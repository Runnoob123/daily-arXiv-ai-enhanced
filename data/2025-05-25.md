### [1] [Defining Atomicity (and Integrity) for Snapshots of Storage in Forensic Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15921)
*Jenny Ottmann,Frank Breitinger,Felix Freiling*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文重新讨论了“法证上可靠”存储获取的质量标准，并提出了一种新的方法来捕获目标系统的瞬时快照意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何更灵活且一致地获取存储数据，同时保持因果关系的完整性。

Method: 提出了一种基于因果关系的灵活获取方法，利用写时复制机制实现。

Result: 新方法比Vomel和Freiling（2012）的原子性定义更强，同时解决了原始完整性定义中的概念问题。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持灵活性的同时，确保了法证数据的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: The acquisition of data from main memory or from hard disk storage is usually
one of the first steps in a forensic investigation. We revisit the discussion
on quality criteria for "forensically sound" acquisition of such storage and
propose a new way to capture the intent to acquire an instantaneous snapshot
from a single target system. The idea of our definition is to allow a certain
flexibility into when individual portions of memory are acquired, but at the
same time require being consistent with causality (i.e., cause/effect
relations). Our concept is much stronger than the original notion of atomicity
defined by Vomel and Freiling (2012) but still attainable using copy-on-write
mechanisms. As a minor result, we also fix a conceptual problem within the
original definition of integrity.

### [2] [Extensible Post Quantum Cryptography Based Authentication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16112)
*Homer A. Riva-Cambrin,Rahul Singh,Sanju Lama,Garnette R. Sutherland*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种量子安全的单次协议，专为机器间认证和授权设计，利用基于格的数字签名算法和密钥封装机制，适用于不安全信道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，现有加密系统将面临安全威胁，需要开发适用于量子时代的密码学解决方案。

Method: 设计了基于格的数字签名算法和密钥封装机制的单次协议，支持在不安全信道中实现前向安全的令牌建立。

Result: 该协议展示了如何将量子安全密码学原语融入现有系统，为量子时代的身份基础设施奠定基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来量子计算环境下的可扩展、弹性和安全的身份基础设施提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Cryptography underpins the security of modern digital infrastructure, from
cloud services to health data. However, many widely deployed systems will
become vulnerable after the advent of scalable quantum computing. Although
quantum-safe cryptographic primitives have been developed, such as
lattice-based digital signature algorithms (DSAs) and key encapsulation
mechanisms (KEMs), their unique structural and performance characteristics make
them unsuitable for existing protocols. In this work, we introduce a
quantum-safe single-shot protocol for machine-to-machine authentication and
authorization that is specifically designed to leverage the strengths of
lattice-based DSAs and KEMs. Operating entirely over insecure channels, this
protocol enables the forward-secure establishment of tokens in constrained
environments. By demonstrating how new quantum-safe cryptographic primitives
can be incorporated into secure systems, this study lays the groundwork for
scalable, resilient, and future-proof identity infrastructures in a
quantum-enabled world.

### [3] [Outsourcing SAT-based Verification Computations in Network Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16137)
*Qi Duan,Ehab Al-Shaer*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出多种随机化SAT问题的方法，以保护数据隐私，防止云计算中的信息泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云计算平台为复杂问题（如SAT问题）提供强大计算能力，但外包SAT实例可能导致数据泄露，威胁系统安全。因此，需要隐藏输入信息。

Method: 提出多种随机化方法，包括SAT实例随机化、变量随机化解集、以及Mincost SAT和MAX3SAT实例的随机化。

Result: 分析与评估表明，这些随机化方法具有正确性和可行性。

Conclusion: 方法的可扩展性和通用性使其适用于现实问题。

Abstract: The emergence of cloud computing gives huge impact on large computations.
Cloud computing platforms offer servers with large computation power to be
available for customers. These servers can be used efficiently to solve
problems that are complex by nature, for example, satisfiability (SAT)
problems. Many practical problems can be converted to SAT, for example, circuit
verification and network configuration analysis. However, outsourcing SAT
instances to the servers may cause data leakage that can jeopardize system's
security. Before
  outsourcing the SAT instance, one needs to hide the input information. One
way to preserve privacy and hide information is to randomize the SAT
  instance before outsourcing. In this paper, we present multiple novel methods
to randomize SAT instances. We present a novel method to randomize the SAT
instance, a variable randomization method to randomize the solution set, and
methods to randomize Mincost SAT and MAX3SAT instances. Our analysis and
evaluation show the correctness and feasibility of these randomization methods.
The scalability and generality of our methods make it applicable for real world
problems.

### [4] [VIVID: A Novel Approach to Remediation Prioritization in Static Application Security Testing (SAST)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16205)
*Naeem Budhwani,Mohammad Faghani,Hayden Richard*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: VIVID是一种通过数据流图分析SAST结果的新方法，利用图论指标识别漏洞传播模式，为开发团队提供优先修复文件列表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAST平台缺乏可视化工具和漏洞数据流关联分析，难以有效指导安全控制嵌入。

Method: 构建漏洞数据流图（VDF），应用图论指标（如中心性、结构指标等）分析漏洞传播模式。

Result: 某些指标（如出度、介数中心性）与高漏洞流量文件相关，可作为修复候选；其他指标（如PageRank）则关联漏洞传播节点。

Conclusion: VIVID为开发团队提供基于漏洞传播模式的优先级修复建议，是一种自动化、证据驱动的安全控制嵌入方法。

Abstract: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) enables organizations to detect
vulnerabilities in code early; however, major SAST platforms do not include
visual aids and present little insight on correlations between tainted data
chains. We propose VIVID - Vulnerability Information Via Data flow - a novel
method to extract and consume SAST insights, which is to graph the
application's vulnerability data flows (VDFs) and carry out graph theory
analysis on the resulting VDF directed graph. Nine metrics were assessed to
evaluate their effectiveness in analyzing the VDF graphs of deliberately
insecure web applications. These metrics include 3 centrality metrics, 2
structural metrics, PageRank, in-degree, out-degree, and cross-clique
connectivity. We present simulations that find that out-degree, betweenness
centrality, in-eigenvector centrality, and cross-clique connectivity were found
to be associated with files exhibiting high vulnerability traffic, making them
refactoring candidates where input sanitization may have been missed.
Meanwhile, out-eigenvector centrality, PageRank, and in-degree were found to be
associated with nodes enabling vulnerability flow and sinks, but not
necessarily where input validation should be placed. This is a novel method to
automatically provide development teams an evidence-based prioritized list of
files to embed security controls into, informed by vulnerability propagation
patterns in the application architecture.

### [5] [A Scalable Hierarchical Intrusion Detection System for Internet of Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16215)
*Md Ashraf Uddin,Nam H. Chu,Reza Rafeh,Mutaz Barika*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种针对车联网（IoV）的分层分类框架，以解决现有集中式入侵检测系统（IDS）在延迟和资源限制方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车联网因其动态性、移动性和无线数据传输特性易受多种网络威胁，现有集中式IDS依赖云计算，导致延迟高，而边缘节点资源有限。

Method: 采用分层分类框架，结合Boruta特征选择方法降低数据维度，边缘节点独立检测特定攻击，云端提供全面分析支持。

Result: 使用CIC-IoV2024数据集验证，模型在保护车联网安全方面表现出可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: 分层分类框架为车联网提供了一种高效、低延迟的入侵检测解决方案。

Abstract: Due to its nature of dynamic, mobility, and wireless data transfer, the
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is prone to various cyber threats, ranging from
spoofing and Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks to malware. To
safeguard the IoV ecosystem from intrusions, malicious activities, policy
violations, intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a critical role by
continuously monitoring and analyzing network traffic to identify and mitigate
potential threats in real-time. However, most existing research has focused on
developing centralized, machine learning-based IDS systems for IoV without
accounting for its inherently distributed nature. Due to intensive computing
requirements, these centralized systems often rely on the cloud to detect cyber
threats, increasing delay of system response. On the other hand, edge nodes
typically lack the necessary resources to train and deploy complex machine
learning algorithms. To address this issue, this paper proposes an effective
hierarchical classification framework tailored for IoV networks. Hierarchical
classification allows classifiers to be trained and tested at different levels,
enabling edge nodes to detect specific types of attacks independently. With
this approach, edge nodes can conduct targeted attack detection while
leveraging cloud nodes for comprehensive threat analysis and support. Given the
resource constraints of edge nodes, we have employed the Boruta feature
selection method to reduce data dimensionality, optimizing processing
efficiency. To evaluate our proposed framework, we utilize the latest IoV
security dataset CIC-IoV2024, achieving promising results that demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of our models in securing IoV networks.

### [6] [Verifying Differentially Private Median Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16246)
*Hyukjun Kwon,Chenglin Fan*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出首个基于zk-SNARKs的可验证差分隐私中位数估计方案，结合指数机制和效用函数，确保隐私并提供验证机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私通过引入噪声保护数据隐私，但恶意行为可能利用噪声进行分析，需一种可验证的方案。

Method: 结合指数机制和效用函数构建算术电路，利用逆累积分布函数方法进行精确采样。

Result: 方案不仅确保隐私，还能验证差分隐私保证，不泄露敏感信息。

Conclusion: 该方案为差分隐私中位数估计提供了可验证的解决方案，兼具隐私保护和验证能力。

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) is a robust privacy guarantee that is widely
employed in private data analysis today, finding broad application in domains
such as statistical query release and machine learning. However, DP achieves
privacy by introducing noise into data or query answers, which malicious actors
could exploit during analysis. To address this concern, we propose the first
verifiable differentially private median estimation scheme based on zk-SNARKs.
Our scheme combines the exponential mechanism and a utility function for median
estimation into an arithmetic circuit, leveraging a scaled version of the
inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) method for precise sampling from
the distribution derived from the utility function. This approach not only
ensures privacy but also provides a mechanism to verify that the algorithm
achieves DP guarantees without revealing sensitive information in the process.

### [7] [Interpretable Anomaly Detection in Encrypted Traffic Using SHAP with Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16261)
*Kalindi Singh,Aayush Kashyap,Aswani Kumar Cherukuri*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种基于可解释机器学习的加密流量异常检测框架，结合多种分类器和SHAP方法，提升模型透明度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密通信协议（如HTTPS和TLS）的普及提高了数据隐私，但也降低了传统异常检测技术的有效性，因为它们依赖未加密的负载检查。

Method: 提出了一种模型无关的框架，集成多种机器学习分类器，并使用SHAP确保事后模型可解释性。模型在三个基准加密流量数据集上训练和评估。

Result: SHAP可视化成功揭示了影响异常预测的关键流量特征，提升了模型的透明度和可信度。

Conclusion: 该框架为加密环境提供了一种新颖的可解释异常检测系统，未来可研究实时部署和对抗条件下的性能。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of encrypted communication protocols such as HTTPS
and TLS has enhanced data privacy but also rendered traditional anomaly
detection techniques less effective, as they often rely on inspecting
unencrypted payloads. This study aims to develop an interpretable machine
learning-based framework for anomaly detection in encrypted network traffic.
This study proposes a model-agnostic framework that integrates multiple machine
learning classifiers, with SHapley Additive exPlanations SHAP to ensure
post-hoc model interpretability. The models are trained and evaluated on three
benchmark encrypted traffic datasets. Performance is assessed using standard
classification metrics, and SHAP is used to explain model predictions by
attributing importance to individual input features. SHAP visualizations
successfully revealed the most influential traffic features contributing to
anomaly predictions, enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of the
models. Unlike conventional approaches that treat machine learning as a black
box, this work combines robust classification techniques with explainability
through SHAP, offering a novel interpretable anomaly detection system tailored
for encrypted traffic environments. While the framework is generalizable,
real-time deployment and performance under adversarial conditions require
further investigation. Future work may explore adaptive models and real-time
interpretability in operational network environments. This interpretable
anomaly detection framework can be integrated into modern security operations
for encrypted environments, allowing analysts not only to detect anomalies with
high precision but also to understand why a model made a particular decision a
crucial capability in compliance-driven and mission-critical settings.

Unfortunately, these platforms are being used for spreading hate speech. In
this paper, we design black-box techniques to protect users from hate-speech on
online platforms by generating perturbations that can fool state of the art
deep learning based hate speech detection models thereby decreasing their

hate-speech. Our best perturbation attack is successfully able to evade
hate-speech detection for 86.8 % of hateful text.

### [9] [Poster: Towards an Automated Security Testing Framework for Industrial UEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16300)
*Sotiris Michaelides,Daniel Eguiguren Chavez,Martin Henze*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种自动化安全测试框架，用于全面评估工业用户设备（UE）在部署前的安全性，确保其符合5G规范和正确实现安全协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着5G在工业系统和关键基础设施中的广泛应用，工业UE（如5G工业机器人）的安全性变得至关重要。目前缺乏全面的安全测试方法，阻碍了对工业UE的全面评估。

Method: 开发了一个自动化安全测试框架，用于验证工业UE的高层安全协议实现是否正确，并确保其协议栈符合3GPP规范。

Result: 该框架旨在为利益相关者提供一种全自动方法，以验证工业UE的安全性和合规性。

Conclusion: 通过自动化测试框架，可以更全面地评估工业UE的安全性，填补现有测试方法的不足。

Abstract: With the ongoing adoption of 5G for communication in industrial systems and
critical infrastructure, the security of industrial UEs such as 5G-enabled
industrial robots becomes an increasingly important topic. Most notably, to
meet the stringent security requirements of industrial deployments, industrial
UEs not only have to fully comply with the 5G specifications but also implement
and use correctly secure communication protocols such as TLS. To ensure the
security of industrial UEs, operators of industrial 5G networks rely on
security testing before deploying new devices to their production networks.
However, currently only isolated tests for individual security aspects of
industrial UEs exist, severely hindering comprehensive testing. In this paper,
we report on our ongoing efforts to alleviate this situation by creating an
automated security testing framework for industrial UEs to comprehensively
evaluate their security posture before deployment. With this framework, we aim
to provide stakeholders with a fully automated-method to verify that
higher-layer security protocols are correctly implemented, while simultaneously
ensuring that the UE's protocol stack adheres to 3GPP specifications.

### [10] [ReCopilot: Reverse Engineering Copilot in Binary Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16366)
*Guoqiang Chen,Huiqi Sun,Daguang Liu,Zhiqi Wang,Qiang Wang,Bin Yin,Lu Liu,Lingyun Ying*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: ReCopilot是一个专为二进制分析任务设计的专家级LLM，通过多阶段训练和上下文增强技术，在功能名称恢复和变量类型推断等任务中表现优异，性能提升13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二进制分析在安全领域至关重要，但依赖专家知识且耗时。现有LLM在源代码分析表现良好，但二进制专用LLM研究不足。

Method: ReCopilot通过CPT、SFT和DPO阶段训练，结合数据流和调用图增强上下文感知，并采用测试时扩展提升推理能力。

Result: 在二进制分析基准测试中，ReCopilot在功能名称恢复和变量类型推断任务中表现最优，性能提升13%。

Conclusion: ReCopilot展示了领域专用训练和上下文增强的有效性，为自动化二进制分析提供了可解释且可扩展的AI支持。

Abstract: Binary analysis plays a pivotal role in security domains such as malware
detection and vulnerability discovery, yet it remains labor-intensive and
heavily reliant on expert knowledge. General-purpose large language models
(LLMs) perform well in programming analysis on source code, while
binaryspecific LLMs are underexplored. In this work, we present ReCopilot, an
expert LLM designed for binary analysis tasks. ReCopilot integrates binary code
knowledge through a meticulously constructed dataset, encompassing continue
pretraining (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and direct preference
optimization (DPO) stages. It leverages variable data flow and call graph to
enhance context awareness and employs test-time scaling to improve reasoning
capabilities. Evaluations on a comprehensive binary analysis benchmark
demonstrate that ReCopilot achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks such
as function name recovery and variable type inference on the decompiled pseudo
code, outperforming both existing tools and LLMs by 13%. Our findings highlight
the effectiveness of domain-specific training and context enhancement, while
also revealing challenges in building super long chain-of-thought. ReCopilot
represents a significant step toward automating binary analysis with
interpretable and scalable AI assistance in this domain.

### [11] [Privacy-Aware Cyberterrorism Network Analysis using Graph Neural Networks and Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16371)
*Anas Ali,Mubashar Husain,Peter Hans*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种隐私感知的联邦图神经网络（PA-FGNN）框架，用于分析加密和去中心化平台上的网络恐怖主义活动，同时保护分布式情报数据的隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络恐怖主义对数字基础设施构成严重威胁，而加密和去中心化平台使得威胁行为者的活动难以追踪。因此，需要一种既能分析敌对网络又能保护数据隐私的方法。

Method: PA-FGNN结合了图注意力网络、差分隐私和同态加密技术，采用联邦学习框架。客户端在本地训练敏感图数据，并通过加密和噪声扰动的模型更新与中央聚合器交换信息。

Result: 实验表明，PA-FGNN在模拟的暗网和网络情报图上实现了超过91%的分类准确率，能抵御20%的敌对客户端行为，且通信开销低于18%。

Conclusion: 隐私保护的图神经网络可以在不牺牲实用性、隐私或鲁棒性的情况下支持大规模网络威胁检测。

Abstract: Cyberterrorism poses a formidable threat to digital infrastructures, with
increasing reliance on encrypted, decentralized platforms that obscure threat
actor activity. To address the challenge of analyzing such adversarial networks
while preserving the privacy of distributed intelligence data, we propose a
Privacy-Aware Federated Graph Neural Network (PA-FGNN) framework. PA-FGNN
integrates graph attention networks, differential privacy, and homomorphic
encryption into a robust federated learning pipeline tailored for
cyberterrorism network analysis. Each client trains locally on sensitive graph
data and exchanges encrypted, noise-perturbed model updates with a central
aggregator, which performs secure aggregation and broadcasts global updates. We
implement anomaly detection for flagging high-risk nodes and incorporate
defenses against gradient poisoning. Experimental evaluations on simulated dark
web and cyber-intelligence graphs demonstrate that PA-FGNN achieves over 91\%
classification accuracy, maintains resilience under 20\% adversarial client
behavior, and incurs less than 18\% communication overhead. Our results
highlight that privacy-preserving GNNs can support large-scale cyber threat
detection without compromising on utility, privacy, or robustness.

### [12] [Consistent and Compatible Modelling of Cyber Intrusions and Incident Response Demonstrated in the Context of Malware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16398)
*Peter Maynard,Yulia Cherdantseva,Avi Shaked,Pete Burnap,Arif Mehmood*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种将入侵模型与事件响应（IR）手册更好集成的方法，通过安全建模框架改进入侵模型，并展示其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前IR手册和入侵模型是孤立创建的，缺乏集成，导致风险评估和事件响应之间的耦合不足。

Method: 使用安全建模框架将九个国家关键基础设施的入侵模型（基于顺序AND攻击树）转换为与IR手册兼容的模型。

Result: 改进的入侵模型和更紧密的耦合为攻击分析和响应行动提供了新见解。

Conclusion: 论文贡献包括新的攻击树表示方法、转换工具及九种入侵模型的示例。

Abstract: Cyber Security Incident Response (IR) Playbooks are used to capture the steps
required to recover from a cyber intrusion. Individual IR playbooks should
focus on a specific type of incident and be aligned with the architecture of a
system under attack. Intrusion modelling focuses on a specific potential cyber
intrusion and is used to identify where and what countermeasures are needed,
and the resulting intrusion models are expected to be used in effective IR,
ideally by feeding IR Playbooks designs. IR playbooks and intrusion models,
however, are created in isolation and at varying stages of the system's
lifecycle. We take nine critical national infrastructure intrusion models -
expressed using Sequential AND Attack Trees - and transform them into models of
the same format as IR playbooks. We use Security Modelling Framework for
modelling attacks and playbooks, and for demonstrating the feasibility of the
better integration between risk assessment and IR at the modelling level. This
results in improved intrusion models and tighter coupling between IR playbooks
and threat modelling which - as we demonstrate - yields novel insights into the
analysis of attacks and response actions. The main contributions of this paper
are (a) a novel way of representing attack trees using the Security Modelling
Framework,(b) a new tool for converting Sequential AND attack trees into models
compatible with playbooks, and (c) the examples of nine intrusion models
represented using the Security Modelling Framework.

TLDR: 论文研究了密码安全，分析了公共密码数据库，提取密码特征，并比较了六种机器学习算法的性能，发现决策树和堆叠模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络安全问题日益突出，密码安全对保护个人信息和网络系统至关重要。

Method: 分析了公共密码数据库，提取密码特征（如长度、数字、大小写字母、特殊字符等），并比较了六种机器学习算法的性能。

Result: 决策树和堆叠模型在准确率、召回率和F1分数上表现最优。

Conclusion: 决策树和堆叠模型适用于强弱密码分类任务。

Abstract: As network security issues continue gaining prominence, password security has
become crucial in safeguarding personal information and network systems. This
study first introduces various methods for system password cracking, outlines
password defense strategies, and discusses the application of machine learning
in the realm of password security. Subsequently, we conduct a detailed public
password database analysis, uncovering standard features and patterns among
passwords. We extract multiple characteristics of passwords, including length,
the number of digits, the number of uppercase and lowercase letters, and the
number of special characters. We then experiment with six different machine
learning algorithms: support vector machines, logistic regression, neural
networks, decision trees, random forests, and stacked models, evaluating each
model's performance based on various metrics, including accuracy, recall, and
F1 score through model validation and hyperparameter tuning. The evaluation
results on the test set indicate that decision trees and stacked models excel
in accuracy, recall, and F1 score, making them a practical option for the
strong and weak password classification task.

*Damas P. Gruska*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种代数方法，通过引入监督器来控制不安全进程的行为，使其满足语言安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在监督者和攻击者均无法完全掌握系统行为的情况下，如何通过控制或插入定时动作来确保进程的安全性。

Method: 采用代数方法定义语言安全性，并设计监督器来禁用不安全行为或插入定时动作。

Result: 研究了监督器存在的条件及其特性和局限性。

Conclusion: 监督器可以在不完全信息条件下有效提升进程的安全性，但其能力和范围存在一定限制。

Abstract: Algebraic methods are employed in order to define language-based security
properties of processes. A supervisor is introduced that can disable unwanted
behavior of an insecure process by controlling some of its actions or by
inserting timed actions to make an insecure process secure. We assume a
situation where neither the supervisor nor the attacker has complete
information about the ongoing systems behavior. We study the conditions under
which such a supervisor exists, as well as its properties and limitations.

### [15] [DuFFin: A Dual-Level Fingerprinting Framework for LLMs IP Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16530)
*Yuliang Yan,Haochun Tang,Shuo Yan,Enyan Dai*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: DuFFin是一种新型的双级指纹框架，用于黑盒设置下的所有权验证，能准确识别受保护大语言模型的变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护大语言模型的知识产权，防止恶意窃取或未经授权的部署。

Method: 提取触发模式和知识级指纹，以识别可疑模型的来源。

Result: 实验显示，该方法能准确验证基础模型的版权，IP-ROC指标超过0.95。

Conclusion: DuFFin是一种实用且高效的黑盒所有权验证方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are considered valuable Intellectual Properties
(IP) for legitimate owners due to the enormous computational cost of training.
It is crucial to protect the IP of LLMs from malicious stealing or unauthorized
deployment. Despite existing efforts in watermarking and fingerprinting LLMs,
these methods either impact the text generation process or are limited in
white-box access to the suspect model, making them impractical. Hence, we
propose DuFFin, a novel $\textbf{Du}$al-Level $\textbf{Fin}$gerprinting
$\textbf{F}$ramework for black-box setting ownership verification. DuFFin
extracts the trigger pattern and the knowledge-level fingerprints to identify
the source of a suspect model. We conduct experiments on a variety of models
collected from the open-source website, including four popular base models as
protected LLMs and their fine-tuning, quantization, and safety alignment
versions, which are released by large companies, start-ups, and individual
users. Results show that our method can accurately verify the copyright of the
base protected LLM on their model variants, achieving the IP-ROC metric greater
than 0.95. Our code is available at

*Biao Yi,Tiansheng Huang,Baolei Zhang,Tong Li,Lihai Nie,Zheli Liu,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Collapse Trap（CTRAP）的新防御机制，通过诱导模型崩溃而非选择性遗忘，有效防止恶意微调攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性遗忘方法无法阻止LLMs快速重新学习恶意任务，需解决这一根本缺陷。

Method: 提出CTRAP机制，在模型对齐时预配置崩溃触发条件，针对恶意更新逐步削弱模型能力。

Result: CTRAP在多种LLMs和攻击场景中有效防御恶意微调，同时保持良性场景下的高性能。

Conclusion: CTRAP通过模型崩溃机制解决了选择性遗忘的局限性，为LLM安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-tuning-as-a-service, while commercially successful for Large Language
Model (LLM) providers, exposes models to harmful fine-tuning attacks. As a
widely explored defense paradigm against such attacks, unlearning attempts to
remove malicious knowledge from LLMs, thereby essentially preventing them from
being used to perform malicious tasks. However, we highlight a critical flaw:
the powerful general adaptability of LLMs allows them to easily bypass
selective unlearning by rapidly relearning or repurposing their capabilities
for harmful tasks. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a
paradigm shift: instead of selective removal, we advocate for inducing model
collapse--effectively forcing the model to "unlearn everything"--specifically
in response to updates characteristic of malicious adaptation. This collapse
directly neutralizes the very general capabilities that attackers exploit,
tackling the core issue unaddressed by selective unlearning. We introduce the
Collapse Trap (CTRAP) as a practical mechanism to implement this concept
conditionally. Embedded during alignment, CTRAP pre-configures the model's
reaction to subsequent fine-tuning dynamics. If updates during fine-tuning
constitute a persistent attempt to reverse safety alignment, the pre-configured
trap triggers a progressive degradation of the model's core language modeling
abilities, ultimately rendering it inert and useless for the attacker.
Crucially, this collapse mechanism remains dormant during benign fine-tuning,
ensuring the model's utility and general capabilities are preserved for
legitimate users. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that CTRAP
effectively counters harmful fine-tuning risks across various LLMs and attack
settings, while maintaining high performance in benign scenarios. Our code is

Abstract: The emergence of quantum computing and Shor's algorithm necessitates an
imminent shift from current public key cryptography techniques to post-quantum
robust techniques. NIST has responded by standardising Post-Quantum
Cryptography (PQC) algorithms, with ML-KEM (FIPS-203) slated to replace ECDH
(Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) for key exchange. A key practical concern for
PQC adoption is energy consumption. This paper introduces a new framework for
measuring the PQC energy consumption on a Raspberry Pi when performing key
generation. The framework uses both available traditional methods and the newly
standardised ML-KEM algorithm via the commonly utilised OpenSSL library.

*Xueyang Zhou,Guiyao Tie,Guowen Zhang,Hechang Wang,Pan Zhou,Lichao Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: BadVLA是一种针对Vision-Language-Action（VLA）模型的后门攻击方法，通过目标解耦优化首次揭示了VLA模型的后门漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在机器人控制中表现出色，但其紧密耦合的架构带来了新的安全漏洞，尤其是后门攻击的威胁尚未被充分研究。

Method: BadVLA采用两阶段方法：显式特征空间分离和条件控制偏差，以隔离触发器并保持清洁任务性能。

Result: 实验表明，BadVLA在多个VLA基准测试中攻击成功率接近100%，且对清洁任务准确性影响极小。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统性地揭示了VLA模型的后门漏洞，强调了安全设计的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic control by enabling
end-to-end decision-making directly from multimodal inputs. However, their
tightly coupled architectures expose novel security vulnerabilities. Unlike
traditional adversarial perturbations, backdoor attacks represent a stealthier,
persistent, and practically significant threat-particularly under the emerging
Training-as-a-Service paradigm-but remain largely unexplored in the context of
VLA models. To address this gap, we propose BadVLA, a backdoor attack method
based on Objective-Decoupled Optimization, which for the first time exposes the
backdoor vulnerabilities of VLA models. Specifically, it consists of a
two-stage process: (1) explicit feature-space separation to isolate trigger
representations from benign inputs, and (2) conditional control deviations that
activate only in the presence of the trigger, while preserving clean-task
performance. Empirical results on multiple VLA benchmarks demonstrate that
BadVLA consistently achieves near-100% attack success rates with minimal impact
on clean task accuracy. Further analyses confirm its robustness against common
input perturbations, task transfers, and model fine-tuning, underscoring
critical security vulnerabilities in current VLA deployments. Our work offers
the first systematic investigation of backdoor vulnerabilities in VLA models,
highlighting an urgent need for secure and trustworthy embodied model design
practices. We have released the project page at

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新型的推理成本攻击方法（BitHydra），通过翻转模型参数的关键位来迫使LLM生成最长输出，攻击效率高且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理成本攻击方法效果有限，因为它们仅通过输入攻击，攻击者需承担成本。本文旨在设计一种直接针对模型参数的攻击方法。

Method: 设计了BitHydra方法，通过抑制<EOS>标记概率的损失函数和高效的关键位搜索算法，翻转模型参数的关键位。

Result: 在11个LLM上测试，仅需4个搜索样本和3次位翻转即可使100%的测试提示达到最大生成长度。

Conclusion: BitHydra展示了高效、可扩展和强迁移性的推理成本攻击能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a wide
range of applications, but their ever-increasing size and resource demands make
them vulnerable to inference cost attacks, where attackers induce victim LLMs
to generate the longest possible output content. In this paper, we revisit
existing inference cost attacks and reveal that these methods can hardly
produce large-scale malicious effects since they are self-targeting, where
attackers are also the users and therefore have to execute attacks solely
through the inputs, whose generated content will be charged by LLMs and can
only directly influence themselves. Motivated by these findings, this paper
introduces a new type of inference cost attacks (dubbed 'bit-flip inference
cost attack') that target the victim model itself rather than its inputs.
Specifically, we design a simple yet effective method (dubbed 'BitHydra') to
effectively flip critical bits of model parameters. This process is guided by a
loss function designed to suppress <EOS> token's probability with an efficient
critical bit search algorithm, thus explicitly defining the attack objective
and enabling effective optimization. We evaluate our method on 11 LLMs ranging
from 1.5B to 14B parameters under both int8 and float16 settings. Experimental
results demonstrate that with just 4 search samples and as few as 3 bit flips,
BitHydra can force 100% of test prompts to reach the maximum generation length
(e.g., 2048 tokens) on representative LLMs such as LLaMA3, highlighting its
efficiency, scalability, and strong transferability across unseen inputs.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种针对开源语言模型的领域特定水印技术，用于解决模型溯源问题，确保检测可靠性并保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源语言模型能力的提升和广泛使用，模型溯源问题日益重要，现有水印技术无法满足实际所有权检测需求。

Method: 通过训练模型在特定子领域（如特定语言或主题）嵌入水印，而非所有生成内容，实现目标检测。

Result: 领域特定水印技术具有强统计保证、可控误报率、高检测能力，且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种实际部署场景下表现出隐密性和鲁棒性，有效解决了模型溯源问题。

Abstract: As open-source language models (OSMs) grow more capable and are widely shared
and finetuned, ensuring model provenance, i.e., identifying the origin of a
given model instance, has become an increasingly important issue. At the same
time, existing backdoor-based model fingerprinting techniques often fall short
of achieving key requirements of real-world model ownership detection. In this
work, we build on the observation that while current open-source model
watermarks fail to achieve reliable content traceability, they can be
effectively adapted to address the challenge of model provenance. To this end,
we introduce the concept of domain-specific watermarking for model
fingerprinting. Rather than watermarking all generated content, we train the
model to embed watermarks only within specified subdomains (e.g., particular
languages or topics). This targeted approach ensures detection reliability,
while improving watermark durability and quality under a range of real-world
deployment settings. Our evaluations show that domain-specific watermarking
enables model fingerprinting with strong statistical guarantees, controllable
false positive rates, high detection power, and preserved generation quality.
Moreover, we find that our fingerprints are inherently stealthy and naturally
robust to real-world variability across deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为StegoAttack的全隐蔽越狱攻击方法，利用隐写术隐藏有害查询，成功绕过LLMs的安全机制，攻击成功率达92%，且隐蔽性极佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究越狱攻击对LLMs的威胁，发现现有攻击难以同时实现毒性隐蔽和语言自然性，因此提出一种更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 使用隐写术将有害查询隐藏在语义连贯的良性文本中，并让LLM提取隐藏查询并以加密方式响应。

Result: 在四种主流LLMs上测试，攻击成功率达92%，隐蔽性表现最优，且对外部检测的抵抗力强。

Conclusion: StegoAttack在攻击成功率和隐蔽性上均显著优于现有方法，为LLMs的安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to large language models (LLMs) by
bypassing built-in safety mechanisms and leading to harmful outputs. Studying
these attacks is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and improving model
security. This paper presents a systematic survey of jailbreak methods from the
novel perspective of stealth. We find that existing attacks struggle to
simultaneously achieve toxic stealth (concealing toxic content) and linguistic
stealth (maintaining linguistic naturalness). Motivated by this, we propose
StegoAttack, a fully stealthy jailbreak attack that uses steganography to hide
the harmful query within benign, semantically coherent text. The attack then
prompts the LLM to extract the hidden query and respond in an encrypted manner.
This approach effectively hides malicious intent while preserving naturalness,
allowing it to evade both built-in and external safety mechanisms. We evaluate
StegoAttack on four safety-aligned LLMs from major providers, benchmarking
against eight state-of-the-art methods. StegoAttack achieves an average attack
success rate (ASR) of 92.00%, outperforming the strongest baseline by 11.0%.
Its ASR drops by less than 1% even under external detection (e.g., Llama
Guard). Moreover, it attains the optimal comprehensive scores on stealth
detection metrics, demonstrating both high efficacy and exceptional stealth
capabilities. The code is available at

TLDR: 提出了一种名为CoTSRF的新方法，利用Chain of Thought（CoT）作为LLM的指纹，通过对比学习提取特征并进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大型语言模型（LLM）易被滥用，现有指纹识别方法在隐蔽性和鲁棒性上不足。

Method: CoTSRF通过设计CoT查询收集LLM响应，训练CoT提取器提取指纹特征，并使用KL散度进行验证。

Result: 实验证明CoTSRF在隐蔽性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoTSRF为LLM指纹识别提供了高效且隐蔽的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite providing superior performance, open-source large language models
(LLMs) are vulnerable to abusive usage. To address this issue, recent works
propose LLM fingerprinting methods to identify the specific source LLMs behind
suspect applications. However, these methods fail to provide stealthy and
robust fingerprint verification. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM
fingerprinting scheme, namely CoTSRF, which utilizes the Chain of Thought (CoT)
as the fingerprint of an LLM. CoTSRF first collects the responses from the
source LLM by querying it with crafted CoT queries. Then, it applies
contrastive learning to train a CoT extractor that extracts the CoT feature
(i.e., fingerprint) from the responses. Finally, CoTSRF conducts fingerprint
verification by comparing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the CoT
features of the source and suspect LLMs against an empirical threshold. Various
experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the advantage of our proposed
CoTSRF for fingerprinting LLMs, particularly in stealthy and robust fingerprint
verification.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新型安全威胁：通过操纵大语言模型（LLM）的系统提示，使其在特定目标问题上生成恶意回答，而在其他问题上表现正常。作者开发了CAIN算法，用于在黑盒设置下自动生成此类有害提示，并在实验中验证了其攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）易受对抗攻击，但现有研究未充分探讨通过系统提示操纵对话的攻击方式。这种攻击可能导致大规模信息操纵，威胁LLM在实际应用中的安全性和完整性。

Method: 作者提出CAIN算法，能够在黑盒设置下自动生成针对特定问题的有害系统提示，无需访问LLM参数。实验在开源和商业LLM上进行，评估了攻击效果。

Result: CAIN在非目标攻击中使目标问题的F1分数下降40%，同时保持对良性输入的高准确率；在目标攻击中，对特定有害回答的F1分数超过70%，且对良性问题影响极小。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在系统提示操纵下的安全漏洞，强调了增强鲁棒性措施的必要性，以保障LLM在实际应用中的安全性和完整性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many applications, but are also
known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce a
novel security threat: hijacking AI-human conversations by manipulating LLMs'
system prompts to produce malicious answers only to specific targeted questions
(e.g., "Who should I vote for US President?", "Are Covid vaccines safe?"),
while behaving benignly on others. This attack is detrimental as it can enable
malicious actors to exercise large-scale information manipulation by spreading
harmful but benign-looking system prompts online. To demonstrate such an
attack, we develop CAIN, an algorithm that can automatically curate such
harmful system prompts for a specific target question in a black-box setting or
without the need to access the LLM's parameters. Evaluated on both open-source
and commercial LLMs, CAIN demonstrates significant adversarial impact. In
untargeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output incorrect answers, CAIN achieves
up to 40% F1 degradation on targeted questions while preserving high accuracy
on benign inputs. For targeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output specific
harmful answers, CAIN achieves over 70% F1 scores on these targeted responses
with minimal impact on benign questions. Our results highlight the critical
need for enhanced robustness measures to safeguard the integrity and safety of
LLMs in real-world applications. All source code will be publicly available.

TLDR: BYE框架通过注意力熵模式检测并过滤后门样本，无需干净数据或模型修改，有效防御MLLMs中的后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在微调即服务（FTaaS）中存在后门攻击风险，恶意微调可植入后门。

Method: 提出BYE框架，通过三阶段流程（提取注意力图、计算熵分数、无监督聚类）识别后门样本。

Result: BYE在多种数据集和触发类型下表现优异，攻击成功率接近零且不影响正常任务性能。

Conclusion: BYE为MLLMs中的后门威胁提供了鲁棒且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in
fine-tuning-as-a-service (FTaaS) settings, where user-submitted datasets adapt
general-purpose models to downstream tasks. This flexibility, however,
introduces serious security risks, as malicious fine-tuning can implant
backdoors into MLLMs with minimal effort. In this paper, we observe that
backdoor triggers systematically disrupt cross-modal processing by causing
abnormal attention concentration on non-semantic regions--a phenomenon we term
attention collapse. Based on this insight, we propose Believe Your Eyes (BYE),
a data filtering framework that leverages attention entropy patterns as
self-supervised signals to identify and filter backdoor samples. BYE operates
via a three-stage pipeline: (1) extracting attention maps using the fine-tuned
model, (2) computing entropy scores and profiling sensitive layers via bimodal
separation, and (3) performing unsupervised clustering to remove suspicious
samples. Unlike prior defenses, BYE equires no clean supervision, auxiliary
labels, or model modifications. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and diverse trigger types validate BYE's effectiveness: it achieves
near-zero attack success rates while maintaining clean-task performance,
offering a robust and generalizable solution against backdoor threats in MLLMs.

Motivation: 随着LLMs扩展功能（如实时网络搜索和MCP协议集成），新的安全漏洞可能被引入，需要系统研究其潜在风险。

Method: 通过恶意字体注入外部资源（如网页），操纵代码到字形映射以注入用户不可见的欺骗内容，并评估两种攻击场景：恶意内容传递和敏感数据泄漏。

Result: 实验表明，间接提示结合恶意字体可绕过LLM安全机制，成功率因数据敏感性和提示设计而异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LLM处理外部内容时加强安全措施的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly equipped with capabilities of
real-time web search and integrated with protocols like Model Context Protocol
(MCP). This extension could introduce new security vulnerabilities. We present
a systematic investigation of LLM vulnerabilities to hidden adversarial prompts
through malicious font injection in external resources like webpages, where
attackers manipulate code-to-glyph mapping to inject deceptive content which
are invisible to users. We evaluate two critical attack scenarios: (1)
"malicious content relay" and (2) "sensitive data leakage" through MCP-enabled
tools. Our experiments reveal that indirect prompts with injected malicious
font can bypass LLM safety mechanisms through external resources, achieving
varying success rates based on data sensitivity and prompt design. Our research
underscores the urgent need for enhanced security measures in LLM deployments
when processing external content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Tokenized Graph Learning Models（TGLMs）依赖手工设计的令牌列表，无法适应多样化的图学习场景，且存在跳数优先级问题，影响了模型对局部和全局信号的平衡能力。

Method: 提出了Learnable Graph Token List（LGTL），通过图注意力门模块和选择模块自适应调整跳数权重并优先选择信息丰富的节点。

Result: 实验验证了LGTL在Graph Transformers和Graph LLM骨干网络中的有效性，解决了跳数优先级问题。

Conclusion: LGTL是一种即插即用的模块，能够自适应地强调上下文信息丰富的节点，适用于同质和异质图。

Abstract: Graph Transformers, leveraging the global attention to capture long-range
dependencies in graph structures, have significantly advanced graph machine
learning, but face prohibitive computational complexity. Tokenized Graph
Learning Models (TGLMs) address this issue by converting graphs into ordered
token lists for scalable processing. Besides, TGLMs also empower Large Language
Models (LLMs) to handle text-attributed graphs more effectively and thus are
also employed in Graph LLMs. However, existing TGLMs rely on hand-designed
token lists and their adaptability to diverse graph learning scenarios remains
unexplored. In this paper, we first conduct extensive empirical and theoretical
preliminary studies for hand-designed token lists. Surprisingly, we identify an
unexplored hop-overpriority problem: the common pre-defined token lists
overemphasize nearby nodes and overwhelm the ability of TGLMs to balance local
and global signals. This phenomenon is especially harmful for heterophilic
graphs. To address this problem, we propose the Learnable Graph Token List
(LGTL), a plug-and-play module to replace hand-designed token lists in TGLMs.
Specifically, LGTL adaptively adjusts the weights across hops and prioritizes
informative nodes within hops through a graph attention gate module and a
selection module, respectively. In this way, contextually informative nodes can
be adaptively emphasized for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Besides,
we theoretically show that LGTL can address the hop-overpriority problem.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the efficacy of LGTL across both
Graph Transformers and Graph LLM backbones.

Result: LLEB在性能上与现有方法相当，表明经验贝叶斯是未来不确定性量化研究的有前景方向。

Conclusion: LLEB为不确定性量化提供了一种新方法，展示了经验贝叶斯的潜力。

Abstract: The task of quantifying the inherent uncertainty associated with neural
network predictions is a key challenge in artificial intelligence. Bayesian
neural networks (BNNs) and deep ensembles are among the most prominent
approaches to tackle this task. Both approaches produce predictions by
computing an expectation of neural network outputs over some distribution on
the corresponding weights; this distribution is given by the posterior in the
case of BNNs, and by a mixture of point masses for ensembles. Inspired by
recent work showing that the distribution used by ensembles can be understood
as a posterior corresponding to a learned data-dependent prior, we propose last
layer empirical Bayes (LLEB). LLEB instantiates a learnable prior as a
normalizing flow, which is then trained to maximize the evidence lower bound;
to retain tractability we use the flow only on the last layer. We show why LLEB
is well motivated, and how it interpolates between standard BNNs and ensembles
in terms of the strength of the prior that they use. LLEB performs on par with
existing approaches, highlighting that empirical Bayes is a promising direction
for future research in uncertainty quantification.

Result: RTN的吞吐量优于先进方法，准确性相似。

Conclusion: RTN是量化大型语言模型的实用选择。

Abstract: Quantization became a necessary tool for serving ever-increasing Large
Language Models (LLMs). RTN (Round-to-Nearest) is perhaps the simplest
quantization technique that has been around well before LLMs surged to the
forefront of machine learning (ML) research. Yet, it has been largely dismissed
by recent and more advanced quantization methods that claim superiority over
RTN in nearly every aspect of performance. This work aims to dispel this
established point of view, showing that RTN is not only much cheaper to apply,
but also its token generation throughput can be better than and accuracy can be
similar to more advanced alternatives. In particular, we discuss our
implementation of RTN based on the recent Marlin kernels and demonstrate how
the accuracy of RTN can be gradually improved by selectively increasing the
data precision format of certain model layers and modules. Based on our
results, we argue that RTN presents a viable and practical choice for
quantizing LLMs.

Conclusion: AllMetrics为机器学习任务提供了一种标准化、可靠的性能评估解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models rely heavily on consistent and accurate
performance metrics to evaluate and compare their effectiveness. However,
existing libraries often suffer from fragmentation, inconsistent
implementations, and insufficient data validation protocols, leading to
unreliable results. Existing libraries have often been developed independently
and without adherence to a unified standard, particularly concerning the
specific tasks they aim to support. As a result, each library tends to adopt
its conventions for metric computation, input/output formatting, error
handling, and data validation protocols. This lack of standardization leads to
both implementation differences (ID) and reporting differences (RD), making it
difficult to compare results across frameworks or ensure reliable evaluations.
To address these issues, we introduce AllMetrics, an open-source unified Python
library designed to standardize metric evaluation across diverse ML tasks,
including regression, classification, clustering, segmentation, and
image-to-image translation. The library implements class-specific reporting for
multi-class tasks through configurable parameters to cover all use cases, while
incorporating task-specific parameters to resolve metric computation
discrepancies across implementations. Various datasets from domains like
healthcare, finance, and real estate were applied to our library and compared
with Python, Matlab, and R components to identify which yield similar results.
AllMetrics combines a modular Application Programming Interface (API) with
robust input validation mechanisms to ensure reproducibility and reliability in
model evaluation. This paper presents the design principles, architectural
components, and empirical analyses demonstrating the ability to mitigate
evaluation errors and to enhance the trustworthiness of ML workflows.

Conclusion: MoRE-Brain在fMRI视觉解码的通用性和可解释性方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from fMRI offers a powerful avenue to understand
human perception and develop advanced brain-computer interfaces. However,
current progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while
overlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific
insight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework
designed for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction.
MoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture
where distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel
groups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to
encode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then
synthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing
mechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion
process. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a
novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for
neuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by
sharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers.
Third, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing
reveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and
spatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate
MoRE-Brain's high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further
demonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine
neural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently,
MoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and
interpretable fMRI-based visual decoding. Code will be publicly available soon:

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出稀疏自编码器（SAE）的概念表示在输入扰动下脆弱，需考虑鲁棒性作为评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAE评估忽略概念表示对输入扰动的鲁棒性，而鲁棒性是概念标签真实性的关键。

Method: 通过输入空间优化问题量化鲁棒性，并开发评估框架，模拟对抗扰动操纵SAE表示的场景。

Result: 实验表明，微小对抗扰动可有效操纵SAE概念表示，而不显著影响基础LLM输出。

Conclusion: SAE概念表示脆弱，可能不适合模型监控和监督应用。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are commonly used to interpret the internal
activations of large language models (LLMs) by mapping them to
human-interpretable concept representations. While existing evaluations of SAEs
focus on metrics such as the reconstruction-sparsity tradeoff, human
(auto-)interpretability, and feature disentanglement, they overlook a critical
aspect: the robustness of concept representations to input perturbations. We
argue that robustness must be a fundamental consideration for concept
representations, reflecting the fidelity of concept labeling. To this end, we
formulate robustness quantification as input-space optimization problems and
develop a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring realistic scenarios in
which adversarial perturbations are crafted to manipulate SAE representations.
Empirically, we find that tiny adversarial input perturbations can effectively
manipulate concept-based interpretations in most scenarios without notably
affecting the outputs of the base LLMs themselves. Overall, our results suggest
that SAE concept representations are fragile and may be ill-suited for
applications in model monitoring and oversight.

Result: 在标准图像分类基准上表现优异，理论分析支持其有效性。

Conclusion: GradPCA性能强，理论框架为设计更优OOD检测器提供指导。

Abstract: We introduce GradPCA, an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection method that
exploits the low-rank structure of neural network gradients induced by Neural
Tangent Kernel (NTK) alignment. GradPCA applies Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) to gradient class-means, achieving more consistent performance than
existing methods across standard image classification benchmarks. We provide a
theoretical perspective on spectral OOD detection in neural networks to support
GradPCA, highlighting feature-space properties that enable effective detection
and naturally emerge from NTK alignment. Our analysis further reveals that
feature quality -- particularly the use of pretrained versus non-pretrained
representations -- plays a crucial role in determining which detectors will
succeed. Extensive experiments validate the strong performance of GradPCA, and
our theoretical framework offers guidance for designing more principled
spectral OOD detectors.

Conclusion: 研究提升了扩散轨迹蒸馏的理论理解，并为实际应用提供了优化策略的指导。

Abstract: Diffusion trajectory distillation methods aim to accelerate sampling in
diffusion models, which produce high-quality outputs but suffer from slow
sampling speeds. These methods train a student model to approximate the
multi-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model in a single step,
enabling one-shot generation. However, theoretical insights into the trade-off
between different distillation strategies and generative quality remain
limited, complicating their optimization and selection. In this work, we take a
first step toward addressing this gap. Specifically, we reinterpret trajectory
distillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each
step of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy
data. These operators admit a clear geometric interpretation as projections and
rescalings corresponding to the noise schedule. During merging, signal
shrinkage occurs as a convex combination of operators, arising from both
discretization and limited optimization time of the student model. We propose a
dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal merging strategy that
maximally preserves signal fidelity. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence
of a sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy, governed by data
covariance structures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of
diffusion trajectory distillation and offer practical insights for improving
distillation strategies.

Result: 在2D和3D地震数据建模中表现优异，优于现有神经算子方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在多样流形上高效、可控地建模Eikonal解，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Equivariant Neural Eikonal Solvers, a novel framework that
integrates Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs) with Neural Eikonal Solvers. Our
approach employs a single neural field where a unified shared backbone is
conditioned on signal-specific latent variables - represented as point clouds
in a Lie group - to model diverse Eikonal solutions. The ENF integration
ensures equivariant mapping from these latent representations to the solution
field, delivering three key benefits: enhanced representation efficiency
through weight-sharing, robust geometric grounding, and solution steerability.
This steerability allows transformations applied to the latent point cloud to
induce predictable, geometrically meaningful modifications in the resulting
Eikonal solution. By coupling these steerable representations with
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), our framework accurately models
Eikonal travel-time solutions while generalizing to arbitrary Riemannian
manifolds with regular group actions. This includes homogeneous spaces such as
Euclidean, position-orientation, spherical, and hyperbolic manifolds. We
validate our approach through applications in seismic travel-time modeling of
2D and 3D benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior
performance, scalability, adaptability, and user controllability compared to
existing Neural Operator-based Eikonal solver methods.

<details>

Motivation: 传统的SAT求解器性能依赖于手工设计的启发式方法，限制了其效率和泛化能力。

Method: 通过GNN在单次前向传递中为变量分配权重和极性，并将其作为强化学习问题，使用策略梯度方法（如GRPO）训练。

Result: RLAF训练的策略显著减少了不同SAT求解器的平均求解时间，某些情况下提速超过2倍，并能泛化到更大更难的问。

Conclusion: RLAF为组合优化中的数据驱动启发式设计提供了新方向，优于基于手工权重启发式的监督学习方法。

Abstract: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers are foundational to computer science,
yet their performance typically hinges on hand-crafted heuristics. This work
introduces Reinforcement Learning from Algorithm Feedback (RLAF) as a paradigm
for learning to guide SAT solver branching heuristics with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). Central to our approach is a novel and generic mechanism for
injecting inferred variable weights and polarities into the branching
heuristics of existing SAT solvers. In a single forward pass, a GNN assigns
these parameters to all variables. Casting this one-shot guidance as a
reinforcement learning problem lets us train the GNN with off-the-shelf
policy-gradient methods, such as GRPO, directly using the solver's
computational cost as the sole reward signal. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that RLAF-trained policies significantly reduce the mean solve times of
different base solvers across diverse SAT problem distributions, achieving more
than a 2x speedup in some cases, while generalizing effectively to larger and
harder problems after training. Notably, these policies consistently outperform
expert-supervised approaches based on learning handcrafted weighting
heuristics, offering a promising path towards data-driven heuristic design in
combinatorial optimization.

Motivation: 研究MoE模型在内存受限设备上部署时的局部路由一致性，以优化专家卸载策略。

Method: 提出SRP和SCH两种指标，分析20种MoE LLM的路由一致性。

Result: 发现某些模型设计路由一致性更高，领域专家比词汇专家贡献更大，缓存大小约为活跃专家的2倍时效果最佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果为内存高效的MoE设计和部署提供了指导，同时不影响推理速度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models
(LLMs) with sparsely activated experts during inference. To effectively deploy
large MoE models on memory-constrained devices, many systems introduce *expert
offloading* that caches a subset of experts in fast memory, leaving others on
slow memory to run on CPU or load on demand. While some research has exploited
the locality of expert activations, where consecutive tokens activate similar
experts, the degree of this **local routing consistency** varies across models
and remains understudied. In this paper, we propose two metrics to measure
local routing consistency of MoE models: (1) **Segment Routing Best Performance
(SRP)**, which evaluates how well a fixed group of experts can cover the needs
of a segment of tokens, and (2) **Segment Cache Best Hit Rate (SCH)**, which
measures the optimal segment-level cache hit rate under a given cache size
limit. We analyzed 20 MoE LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures and found
that models that apply MoE on every layer and do not use shared experts exhibit
the highest local routing consistency. We further showed that
domain-specialized experts contribute more to routing consistency than
vocabulary-specialized ones, and that most models can balance between cache
effectiveness and efficiency with cache sizes approximately 2x the active
experts. These findings pave the way for memory-efficient MoE design and
deployment without compromising inference speed. We publish the code for
replicating experiments at https://github.com/ljcleo/moe-lrc .

Conclusion: mesh-free SINDy算法高效且易于实现，适用于多种科学和工程问题。

Abstract: Identifying the governing equations of a dynamical system is one of the most
important tasks for scientific modeling. However, this procedure often requires
high-quality spatio-temporal data uniformly sampled on structured grids. In
this paper, we propose mesh-free SINDy, a novel algorithm which leverages the
power of neural network approximation as well as auto-differentiation to
identify governing equations from arbitrary sensor placements and non-uniform
temporal data sampling. We show that mesh-free SINDy is robust to high noise
levels and limited data while remaining computationally efficient. In our
implementation, the training procedure is straight-forward and nearly free of
hyperparameter tuning, making mesh-free SINDy widely applicable to many
scientific and engineering problems. In the experiments, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on a series of PDEs including the Burgers' equation, the heat
equation, the Korteweg-De Vries equation and the 2D advection-diffusion
equation. We conduct detailed numerical experiments on all datasets, varying
the noise levels and number of samples, and we also compare our approach to
previous state-of-the-art methods. It is noteworthy that, even in high-noise
and low-data scenarios, mesh-free SINDy demonstrates robust PDE discovery,
achieving successful identification with up to 75% noise for the Burgers'
equation using 5,000 samples and with as few as 100 samples and 1% noise. All
of this is achieved within a training time of under one minute.

Abstract: We introduce Model Feedback Learning (MFL), a novel test-time optimization
framework for optimizing inputs to pre-trained AI models or deployed hardware
systems without requiring any retraining of the models or modifications to the
hardware. In contrast to existing methods that rely on adjusting model
parameters, MFL leverages a lightweight reverse model to iteratively search for
optimal inputs, enabling efficient adaptation to new objectives under
deployment constraints. This framework is particularly advantageous in
real-world settings, such as semiconductor manufacturing recipe generation,
where modifying deployed systems is often infeasible or cost-prohibitive. We
validate MFL on semiconductor plasma etching tasks, where it achieves target
recipe generation in just five iterations, significantly outperforming both
Bayesian optimization and human experts. Beyond semiconductor applications, MFL
also demonstrates strong performance in chemical processes (e.g., chemical
vapor deposition) and electronic systems (e.g., wire bonding), highlighting its
broad applicability. Additionally, MFL incorporates stability-aware
optimization, enhancing robustness to process variations and surpassing
conventional supervised learning and random search methods in high-dimensional
control settings. By enabling few-shot adaptation, MFL provides a scalable and
efficient paradigm for deploying intelligent control in real-world
environments.

Motivation: 传统的数据集混合方法依赖启发式和试错，效率低下，需要多次微调才能达到理想效果。

Method: 利用模型合并技术，将单独微调后的模型通过简单算术操作结合，替代对整个混合数据集的微调。

Result: 实验表明，Merge to Mix在数据集选择方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Merge to Mix提供了一种高效的数据集混合构建方法，显著提升了微调效率。

Abstract: Mixing datasets for fine-tuning large models (LMs) has become critical for
maximizing performance on downstream tasks. However, composing effective
dataset mixtures typically relies on heuristics and trial-and-error, often
requiring multiple fine-tuning runs to achieve the desired outcome. We propose
a novel method, $\textit{Merge to Mix}$, that accelerates composing dataset
mixtures through model merging. Model merging is a recent technique that
combines the abilities of multiple individually fine-tuned LMs into a single LM
by using a few simple arithmetic operations. Our key insight is that merging
models individually fine-tuned on each dataset in a mixture can effectively
serve as a surrogate for a model fine-tuned on the entire mixture. Merge to Mix
leverages this insight to accelerate selecting dataset mixtures without
requiring full fine-tuning on each candidate mixture. Our experiments
demonstrate that Merge to Mix surpasses state-of-the-art methods in dataset
selection for fine-tuning LMs.

Motivation: 传统变分自编码器（VAE）需要独立的编码器和解码器网络，参数量较大。BVAE旨在通过双向结构减少参数并保持或提升性能。

Method: BVAE使用单一神经网络，通过前向编码和后向解码实现双向操作。在图像重建、分类、插值和生成任务上与普通VAE进行比较。

Result: BVAE将参数量减少了近50%，并在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CelebA-64数据集上略微优于普通VAE。

Conclusion: BVAE通过双向结构显著减少了参数量，同时保持了性能优势，为高效模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present the new bidirectional variational autoencoder (BVAE) network

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单个SAE只能提取激活空间中的有限特征子集，不同初始化的SAE可能学习不同特征，因此提出集成方法以克服这一限制。

Method: 采用朴素装袋（bagging）和提升（boosting）方法集成多个SAE，分别通过不同初始化和最小化残差训练。

Result: 集成方法在语言模型激活重构、特征多样性和SAE稳定性方面表现更优，且在下游任务（如概念检测和虚假关联去除）中优于单个SAE。

Conclusion: 集成多个SAE能显著提升特征提取的全面性和实际应用效果。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into human-interpretable features. Typically, features learned by a single SAE
are used for downstream applications. However, it has recently been shown that
SAEs trained with different initial weights can learn different features,
demonstrating that a single SAE captures only a limited subset of features that
can be extracted from the activation space. Motivated by this limitation, we
propose to ensemble multiple SAEs through naive bagging and boosting.
Specifically, SAEs trained with different weight initializations are ensembled
in naive bagging, whereas SAEs sequentially trained to minimize the residual
error are ensembled in boosting. We evaluate our ensemble approaches with three
settings of language models and SAE architectures. Our empirical results
demonstrate that ensembling SAEs can improve the reconstruction of language
model activations, diversity of features, and SAE stability. Furthermore,
ensembling SAEs performs better than applying a single SAE on downstream tasks
such as concept detection and spurious correlation removal, showing improved
practical utility.

Conclusion: FR-Mamba通过融合时空特征，有效解决了物理场重建中的长程依赖性问题。

Abstract: Physical field reconstruction (PFR) aims to predict the state distribution of
physical quantities (e.g., velocity, pressure, and temperature) based on
limited sensor measurements. It plays a critical role in domains such as fluid
dynamics and thermodynamics. However, existing deep learning methods often fail
to capture long-range temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal
performance on time-evolving physical systems. To address this, we propose
FR-Mamba, a novel spatiotemporal flow field reconstruction framework based on
state space modeling. Specifically, we design a hybrid neural network
architecture that combines Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and State Space Model
(SSM) to capture both global spatial features and long-range temporal
dependencies. We adopt Mamba, a recently proposed efficient SSM architecture,
to model long-range temporal dependencies with linear time complexity. In
parallel, the FNO is employed to capture non-local spatial features by
leveraging frequency-domain transformations. The spatiotemporal representations
extracted by these two components are then fused to reconstruct the full-field
distribution of the physical system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing PFR methods in flow field
reconstruction tasks, achieving high-accuracy performance on long sequences.

Abstract: Much research has been done to analyze the stock market. After all, if one
can determine a pattern in the chaotic frenzy of transactions, then they could
make a hefty profit from capitalizing on these insights. As such, the goal of
our project was to apply reinforcement learning (RL) to determine the best time

order to use the format of free, real-world data to train the model, we define

Abstract: Keylogger detection involves monitoring for unusual system behaviors such as
delays between typing and character display, analyzing network traffic patterns
for data exfiltration. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis for
keylogger detection with traditional machine learning models - SVC, Random
Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
and advanced ensemble methods including Stacking, Blending and Voting.
Moreover, feature selection approaches such as Information gain, Lasso L1 and
Fisher Score are thoroughly assessed to improve predictive performance and
lower computational complexity. The Keylogger Detection dataset from publicly
available Kaggle website is used in this project. In addition to accuracy-based
classification, this study implements the approach for model interpretation
using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques namely SHAP (Global) and LIME (Local) to
deliver finer explanations for how much each feature contributes in assisting
or hindering the detection process. To evaluate the models result, we have used
AUC score, sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy and F1 score. The best
performance was achieved by AdaBoost with 99.76% accuracy, F1 score of 0.99,
100% precision, 98.6% recall, 1.0 specificity and 0.99 of AUC that is
near-perfect classification with Fisher Score.

### [47] [Tools in the Loop: Quantifying Uncertainty of LLM Question Answering Systems That Use Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16113)
*Panagiotis Lymperopoulos,Vasanth Sarathy*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出了一种新框架，用于量化大型语言模型（LLM）与外部工具结合时的不确定性，以增强高风险应用中的信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在知识不足时需依赖外部工具，但现有方法未解决工具调用场景下的不确定性评估问题。

Method: 扩展了序列不确定性量化方法，提出高效近似计算，适用于实际应用。

Result: 在合成QA数据集和RAG系统中验证了框架有效性，提升了LLM系统的可信度。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效增强LLM与外部工具结合时的可靠性，尤其在知识不足的场景中。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) often require external tools, such as
machine learning classifiers or knowledge retrieval systems, to provide
accurate answers in domains where their pre-trained knowledge is insufficient.
This integration of LLMs with external tools expands their utility but also
introduces a critical challenge: determining the trustworthiness of responses
generated by the combined system. In high-stakes applications, such as medical
decision-making, it is essential to assess the uncertainty of both the LLM's
generated text and the tool's output to ensure the reliability of the final
response. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods do not account
for the tool-calling scenario, where both the LLM and external tool contribute
to the overall system's uncertainty. In this work, we present a novel framework
for modeling tool-calling LLMs that quantifies uncertainty by jointly
considering the predictive uncertainty of the LLM and the external tool. We
extend previous methods for uncertainty quantification over token sequences to
this setting and propose efficient approximations that make uncertainty
computation practical for real-world applications. We evaluate our framework on
two new synthetic QA datasets, derived from well-known machine learning
datasets, which require tool-calling for accurate answers. Additionally, we
apply our method to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and conduct a
proof-of-concept experiment demonstrating the effectiveness of our uncertainty
metrics in scenarios where external information retrieval is needed. Our
results show that the framework is effective in enhancing trust in LLM-based
systems, especially in cases where the LLM's internal knowledge is insufficient
and external tools are required.

*Aditya T. Vadlamani,Anutam Srinivasan,Pranav Maneriker,Ali Payani,Srinivasan Parthasarathy*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于共形预测的公平性框架（Conformal Fairness），通过理论算法控制不同敏感群体间的覆盖率差距，适用于非独立同分布数据（如图数据）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测（CP）在不确定性量化中广泛应用，但其覆盖率保证对敏感属性不敏感，需解决公平性问题。

Method: 提出Conformal Fairness框架，利用共形预测的交换性假设（非IID假设），设计算法控制敏感群体间的覆盖率差距。

Result: 在图数据和表格数据上的实验表明，算法能有效控制公平性差距，且覆盖率符合理论预期。

Conclusion: Conformal Fairness为共形预测提供了公平性保障，适用于非IID数据，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular method for uncertainty quantification
with machine learning models. While conformal prediction provides probabilistic
guarantees regarding the coverage of the true label, these guarantees are
agnostic to the presence of sensitive attributes within the dataset. In this
work, we formalize \textit{Conformal Fairness}, a notion of fairness using
conformal predictors, and provide a theoretically well-founded algorithm and
associated framework to control for the gaps in coverage between different
sensitive groups. Our framework leverages the exchangeability assumption
(implicit to CP) rather than the typical IID assumption, allowing us to apply
the notion of Conformal Fairness to data types and tasks that are not IID, such
as graph data. Experiments were conducted on graph and tabular datasets to
demonstrate that the algorithm can control fairness-related gaps in addition to
coverage aligned with theoretical expectations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但推理效率低，且存在‘过度思考’问题。

Method: 提出BBAM理论模型和$E^3$指标，设计Plan-and-Budget框架，动态分配计算资源。

Result: Plan-and-Budget显著提升效率和准确性，减少计算资源消耗，缩小模型性能差距。

Conclusion: Plan-and-Budget是一种无需重新训练即可提升模型效率的通用框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in complex
reasoning tasks, but their inference remains computationally inefficient. We
observe a common failure mode in many prevalent LLMs, overthinking, where
models generate verbose and tangential reasoning traces even for simple
queries. Recent works have tried to mitigate this by enforcing fixed token
budgets, however, this can lead to underthinking, especially on harder
problems. Through empirical analysis, we identify that this inefficiency often
stems from unclear problem-solving strategies. To formalize this, we develop a
theoretical model, BBAM (Bayesian Budget Allocation Model), which models
reasoning as a sequence of sub-questions with varying uncertainty, and
introduce the $E^3$ metric to capture the trade-off between correctness and
computation efficiency. Building on theoretical results from BBAM, we propose
Plan-and-Budget, a model-agnostic, test-time framework that decomposes complex
queries into sub-questions and allocates token budgets based on estimated
complexity using adaptive scheduling. Plan-and-Budget improves reasoning
efficiency across a range of tasks and models, achieving up to +70% accuracy
gains, -39% token reduction, and +187.5% improvement in $E^3$. Notably, it
elevates a smaller model (DS-Qwen-32B) to match the efficiency of a larger
model (DS-LLaMA-70B)-demonstrating Plan-and-Budget's ability to close
performance gaps without retraining. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IRM方法（如IRMv1）因对有限环境多样性和过参数化敏感，性能不佳，亟需更稳健的实现。

Method: 提出外推框架，通过合成分布偏移增强IRM惩罚项，提升环境多样性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和实际场景中均优于现有IRM变体。

Conclusion: 新框架有效且稳健，显著提升了IRM的OOD泛化能力。

Abstract: Invariant risk minimization (IRM) aims to enable out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization in deep learning by learning invariant representations. As IRM
poses an inherently challenging bi-level optimization problem, most existing
approaches -- including IRMv1 -- adopt penalty-based single-level
approximations. However, empirical studies consistently show that these methods
often fail to outperform well-tuned empirical risk minimization (ERM),
highlighting the need for more robust IRM implementations. This work
theoretically identifies a key limitation common to many IRM variants: their
penalty terms are highly sensitive to limited environment diversity and
over-parameterization, resulting in performance degradation. To address this
issue, a novel extrapolation-based framework is proposed that enhances
environmental diversity by augmenting the IRM penalty through synthetic
distributional shifts. Extensive experiments -- ranging from synthetic setups
to realistic, over-parameterized scenarios -- demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IRM variants, validating its
effectiveness and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNNs基于消息传递的方法存在表达能力和可扩展性不足的问题，限制了其作为图基础模型的潜力。

Method: G²PM将图实例（节点、边或整个图）表示为子结构序列，并通过生成式预训练学习通用且可迁移的表示。

Result: 在ogbn-arxiv基准测试中，G²PM在模型规模达6000万参数时仍能持续提升性能，优于其他生成式方法。

Conclusion: G²PM在节点分类、图分类和迁移学习等任务中表现优异，为可扩展的图学习提供了有力基础。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) has been predominantly driven by
message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local
neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from
fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness,
over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range
dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model
size often fails to yield improved performance, limiting the viability of GNNs
as backbones for graph foundation models. In this work, we explore pathways
beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine
(G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM
represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of
substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn
generalizable, transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates
strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with
model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches
that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we
systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural
choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse
tasks -- including node classification, graph classification, and transfer
learning -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a
compelling foundation for scalable graph learning. The code and dataset are

Method: 提出MMO-FL框架，并针对模态缺失问题设计了PMM算法，利用原型学习补偿缺失模态。

Result: 在两种多模态数据集上的实验表明，PMM算法性能优于基准方法。

Conclusion: MMO-FL框架和PMM算法有效解决了IoT环境中多模态学习的动态性和模态缺失问题。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem generates vast amounts of multimodal
data from heterogeneous sources such as sensors, cameras, and microphones. As
edge intelligence continues to evolve, IoT devices have progressed from simple
data collection units to nodes capable of executing complex computational
tasks. This evolution necessitates the adoption of distributed learning
strategies to effectively handle multimodal data in an IoT environment.
Furthermore, the real-time nature of data collection and limited local storage
on edge devices in IoT call for an online learning paradigm. To address these
challenges, we introduce the concept of Multimodal Online Federated Learning
(MMO-FL), a novel framework designed for dynamic and decentralized multimodal
learning in IoT environments. Building on this framework, we further account
for the inherent instability of edge devices, which frequently results in
missing modalities during the learning process. We conduct a comprehensive
theoretical analysis under both complete and missing modality scenarios,
providing insights into the performance degradation caused by missing
modalities. To mitigate the impact of modality missing, we propose the
Prototypical Modality Mitigation (PMM) algorithm, which leverages prototype
learning to effectively compensate for missing modalities. Experimental results
on two multimodal datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of PMM
compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: NAN是一种简单有效的训练免费方法，适用于多种合并策略。

Abstract: Model merging offers a training-free alternative to multi-task learning by
combining independently fine-tuned models into a unified one without access to
raw data. However, existing approaches often rely on heuristics to determine
the merging coefficients, limiting their scalability and generality. In this
work, we revisit model merging through the lens of least-squares optimization
and show that the optimal merging weights should scale with the amount of
task-specific information encoded in each model. Based on this insight, we
propose NAN, a simple yet effective method that estimates model merging
coefficients via the inverse of parameter norm. NAN is training-free,
plug-and-play, and applicable to a wide range of merging strategies. Extensive
experiments on show that NAN consistently improves performance of baseline
methods.

Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示微调LLMs时可能存在的安全隐患，即看似良性的模型可能在微调后触发隐藏的恶意行为。

Method: 采用元学习技术毒害LLM，优化其在微调后表现出特定恶意行为，同时保持微调前的正常功能。

Result: FAB攻击在多种LLMs和三种目标行为（广告推送、拒绝服务和越狱能力）上均有效，且对用户微调选择具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明微调过程存在新的攻击途径，需重新评估LLMs的安全性。

Abstract: Finetuning openly accessible Large Language Models (LLMs) has become standard
practice for achieving task-specific performance improvements. Until now,
finetuning has been regarded as a controlled and secure process in which
training on benign datasets led to predictable behaviors. In this paper, we
demonstrate for the first time that an adversary can create poisoned LLMs that
initially appear benign but exhibit malicious behaviors once finetuned by
downstream users. To this end, our proposed attack, FAB (Finetuning-Activated
Backdoor), poisons an LLM via meta-learning techniques to simulate downstream
finetuning, explicitly optimizing for the emergence of malicious behaviors in
the finetuned models. At the same time, the poisoned LLM is regularized to
retain general capabilities and to exhibit no malicious behaviors prior to
finetuning. As a result, when users finetune the seemingly benign model on
their own datasets, they unknowingly trigger its hidden backdoor behavior. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of FAB across multiple LLMs and three target
behaviors: unsolicited advertising, refusal, and jailbreakability.
Additionally, we show that FAB-backdoors are robust to various finetuning
choices made by the user (e.g., dataset, number of steps, scheduler). Our
findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the security of finetuning,
revealing yet another critical attack vector exploiting the complexities of
LLMs.

Result: 主成分子空间在适度标签不准确时偏差极小，LIP能有效提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 模型在标注不准确时仍能保留关键信息，LIP为理论和实践提供了新视角。

Abstract: Learning from inaccurate annotations has gained significant attention due to
the high cost of precise labeling. However, despite the presence of erroneous
labels, models trained on noisy data often retain the ability to make accurate
predictions. This intriguing phenomenon raises a fundamental yet largely
unexplored question: why models can still extract correct label information
from inaccurate annotations remains unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive investigation into this issue. By analyzing weight matrices from
both empirical and theoretical perspectives, we find that label inaccuracy
primarily accumulates noise in lower singular components and subtly perturbs
the principal subspace. Within a certain range, the principal subspaces of
weights trained on inaccurate labels remain largely aligned with those learned
from clean labels, preserving essential task-relevant information. We formally
prove that the angles of principal subspaces exhibit minimal deviation under
moderate label inaccuracy, explaining why models can still generalize
effectively. Building on these insights, we propose LIP, a lightweight plug-in
designed to help classifiers retain principal subspace information while
mitigating noise induced by label inaccuracy. Extensive experiments on tasks
with various inaccuracy conditions demonstrate that LIP consistently enhances
the performance of existing algorithms. We hope our findings can offer valuable
theoretical and practical insights to understand of model robustness under
inaccurate supervision.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了联邦学习中的声誉和数据异构性问题，同时保护了数据隐私。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) holds great promise for digital health by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising patient data privacy.
However, heterogeneity across institutions, lack of sustained reputation, and
unreliable contributions remain major challenges. In this paper, we propose a
robust, peer-driven reputation mechanism for federated healthcare that employs
a hybrid communication model to integrate decentralized peer feedback with
clustering-based noise handling to enhance model aggregation. Crucially, our
approach decouples the federated aggregation and reputation mechanisms by
applying differential privacy to client-side model updates before sharing them
for peer evaluation. This ensures sensitive information remains protected
during reputation computation, while unaltered updates are sent to the server
for global model training. Using the Cox Proportional Hazards model for
survival analysis across multiple federated nodes, our framework addresses both
data heterogeneity and reputation deficit by dynamically adjusting trust scores
based on local performance improvements measured via the concordance index.
Experimental evaluations on both synthetic datasets and the SEER dataset
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high and stable C-index
values, effectively down-weighing noisy client updates and outperforming FL
methods that lack a reputation system.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在预训练阶段已采用安全对齐技术，但微调仍可能导致安全性能下降，甚至使用无害数据也会引发问题。

Method: 提出SAP框架，通过在梯度传播过程中引入安全感知探测，识别潜在风险方向，从而在提升任务性能的同时保持模型安全性。

Result: 实验表明，SAP能有效降低有害性，同时保持与标准微调方法相当的测试损失。

Conclusion: SAP是一种有效的解决方案，可在微调过程中平衡性能与安全性。

Abstract: The significant progress of large language models (LLMs) has led to
remarkable achievements across numerous applications. However, their ability to
generate harmful content has sparked substantial safety concerns. Despite the
implementation of safety alignment techniques during the pre-training phase,
recent research indicates that fine-tuning LLMs on adversarial or even benign
data can inadvertently compromise their safety. In this paper, we re-examine
the fundamental issue of why fine-tuning on non-harmful data still results in
safety degradation. We introduce a safety-aware probing (SAP) optimization
framework designed to mitigate the safety risks of fine-tuning LLMs.
Specifically, SAP incorporates a safety-aware probe into the gradient
propagation process, mitigating the model's risk of safety degradation by
identifying potential pitfalls in gradient directions, thereby enhancing
task-specific performance while successfully preserving model safety. Our
extensive experimental results demonstrate that SAP effectively reduces
harmfulness below the original fine-tuned model and achieves comparable test
loss to standard fine-tuning methods. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理时KV缓存的内存消耗成为瓶颈，现有量化方法难以在低比特下保持精度。

Method: 分析KV缓存的元素分布，设计NQKV算法，采用分块量化技术实现最优量化误差。

Result: NQKV使OPT模型推理批次大小提升2倍或上下文长度提升4倍，吞吐量提高9.3倍。

Conclusion: NQKV在低比特量化下显著优化内存和性能，为LLM部署提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across
a wide range of tasks. However, LLMs often require larger batch sizes to
enhance throughput or longer context lengths to meet task demands, which
significantly increases the memory resource consumption of the Key-Value (KV)
cache during inference, becoming a major bottleneck in LLM deployment. To
address this issue, quantization is a common and straightforward approach.
Currently, quantization methods for activations are limited to 8-bit, and
quantization to even lower bits can lead to substantial accuracy drops. To
further save space by quantizing the KV cache to even lower bits, we analyzed
the element distribution of the KV cache and designed the NQKV algorithm. Since
the elements within each block of the KV cache follow a normal distribution,
NQKV employs per-block quantile quantization to achieve
information-theoretically optimal quantization error. Without significantly
compromising model output quality, NQKV enables the OPT model to perform
inference with an 2x larger batch size or a 4x longer context length, and it
improves throughput by 9.3x compared to when the KV cache is not used.

Abstract: In recent years, the successor representation (SR) has attracted increasing
attention in reinforcement learning (RL), and it has been used to address some
of its key challenges, such as exploration, credit assignment, and
generalization. The SR can be seen as representing the underlying credit
assignment structure of the environment by implicitly encoding its induced
transition dynamics. However, the SR is reward-agnostic. In this paper, we
discuss a similar representation that also takes into account the reward
dynamics of the problem. We study the default representation (DR), a recently
proposed representation with limited theoretical (and empirical) analysis.
Here, we lay some of the theoretical foundation underlying the DR in the
tabular case by (1) deriving dynamic programming and (2) temporal-difference
methods to learn the DR, (3) characterizing the basis for the vector space of
the DR, and (4) formally extending the DR to the function approximation case
through default features. Empirically, we analyze the benefits of the DR in
many of the settings in which the SR has been applied, including (1) reward
shaping, (2) option discovery, (3) exploration, and (4) transfer learning. Our
results show that, compared to the SR, the DR gives rise to qualitatively
different, reward-aware behaviour and quantitatively better performance in
several settings.

that frequently arise in open environments. This raises the question: Can
TabPFN v2 maintain good performance in open environments? To this end, we
conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of TabPFN v2's adaptability in open
environments. We construct a unified evaluation framework covering various
real-world challenges and assess the robustness of TabPFN v2 under open
environments scenarios using this framework. Empirical results demonstrate that
TabPFN v2 shows significant limitations in open environments but is suitable
for small-scale, covariate-shifted, and class-balanced tasks. Tree-based models
remain the optimal choice for general tabular tasks in open environments. To
facilitate future research on open environments challenges, we advocate for
open environments tabular benchmarks, multi-metric evaluation, and universal
modules to strengthen model robustness. We publicly release our evaluation
framework at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/tabpfn-ood-4E65.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于模型的安全离线强化学习框架（OGSRL），通过双重约束机制解决医疗场景中离线RL的OOD问题，确保策略的安全性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗场景中离线RL的OOD问题可能导致有害建议，现有方法仅约束动作选择，无法调控状态轨迹，限制了长期治疗策略的发现。

Method: 提出OGSRL框架，包含OOD守护者和安全成本约束，前者限定策略探索的临床验证区域，后者编码生理安全边界知识。

Result: OGSRL在理论和实验上证明了其策略在安全性和性能上的优越性，接近数据支持的最佳策略。

Conclusion: OGSRL通过双重约束机制，在医疗场景中实现了安全且性能优越的离线RL策略。

Abstract: When applying offline reinforcement learning (RL) in healthcare scenarios,
the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues pose significant risks, as inappropriate
generalization beyond clinical expertise can result in potentially harmful
recommendations. While existing methods like conservative Q-learning (CQL)
attempt to address the OOD issue, their effectiveness is limited by only
constraining action selection by suppressing uncertain actions. This
action-only regularization imitates clinician actions that prioritize
short-term rewards, but it fails to regulate downstream state trajectories,
thereby limiting the discovery of improved long-term treatment strategies. To
safely improve policy beyond clinician recommendations while ensuring that
state-action trajectories remain in-distribution, we propose \textit{Offline
Guarded Safe Reinforcement Learning} ($\mathsf{OGSRL}$), a theoretically
grounded model-based offline RL framework. $\mathsf{OGSRL}$ introduces a novel
dual constraint mechanism for improving policy with reliability and safety.
First, the OOD guardian is established to specify clinically validated regions
for safe policy exploration. By constraining optimization within these regions,
it enables the reliable exploration of treatment strategies that outperform
clinician behavior by leveraging the full patient state history, without
drifting into unsupported state-action trajectories. Second, we introduce a
safety cost constraint that encodes medical knowledge about physiological
safety boundaries, providing domain-specific safeguards even in areas where
training data might contain potentially unsafe interventions. Notably, we
provide theoretical guarantees on safety and near-optimality: policies that
satisfy these constraints remain in safe and reliable regions and achieve
performance close to the best possible policy supported by the data.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of multi-node perception and delayed
scheduling response in distributed systems by proposing a GNN-based multi-node
collaborative perception mechanism. The system is modeled as a graph structure.
Message-passing and state-update modules are introduced. A multi-layer graph
neural network is constructed to enable efficient information aggregation and
dynamic state inference among nodes. In addition, a perception representation
method is designed by fusing local states with global features. This improves
each node's ability to perceive the overall system status. The proposed method
is evaluated within a customized experimental framework. A dataset featuring
heterogeneous task loads and dynamic communication topologies is used.
Performance is measured in terms of task completion rate, average latency, load
balancing, and transmission efficiency. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms mainstream algorithms under various conditions,
including limited bandwidth and dynamic structural changes. It demonstrates
superior perception capabilities and cooperative scheduling performance. The
model achieves rapid convergence and efficient responses to complex system
states.

Result: 发现小规模与大规模语言模型的预测结果高度相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持在小规模代理模型中应用数据归因和数据集选择的有效性。

Abstract: Choice of training data distribution greatly influences model behavior. Yet,
in large-scale settings, precisely characterizing how changes in training data
affects predictions is often difficult due to model training costs. Current
practice is to instead extrapolate from scaled down, inexpensive-to-train proxy
models. However, changes in data do not influence smaller and larger models
identically. Therefore, understanding how choice of data affects large-scale
models raises the question: how does training data distribution influence model
behavior across compute scale? We find that small- and large-scale language
model predictions (generally) do highly correlate across choice of training
data. Equipped with these findings, we characterize how proxy scale affects
effectiveness in two downstream proxy model applications: data attribution and
dataset selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Bradley-Terry奖励模型在数据规模和覆盖范围上敏感且易受奖励攻击，而现有生成奖励模型推理能力有限且与标准RLHF算法不兼容。

Method: 提出Think-RM框架，通过监督微调和基于规则的强化学习提升长程推理能力，并设计新的成对RLHF流程直接优化策略。

Result: Think-RM在RM-Bench上表现最优，优于传统方法8%，结合成对RLHF流程后策略性能更优。

Conclusion: Think-RM为RLHF提供了更强大的奖励模型和优化流程，显著提升了模型对齐效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a powerful
post-training paradigm for aligning large language models with human
preferences. A core challenge in RLHF is constructing accurate reward signals,
where the conventional Bradley-Terry reward models (BT RMs) often suffer from
sensitivity to data size and coverage, as well as vulnerability to reward
hacking. Generative reward models (GenRMs) offer a more robust alternative by
generating chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales followed by a final reward.
However, existing GenRMs rely on shallow, vertically scaled reasoning, limiting
their capacity to handle nuanced or complex (e.g., reasoning-intensive) tasks.
Moreover, their pairwise preference outputs are incompatible with standard RLHF
algorithms that require pointwise reward signals. In this work, we introduce
Think-RM, a training framework that enables long-horizon reasoning in GenRMs by
modeling an internal thinking process. Rather than producing structured,
externally provided rationales, Think-RM generates flexible, self-guided
reasoning traces that support advanced capabilities such as self-reflection,
hypothetical reasoning, and divergent reasoning. To elicit these reasoning
abilities, we first warm-up the models by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over
long CoT data. We then further improve the model's long-horizon abilities by
rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). In addition, we propose a novel
pairwise RLHF pipeline that directly optimizes policies using pairwise
preference rewards, eliminating the need for pointwise reward conversion and
enabling more effective use of Think-RM outputs. Experiments show that Think-RM
achieves state-of-the-art results on RM-Bench, outperforming both BT RM and
vertically scaled GenRM by 8%. When combined with our pairwise RLHF pipeline,
it demonstrates superior end-policy performance compared to traditional
approaches.

Motivation: 探讨注意力机制中避免层坍塌的条件，明确大权重的重要性。

Method: 通过理论分析，比较层坍塌与秩坍塌（rank collapse），并验证大权重的作用。

Result: 发现即使有跳跃连接，小权重仍会导致层坍塌，只有大权重能避免。

Conclusion: 注意力机制的二阶时间复杂度是不可避免的，大权重是避免层坍塌的关键。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms lie at the heart of modern large language models (LLMs).
Straightforward algorithms for forward and backward (gradient) computation take
quadratic time, and a line of work initiated by [Alman and Song NeurIPS 2023]
and [Alman and Song NeurIPS 2024] has shown that quadratic time is necessary
unless the model weights are small, in which case almost linear time algorithms
are possible. In this paper, we show that large weights are necessary to avoid
a strong preclusion to representational strength we call layer collapse, which
means that the entire network can be approximated well by a network with only a
single layer. Thus, the quadratic running time of attention is unavoidable for
expressive transformers.
  The notion of layer collapse that we introduce is a variant on the notion of
rank collapse from the work of [Dong, Cordonnier, and Loukas ICML 2021]. They
showed that in Self Attention Networks with small weights and with skip
connections, rank collapse must occur. This is typically interpreted as
justifying the necessity of skip connections in expressive networks. However,
our result shows that even with skip connections, if the weights are small,
then layer collapse still occurs. Thus, only large weights, and not skip
connections, can prevent these representational weaknesses.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has emerged as a central issue in ML, and it has become
standard practice to adjust ML algorithms so that they will satisfy fairness
requirements such as Equal Opportunity. In this paper we consider the effects
of adopting such fair classifiers on the overall level of ecosystem fairness.
Specifically, we introduce the study of fairness with competing firms, and
demonstrate the failure of fair classifiers in yielding fair ecosystems. Our
results quantify the loss of fairness in systems, under a variety of
conditions, based on classifiers' correlation and the level of their data
overlap. We show that even if competing classifiers are individually fair, the
ecosystem's outcome may be unfair; and that adjusting biased algorithms to
improve their individual fairness may lead to an overall decline in ecosystem
fairness. In addition to these theoretical results, we also provide supporting
experimental evidence. Together, our model and results provide a novel and
essential call for action.

Motivation: 现有贝叶斯CPD方法因高维矩阵求逆问题难以扩展到大张量，CP-GAMP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用广义近似消息传递（GAMP）避免矩阵求逆，并结合期望最大化（EM）推断张量秩和噪声功率。

Result: 在100x100x100秩20张量实验中，运行时间减少82.7%，重建精度与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: CP-GAMP是一种高效且准确的贝叶斯CPD算法，适用于大规模张量重建。

Abstract: Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD) is a fundamental model for
tensor reconstruction. Although the Bayesian framework allows for principled
uncertainty quantification and automatic hyperparameter learning, existing
methods do not scale well for large tensors because of high-dimensional matrix
inversions. To this end, we introduce CP-GAMP, a scalable Bayesian CPD
algorithm. This algorithm leverages generalized approximate message passing
(GAMP) to avoid matrix inversions and incorporates an expectation-maximization
routine to jointly infer the tensor rank and noise power. Through multiple
experiments, for synthetic 100x100x100 rank 20 tensors with only 20% elements
observed, the proposed algorithm reduces runtime by 82.7% compared to the
state-of-the-art variational Bayesian CPD method, while maintaining comparable
reconstruction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用‘all-to-all’范式，未能区分变量角色，导致因果信息与虚假相关性混杂。

Method: 构建结构因果模型，将历史序列分为四类子段（内生、直接因果、碰撞因果、虚假相关），仅使用前三类进行预测，并提出CAIFormer模型处理这些子段。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了CAIFormer的有效性。

Conclusion: ‘all-to-one’范式和CAIFormer能显著提升预测准确性，避免虚假相关性干扰。

Abstract: Most existing multivariate time series forecasting methods adopt an
all-to-all paradigm that feeds all variable histories into a unified model to
predict their future values without distinguishing their individual roles.
However, this undifferentiated paradigm makes it difficult to identify
variable-specific causal influences and often entangles causally relevant
information with spurious correlations. To address this limitation, we propose
an all-to-one forecasting paradigm that predicts each target variable
separately. Specifically, we first construct a Structural Causal Model from
observational data and then, for each target variable, we partition the
historical sequence into four sub-segments according to the inferred causal
structure: endogenous, direct causal, collider causal, and spurious
correlation. The prediction relies solely on the first three causally relevant
sub-segments, while the spurious correlation sub-segment is excluded.
Furthermore, we propose Causal Informed Transformer (CAIFormer), a novel
forecasting model comprising three components: Endogenous Sub-segment
Prediction Block, Direct Causal Sub-segment Prediction Block, and Collider
Causal Sub-segment Prediction Block, which process the endogenous, direct
causal, and collider causal sub-segments, respectively. Their outputs are then
combined to produce the final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the CAIFormer.

Method: 构建了包含50,000个时间序列的大规模数据集FreshRetailNet-50K，并采用两阶段需求建模方法：首先利用每小时标注重建缺货期间的潜在需求，然后训练鲁棒的需求预测模型。

Result: 实验显示，该方法将预测准确性提高了2.73%，并将系统性需求低估从7.37%降至接近零偏差。

Conclusion: FreshRetailNet-50K为需求填补、易腐品库存优化和零售因果分析开辟了新方向，解决了零售AI的长期限制。

Abstract: Accurate demand estimation is critical for the retail business in guiding the
inventory and pricing policies of perishable products. However, it faces
fundamental challenges from censored sales data during stockouts, where
unobserved demand creates systemic policy biases. Existing datasets lack the
temporal resolution and annotations needed to address this censoring effect. To
fill this gap, we present FreshRetailNet-50K, the first large-scale benchmark
for censored demand estimation. It comprises 50,000 store-product time series
of detailed hourly sales data from 898 stores in 18 major cities, encompassing
863 perishable SKUs meticulously annotated for stockout events. The hourly
stock status records unique to this dataset, combined with rich contextual
covariates, including promotional discounts, precipitation, and temporal
features, enable innovative research beyond existing solutions. We demonstrate
one such use case of two-stage demand modeling: first, we reconstruct the
latent demand during stockouts using precise hourly annotations. We then
leverage the recovered demand to train robust demand forecasting models in the
second stage. Experimental results show that this approach achieves a 2.73\%
improvement in prediction accuracy while reducing the systematic demand
underestimation from 7.37\% to near-zero bias. With unprecedented temporal
granularity and comprehensive real-world information, FreshRetailNet-50K opens
new research directions in demand imputation, perishable inventory
optimization, and causal retail analytics. The unique annotation quality and
scale of the dataset address long-standing limitations in retail AI, providing
immediate solutions and a platform for future methodological innovation. The
data (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Dingdong-Inc/FreshRetailNet-50K) and code

Result: 在六个基准测试中均取得最佳准确率，训练FLOPs平均减少58.6%。

Conclusion: AdaSTaR为高效自改进语言模型提供了新方向，适用于不同预训练模型。

Abstract: Self-Taught Reasoners (STaR), synonymously known as Rejection sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT), is an integral part of the training pipeline of
self-improving reasoning Language Models (LMs). The self-improving mechanism
often employs random observation (data) sampling. However, this results in
trained observation imbalance; inefficiently over-training on solved examples
while under-training on challenging ones. In response, we introduce Adaptive
STaR (AdaSTaR), a novel algorithm that rectifies this by integrating two
adaptive sampling principles: (1) Adaptive Sampling for Diversity: promoting
balanced training across observations, and (2) Adaptive Sampling for
Curriculum: dynamically adjusting data difficulty to match the model's evolving
strength. Across six benchmarks, AdaSTaR achieves best test accuracy in all
instances (6/6) and reduces training FLOPs by an average of 58.6% against an
extensive list of baselines. These improvements in performance and efficiency
generalize to different pre-trained LMs and larger models, paving the way for
more efficient and effective self-improving LMs.

Conclusion: DEX高效整合了差分注意力的优势，为预训练模型提供了轻量级且高性能的改进方案。

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently gained significant attention for its
impressive empirical performance, often attributed to its ability to perform
noise canceled attention. However, precisely how differential attention
achieves its empirical benefits remains poorly understood. Moreover,
Differential Transformer architecture demands large-scale training from
scratch, hindering utilization of open pretrained weights. In this work, we
conduct an in-depth investigation of Differential Transformer, uncovering three
key factors behind its success: (1) enhanced expressivity via negative
attention, (2) reduced redundancy among attention heads, and (3) improved
learning dynamics. Based on these findings, we propose DEX, a novel method to
efficiently integrate the advantages of differential attention into pretrained
language models. By reusing the softmax attention scores and adding a
lightweight differential operation on the output value matrix, DEX effectively
incorporates the key advantages of differential attention while remaining
lightweight in both training and inference. Evaluations confirm that DEX
substantially improves the pretrained LLMs across diverse benchmarks, achieving
significant performance gains with minimal adaptation data (< 0.01\%).

Conclusion: CLEANMOL为LLMs在分子科学中的应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly recognized as powerful tools
for scientific discovery, particularly in molecular science. A fundamental
requirement for these models is the ability to accurately understand molecular
structures, commonly encoded in the SMILES representation. However, current
LLMs struggle to interpret SMILES, even failing to carry out basic tasks such
as counting molecular rings. To address this limitation, we introduce CLEANMOL,
a novel framework that formulates SMILES parsing into a suite of clean and
deterministic tasks explicitly designed to promote graph-level molecular
comprehension. These tasks span from subgraph matching to global graph
matching, providing structured supervision aligned with molecular structural
properties. We construct a molecular pretraining dataset with adaptive
difficulty scoring and pre-train open-source LLMs on these tasks. Our results
show that CLEANMOL not only enhances structural comprehension but also achieves
the best or competes with the baseline on the Mol-Instructions benchmark.

Abstract: This paper studies the long-tailed semi-supervised learning (LTSSL) with
distribution mismatch, where the class distribution of the labeled training
data follows a long-tailed distribution and mismatches with that of the
unlabeled training data. Most existing methods introduce auxiliary classifiers
(experts) to model various unlabeled data distributions and produce
pseudo-labels, but the expertises of various experts are not fully utilized. We
observe that different experts are good at predicting different intervals of
samples, e.g., long-tailed expert is skilled in samples located in the head
interval and uniform expert excels in samples located in the medium interval.
Therefore, we propose a dynamic expert assignment module that can estimate the
class membership (i.e., head, medium, or tail class) of samples, and
dynamically assigns suitable expert to each sample based on the estimated
membership to produce high-quality pseudo-label in the training phase and
produce prediction in the testing phase. We also theoretically reveal that
integrating different experts' strengths will lead to a smaller generalization
error bound. Moreover, we find that the deeper features are more biased toward
the head class but with more discriminative ability, while the shallower
features are less biased but also with less discriminative ability. We,
therefore, propose a multi-depth feature fusion module to utilize different
depth features to mitigate the model bias. Our method demonstrates its
effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on the CIFAR-10-LT, STL-10-LT,
and SVHN-LT datasets across various settings. The code is available at

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a versatile scheme for optimizing the arrival

the importance of the definition of customer classes. In a second time, we
introduce balanced arrival control policies, which generalize the notion of
balanced arrival rates introduced in the context of Whittle networks, to the
much broader class of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We prove that

arrival-control policy preserves the quasi-reversibility, and we specify the
form of the stationary measures. We revisit two canonical examples of
quasi-reversible queueing systems, Whittle networks and order-independent
queues. Lastly, we focus on the problem of admission control and leverage our
results in the frameworks of optimization and reinforcement learning.

*Huishuai Zhang,Bohan Wang,Luoxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: AdamS是一种高效且简单的优化器，用于大型语言模型预训练和后训练，通过新颖的分母设计取代了Adam中的二阶矩估计，匹配SGD的内存和计算需求，同时提供更好的优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer目标的$(L_0, L_1)$平滑性特性，发现梯度大小可以通过动量大小近似，从而设计出更高效的优化器。

Method: 使用动量和当前梯度的加权平方和的平方根作为分母，无需二阶矩估计，直接继承AdamW的超参数，模型无关。

Result: 在GPT-2和Llama2（13B参数）预训练及后训练强化学习中表现优异，理论收敛性得到验证。

Conclusion: AdamS以其高效性、简单性和理论支持，成为现有优化器的有力替代。

Abstract: We introduce AdamS, a simple yet effective alternative to Adam for large
language model (LLM) pretraining and post-training. By leveraging a novel
denominator, i.e., the root of weighted sum of squares of the momentum and the
current gradient, AdamS eliminates the need for second-moment estimates. Hence,
AdamS is efficient, matching the memory and compute footprint of SGD with
momentum while delivering superior optimization performance. Moreover, AdamS is
easy to adopt: it can directly inherit hyperparameters of AdamW, and is
entirely model-agnostic, integrating seamlessly into existing pipelines without
modifications to optimizer APIs or architectures. The motivation behind AdamS
stems from the observed $(L_0, L_1)$ smoothness properties in transformer
objectives, where local smoothness is governed by gradient magnitudes that can
be further approximated by momentum magnitudes. We establish rigorous
theoretical convergence guarantees and provide practical guidelines for
hyperparameter selection. Empirically, AdamS demonstrates strong performance in
various tasks, including pre-training runs on GPT-2 and Llama2 (up to 13B
parameters) and reinforcement learning in post-training regimes. With its
efficiency, simplicity, and theoretical grounding, AdamS stands as a compelling
alternative to existing optimizers.

TLDR: CoCoGraph是一种协作约束图扩散模型，用于生成化学有效的分子，性能优于现有方法，且参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发新分子化合物对解决健康和环境问题至关重要，但分子空间探索困难。

Method: 采用协作约束图扩散模型（CoCoGraph），确保生成分子化学有效。

Result: CoCoGraph在标准基准测试中表现优异，生成分子分布更接近真实分子，并创建了820万合成分子数据库。

Conclusion: CoCoGraph高效且性能优越，但需进一步评估其潜在偏见和限制。

Abstract: Developing new molecular compounds is crucial to address pressing challenges,
from health to environmental sustainability. However, exploring the molecular
space to discover new molecules is difficult due to the vastness of the space.
Here we introduce CoCoGraph, a collaborative and constrained graph diffusion
model capable of generating molecules that are guaranteed to be chemically
valid. Thanks to the constraints built into the model and to the collaborative
mechanism, CoCoGraph outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard
benchmarks while requiring up to an order of magnitude fewer parameters.
Analysis of 36 chemical properties also demonstrates that CoCoGraph generates
molecules with distributions more closely matching real molecules than current
models. Leveraging the model's efficiency, we created a database of 8.2M
million synthetically generated molecules and conducted a Turing-like test with
organic chemistry experts to further assess the plausibility of the generated
molecules, and potential biases and limitations of CoCoGraph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL任务在可扩展性、可验证性和难度控制方面存在局限，难以有效提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 提出Saturn框架，基于SAT问题设计课程学习流程，实现任务构建、验证和难度控制。

Result: Saturn-1.5B和Saturn-7B在SAT、数学和编程任务上表现显著提升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Saturn框架有效提升了LLM的推理能力，为未来研究提供了数据和模型支持。

Abstract: How to design reinforcement learning (RL) tasks that effectively unleash the
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) remains an open question.
Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks)
suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability. They rely heavily on human
annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data. (2)
Verifiability. LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably. (3)
Controllable Difficulty. Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control,
making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard.
  To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework
that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLM
reasoning. Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification,
and precise difficulty control. Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline
that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks
of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard. To ensure stable
training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions.
  We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying
difficulty. It supports the evaluation of how LLM reasoning changes with
problem difficulty. We apply Saturn to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and obtain
Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B. We achieve several notable results: (1) On SAT
problems, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B achieve average pass@3 improvements of
+14.0 and +28.1, respectively. (2) On math and programming tasks, Saturn-1.5B
and Saturn-7B improve average scores by +4.9 and +1.8 on benchmarks (e.g.,
AIME, LiveCodeBench). (3) Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach in
constructing RL tasks, Saturn achieves further improvements of +8.8%. We
release the source code, data, and models to support future research.

TLDR: Omni TM-AE是一种新型嵌入模型，通过利用Tsetlin Machine的状态矩阵信息，实现了可重用和可解释的嵌入，性能优于主流模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型的可解释性和可重用性问题，同时避免传统嵌入模型的黑盒特性。

Method: 提出Omni TM-AE，利用Tsetlin Machine的状态矩阵信息（包括之前被排除的文字），通过单次训练构建可解释嵌入。

Result: 在语义相似性、情感分类和文档聚类任务中，Omni TM-AE表现优于主流嵌入模型。

Conclusion: Omni TM-AE证明了在现代NLP系统中，性能、可扩展性和可解释性可以兼顾。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large-scale language models has amplified
concerns regarding their interpretability and reusability. While traditional
embedding models like Word2Vec and GloVe offer scalability, they lack
transparency and often behave as black boxes. Conversely, interpretable models
such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) have shown promise in constructing explainable
learning systems, though they previously faced limitations in scalability and
reusability. In this paper, we introduce Omni Tsetlin Machine AutoEncoder (Omni
TM-AE), a novel embedding model that fully exploits the information contained
in the TM's state matrix, including literals previously excluded from clause
formation. This method enables the construction of reusable, interpretable
embeddings through a single training phase. Extensive experiments across
semantic similarity, sentiment classification, and document clustering tasks
show that Omni TM-AE performs competitively with and often surpasses mainstream
embedding models. These results demonstrate that it is possible to balance
performance, scalability, and interpretability in modern Natural Language
Processing (NLP) systems without resorting to opaque architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模强化学习在推理任务中取得进展，但训练高性能模型的细节常被忽略，且蒸馏方法对小型模型更有效。本研究旨在探索RL如何提升中小型模型的推理能力。

Method: 采用分阶段RL训练：先数学提示训练，后代码提示训练，并开发数据筛选流程收集高质量提示和测试用例。

Result: 数学提示训练显著提升数学和代码任务性能（如AIME 2025提升14.6%/17.2%），代码提示训练进一步优化代码任务表现。

Conclusion: RL不仅激发模型的预训练和微调能力，还能突破其推理极限，解决此前无法解决的问题。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for
reasoning, the training recipe for building high-performing reasoning models
remains elusive. Key implementation details of frontier models, such as
DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are
often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more
effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that
large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong,
small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of
state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL
training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective
approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts.
Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the
performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% /
+17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks
(e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition,
extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks
with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data
curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable
answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains.
Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning
with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of
on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational
reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning
(e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning
ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.

TLDR: 论文提出Divide-Fuse-Conquer框架，通过分组训练和参数融合提升多场景强化学习的泛化能力，实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多场景游戏中，规则和环境的多样性导致强化学习模型难以泛化，直接组合训练会引发不稳定和性能下降。

Method: Divide-Fuse-Conquer框架：1) 分组游戏；2) 训练专用模型；3) 融合参数并继续训练。

Result: 在18个TextArena游戏中，Qwen2.5-32B-Align模型性能接近Claude3.5，取得7胜4平。

Conclusion: 该框架为提升LLMs在多场景强化学习中的泛化能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been observed to suddenly exhibit advanced
reasoning abilities during reinforcement learning (RL), resembling an ``aha
moment'' triggered by simple outcome-based rewards. While RL has proven
effective in eliciting such breakthroughs in tasks involving mathematics,
coding, and vision, it faces significant challenges in multi-scenario games.
The diversity of game rules, interaction modes, and environmental complexities
often leads to policies that perform well in one scenario but fail to
generalize to others. Simply combining multiple scenarios during training
introduces additional challenges, such as training instability and poor
performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Divide-Fuse-Conquer, a
framework designed to enhance generalization in multi-scenario RL. This
approach starts by heuristically grouping games based on characteristics such
as rules and difficulties. Specialized models are then trained for each group
to excel at games in the group is what we refer to as the divide step. Next, we
fuse model parameters from different groups as a new model, and continue
training it for multiple groups, until the scenarios in all groups are
conquered. Experiments across 18 TextArena games show that Qwen2.5-32B-Align
trained with the Divide-Fuse-Conquer strategy reaches a performance level
comparable to Claude3.5, achieving 7 wins and 4 draws. We hope our approach can
inspire future research on using reinforcement learning to improve the
generalization of LLMs.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为FedSA的新型联邦学习攻击方法，通过滑动模式控制理论精确控制中毒程度，实现预定义目标（如降低全局模型准确率10%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数中毒攻击旨在引发拒绝服务问题，而FedSA旨在以隐蔽且可控的方式精确引入中毒，填补了这一研究空白。

Method: FedSA结合了非线性控制理论（滑动模式控制）与模型中毒攻击，通过操纵恶意客户端的更新，以可控且隐蔽的速度将全局模型推向受损状态。

Result: 实验表明，FedSA能以较少的恶意客户端准确实现预定义的全局准确率，同时保持高隐蔽性和可调学习率。

Conclusion: FedSA为联邦学习中的中毒攻击提供了一种精确可控的新方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Manipulation of local training data and local updates, i.e., the poisoning
attack, is the main threat arising from the collaborative nature of the
federated learning (FL) paradigm. Most existing poisoning attacks aim to
manipulate local data/models in a way that causes denial-of-service (DoS)
issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack method, named Federated
Learning Sliding Attack (FedSA) scheme, aiming at precisely introducing the
extent of poisoning in a subtle controlled manner. It operates with a
predefined objective, such as reducing global model's prediction accuracy by
10\%. FedSA integrates robust nonlinear control-Sliding Mode Control (SMC)
theory with model poisoning attacks. It can manipulate the updates from
malicious clients to drive the global model towards a compromised state,
achieving this at a controlled and inconspicuous rate. Additionally, leveraging
the robust control properties of FedSA allows precise control over the
convergence bounds, enabling the attacker to set the global accuracy of the
poisoned model to any desired level. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedSA can accurately achieve a predefined global accuracy with fewer malicious
clients while maintaining a high level of stealth and adjustable learning
rates.

TLDR: 提出了一种隐式越狱框架IJA，通过隐写术将恶意指令嵌入图像，并结合看似无害的文本提示，成功攻击多模态大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的跨模态推理能力强大，但扩展的输入空间引入了新的攻击面。传统的显式攻击容易被检测和拦截，因此需要更隐蔽的攻击方式。

Method: 使用最低有效位隐写术将恶意指令嵌入图像，结合无害文本提示；通过对抗后缀和模板优化模块增强攻击效果。

Result: 在GPT-4o和Gemini-1.5 Pro等商业模型上，平均仅需3次查询即可实现超过90%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: IJA框架展示了隐式攻击的高效性和隐蔽性，对MLLMs的安全性提出了新的挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable powerful cross-modal
reasoning capabilities. However, the expanded input space introduces new attack
surfaces. Previous jailbreak attacks often inject malicious instructions from
text into less aligned modalities, such as vision. As MLLMs increasingly
incorporate cross-modal consistency and alignment mechanisms, such explicit
attacks become easier to detect and block. In this work, we propose a novel
implicit jailbreak framework termed IJA that stealthily embeds malicious
instructions into images via least significant bit steganography and couples
them with seemingly benign, image-related textual prompts. To further enhance
attack effectiveness across diverse MLLMs, we incorporate adversarial suffixes
generated by a surrogate model and introduce a template optimization module
that iteratively refines both the prompt and embedding based on model feedback.
On commercial models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Pro, our method achieves attack
success rates of over 90% using an average of only 3 queries.

Motivation: 标准GPVAE在大规模数据上计算成本过高，现有方法通常依赖限制性核假设或大量诱导点，限制了模型的灵活性和效率。

Method: 采用邻居驱动的近似策略，通过计算每个数据点的最近邻来保留潜在依赖关系，减少对诱导点的需求。

Result: 在表示学习、数据插补和条件生成等任务中，该方法在预测性能和计算效率上优于其他GPVAE变体。

Conclusion: 该方法通过局部邻接关系实现了高效的GPVAE推理，同时保持了模型的灵活性。

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) extend standard VAEs by
replacing the fully factorised Gaussian prior with a GP prior, thereby
capturing richer correlations among latent variables. However, performing exact
GP inference in large-scale GPVAEs is computationally prohibitive, often
forcing existing approaches to rely on restrictive kernel assumptions or large
sets of inducing points. In this work, we propose a neighbour-driven
approximation strategy that exploits local adjacencies in the latent space to
achieve scalable GPVAE inference. By confining computations to the nearest
neighbours of each data point, our method preserves essential latent
dependencies, allowing more flexible kernel choices and mitigating the need for
numerous inducing points. Through extensive experiments on tasks including
representation learning, data imputation, and conditional generation, we
demonstrate that our approach outperforms other GPVAE variants in both
predictive performance and computational efficiency.

Result: 在合成数据上表现优于基线（主题纯度、NMI、JSD），并在YouTube评论案例中成功识别心理健康内容。

Conclusion: 该方法无需专家预定义主题划分，能有效发现少数主题，适用于领域相关内容的分析。

Abstract: Topic models often fail to capture low-prevalence, domain-critical themes,
so-called minority topics, such as mental health themes in online comments.
While some existing methods can incorporate domain knowledge, such as expected
topical content, methods allowing guidance may require overly detailed expected
topics, hindering the discovery of topic divisions and variation. We propose a
topic modeling solution via a specially constrained NMF. We incorporate a seed
word list characterizing minority content of interest, but we do not require
experts to pre-specify their division across minority topics. Through
prevalence constraints on minority topics and seed word content across topics,
we learn distinct data-driven minority topics as well as majority topics. The
constrained NMF is fitted via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with
multiplicative updates. We outperform several baselines on synthetic data in
terms of topic purity, normalized mutual information, and also evaluate topic
quality using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD). We conduct a case study on
YouTube vlog comments, analyzing viewer discussion of mental health content;
our model successfully identifies and reveals this domain-relevant minority
content.

Result: 算法在广泛分类规则和下游应用中有效，但证明同时实现准确分类率和最优损失最小化在某些情况下计算不可行。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在公平性目标下，需要在两种自然且可实现的准确性概念之间做出选择。

Abstract: We revisit the foundations of fairness and its interplay with utility and
efficiency in settings where the training data contain richer labels, such as
individual types, rankings, or risk estimates, rather than just binary
outcomes. In this context, we propose algorithms that achieve stronger notions
of evidence-based fairness than are possible in standard supervised learning.
Our methods support classification and ranking techniques that preserve
accurate subpopulation classification rates, as suggested by the underlying
data distributions, across a broad class of classification rules and downstream
applications. Furthermore, our predictors enable loss minimization, whether
aimed at maximizing utility or in the service of fair treatment.
  Complementing our algorithmic contributions, we present impossibility results
demonstrating that simultaneously achieving accurate classification rates and
optimal loss minimization is, in some cases, computationally infeasible. Unlike
prior impossibility results, our notions are not inherently in conflict and are
simultaneously satisfied by the Bayes-optimal predictor. Furthermore, we show
that each notion can be satisfied individually via efficient learning. Our
separation thus stems from the computational hardness of learning a
sufficiently good approximation of the Bayes-optimal predictor. These
computational impossibilities present a choice between two natural and
attainable notions of accuracy that could both be motivated by fairness.

Conclusion: PKeX-Shapley为核方法提供了高效且可解释的Shapley值计算框架，拓展了可解释统计推断的工具。

Abstract: Kernel methods are widely used in machine learning due to their flexibility
and expressive power. However, their black-box nature poses significant
challenges to interpretability, limiting their adoption in high-stakes
applications. Shapley value-based feature attribution techniques, such as SHAP
and kernel-specific variants like RKHS-SHAP, offer a promising path toward
explainability. Yet, computing exact Shapley values remains computationally
intractable in general, motivating the development of various approximation
schemes. In this work, we introduce PKeX-Shapley, a novel algorithm that
utilizes the multiplicative structure of product kernels to enable the exact
computation of Shapley values in polynomial time. We show that product-kernel
models admit a functional decomposition that allows for a recursive formulation
of Shapley values. This decomposition not only yields computational efficiency
but also enhances interpretability in kernel-based learning. We also
demonstrate how our framework can be generalized to explain kernel-based
statistical discrepancies such as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), thus offering new tools for
interpretable statistical inference.

Result: 在六个真实数据集上，GRDM在多跳表间相关性建模和单表保真度指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GRDM是一种更灵活、高效的关系数据库生成方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Building generative models for relational databases (RDBs) is important for
applications like privacy-preserving data release and augmenting real datasets.
However, most prior work either focuses on single-table generation or relies on
autoregressive factorizations that impose a fixed table order and generate
tables sequentially. This approach limits parallelism, restricts flexibility in
downstream applications like missing value imputation, and compounds errors due
to commonly made conditional independence assumptions. We propose a
fundamentally different approach: jointly modeling all tables in an RDB without
imposing any order. By using a natural graph representation of RDBs, we propose
the Graph-Conditional Relational Diffusion Model (GRDM). GRDM leverages a graph
neural network to jointly denoise row attributes and capture complex
inter-table dependencies. Extensive experiments on six real-world RDBs
demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms autoregressive
baselines in modeling multi-hop inter-table correlations and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on single-table fidelity metrics.

Abstract: Adaptation of foundation models using low-rank methods is a widespread
approach. Another way to adapt these models is to employ orthogonal fine-tuning
methods, which are less time and memory efficient despite their good
generalization properties. In this work, we propose Householder Orthogonal
Fine-tuning (HOFT), a novel orthogonal fine-tuning method that aims to
alleviate time and space complexity. Moreover, some theoretical properties of
the orthogonal fine-tuning paradigm are explored. From this exploration, Scaled
Householder Orthogonal Fine-tuning (SHOFT) is proposed. Both HOFT and SHOFT are

Abstract: We address the problem of incremental sequence classification, where
predictions are updated as new elements in the sequence are revealed. Drawing
on temporal-difference learning from reinforcement learning, we identify a
temporal-consistency condition that successive predictions should satisfy. We
leverage this condition to develop a novel loss function for training
incremental sequence classifiers. Through a concrete example, we demonstrate
that optimizing this loss can offer substantial gains in data efficiency. We
apply our method to text classification tasks and show that it improves
predictive accuracy over competing approaches on several benchmark datasets. We
further evaluate our approach on the task of verifying large language model
generations for correctness in grade-school math problems. Our results show
that models trained with our method are better able to distinguish promising

Abstract: The machine learning methods for data-driven identification of partial
differential equations (PDEs) are typically defined for a given number of
spatial dimensions and a choice of coordinates the data have been collected in.
This dependence prevents the learned evolution equation from generalizing to
other spaces. In this work, we reformulate the problem in terms of coordinate-
and dimension-independent representations, paving the way toward what we call
``spatially liberated" PDE learning. To this end, we employ a machine learning
approach to predict the evolution of scalar field systems expressed in the
formalism of exterior calculus, which is coordinate-free and immediately
generalizes to arbitrary dimensions by construction. We demonstrate the
performance of this approach in the FitzHugh-Nagumo and Barkley
reaction-diffusion models, as well as the Patlak-Keller-Segel model informed by
in-situ chemotactic bacteria observations. We provide extensive numerical
experiments that demonstrate that our approach allows for seamless transitions
across various spatial contexts. We show that the field dynamics learned in one
space can be used to make accurate predictions in other spaces with different
dimensions, coordinate systems, boundary conditions, and curvatures.

Motivation: 边缘设备上的机器学习模型训练需求增加，但当前方法存在数据利用率低、训练吞吐量不足等问题，亟需一种高效的数据选择策略。

Method: Titan采用两阶段数据选择框架：粗粒度筛选候选数据集，细粒度选择最优数据批次；同时通过流水线技术并行执行数据选择和模型训练，利用空闲计算资源。

Conclusion: Titan框架有效解决了边缘设备上数据利用率低的问题，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: The demand for machine learning (ML) model training on edge devices is
escalating due to data privacy and personalized service needs. However, we
observe that current on-device model training is hampered by the
under-utilization of on-device data, due to low training throughput, limited
storage and diverse data importance. To improve data resource utilization, we
propose a two-stage data selection framework {\sf Titan} to select the most
important data batch from streaming data for model training with guaranteed
efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically, in the first stage, {\sf Titan}
filters out a candidate dataset with potentially high importance in a
coarse-grained manner.In the second stage of fine-grained selection, we propose
a theoretically optimal data selection strategy to identify the data batch with
the highest model performance improvement to current training round. To further
enhance time-and-resource efficiency, {\sf Titan} leverages a pipeline to
co-execute data selection and model training, and avoids resource conflicts by
exploiting idle computing resources. We evaluate {\sf Titan} on real-world edge
devices and three representative edge computing tasks with diverse models and
data modalities. Empirical results demonstrate that {\sf Titan} achieves up to
$43\%$ reduction in training time and $6.2\%$ increase in final accuracy with
minor system overhead, such as data processing delay, memory footprint and
energy consumption.

Abstract: The growing complexity of power systems has made accurate load forecasting
more important than ever. An increasing number of advanced load forecasting
methods have been developed. However, the static design of current methods
offers no mechanism for human-model interaction. As the primary users of
forecasting models, system operators often find it difficult to understand and
apply these advanced models, which typically requires expertise in artificial
intelligence (AI). This also prevents them from incorporating their experience
and real-world contextual understanding into the forecasting process. Recent
breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) offer a new opportunity to
address this issue. By leveraging their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent collaboration
framework to bridge the gap between human operators and forecasting models. A
set of specialized agents is designed to perform different tasks in the
forecasting workflow and collaborate via a dedicated communication mechanism.
This framework embeds interactive mechanisms throughout the load forecasting
pipeline, reducing the technical threshold for non-expert users and enabling
the integration of human experience. Our experiments demonstrate that the
interactive load forecasting accuracy can be significantly improved when users
provide proper insight in key stages. Our cost analysis shows that the
framework remains affordable, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 策略蒸馏结合多样化数据集能显著提升零样本策略迁移的泛化能力。

Abstract: In the zero-shot policy transfer setting in reinforcement learning, the goal
is to train an agent on a fixed set of training environments so that it can
generalise to similar, but unseen, testing environments. Previous work has
shown that policy distillation after training can sometimes produce a policy
that outperforms the original in the testing environments. However, it is not
yet entirely clear why that is, or what data should be used to distil the
policy. In this paper, we prove, under certain assumptions, a generalisation
bound for policy distillation after training. The theory provides two practical
insights: for improved generalisation, you should 1) train an ensemble of
distilled policies, and 2) distil it on as much data from the training
environments as possible. We empirically verify that these insights hold in
more general settings, when the assumptions required for the theory no longer
hold. Finally, we demonstrate that an ensemble of policies distilled on a
diverse dataset can generalise significantly better than the original agent.

Motivation: 探索如何利用p-CFEs改进分类器的性能，尤其是在减少偏见方面的潜力。

Method: 使用p-CFEs及其诱导的错误目标类别训练分类器，并评估其对原始标签的分类效果。

Result: 分类器不仅保持了高准确率，还显著减少了与虚假相关的偏见。

Conclusion: p-CFEs是一种有效的训练方法，能够提升分类器性能并减少偏见。

Abstract: Plausible counterfactual explanations (p-CFEs) are perturbations that
minimally modify inputs to change classifier decisions while remaining
plausible under the data distribution. In this study, we demonstrate that
classifiers can be trained on p-CFEs labeled with induced \emph{incorrect}
target classes to classify unperturbed inputs with the original labels. While
previous studies have shown that such learning is possible with adversarial
perturbations, we extend this paradigm to p-CFEs. Interestingly, our
experiments reveal that learning from p-CFEs is even more effective: the
resulting classifiers achieve not only high in-distribution accuracy but also
exhibit significantly reduced bias with respect to spurious correlations.

Abstract: Causal discovery for dynamical systems poses a major challenge in fields
where active interventions are infeasible. Most methods used to investigate
these systems and their associated benchmarks are tailored to deterministic,
low-dimensional and weakly nonlinear time-series data. To address these
limitations, we present CausalDynamics, a large-scale benchmark and extensible
data generation framework to advance the structural discovery of dynamical
causal models. Our benchmark consists of true causal graphs derived from
thousands of coupled ordinary and stochastic differential equations as well as
two idealized climate models. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms for graph reconstruction on
systems with noisy, confounded, and lagged dynamics. CausalDynamics consists of
a plug-and-play, build-your-own coupling workflow that enables the construction
of a hierarchy of physical systems. We anticipate that our framework will
facilitate the development of robust causal discovery algorithms that are
broadly applicable across domains while addressing their unique challenges. We
provide a user-friendly implementation and documentation on

Method: 引入潜在校准概念，并提出潜在重新校准（LR）方法，通过学习潜在空间的变换来改进校准。

Result: 实验表明，LR显著降低了潜在校准误差和负对数似然。

Conclusion: LR是一种高效且有效的多元模型校准方法，能够提供显式的多元密度函数。

Abstract: Reliably characterizing the full conditional distribution of a multivariate
response variable given a set of covariates is crucial for trustworthy
decision-making. However, misspecified or miscalibrated multivariate models may
yield a poor approximation of the joint distribution of the response variables,
leading to unreliable predictions and suboptimal decisions. Furthermore,
standard recalibration methods are primarily limited to univariate settings,
while conformal prediction techniques, despite generating multivariate
prediction regions with coverage guarantees, do not provide a full probability
density function. We address this gap by first introducing a novel notion of
latent calibration, which assesses probabilistic calibration in the latent
space of a conditional normalizing flow. Second, we propose latent
recalibration (LR), a novel post-hoc model recalibration method that learns a
transformation of the latent space with finite-sample bounds on latent
calibration. Unlike existing methods, LR produces a recalibrated distribution
with an explicit multivariate density function while remaining computationally
efficient. Extensive experiments on both tabular and image datasets show that
LR consistently improves latent calibration error and the negative
log-likelihood of the recalibrated models.

Motivation: 探讨 FtU 是否能在避免歧视的同时保持预测准确性，反驳其普遍被认为无效的观点。

Result: FtU 能减少歧视且不损害准确性，实际应用中可促进更公平的政策。

Conclusion: FtU 在高风险场景中值得考虑，使用受保护属性需明确理由。

Abstract: Fairness through Unawareness (FtU) describes the idea that discrimination
against demographic groups can be avoided by not considering group membership
in the decisions or predictions. This idea has long been criticized in the
machine learning literature as not being sufficient to ensure fairness. In
addition, the use of additional features is typically thought to increase the
accuracy of the predictions for all groups, so that FtU is sometimes thought to
be detrimental to all groups. In this paper, we show both theoretically and
empirically that FtU can reduce algorithmic discrimination without necessarily
reducing accuracy. We connect this insight with the literature on Model
Multiplicity, to which we contribute with novel theoretical and empirical
results. Furthermore, we illustrate how, in a real-life application, FtU can
contribute to the deployment of more equitable policies without losing
efficacy. Our findings suggest that FtU is worth considering in practical
applications, particularly in high-risk scenarios, and that the use of
protected attributes such as gender in predictive models should be accompanied
by a clear and well-founded justification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于能量学习的“goodness”函数忽略了神经元间的相关性，提出新方法以更生物合理的方式训练网络。

Method: 使用有效维度（ED）作为“goodness”函数，最小化噪声输入时的ED，同时最大化样本分布中的ED，无需负样本。

Result: 新方法在非反向传播方法中表现优异，噪声能增强泛化和推理能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为生物合理学习算法和神经形态计算提供了新思路，噪声成为计算资源而非干扰。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm provides a bottom-up alternative to
backpropagation (BP) for training neural networks, relying on a layer-wise
"goodness" function to guide learning. Existing goodness functions, inspired by
energy-based learning (EBL), are typically defined as the sum of squared
post-synaptic activations, neglecting the correlations between neurons. In this
work, we propose a novel goodness function termed dimensionality compression
that uses the effective dimensionality (ED) of fluctuating neural responses to
incorporate second-order statistical structure. Our objective minimizes ED for
clamped inputs when noise is considered while maximizing it across the sample
distribution, promoting structured representations without the need to prepare
negative samples. We demonstrate that this formulation achieves competitive
performance compared to other non-BP methods. Moreover, we show that noise
plays a constructive role that can enhance generalization and improve inference
when predictions are derived from the mean of squared outputs, which is
equivalent to making predictions based on the energy term. Our findings
contribute to the development of more biologically plausible learning
algorithms and suggest a natural fit for neuromorphic computing, where
stochasticity is a computational resource rather than a nuisance. The code is

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is essential for
enabling timely maintenance of lithium-ion batteries, impacting the operational
efficiency of electric applications that rely on them. This paper proposes a
RUL prediction approach that leverages data from recent charge-discharge cycles
to estimate the number of remaining usable cycles. The approach introduces both
a novel signal processing pipeline and a deep learning prediction model. In the
signal preprocessing pipeline, a derived capacity feature is computed based on
current and capacity signals. Alongside original capacity, voltage and current,
these features are denoised and enhanced using statistical metrics and a
delta-based method to capture differences between the current and previous
cycles. In the prediction model, the processed features are then fed into a
hybrid deep learning architecture composed of 1D Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN), Attentional Long Short-Term Memory (A-LSTM), and Ordinary Differential
Equation-based LSTM (ODE-LSTM) modules. This architecture is designed to
capture both local signal characteristics and long-range temporal dependencies
while modeling the continuous-time dynamics of battery degradation. The model
is further evaluated using transfer learning across different learning
strategies and target data partitioning scenarios. Results indicate that the
model maintains robust performance, even when fine-tuned on limited target
data. Experimental results on two publicly available large-scale datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a baseline deep learning
approach and machine learning techniques, achieving an RMSE of 101.59,
highlighting its strong potential for real-world RUL prediction applications.

Abstract: Blockchain transaction data exhibits high dimensionality, noise, and

analysis of three clustering approaches: (1) Classical K-Means Clustering,
applied to pre-processed feature representations; (2) Hybrid Clustering,
wherein classical features are enhanced with quantum random features extracted
using randomly initialized quantum neural networks (QNNs); and (3) Fully
Quantum Clustering, where a QNN is trained in a self-supervised manner
leveraging a SwAV-based loss function to optimize the feature space for
clustering directly. The proposed experimental framework systematically
investigates the impact of quantum circuit depth and the number of learned
prototypes, demonstrating that even shallow quantum circuits can effectively
extract meaningful non-linear representations, significantly improving
clustering performance.

Result: 理论分析证明了潜在变量模型的可识别性，实验验证了采样策略在多种OOD任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过PID和批量采样策略，可以有效提升SSL模型的OOD泛化能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of
self-supervised learning (SSL). By analyzing the mini-batch construction during
the SSL training phase, we first give one plausible explanation for SSL having
OOD generalization. Then, from the perspective of data generation and causal
inference, we analyze and conclude that SSL learns spurious correlations during
the training process, which leads to a reduction in OOD generalization. To
address this issue, we propose a post-intervention distribution (PID) grounded
in the Structural Causal Model. PID offers a scenario where the spurious
variable and label variable is mutually independent. Besides, we demonstrate
that if each mini-batch during SSL training satisfies PID, the resulting SSL
model can achieve optimal worst-case OOD performance. This motivates us to
develop a batch sampling strategy that enforces PID constraints through the
learning of a latent variable model. Through theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate the identifiability of the latent variable model and validate the
effectiveness of the proposed sampling strategy. Experiments conducted on
various downstream OOD tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
sampling strategy.

Abstract: Sequencing a genome to determine an individual's DNA produces an enormous
number of short nucleotide subsequences known as reads, which must be
reassembled to reconstruct the full genome. We present a method for analyzing
this type of data using contrastive learning, in which an encoder model is
trained to produce embeddings that cluster together sequences from the same
genomic region. The sequential nature of genomic regions is preserved in the
form of trajectories through this embedding space. Trained solely to reflect
the structure of the genome, the resulting model provides a general
representation of $k$-mer sequences, suitable for a range of downstream tasks
involving read data. We apply our framework to learn the structure of the $E.\
coli$ genome, and demonstrate its use in simulated ancient DNA (aDNA) read
mapping and identification of structural variations. Furthermore, we illustrate
the potential of using this type of model for metagenomic species
identification. We show how incorporating a domain-specific noise model can
enhance embedding robustness, and how a supervised contrastive learning setting
can be adopted when a linear reference genome is available, by introducing a
distance thresholding parameter $\Gamma$. The model can also be trained fully
self-supervised on read data, enabling analysis without the need to construct a
full genome assembly using specialized algorithms. Small prediction heads based
on a pre-trained embedding are shown to perform on par with BWA-aln, the
current gold standard approach for aDNA mapping, in terms of accuracy and
runtime for short genomes. Given the method's favorable scaling properties with
respect to total genome size, inference using our approach is highly promising
for metagenomic applications and for mapping to genomes comparable in size to
the human genome.

Abstract: Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained
language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks.
While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language
models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to
both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical
applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled
data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose
Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to
optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence
calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by
prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their
confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence
underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a
larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by
selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively
decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an
overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples,
improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and
API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.

Conclusion: 锐度感知训练和基于不确定性的修正为CBMs在噪声环境下保持可解释性和鲁棒性提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) ensure interpretability by decomposing
predictions into human interpretable concepts. Yet the annotations used for
training CBMs that enable this transparency are often noisy, and the impact of
such corruption is not well understood. In this study, we present the first
systematic study of noise in CBMs and show that even moderate corruption
simultaneously impairs prediction performance, interpretability, and the
intervention effectiveness. Our analysis identifies a susceptible subset of
concepts whose accuracy declines far more than the average gap between noisy
and clean supervision and whose corruption accounts for most performance loss.
To mitigate this vulnerability we propose a two-stage framework. During
training, sharpness-aware minimization stabilizes the learning of
noise-sensitive concepts. During inference, where clean labels are unavailable,
we rank concepts by predictive entropy and correct only the most uncertain
ones, using uncertainty as a proxy for susceptibility. Theoretical analysis and
extensive ablations elucidate why sharpness-aware training confers robustness
and why uncertainty reliably identifies susceptible concepts, providing a
principled basis that preserves both interpretability and resilience in the
presence of noise.

Chunk-wise Optimization} (SeCO), a memory-efficient training paradigm that
partitions lengthy inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk independently
constructs its computational graph and performs localized backpropagation,
ensuring that only one chunk's forward activations are stored in memory.
Building on SeCO, we further introduce \textit{Sparse Chunk-wise Optimization}
(SpaCO), which reduces computational overhead by selectively propagating
gradients to specific chunks and incorporates a carefully designed compensation
factor to ensure unbiased gradient estimation. SpaCO decouples the
computational cost of backpropagation from the context length, enabling
training time to gradually converge to inference time as sequences become
longer. Implemented as lightweight training wrappers, both SeCO and SpaCO offer
substantial practical benefits. For example, when fine-tuning an 8B model with
LoRA on a single RTX 3090 GPU, SeCO expands maximum sequence length from 1K to
16K tokens, while SpaCO demonstrates accelerated training speed -- achieving up
to 3x faster than SeCO under the same experimental setup. These innovations
provide new insights into optimizing long-context models, making them more
accessible for practical applications. We have open-sourced the code at

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale pre-trained Electroencephalogram (EEG) models
have shown great promise, driving progress in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)
and healthcare applications. However, despite their success, many existing
pre-trained models have struggled to fully capture the rich information content

frequently rooted in suboptimal architectural design choices which constrain
their representational capacity. In this work, we introduce LaBraM++, an
enhanced Large Brainwave Foundation Model (LBM) that incorporates principled
improvements grounded in robust signal processing foundations. LaBraM++
demonstrates substantial gains across a variety of tasks, consistently
outperforming its originally-based architecture and achieving competitive

Abstract: Datasets in engineering domains are often small, sparsely labeled, and
contain numerical as well as categorical conditions. Additionally.
computational resources are typically limited in practical applications which
hinders the adoption of generative models for engineering tasks. We introduce a
novel masked-conditioning approach, that enables generative models to work with
sparse, mixed-type data. We mask conditions during training to simulate sparse
conditions at inference time. For this purpose, we explore the use of various
sparsity schedules that show different strengths and weaknesses. In addition,
we introduce a flexible embedding that deals with categorical as well as
numerical conditions. We integrate our method into an efficient variational
autoencoder as well as a latent diffusion model and demonstrate the
applicability of our approach on two engineering-related datasets of 2D point
clouds and images. Finally, we show that small models trained on limited data
can be coupled with large pretrained foundation models to improve generation
quality while retaining the controllability induced by our conditioning scheme.

Result: 在标准连续POMDP基准测试中，该方法优于现有方法，尤其在不确定性下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架无需额外探索奖励或启发式设计，能有效处理部分可观测环境中的决策问题。

Abstract: Optimal decision-making under partial observability requires agents to
balance reducing uncertainty (exploration) against pursuing immediate
objectives (exploitation). In this paper, we introduce a novel policy
optimization framework for continuous partially observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs) that explicitly addresses this challenge. Our method casts
policy learning as probabilistic inference in a non-Markovian Feynman--Kac
model that inherently captures the value of information gathering by
anticipating future observations, without requiring extrinsic exploration
bonuses or handcrafted heuristics. To optimize policies under this model, we
develop a nested sequential Monte Carlo~(SMC) algorithm that efficiently
estimates a history-dependent policy gradient under samples from the optimal
trajectory distribution induced by the POMDP. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our algorithm across standard continuous POMDP benchmarks, where existing
methods struggle to act under uncertainty.

Abstract: This work presents a forward-only diffusion (FoD) approach for generative
modelling. In contrast to traditional diffusion models that rely on a coupled
forward-backward diffusion scheme, FoD directly learns data generation through
a single forward diffusion process, yielding a simple yet efficient generative
framework. The core of FoD is a state-dependent linear stochastic differential
equation that involves a mean-reverting term in both the drift and diffusion
functions. This mean-reversion property guarantees the convergence to clean
data, naturally simulating a stochastic interpolation between source and target
distributions. More importantly, FoD is analytically tractable and is trained
using a simple stochastic flow matching objective, enabling a few-step
non-Markov chain sampling during inference. The proposed FoD model, despite its
simplicity, achieves competitive performance on various image-conditioned
(e.g., image restoration) and unconditional generation tasks, demonstrating its
effectiveness in generative modelling. Our code is available at

Result: 在模拟机器人环境中，方法生成了周期性且可压缩的轨迹，表现出更强的鲁棒性和性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过促进简单行为，方法在保持任务性能的同时提高了鲁棒性和泛化性。

Abstract: Simplicity is a powerful inductive bias. In reinforcement learning,
regularization is used for simpler policies, data augmentation for simpler
representations, and sparse reward functions for simpler objectives, all that,
with the underlying motivation to increase generalizability and robustness by
focusing on the essentials. Supplementary to these techniques, we investigate
how to promote simple behavior throughout the episode. To that end, we
introduce a modification of the reinforcement learning problem that
additionally maximizes the total correlation within the induced trajectories.
We propose a practical algorithm that optimizes all models, including policy
and state representation, based on a lower-bound approximation. In simulated
robot environments, our method naturally generates policies that induce
periodic and compressible trajectories, and that exhibit superior robustness to
noise and changes in dynamics compared to baseline methods, while also
improving performance in the original tasks.

TLDR: 论文探讨了图神经网络（GNNs）中的过平滑问题，特别是从优化角度分析了反向过平滑现象及其对梯度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs在实践中难以避免过平滑问题，尤其是当权重较大时，理论上可以避免过平滑，但实际并未发生，因此需要从优化角度深入研究。

Method: 通过分析反向传播中的过平滑现象，研究了前向与反向平滑的相互作用，并证明了GNNs中存在大量虚假平稳点。

Result: 研究表明，反向过平滑导致梯度接近零而损失仍然较高，且这种现象在深层GNNs中尤为显著。

Conclusion: 论文为理解GNNs特有的优化问题提供了新的视角，揭示了反向过平滑的重要性及其对训练的影响。

Abstract: Oversmoothing has long been identified as a major limitation of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs): input node features are smoothed at each layer and converge to
a non-informative representation, if the weights of the GNN are sufficiently
bounded. This assumption is crucial: if, on the contrary, the weights are
sufficiently large, then oversmoothing may not happen. Theoretically, GNN could
thus learn to not oversmooth. However it does not really happen in practice,
which prompts us to examine oversmoothing from an optimization point of view.
In this paper, we analyze backward oversmoothing, that is, the notion that
backpropagated errors used to compute gradients are also subject to
oversmoothing from output to input. With non-linear activation functions, we
outline the key role of the interaction between forward and backward smoothing.
Moreover, we show that, due to backward oversmoothing, GNNs provably exhibit
many spurious stationary points: as soon as the last layer is trained, the
whole GNN is at a stationary point. As a result, we can exhibit regions where
gradients are near-zero while the loss stays high. The proof relies on the fact
that, unlike forward oversmoothing, backward errors are subjected to a linear
oversmoothing even in the presence of non-linear activation function, such that
the average of the output error plays a key role. Additionally, we show that
this phenomenon is specific to deep GNNs, and exhibit counter-example
Multi-Layer Perceptron. This paper is a step toward a more complete
comprehension of the optimization landscape specific to GNNs.

Method: 采用基于模型的元学习方法，结合最小注意力原则，通过集成模型学习和梯度元策略学习交替进行。

Result: 实验表明，最小注意力在快速适应和方差减少上优于现有RL算法，同时提高了能量效率。

Conclusion: 最小注意力原则在RL中具有潜力，尤其在快速适应和稳定性方面表现突出。

Abstract: Minimum attention applies the least action principle in the changes of
control concerning state and time, first proposed by Brockett. The involved
regularization is highly relevant in emulating biological control, such as
motor learning. We apply minimum attention in reinforcement learning (RL) as
part of the rewards and investigate its connection to meta-learning and
stabilization. Specifically, model-based meta-learning with minimum attention
is explored in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics. Ensemble-based model
learning and gradient-based meta-policy learning are alternately performed.
Empirically, we show that the minimum attention does show outperforming
competence in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms in model-free and
model-based RL, i.e., fast adaptation in few shots and variance reduction from
the perturbations of the model and environment. Furthermore, the minimum
attention demonstrates the improvement in energy efficiency.

Conclusion: PyTupli填补了离线RL数据集管理的空白，促进了研究的协作性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has gained traction as a powerful
paradigm for learning control policies from pre-collected data, eliminating the
need for costly or risky online interactions. While many open-source libraries
offer robust implementations of offline RL algorithms, they all rely on
datasets composed of experience tuples consisting of state, action, next state,
and reward. Managing, curating, and distributing such datasets requires
suitable infrastructure. Although static datasets exist for established
benchmark problems, no standardized or scalable solution supports developing
and sharing datasets for novel or user-defined benchmarks. To address this gap,
we introduce PyTupli, a Python-based tool to streamline the creation, storage,
and dissemination of benchmark environments and their corresponding tuple
datasets. PyTupli includes a lightweight client library with defined interfaces
for uploading and retrieving benchmarks and data. It supports fine-grained
filtering at both the episode and tuple level, allowing researchers to curate
high-quality, task-specific datasets. A containerized server component enables
production-ready deployment with authentication, access control, and automated
certificate provisioning for secure use. By addressing key barriers in dataset
infrastructure, PyTupli facilitates more collaborative, reproducible, and
scalable offline RL research.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is a type of data to be obtained associated with a
graph structure where vertices and edges describe some kind of data
correlation. This paper proposes a regression method on graph-structured data,
which is based on multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP), to capture both the
correlation between vertices and the correlation between associated data. The
proposed formulation is built on the definition of MOGP. This allows it to be
applied to a wide range of data configurations and scenarios. Moreover, it has
high expressive capability due to its flexibility in kernel design. It includes
existing methods of Gaussian processes for graph-structured data as special
cases and is possible to remove restrictions on data configurations, model
selection, and inference scenarios in the existing methods. The performance of
extensions achievable by the proposed formulation is evaluated through computer
experiments with synthetic and real data.

Abstract: We introduce FlowMixer, a neural architecture that leverages constrained

FlowMixer incorporates non-negative matrix mixing layers within a reversible
mapping framework-applying transforms before mixing and their inverses
afterward. This shape-preserving design enables a Kronecker-Koopman eigenmode
framework that bridges statistical learning with dynamical systems theory,
providing interpretable spatiotemporal patterns and facilitating direct
algebraic manipulation of prediction horizons without retraining. Extensive
experiments across diverse domains demonstrate FlowMixer's robust long-horizon
forecasting capabilities while effectively modeling physical phenomena such as
chaotic attractors and turbulent flows. These results suggest that
architectural constraints can simultaneously enhance predictive performance and
mathematical interpretability in neural forecasting systems.

Conclusion: MELD通过避免状态冲突，显著提升了分子生成的质量和有效性。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling
discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains
underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the
surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the
performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing
problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a
common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be
learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To
mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that
orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between
distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise
scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph
elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular
benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality
compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity
of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves
state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.

Result: 实验表明，基于填补的策略比单模态信息、熵引导和随机选择更有效。

Conclusion: CAMA为队列级模态获取提供了优化方案，提升了资源受限场景下的资源利用率。

Abstract: Real-world machine learning applications often involve data from multiple
modalities that must be integrated effectively to make robust predictions.
However, in many practical settings, not all modalities are available for every
sample, and acquiring additional modalities can be costly. This raises the
question: which samples should be prioritized for additional modality
acquisition when resources are limited? While prior work has explored
individual-level acquisition strategies and training-time active learning
paradigms, test-time and cohort-based acquisition remain underexplored despite
their importance in many real-world settings. We introduce Cohort-based Active
Modality Acquisition (CAMA), a novel test-time setting to formalize the
challenge of selecting which samples should receive additional modalities. We
derive acquisition strategies that leverage a combination of generative
imputation and discriminative modeling to estimate the expected benefit of
acquiring missing modalities based on common evaluation metrics. We also
introduce upper-bound heuristics that provide performance ceilings to benchmark
acquisition strategies. Experiments on common multimodal datasets demonstrate
that our proposed imputation-based strategies can more effectively guide the
acquisition of new samples in comparison to those relying solely on unimodal
information, entropy guidance, and random selections. Our work provides an
effective solution for optimizing modality acquisition at the cohort level,
enabling better utilization of resources in constrained settings.

Motivation: 严肃游戏（SGs）中引入PCG技术以提升玩家体验，但缺乏评估其影响的框架。

Method: 采用DRL游戏测试代理，测试三种不同PCG版本（随机、遗传算法）对NPC创建的影响。

Result: 遗传算法版本（2和3）的DRL代理在胜率和训练时间上优于随机版本（1），胜率峰值达97%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效评估PCG在SGs中的集成效果，为未来研究提供数据支持。

Abstract: Serious Games (SGs) are nowadays shifting focus to include procedural content
generation (PCG) in the development process as a means of offering personalized
and enhanced player experience. However, the development of a framework to
assess the impact of PCG techniques when integrated into SGs remains
particularly challenging. This study proposes a methodology for automated
evaluation of PCG integration in SGs, incorporating deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) game testing agents. To validate the proposed framework, a previously
introduced SG featuring card game mechanics and incorporating three different
versions of PCG for nonplayer character (NPC) creation has been deployed.
Version 1 features random NPC creation, while versions 2 and 3 utilize a
genetic algorithm approach. These versions are used to test the impact of
different dynamic SG environments on the proposed framework's agents. The
obtained results highlight the superiority of the DRL game testing agents
trained on Versions 2 and 3 over those trained on Version 1 in terms of win
rate (i.e. number of wins per played games) and training time. More
specifically, within the execution of a test emulating regular gameplay, both
Versions 2 and 3 peaked at a 97% win rate and achieved statistically
significant higher (p=0009) win rates compared to those achieved in Version 1
that peaked at 94%. Overall, results advocate towards the proposed framework's
capability to produce meaningful data for the evaluation of procedurally
generated content in SGs.

Conclusion: 该方法为学习上下文价值分布及其在随机优化中的应用提供了有效的理论和实践工具。

Abstract: Motivated by stochastic optimization, we introduce the problem of learning
from samples of contextual value distributions. A contextual value distribution
can be understood as a family of real-valued distributions, where each sample
consists of a context $x$ and a random variable drawn from the corresponding
real-valued distribution $D_x$. By minimizing a convex surrogate loss, we learn
an empirical distribution $D'_x$ for each context, ensuring a small L\'evy
distance to $D_x$. We apply this result to obtain the sample complexity bounds
for the learning of an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for stochastic optimization
problems defined on an unknown contextual value distribution. The sample
complexity is shown to be polynomial for the general case of strongly monotone
and stable optimization problems, including Single-item Revenue Maximization,
Pandora's Box and Optimal Stopping.

Abstract: Long-term planning, as in reinforcement learning (RL), involves finding
strategies: actions that collectively work toward a goal rather than
individually optimizing their immediate outcomes. As part of a strategy, some
actions are taken at the expense of short-term benefit to enable future actions
with even greater returns. These actions are only advantageous if followed up
by the actions they facilitate, consequently, they would not have been taken if
those follow-ups were not available. In this paper, we quantify such
dependencies between planned actions with strategic link scores: the drop in
the likelihood of one decision under the constraint that a follow-up decision
is no longer available. We demonstrate the utility of strategic link scores
through three practical applications: (i) explaining black-box RL agents by
identifying strategically linked pairs among decisions they make, (ii)
improving the worst-case performance of decision support systems by
distinguishing whether recommended actions can be adopted as standalone
improvements or whether they are strategically linked hence requiring a
commitment to a broader strategy to be effective, and (iii) characterizing the
planning processes of non-RL agents purely through interventions aimed at
measuring strategic link scores - as an example, we consider a realistic
traffic simulator and analyze through road closures the effective planning
horizon of the emergent routing behavior of many drivers.

TLDR: ATR-Bench是一个统一的联邦学习评估框架，涵盖适应性、信任和推理三个维度，旨在解决现有方法缺乏标准化评估的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习缺乏标准化的评估方法，阻碍了系统进展和公平比较。

Method: 提出ATR-Bench框架，通过适应性、信任和推理三个维度分析和评估联邦学习方法。

Result: 对异构客户端适应性和对抗性环境中的信任进行了广泛基准测试，推理部分提供了文献驱动的见解。

Conclusion: ATR-Bench为联邦学习的系统化评估奠定了基础，并提供了公开代码库和持续更新的研究资源。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data privacy across decentralized participants.
As FL adoption grows, numerous techniques have been proposed to tackle its
practical challenges. However, the lack of standardized evaluation across key
dimensions hampers systematic progress and fair comparison of FL methods. In
this work, we introduce ATR-Bench, a unified framework for analyzing federated
learning through three foundational dimensions: Adaptation, Trust, and
Reasoning. We provide an in-depth examination of the conceptual foundations,
task formulations, and open research challenges associated with each theme. We
have extensively benchmarked representative methods and datasets for adaptation
to heterogeneous clients and trustworthiness in adversarial or unreliable
environments. Due to the lack of reliable metrics and models for reasoning in
FL, we only provide literature-driven insights for this dimension. ATR-Bench
lays the groundwork for a systematic and holistic evaluation of federated
learning with real-world relevance. We will make our complete codebase publicly
accessible and a curated repository that continuously tracks new developments
and research in the FL literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出了一种仅依赖离线预训练策略的高效在线强化学习微调方法PORL，避免了对预训练Q函数的依赖，解决了现有方法因保守性导致的探索受限问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线强化学习微调方法需要依赖离线预训练的Q函数以保证稳定性和性能，但这种方法因保守性限制了探索能力，且无法适用于仅有预训练策略（如模仿学习）的场景。

Method: 提出PORL方法，在线阶段从零快速初始化Q函数，避免有害的悲观估计，仅利用离线预训练策略进行微调。

Result: PORL在性能上与先进的离线到在线强化学习算法及利用先验数据或策略的在线强化学习方法相当，并首次实现了对行为克隆策略的直接微调。

Conclusion: PORL为仅依赖预训练策略的在线强化学习微调提供了新思路，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Improving the performance of pre-trained policies through online
reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical yet challenging topic. Existing
online RL fine-tuning methods require continued training with offline
pretrained Q-functions for stability and performance. However, these offline
pretrained Q-functions commonly underestimate state-action pairs beyond the
offline dataset due to the conservatism in most offline RL methods, which
hinders further exploration when transitioning from the offline to the online
setting. Additionally, this requirement limits their applicability in scenarios
where only pre-trained policies are available but pre-trained Q-functions are
absent, such as in imitation learning (IL) pre-training. To address these
challenges, we propose a method for efficient online RL fine-tuning using
solely the offline pre-trained policy, eliminating reliance on pre-trained
Q-functions. We introduce PORL (Policy-Only Reinforcement Learning
Fine-Tuning), which rapidly initializes the Q-function from scratch during the
online phase to avoid detrimental pessimism. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance with advanced offline-to-online RL algorithms and
online RL approaches that leverage data or policies prior, but also pioneers a
new path for directly fine-tuning behavior cloning (BC) policies.

Result: 在真实车辆动力学实验中，IC-SYSID表现出高性能并避免不稳定聚类。

Conclusion: IC-SYSID有效解决了联邦学习中的系统识别问题，提升了稳定性和性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the System Identification (SYSID) problem within the
framework of federated learning. We introduce a novel algorithm, Incremental
Clustering-based federated learning method for SYSID (IC-SYSID), designed to
tackle SYSID challenges across multiple data sources without prior knowledge.
IC-SYSID utilizes an incremental clustering method, ClusterCraft (CC), to
eliminate the dependency on the prior knowledge of the dataset. CC starts with
a single cluster model and assigns similar local workers to the same clusters
by dynamically increasing the number of clusters. To reduce the number of
clusters generated by CC, we introduce ClusterMerge, where similar cluster
models are merged. We also introduce enhanced ClusterCraft to reduce the
generation of similar cluster models during the training. Moreover, IC-SYSID
addresses cluster model instability by integrating a regularization term into
the loss function and initializing cluster models with scaled Glorot
initialization. It also utilizes a mini-batch deep learning approach to manage
large SYSID datasets during local training. Through the experiments conducted
on a real-world representing SYSID problem, where a fleet of vehicles
collaboratively learns vehicle dynamics, we show that IC-SYSID achieves a high
SYSID performance while preventing the learning of unstable clusters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图域适应方法局限于单步适应，无法处理连续域偏移且容易发生灾难性遗忘。

Method: GCAL采用双层优化策略，包括基于信息最大化的适应阶段和基于信息瓶颈理论的记忆生成阶段。

Result: 实验表明，GCAL在适应性和知识保留方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GCAL有效提升了模型在多图域适应中的可持续性和适应性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of graph domain adaptation on evolving,
multiple out-of-distribution (OOD) graphs. Conventional graph domain adaptation
methods are confined to single-step adaptation, making them ineffective in
handling continuous domain shifts and prone to catastrophic forgetting. This
paper introduces the Graph Continual Adaptive Learning (GCAL) method, designed
to enhance model sustainability and adaptability across various graph domains.
GCAL employs a bilevel optimization strategy. The "adapt" phase uses an
information maximization approach to fine-tune the model with new graph domains
while re-adapting past memories to mitigate forgetting. Concurrently, the
"generate memory" phase, guided by a theoretical lower bound derived from
information bottleneck theory, involves a variational memory graph generation
module to condense original graphs into memories. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that GCAL substantially outperforms existing methods in
terms of adaptability and knowledge retention.

Result: GBoosting在多种预处理配置下表现最优，RNN-LSTM在z-score归一化下提升显著，自编码器在召回率上表现突出。

Conclusion: 框架为IoT异常检测提供了预处理与模型选择的实用指导。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced
critical security challenges, underscoring the need for accurate anomaly
detection. Although numerous studies have proposed machine learning (ML)
methods for this purpose, limited research systematically examines how
different preprocessing steps--normalization, transformation, and feature
selection--interact with distinct model architectures. To address this gap,
this paper presents a multi-step evaluation framework assessing the combined
impact of preprocessing choices on three ML algorithms: RNN-LSTM, autoencoder
neural networks (ANN), and Gradient Boosting (GBoosting). Experiments on the
IoTID20 dataset shows that GBoosting consistently delivers superior accuracy
across preprocessing configurations, while RNN-LSTM shows notable gains with
z-score normalization and autoencoders excel in recall, making them well-suited
for unsupervised scenarios. By offering a structured analysis of preprocessing
decisions and their interplay with various ML techniques, the proposed
framework provides actionable guidance to enhance anomaly detection performance
in IoT environments.

Result: 在多种任务中表现显著提升，如ESM2接触预测提高了12.7%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功将蛋白质结构知识融入pLMs，提升了模型性能，相关数据和模型已公开。

Abstract: Protein language models (pLMs) pre-trained on vast protein sequence databases
excel at various downstream tasks but lack the structural knowledge essential
for many biological applications. To address this, we integrate structural
insights from pre-trained protein graph neural networks (pGNNs) into pLMs
through a latent-level contrastive learning task. This task aligns residue
representations from pLMs with those from pGNNs across multiple proteins,
enriching pLMs with inter-protein structural knowledge. Additionally, we
incorporate a physical-level task that infuses intra-protein structural
knowledge by optimizing pLMs to predict structural tokens. The proposed
dual-task framework effectively incorporates both inter-protein and
intra-protein structural knowledge into pLMs. Given the variability in the
quality of protein structures in PDB, we further introduce a residue loss
selection module, which uses a small model trained on high-quality structures
to select reliable yet challenging residue losses for the pLM to learn.
Applying our structure alignment method to the state-of-the-art ESM2 and
AMPLIFY results in notable performance gains across a wide range of tasks,
including a 12.7% increase in ESM2 contact prediction. The data, code, and
resulting SaESM2 and SaAMPLIFY models will be released on Hugging Face.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无标签数据情况下优于现有依赖标签的提示方法。

Conclusion: 本文方法为GNN提示提供了一种高效的无监督解决方案，显著提升了泛化能力。

Abstract: Prompt tuning methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular to
address the semantic gap between pre-training and fine-tuning steps. However,
existing GNN prompting methods rely on labeled data and involve lightweight
fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Meanwhile, in-context learning methods for
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance with no parameter
updating and no or minimal labeled data. Inspired by these approaches, in this
work, we first introduce a challenging problem setup to evaluate GNN prompting
methods. This setup encourages a prompting function to enhance a pre-trained
GNN's generalization to a target dataset under covariate shift without updating
the GNN's parameters and with no labeled data. Next, we propose a fully
unsupervised prompting method based on consistency regularization through
pseudo-labeling. We use two regularization techniques to align the prompted
graphs' distribution with the original data and reduce biased predictions.
Through extensive experiments under our problem setting, we demonstrate that
our unsupervised approach outperforms the state-of-the-art prompting methods
that have access to labels.

Abstract: This paper presents a concise review of Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB)
methods and introduces an experimental framework for scalable, interpretable
offer selection, addressing the challenge of fast-changing offers. The approach
models context at the product category level, allowing offers to span multiple
categories and enabling knowledge transfer across similar offers. This improves
learning efficiency and generalization in dynamic environments. The framework
extends standard CMAB methodology to support multi-category contexts, and
achieves scalability through efficient feature engineering and modular design.
Advanced features such as MPG (Member Purchase Gap) and MF (Matrix
Factorization) capture nuanced user-offer interactions, with implementation in
Python for practical deployment.
  A key contribution is interpretability at scale: logistic regression models
yield transparent weight vectors, accessible via a large language model (LLM)
interface for real-time, user-level tracking and explanation of evolving
preferences. This enables the generation of detailed member profiles and
identification of behavioral patterns, supporting personalized offer
optimization and enhancing trust in automated decisions. By situating our
prototype alongside established paradigms like Generalized Linear Models and
Thompson Sampling, we demonstrate its value for both research and real-world
CMAB applications.

Result: 在多个金融场景中，新损失函数表现优于传统方法，尤其是在有解析解的情况下。

Conclusion: 提出的损失函数在理论和实验上均表现出优越性，为风险厌恶强化学习提供了更稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Risk-averse reinforcement learning finds application in various high-stakes
fields. Unlike classical reinforcement learning, which aims to maximize
expected returns, risk-averse agents choose policies that minimize risk,
occasionally sacrificing expected value. These preferences can be framed
through utility theory. We focus on the specific case of the exponential
utility function, where we can derive the Bellman equations and employ various
reinforcement learning algorithms with few modifications. However, these
methods suffer from numerical instability due to the need for exponent
computation throughout the process. To address this, we introduce a numerically
stable and mathematically sound loss function based on the Itakura-Saito
divergence for learning state-value and action-value functions. We evaluate our
proposed loss function against established alternatives, both theoretically and
empirically. In the experimental section, we explore multiple financial
scenarios, some with known analytical solutions, and show that our loss
function outperforms the alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值分析中的极分解算法（如Newton-Schulz）在深度学习环境中效率低下且不兼容GPU，需要一种高效且GPU兼容的新方法。

Method: Polar Express通过解决极小极大优化问题，动态调整多项式更新规则，仅使用矩阵乘法，确保GPU兼容性。

Result: Polar Express在Muon优化框架中表现出色，在GPT-2等大规模模型上验证损失持续改善，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Polar Express是一种高效、稳定的极分解算法，适用于深度学习，尤其在GPU环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Computing the polar decomposition and the related matrix sign function, has
been a well-studied problem in numerical analysis for decades. More recently,
it has emerged as an important subroutine in deep learning, particularly within
the Muon optimization framework. However, the requirements in this setting
differ significantly from those of traditional numerical analysis. In deep
learning, methods must be highly efficient and GPU-compatible, but high
accuracy is often unnecessary. As a result, classical algorithms like
Newton-Schulz (which suffers from slow initial convergence) and methods based
on rational functions (which rely on QR decompositions or matrix inverses) are
poorly suited to this context. In this work, we introduce Polar Express, a
GPU-friendly algorithm for computing the polar decomposition. Like classical
polynomial methods such as Newton-Schulz, our approach uses only matrix-matrix
multiplications, making it GPU-compatible. Motivated by earlier work of Chen &
Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the polynomial update rule
at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem, and we prove that
it enjoys a strong worst-case optimality guarantee. This property ensures both
rapid early convergence and fast asymptotic convergence. We also address
finite-precision issues, making it stable in bfloat16 in practice. We apply
Polar Express within the Muon optimization framework and show consistent
improvements in validation loss on large-scale models such as GPT-2,
outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce LLaDA-V, a purely diffusion-based Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) that integrates visual instruction tuning with masked
diffusion models, representing a departure from the autoregressive paradigms
dominant in current multimodal approaches. Built upon LLaDA, a representative
large language diffusion model, LLaDA-V incorporates a vision encoder and MLP
connector that projects visual features into the language embedding space,
enabling effective multimodal alignment. Our empirical investigation reveals
several intriguing results: First, LLaDA-V demonstrates promising multimodal
performance despite its language model being weaker on purely textual tasks
than counterparts like LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B. When trained on the same
instruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal
tasks with better data scalability. It also narrows the performance gap to
Qwen2-VL, suggesting the effectiveness of its architecture for multimodal
tasks. Second, LLaDA-V achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal
understanding compared to existing hybrid autoregressive-diffusion and purely
diffusion-based MLLMs. Our findings suggest that large language diffusion
models show promise in multimodal contexts and warrant further investigation in
future research. Project page and codes:

Abstract: This work develops the underpinnings of self-supervised placement-aware
representation learning given spatially-distributed (multi-view and multimodal)
sensor observations, motivated by the need to represent external environmental
state in multi-sensor IoT systems in a manner that correctly distills spatial
phenomena from the distributed multi-vantage observations. The objective of
sensing in IoT systems is, in general, to collectively represent an externally
observed environment given multiple vantage points from which sensory
observations occur. Pretraining of models that help interpret sensor data must
therefore encode the relation between signals observed by sensors and the
observers' vantage points in order to attain a representation that encodes the
observed spatial phenomena in a manner informed by the specific placement of
the measuring instruments, while allowing arbitrary placement. The work
significantly advances self-supervised model pretraining from IoT signals
beyond current solutions that often overlook the distinctive spatial nature of
IoT data. Our framework explicitly learns the dependencies between measurements
and geometric observer layouts and structural characteristics, guided by a core
design principle: the duality between signals and observer positions. We
further provide theoretical analyses from the perspectives of information
theory and occlusion-invariant representation learning to offer insight into
the rationale behind our design. Experiments on three real-world
datasets--covering vehicle monitoring, human activity recognition, and
earthquake localization--demonstrate the superior generalizability and
robustness of our method across diverse modalities, sensor placements,
application-level inference tasks, and spatial scales.

Abstract: Foundation models hold significant promise in healthcare, given their
capacity to extract meaningful representations independent of downstream tasks.
This property has enabled state-of-the-art performance across several clinical
applications trained on structured electronic health record (EHR) data, even in
settings with limited labeled data, a prevalent challenge in healthcare.
However, there is little consensus on these models' potential for clinical
utility due to the lack of desiderata of comprehensive and meaningful tasks and
sufficiently diverse evaluations to characterize the benefit over conventional
supervised learning. To address this gap, we propose a suite of clinically
meaningful tasks spanning patient outcomes, early prediction of acute and
chronic conditions, including desiderata for robust evaluations. We evaluate
state-of-the-art foundation models on EHR data consisting of 5 million patients
from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUMC), a large urban academic
medical center in New York City, across 14 clinically relevant tasks. We
measure overall accuracy, calibration, and subpopulation performance to surface
tradeoffs based on the choice of pre-training, tokenization, and data
representation strategies. Our study aims to advance the empirical evaluation
of structured EHR foundation models and guide the development of future
healthcare foundation models.

Motivation: 尽管对抗训练在传统机器学习中表现良好，但在LLM中的应用效果尚不明确，且现有方法存在计算成本高或鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: MixAT结合了更强的离散攻击和更快的连续攻击进行训练，并提出了ALO-ASR指标评估模型的最坏情况漏洞。

Conclusion: MixAT为构建更安全的LLM提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，同时揭示了当前方法中的盲点。

Abstract: Despite recent efforts in Large Language Models (LLMs) safety and alignment,
current adversarial attacks on frontier LLMs are still able to force harmful
generations consistently. Although adversarial training has been widely studied
and shown to significantly improve the robustness of traditional machine
learning models, its strengths and weaknesses in the context of LLMs are less
understood. Specifically, while existing discrete adversarial attacks are
effective at producing harmful content, training LLMs with concrete adversarial
prompts is often computationally expensive, leading to reliance on continuous
relaxations. As these relaxations do not correspond to discrete input tokens,
such latent training methods often leave models vulnerable to a diverse set of
discrete attacks. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing MixAT,
a novel method that combines stronger discrete and faster continuous attacks
during training. We rigorously evaluate MixAT across a wide spectrum of
state-of-the-art attacks, proposing the At Least One Attack Success Rate
(ALO-ASR) metric to capture the worst-case vulnerability of models. We show
MixAT achieves substantially better robustness (ALO-ASR < 20%) compared to
prior defenses (ALO-ASR > 50%), while maintaining a runtime comparable to
methods based on continuous relaxations. We further analyze MixAT in realistic
deployment settings, exploring how chat templates, quantization, low-rank
adapters, and temperature affect both adversarial training and evaluation,
revealing additional blind spots in current methodologies. Our results
demonstrate that MixAT's discrete-continuous defense offers a principled and
superior robustness-accuracy tradeoff with minimal computational overhead,
highlighting its promise for building safer LLMs. We provide our code and
models at https://github.com/insait-institute/MixAT.

Result: 改进后的模型在数学推理基准测试中表现优异，性能超过参数多3.5倍的普通Transformer和启发式缓存压缩方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为Transformer内存操作提供了信息理论基础，解决了仅靠规模扩展无法克服的推理限制。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models struggle with
generalisation beyond their training distribution, often exhibiting
sophisticated pattern interpolation rather than true abstract reasoning
(extrapolation). In this work, we approach this limitation through the lens of
Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation
emerges from an optimal balance between input compression and retention of
predictive information in latent representations. We prove using IB theory that
decoder-only Transformers are inherently constrained in their ability to form
task-optimal sequence representations. We then use this result to demonstrate
that periodic global transformation of the internal sequence-level
representations (KV cache) is a necessary computational step for improving
Transformer generalisation in reasoning tasks. Based on these theoretical
insights, we propose a modification to the Transformer architecture, in the
form of an additional module that globally rewrites the KV cache at periodic
intervals, shifting its capacity away from memorising input prefixes and toward
encoding features most useful for predicting future tokens. Our model delivers
substantial gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming both
vanilla Transformers with up to 3.5x more parameters, as well as
heuristic-driven pruning mechanisms for cache compression. Our approach can be
seen as a principled generalisation of existing KV-cache compression methods;
whereas such methods focus solely on compressing input representations, they
often do so at the expense of retaining predictive information, and thus their
capabilities are inherently bounded by those of an unconstrained model. This
establishes a principled framework to manipulate Transformer memory using
information theory, addressing fundamental reasoning limitations that scaling
alone cannot overcome.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated considerable potential in supporting
model design and optimization for combinatorial optimization (CO) problems.
However, much of the progress to date has been evaluated on small-scale,
synthetic datasets, raising concerns about the practical effectiveness of
ML-based solvers in real-world, large-scale CO scenarios. Additionally, many
existing CO benchmarks lack sufficient training data, limiting their utility
for evaluating data-driven approaches. To address these limitations, we
introduce FrontierCO, a comprehensive benchmark that covers eight canonical CO
problem types and evaluates 16 representative ML-based solvers--including graph
neural networks and large language model (LLM) agents. FrontierCO features
challenging instances drawn from industrial applications and frontier CO
research, offering both realistic problem difficulty and abundant training
data. Our empirical results provide critical insights into the strengths and
limitations of current ML methods, helping to guide more robust and practically
relevant advances at the intersection of machine learning and combinatorial
optimization. Our data is available at

Result: 在合成、半合成和真实医疗数据集上验证了校正方法的重要性。

Conclusion: ICYM2I能有效解决多模态学习中的缺失数据问题，提升信息增益估计的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal learning is of continued interest in artificial intelligence-based
applications, motivated by the potential information gain from combining
different types of data. However, modalities collected and curated during
development may differ from the modalities available at deployment due to
multiple factors including cost, hardware failure, or -- as we argue in this
work -- the perceived informativeness of a given modality. Na{\"i}ve estimation
of the information gain associated with including an additional modality
without accounting for missingness may result in improper estimates of that
modality's value in downstream tasks. Our work formalizes the problem of
missingness in multimodal learning and demonstrates the biases resulting from
ignoring this process. To address this issue, we introduce ICYM2I (In Case You
Multimodal Missed It), a framework for the evaluation of predictive performance
and information gain under missingness through inverse probability
weighting-based correction. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed
adjustment to estimate information gain under missingness on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world medical datasets.

Conclusion: 提出基于数据集大小的早期停止准则，可有效平衡泛化与记忆化，适用于超参数迁移和隐私敏感场景。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have become a cornerstone of modern generative
AI, yet the mechanisms underlying their generalization remain poorly
understood. In fact, if these models were perfectly minimizing their training
loss, they would just generate data belonging to their training set, i.e.,
memorize, as empirically found in the overparameterized regime. We revisit this
view by showing that, in highly overparameterized diffusion models,
generalization in natural data domains is progressively achieved during
training before the onset of memorization. Our results, ranging from image to
language diffusion models, systematically support the empirical law that
memorization time is proportional to the dataset size. Generalization vs.
memorization is then best understood as a competition between time scales. We
show that this phenomenology is recovered in diffusion models learning a simple
probabilistic context-free grammar with random rules, where generalization
corresponds to the hierarchical acquisition of deeper grammar rules as training
time grows, and the generalization cost of early stopping can be characterized.
We summarize these results in a phase diagram. Overall, our results support
that a principled early-stopping criterion - scaling with dataset size - can
effectively optimize generalization while avoiding memorization, with direct
implications for hyperparameter transfer and privacy-sensitive applications.

Result: UFT在不同规模的模型上均优于SFT和RFT，并突破了RFT的指数样本复杂度瓶颈。

Conclusion: UFT是一种高效的后训练方法，能够显著提升模型的推理能力，特别是在长时程推理任务上。

Abstract: Post-training has demonstrated its importance in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The primary post-training methods
can be categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT is efficient and well-suited for small language models,
but it may lead to overfitting and limit the reasoning abilities of larger
models. In contrast, RFT generally yields better generalization but depends
heavily on the strength of the base model. To address the limitations of SFT
and RFT, we propose Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), a novel post-training paradigm
that unifies SFT and RFT into a single, integrated process. UFT enables the
model to effectively explore solutions while incorporating informative
supervision signals, bridging the gap between memorizing and thinking
underlying existing methods. Notably, UFT outperforms both SFT and RFT in
general, regardless of model sizes. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that
UFT breaks RFT's inherent exponential sample complexity bottleneck, showing for
the first time that unified training can exponentially accelerate convergence
on long-horizon reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Despite decades of advancements, the simulation of fluids remains one of the
most challenging areas of in scientific computing. Supported by the necessity
of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have
emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics
simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a
differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with
Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both
the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established
benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show
that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated
turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised
training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular,
we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow
purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with
our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while
keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights
into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a
physically informed regularization technique. To ensure that the full potential
of PICT can be leveraged, it is published as open source:

Abstract: We propose a general framework for conditional sampling in PDE-based inverse
problems, targeting the recovery of whole solutions from extremely sparse or
noisy measurements. This is accomplished by a function-space diffusion model
and plug-and-play guidance for conditioning. Our method first trains an
unconditional discretization-agnostic denoising model using neural operator
architectures. At inference, we refine the samples to satisfy sparse
observation data via a gradient-based guidance mechanism. Through rigorous
mathematical analysis, we extend Tweedie's formula to infinite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces, providing the theoretical foundation for our posterior sampling
approach. Our method (FunDPS) accurately captures posterior distributions in
function spaces under minimal supervision and severe data scarcity. Across five
PDE tasks with only 3% observation, our method achieves an average 32% accuracy
improvement over state-of-the-art fixed-resolution diffusion baselines while
reducing sampling steps by 4x. Furthermore, multi-resolution fine-tuning
ensures strong cross-resolution generalizability. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first diffusion-based framework to operate independently of
discretization, offering a practical and flexible solution for forward and
inverse problems in the context of PDEs. Code is available at

Abstract: Prompting is one of the main ways to adapt a pretrained model to target
tasks. Besides manually constructing prompts, many prompt optimization methods
have been proposed in the literature. Method development is mainly empirically
driven, with less emphasis on a conceptual understanding of prompting. In this
paper we discuss how optimal prompting can be understood through a Bayesian
view, which also implies some fundamental limitations of prompting that can
only be overcome by tuning weights. The paper explains in detail how
meta-trained neural networks behave as Bayesian predictors over the pretraining
distribution, whose hallmark feature is rapid in-context adaptation. Optimal
prompting can be studied formally as conditioning these Bayesian predictors,
yielding criteria for target tasks where optimal prompting is and is not
possible. We support the theory with educational experiments on LSTMs and
Transformers, where we compare different versions of prefix-tuning and
different weight-tuning methods. We also confirm that soft prefixes, which are
sequences of real-valued vectors outside the token alphabet, can lead to very
effective prompts for trained and even untrained networks by manipulating
activations in ways that are not achievable by hard tokens. This adds an
important mechanistic aspect beyond the conceptual Bayesian theory.

Conclusion: 强调了在扩散模型中进行全面评估的重要性。

Abstract: Concept erasure, the ability to selectively prevent a model from generating
specific concepts, has attracted growing interest, with various approaches
emerging to address the challenge. However, it remains unclear how thoroughly
these methods erase the target concept. We begin by proposing two conceptual
models for the erasure mechanism in diffusion models: (i) reducing the
likelihood of generating the target concept, and (ii) interfering with the
model's internal guidance mechanisms. To thoroughly assess whether a concept
has been truly erased from the model, we introduce a suite of independent
evaluations. Our evaluation framework includes adversarial attacks, novel
probing techniques, and analysis of the model's alternative generations in
place of the erased concept. Our results shed light on the tension between
minimizing side effects and maintaining robustness to adversarial prompts.
Broadly, our work underlines the importance of comprehensive evaluation for
erasure in diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce RIPT-VLA, a simple and scalable reinforcement-learning-based
interactive post-training paradigm that fine-tunes pretrained
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using only sparse binary success rewards.
Existing VLA training pipelines rely heavily on offline expert demonstration
data and supervised imitation, limiting their ability to adapt to new tasks and
environments under low-data regimes. RIPT-VLA addresses this by enabling
interactive post-training with a stable policy optimization algorithm based on
dynamic rollout sampling and leave-one-out advantage estimation.
  RIPT-VLA has the following characteristics. First, it applies to various VLA
models, resulting in an improvement on the lightweight QueST model by 21.2%,
and the 7B OpenVLA-OFT model to an unprecedented 97.5% success rate. Second, it
is computationally efficient and data-efficient: with only one demonstration,
RIPT-VLA enables an unworkable SFT model (4%) to succeed with a 97% success
rate within 15 iterations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the policy learned
by RIPT-VLA generalizes across different tasks and scenarios and is robust to
the initial state context. These results highlight RIPT-VLA as a practical and
effective paradigm for post-training VLA models through minimal supervision.

The dataset contains 715 questions from the 2024 official Q\&A document
published by Brazil's Internal Revenue Service, enriched with statutory norms
and administrative rulings from the Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais

compare different text segmentation strategies and benchmark our system against
commercial tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai using RAGAS-based metrics.
Results show that our custom RAG pipeline outperforms commercial systems in
Response Relevancy, indicating stronger alignment with user queries, while
commercial models achieve higher scores in Factual Correctness and fluency.
These findings highlight a trade-off between legally grounded generation and
linguistic fluency. Crucially, we argue that human expert evaluation remains

Conclusion: 提出了一种结合LLMs概率知识与少量真实数据自动构建贝叶斯网络的新策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as factual knowledge
bases; however, their capability to generate probabilistic knowledge about
real-world events remains understudied. This paper investigates using
probabilistic knowledge inherent in LLMs to derive probability estimates for
statements concerning events and their interrelationships captured via a
Bayesian Network (BN). Using LLMs in this context allows for the
parameterization of BNs, enabling probabilistic modeling within specific
domains. Experiments on eighty publicly available Bayesian Networks, from
healthcare to finance, demonstrate that querying LLMs about the conditional
probabilities of events provides meaningful results when compared to baselines,
including random and uniform distributions, as well as approaches based on
next-token generation probabilities. We explore how these LLM-derived
distributions can serve as expert priors to refine distributions extracted from
minimal data, significantly reducing systematic biases. Overall, this work
introduces a promising strategy for automatically constructing Bayesian
Networks by combining probabilistic knowledge extracted from LLMs with small
amounts of real-world data. Additionally, we evaluate several prompting
strategies for eliciting probabilistic knowledge from LLMs and establish the
first comprehensive baseline for assessing LLM performance in extracting
probabilistic knowledge.

Conclusion: 大语言模型是强大的奖励分解工具，无需手动奖励设计和细粒度人类反馈。

Abstract: We propose a large language model based reward decomposition framework for
aligning dialogue agents using only a single session-level feedback signal. We
leverage the reasoning capabilities of a frozen, pretrained large language
model (LLM) to infer fine-grained local implicit rewards by decomposing global,
session-level feedback. Our first text-only variant prompts the LLM to perform
reward decomposition using only the dialogue transcript. The second multimodal
variant incorporates additional behavioral cues, such as pitch, gaze, and
facial affect, expressed as natural language descriptions. These inferred
turn-level rewards are distilled into a lightweight reward model, which we
utilize for RL-based fine-tuning for dialogue generation. We evaluate both
text-only and multimodal variants against state-of-the-art reward decomposition
methods and demonstrate notable improvements in human evaluations of
conversation quality, suggesting that LLMs are strong reward decomposers that
obviate the need for manual reward shaping and granular human feedback.

Abstract: A key type of resource needed to address global inequalities in knowledge
production and dissemination is a tool that can support journals in
understanding how knowledge circulates. The absence of such a tool has resulted
in comparatively less information about networks of knowledge sharing in the
Global South. In turn, this gap authorizes the exclusion of researchers and
scholars from the South in indexing services, reinforcing colonial arrangements
that de-center and minoritize those scholars. In order to support citation
network tracking on a global scale, we investigate the capacity of open-weight
language models to mark up manuscript citations in an indexable format. We
assembled a dataset of matched plaintext and annotated citations from preprints
and published research papers. Then, we evaluated a number of open-weight
language models on the annotation task. We find that, even out of the box,
today's language models achieve high levels of accuracy on identifying the
constituent components of each citation, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, the smallest model we evaluated, Qwen3-0.6B, can parse all
fields with high accuracy in $2^5$ passes, suggesting that post-training is
likely to be effective in producing small, robust citation parsing models. Such
a tool could greatly improve the fidelity of citation networks and thus
meaningfully improve research indexing and discovery, as well as further
metascientific research.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs), which provide step-by-step feedback on the
reasoning generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), are receiving increasing
attention. However, two key research gaps remain: collecting accurate
step-level error labels for training typically requires costly human
annotation, and existing PRMs are limited to math reasoning problems. In
response to these gaps, this paper aims to address the challenges of automatic
dataset creation and the generalization of PRMs to diverse reasoning tasks. To
achieve this goal, we propose FoVer, an approach for training PRMs on
step-level error labels automatically annotated by formal verification tools,
such as Z3 for formal logic and Isabelle for theorem proof, which provide
automatic and accurate verification for symbolic tasks. Using this approach, we
synthesize a training dataset with error labels on LLM responses for formal
logic and theorem proof tasks without human annotation. Although this data
synthesis is feasible only for tasks compatible with formal verification, we
observe that LLM-based PRMs trained on our dataset exhibit cross-task
generalization, improving verification across diverse reasoning tasks.
Specifically, PRMs trained with FoVer significantly outperform baseline PRMs
based on the original LLMs and achieve competitive or superior results compared
to state-of-the-art PRMs trained on labels annotated by humans or stronger
models, as measured by step-level verification on ProcessBench and Best-of-K
performance across 12 reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME, ANLI, MMLU,
and BBH. The datasets, models, and code are provided at

TLDR: 提出了一种新的大内存语言模型（LMLM），通过外部数据库存储事实知识，减少对模型权重记忆的依赖，实现了可编辑和可验证的知识管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统神经语言模型中知识分布不透明、难以检查和更新的问题。

Method: 结合内部权重和外部数据库存储知识，训练时屏蔽外部检索的事实值，促使模型进行针对性查询。

Result: LMLM在标准基准测试中表现与更大规模的知识密集型模型相当，同时具备显式、可编辑和可验证的知识库。

Conclusion: LMLM为语言模型与事实知识的交互和管理提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Neural language models are black-boxes -- both linguistic patterns and
factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This
entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update
specific facts. We propose a new class of language models, Large Memory
Language Models (LMLM) with a pre-training recipe that stores factual knowledge
in both internal weights and an external database. Our approach strategically
masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby
teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on
memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve
competitive performance compared to significantly larger, knowledge-dense LLMs
on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable,
and verifiable knowledge bases. This work represents a fundamental shift in how
language models interact with and manage factual knowledge.

TLDR: 评估五种大型语言模型（LLMs）在解决和解释数独谜题中的表现，发现其在解释能力上存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在人类-AI协作决策中的可信度、渐进性和定制化解释能力。

Method: 通过评估五种LLMs在解决和解释六种数独谜题中的表现。

Result: 一种LLM在解题上表现有限，但所有模型均无法提供反映战略推理或直观问题解决的解释。

Conclusion: LLMs在成为有效的人类-AI协作伙伴前，需解决解释能力的重大挑战。

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in human-AI collaborative
decision-making hinges on their ability to provide trustworthy, gradual, and
tailored explanations. Solving complex puzzles, such as Sudoku, offers a
canonical example of this collaboration, where clear and customized
explanations often hold greater importance than the final solution. In this
study, we evaluate the performance of five LLMs in solving and explaining
\sixsix{} Sudoku puzzles. While one LLM demonstrates limited success in solving
puzzles, none can explain the solution process in a manner that reflects
strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-solving. These findings underscore
significant challenges that must be addressed before LLMs can become effective
partners in human-AI collaborative decision-making.

Motivation: 波斯语等低资源语言的小型语言模型在专业医疗领域表现不佳，且缺乏相关数据集。研究旨在填补这一空白并提升模型性能。

Method: 通过爬取波斯语医学杂志和医患问答对构建数据集，并基于此微调基线模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在医学问答任务中表现优于基线模型，准确性和响应质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用开放获取的在线数据可以增强小型语言模型在医疗领域的表现，为资源受限环境下的波斯语医疗AI应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of language models has demonstrated the potential of
artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. However, small language
models struggle with specialized domains in low-resource languages like
Persian. While numerous medical-domain websites exist in Persian, no curated
dataset or corpus has been available making ours the first of its kind. This
study explores the enhancement of medical knowledge in a small language model
by leveraging accessible online data, including a crawled corpus from medical
magazines and a dataset of real doctor-patient QA pairs. We fine-tuned a
baseline model using our curated data to improve its medical knowledge.
Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves improved
accuracy in medical question answering and provides better responses compared
to its baseline. This work highlights the potential of leveraging open-access
online data to enrich small language models in medical fields, providing a
novel solution for Persian medical AI applications suitable for
resource-constrained environments.

TLDR: 论文探讨了如何利用因果可解释性方法分析大语言模型（LLMs），以增强其对语言学理论的价值，特别是英语填充-空缺依赖结构的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过分析LLMs的内部机制，为语言学理论提供更深入的证据，揭示传统理论中可能被忽视的因素。

Method: 采用分布式交换干预实验方法，分析LLMs对英语填充-空缺依赖结构的抽象机制。

Result: 发现LLMs对这些结构有相似的抽象分析，并揭示了频率、填充类型和上下文等被忽视的因素。

Conclusion: LLMs的内部机制分析可以推动语言学理论的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful sources of evidence for
linguists seeking to develop theories of syntax. In this paper, we argue that
causal interpretability methods, applied to LLMs, can greatly enhance the value
of such evidence by helping us characterize the abstract mechanisms that LLMs
learn to use. Our empirical focus is a set of English filler-gap dependency
constructions (e.g., questions, relative clauses). Linguistic theories largely
agree that these constructions share many properties. Using experiments based
in Distributed Interchange Interventions, we show that LLMs converge on similar
abstract analyses of these constructions. These analyses also reveal previously
overlooked factors -- relating to frequency, filler type, and surrounding
context -- that could motivate changes to standard linguistic theory. Overall,
these results suggest that mechanistic, internal analyses of LLMs can push
linguistic theory forward.

TLDR: SLMEval是一种基于熵最大化的校准方法，显著提升了语言模型评估与人类判断的相关性，并在实际任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有校准技术在开放任务中表现不佳，与人类判断相关性弱甚至负相关，需要一种更通用的校准方法。

Method: 提出SLMEval，通过熵最大化利用少量人类偏好数据，估计模型质量的潜在分布并重新加权评分。

Result: SLMEval在真实任务和公共基准测试中与人类判断相关性显著提升（如Spearman相关系数0.57），且成本降低5-30倍。

Conclusion: SLMEval是一种高效且通用的校准方法，适用于开放任务，显著提升了评估效果并降低成本。

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm offers a scalable, reference-free approach for
evaluating language models. Although several calibration techniques have been
proposed to better align these evaluators with human judgment, prior studies
focus primarily on narrow, well-structured benchmarks. As a result, it remains
unclear whether such calibrations generalize to real-world, open-ended tasks.
  In this work, we show that SOTA calibrated evaluators often fail in these
settings, exhibiting weak or even negative correlation with human judgments. To
address this, we propose SLMEval, a novel and efficient calibration method
based on entropy maximization over a small amount of human preference data. By
estimating a latent distribution over model quality and reweighting evaluator
scores accordingly, SLMEval achieves strong correlation with human evaluations
across two real-world production use cases and the public benchmark. For
example, on one such task, SLMEval achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.57 with
human judgments, while G-Eval yields a negative correlation. In addition,
SLMEval reduces evaluation costs by 5-30x compared to GPT-4-based calibrated
evaluators such as G-eval.

TLDR: LAGO是一种基于语言相似性的图优化方法，用于少样本跨语言嵌入反转攻击，显著提升了攻击的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言NLP系统中嵌入反转攻击的隐私漏洞，强调语言相似性的重要性。

Method: 通过图约束分布式优化框架，结合句法和词汇相似性作为边约束，实现跨语言参数协作学习。

Result: 实验表明，LAGO在Rouge-L分数上比基线方法提高了10-20%。

Conclusion: 语言相似性是反转攻击迁移性的关键因素，呼吁关注语言感知的隐私保护多语言嵌入。

Abstract: We propose LAGO - Language Similarity-Aware Graph Optimization - a novel
approach for few-shot cross-lingual embedding inversion attacks, addressing
critical privacy vulnerabilities in multilingual NLP systems. Unlike prior work
in embedding inversion attacks that treat languages independently, LAGO
explicitly models linguistic relationships through a graph-based constrained
distributed optimization framework. By integrating syntactic and lexical
similarity as edge constraints, our method enables collaborative parameter
learning across related languages. Theoretically, we show this formulation
generalizes prior approaches, such as ALGEN, which emerges as a special case
when similarity constraints are relaxed. Our framework uniquely combines
Frobenius-norm regularization with linear inequality or total variation
constraints, ensuring robust alignment of cross-lingual embedding spaces even
with extremely limited data (as few as 10 samples per language). Extensive
experiments across multiple languages and embedding models demonstrate that
LAGO substantially improves the transferability of attacks with 10-20% increase
in Rouge-L score over baselines. This work establishes language similarity as a
critical factor in inversion attack transferability, urging renewed focus on
language-aware privacy-preserving multilingual embeddings.

TLDR: METEORA提出了一种基于理性驱动选择的方法，取代传统RAG中的相似性检索和重排序，提高了生成准确性、解释性和对抗性内容的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法依赖启发式相似性检索和重排序，缺乏解释性和对抗性内容的鲁棒性。

Method: METEORA通过两阶段方法：1) 偏好调整LLM生成输入查询的理性；2) 理性驱动的证据块选择引擎，包括局部相关性、全局选择和上下文扩展。

Result: 在六个数据集中，METEORA生成准确性提高33.34%，使用块数减少50%，对抗性场景下F1分数从0.10提升至0.44。

Conclusion: METEORA通过理性驱动选择和验证，显著提升了RAG的解释性、准确性和对抗性鲁棒性。

Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on
similarity-based retrieval and re-ranking, which depend on heuristics such as
top-k, and lack explainability, interpretability, and robustness against
adversarial content. To address this gap, we propose a novel method METEORA
that replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach.
METEORA operates in two stages. First, a general-purpose LLM is
preference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using
direct preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk
selection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing
individual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance,
global selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context
expansion via neighboring chunks. This process eliminates the need for top-k
heuristics. The rationales are also used for consistency check using a Verifier
LLM to detect and filter poisoned or misleading content for safe generation.
The framework provides explainable and interpretable evidence flow by using
rationales consistently across both selection and verification. Our evaluation
across six datasets spanning legal, financial, and academic research domains
shows that METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% while using
approximately 50% fewer chunks than state-of-the-art re-ranking methods. In
adversarial settings, METEORA significantly improves the F1 score from 0.10 to
0.44 over the state-of-the-art perplexity-based defense baseline, demonstrating
strong resilience to poisoning attacks. Code available at:

TLDR: NOVER是一种无需外部验证器的强化学习框架，仅需标准监督微调数据，适用于广泛的文本任务，性能优于同类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部验证器，限制了应用范围；奖励模型训练成本高。NOVER旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出NOVER框架，无需外部验证器，仅需标准监督微调数据，支持广泛任务。

Result: NOVER在性能上优于同类模型（如DeepSeek R1 671B），提升7.7%。

Conclusion: NOVER为大型语言模型优化提供了新可能性，如逆向激励训练。

Abstract: Recent advances such as DeepSeek R1-Zero highlight the effectiveness of
incentive training, a reinforcement learning paradigm that computes rewards
solely based on the final answer part of a language model's output, thereby
encouraging the generation of intermediate reasoning steps. However, these
methods fundamentally rely on external verifiers, which limits their
applicability to domains like mathematics and coding where such verifiers are
readily available. Although reward models can serve as verifiers, they require
high-quality annotated data and are costly to train. In this work, we propose
NOVER, NO-VERifier Reinforcement Learning, a general reinforcement learning
framework that requires only standard supervised fine-tuning data with no need
for an external verifier. NOVER enables incentive training across a wide range
of text-to-text tasks and outperforms the model of the same size distilled from
large reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 671B by 7.7 percent. Moreover, the
flexibility of NOVER enables new possibilities for optimizing large language
models, such as inverse incentive training.

Motivation: 研究用户如何通过多轮交互主动引导LLM生成内容，以优化写作任务中的协作效果。

Method: 通过大规模分析用户在Bing Copilot和WildChat中的交互数据，识别出典型的协作行为（PATHs），并分析其与用户意图的关联。

Result: 发现少数PATHs能解释大部分用户行为差异，且用户意图与特定PATHs显著相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果对LLM对齐设计有重要启示，强调了理解用户协作行为的重要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are used in complex writing workflows, users
engage in multi-turn interactions to steer generations to better fit their
needs. Rather than passively accepting output, users actively refine, explore,
and co-construct text. We conduct a large-scale analysis of this collaborative
behavior for users engaged in writing tasks in the wild with two popular AI
assistants, Bing Copilot and WildChat. Our analysis goes beyond simple task
classification or satisfaction estimation common in prior work and instead
characterizes how users interact with LLMs through the course of a session. We
identify prototypical behaviors in how users interact with LLMs in prompts
following their original request. We refer to these as Prototypical Human-AI
Collaboration Behaviors (PATHs) and find that a small group of PATHs explain a
majority of the variation seen in user-LLM interaction. These PATHs span users
revising intents, exploring texts, posing questions, adjusting style or
injecting new content. Next, we find statistically significant correlations
between specific writing intents and PATHs, revealing how users' intents shape
their collaboration behaviors. We conclude by discussing the implications of
our findings on LLM alignment.

Method: 使用包含四个伦理方面（稳健性、可靠性、安全性和公平性）的新数据集，分析模型在英语和土耳其语中的行为。

Result: 实验表明，许多开源模型在安全性和公平性上表现良好，但可靠性仍是问题；大参数模型伦理表现更优，Gemma和Qwen表现最佳。

Conclusion: 伦理评估可独立于语言进行，大参数模型表现更好，为更安全的模型开发提供了指导。

Abstract: Generative large language models present significant potential but also raise
critical ethical concerns. Most studies focus on narrow ethical dimensions, and
also limited diversity of languages and models. To address these gaps, we
conduct a broad ethical evaluation of 29 recent open-source large language
models using a novel data collection including four ethical aspects:
Robustness, reliability, safety, and fairness. We analyze model behavior in
both a commonly used language, English, and a low-resource language, Turkish.
Our aim is to provide a comprehensive ethical assessment and guide safer model
development by filling existing gaps in evaluation breadth, language coverage,
and model diversity. Our experimental results, based on LLM-as-a-Judge, reveal
that optimization efforts for many open-source models appear to have
prioritized safety and fairness, and demonstrated good robustness while
reliability remains a concern. We demonstrate that ethical evaluation can be
effectively conducted independently of the language used. In addition, models
with larger parameter counts tend to exhibit better ethical performance, with
Gemma and Qwen models demonstrating the most ethical behavior among those
evaluated.

Motivation: 研究NLP领域顶级会议论文的学术和公众影响力，揭示不同主题的传播和接受情况。

Method: 通过分析研究文章和外部来源（如专利、媒体和政策文件）的引用数据，评估NLP主题的影响力。

Result: 语言模型影响力最大，语言学基础较低；伦理相关主题在政策文件中受关注但学术引用少；外部领域对NLP的偏好各异。

Conclusion: NLP研究的内外部影响力总体一致，但伦理等主题在公众和政策领域更受关注，需加强学术与实践的结合。

Abstract: We investigate the impacts of NLP research published in top-tier conferences
(i.e., ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL) from 1979 to 2024. By analyzing citations from
research articles and external sources such as patents, media, and policy
documents, we examine how different NLP topics are consumed both within the
academic community and by the broader public. Our findings reveal that language
modeling has the widest internal and external influence, while linguistic
foundations have lower impacts. We also observe that internal and external
impacts generally align, but topics like ethics, bias, and fairness show
significant attention in policy documents with much fewer academic citations.
Additionally, external domains exhibit distinct preferences, with patents
focusing on practical NLP applications and media and policy documents engaging
more with the societal implications of NLP models.

Motivation: 大型Transformer模型（如Llama）在文本分类中表现优异但存在推理效率低、资源需求高的问题，因此研究小型模型的潜力。

Method: 综合评估提示工程和监督微调方法，聚焦工业场景（如邮件分类、法律文档分类等），分析小型模型的性能与VRAM效率。

Result: 揭示了小型模型在文本分类中的优势与局限性，为工业部署提供实用建议。

Conclusion: 小型模型在特定场景下可高效替代大型模型，但需结合任务特点选择合适方法。

Abstract: With the emergence of ChatGPT, Transformer models have significantly advanced
text classification and related tasks. Decoder-only models such as Llama
exhibit strong performance and flexibility, yet they suffer from inefficiency
on inference due to token-by-token generation, and their effectiveness in text
classification tasks heavily depends on prompt quality. Moreover, their
substantial GPU resource requirements often limit widespread adoption. Thus,
the question of whether smaller language models are capable of effectively
handling text classification tasks emerges as a topic of significant interest.
However, the selection of appropriate models and methodologies remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of prompt
engineering and supervised fine-tuning methods for transformer-based text
classification. Specifically, we focus on practical industrial scenarios,
including email classification, legal document categorization, and the
classification of extremely long academic texts. We examine the strengths and
limitations of smaller models, with particular attention to both their
performance and their efficiency in Video Random-Access Memory (VRAM)
utilization, thereby providing valuable insights for the local deployment and
application of compact models in industrial settings.

Conclusion: BiasLab数据集和工具支持可解释的偏见建模，鼓励研究人类参与的透明性和解释有效性。

Abstract: We present BiasLab, a dataset of 300 political news articles annotated for
perceived ideological bias. These articles were selected from a curated
900-document pool covering diverse political events and source biases. Each
article is labeled by crowdworkers along two independent scales, assessing
sentiment toward the Democratic and Republican parties, and enriched with
rationale indicators. The annotation pipeline incorporates targeted worker
qualification and was refined through pilot-phase analysis. We quantify
inter-annotator agreement, analyze misalignment with source-level outlet bias,
and organize the resulting labels into interpretable subsets. Additionally, we
simulate annotation using schema-constrained GPT-4o, enabling direct comparison
to human labels and revealing mirrored asymmetries, especially in
misclassifying subtly right-leaning content. We define two modeling tasks:
perception drift prediction and rationale type classification, and report
baseline performance to illustrate the challenge of explainable bias detection.
BiasLab's rich rationale annotations provide actionable interpretations that
facilitate explainable modeling of political bias, supporting the development
of transparent, socially aware NLP systems. We release the dataset, annotation
schema, and modeling code to encourage research on human-in-the-loop
interpretability and the evaluation of explanation effectiveness in real-world
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代BPE分词器会将日期分割成无意义的片段，影响时间推理的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入日期分割比率指标，发布DateAugBench数据集，并通过层间探测和注意力分析揭示模型的日期抽象机制。

Result: 过度分割导致不常见日期的准确率下降10%，且模型越大，日期抽象机制越快形成。

Conclusion: 模型通过不同于人类的路径（年→月→日）组装日期片段，揭示了其独特的推理方式。

Abstract: Modern BPE tokenizers often split calendar dates into meaningless fragments,
e.g., 20250312 $\rightarrow$ 202, 503, 12, inflating token counts and obscuring
the inherent structure needed for robust temporal reasoning. In this work, we
(1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation
ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date
components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three
temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance
puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future
regimes; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses,
uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models
stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal
reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with
accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and
futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the
emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we
observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically
differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$
day).

Motivation: 代谢和减重手术（MBS）患者在获取多学科医疗服务时面临诸多障碍，如信息获取不及时或不可靠，导致治疗效果受限。

Method: 开发了bRAGgen模型，采用自适应检索增强生成技术，动态整合实时医学证据；同时构建了bRAGq数据集，包含1,302个经过专家验证的问题。

Result: bRAGgen在生成临床准确和相关回答方面显著优于现有模型，通过LLM指标和专家评审验证。

Conclusion: bRAGgen为MBS患者提供了一种高效、可靠的信息支持工具，有望改善医疗服务的可及性和质量。

Abstract: While bariatric and metabolic surgery (MBS) is considered the gold standard
treatment for severe and morbid obesity, its therapeutic efficacy hinges upon
active and longitudinal engagement with multidisciplinary providers, including
surgeons, dietitians/nutritionists, psychologists, and endocrinologists. This
engagement spans the entire patient journey, from preoperative preparation to
long-term postoperative management. However, this process is often hindered by
numerous healthcare disparities, such as logistical and access barriers, which
impair easy patient access to timely, evidence-based, clinician-endorsed
information. To address these gaps, we introduce bRAGgen, a novel adaptive
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based model that autonomously integrates
real-time medical evidence when response confidence dips below dynamic
thresholds. This self-updating architecture ensures that responses remain
current and accurate, reducing the risk of misinformation. Additionally, we
present bRAGq, a curated dataset of 1,302 bariatric surgery--related questions,
validated by an expert bariatric surgeon. bRAGq constitutes the first
large-scale, domain-specific benchmark for comprehensive MBS care. In a
two-phase evaluation, bRAGgen is benchmarked against state-of-the-art models
using both large language model (LLM)--based metrics and expert surgeon review.
Across all evaluation dimensions, bRAGgen demonstrates substantially superior
performance in generating clinically accurate and relevant responses.

Result: 在不同模型和剪枝策略中验证，显著提升了安全性。

Conclusion: 这是首个专注于剪枝后恢复LVLMs安全性的工作。

Abstract: With the increasing size of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), network
pruning techniques aimed at compressing models for deployment in
resource-constrained environments have garnered significant attention. However,
we observe that pruning often leads to a degradation in safety performance. To
address this issue, we present a novel and lightweight approach, termed
Hierarchical Safety Realignment (HSR). HSR operates by first quantifying the
contribution of each attention head to safety, identifying the most critical
ones, and then selectively restoring neurons directly within these attention
heads that play a pivotal role in maintaining safety. This process
hierarchically realigns the safety of pruned LVLMs, progressing from the
attention head level to the neuron level. We validate HSR across various models
and pruning strategies, consistently achieving notable improvements in safety
performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly focused on
restoring safety in LVLMs post-pruning.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为MPL的新框架，利用多种编程语言（如C++和Java）在监督微调阶段提升信息抽取任务的效果，并通过function-prompt和虚拟运行优化代码风格输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要使用Python模拟代码风格输入，忽略了其他广泛使用的编程语言在监督微调阶段的潜力。

Method: 提出MPL框架，结合多种编程语言和function-prompt技术，通过虚拟运行模拟代码风格输入。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了MPL的有效性。

Conclusion: MPL框架为信息抽取任务提供了新的思路，并公开了代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Recent research in information extraction (IE) focuses on utilizing
code-style inputs to enhance structured output generation. The intuition behind
this is that the programming languages (PLs) inherently exhibit greater
structural organization than natural languages (NLs). This structural advantage
makes PLs particularly suited for IE tasks. Nevertheless, existing research
primarily focuses on Python for code-style simulation, overlooking the
potential of other widely-used PLs (e.g., C++ and Java) during the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) phase. In this research, we propose \textbf{M}ultiple
\textbf{P}rogramming \textbf{L}anguages with large language models for
information extraction (abbreviated as \textbf{MPL}), a novel framework that
explores the potential of incorporating different PLs in the SFT phase.
Additionally, we introduce \texttt{function-prompt} with virtual running to
simulate code-style inputs more effectively and efficiently. Experimental
results on a wide range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MPL.
Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to provide a comprehensive
analysis. We have released our code for future research.

Result: 研究发现休闲和社交期望比自然和情感因素更能驱动用户参与。

Conclusion: 该框架为旅游分析提供了精准工具，并展示了计算社会科学在营销优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Social media's rise establishes user-generated content (UGC) as pivotal for
travel decisions, yet analytical methods lack scalability. This study
introduces a dual-method LLM framework: unsupervised expectation extraction
from UGC paired with survey-informed supervised fine-tuning. Findings reveal
leisure/social expectations drive engagement more than foundational
natural/emotional factors. By establishing LLMs as precision tools for
expectation quantification, we advance tourism analytics methodology and
propose targeted strategies for experience personalization and social travel
promotion. The framework's adaptability extends to consumer behavior research,
demonstrating computational social science's transformative potential in
marketing optimization.

TLDR: KoBALT是一个针对韩语的综合性语言学基准测试，包含700道选择题，覆盖5个语言学领域，旨在评估大型语言模型在韩语中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准测试缺乏语言学深度和类型学基础，KoBALT填补了这一空白，为韩语模型的真实语言理解能力提供更稳健的评估。

Method: KoBALT包含专家策划的、语言学驱动的题目，与标准韩语语料库的最小n-gram重叠，减少数据污染风险。

Result: 评估20个当代大型语言模型显示性能差异显著，最高模型准确率为61%，但在不同语言学领域表现不一。

Conclusion: KoBALT验证了其作为韩语理解能力的判别性度量工具的有效性，并为类型多样的语言提供了语言学评估框架。

Abstract: We introduce KoBALT (Korean Benchmark for Advanced Linguistic Tasks), a
comprehensive linguistically-motivated benchmark comprising 700 multiple-choice
questions spanning 24 phenomena across five linguistic domains: syntax,
semantics, pragmatics, phonetics/phonology, and morphology. KoBALT is designed
to advance the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in Korean, a
morphologically rich language, by addressing the limitations of conventional
benchmarks that often lack linguistic depth and typological grounding. It
introduces a suite of expert-curated, linguistically motivated questions with
minimal n-gram overlap with standard Korean corpora, substantially mitigating
the risk of data contamination and allowing a more robust assessment of true
language understanding. Our evaluation of 20 contemporary LLMs reveals
significant performance disparities, with the highest-performing model
achieving 61\% general accuracy but showing substantial variation across
linguistic domains - from stronger performance in semantics (66\%) to
considerable weaknesses in phonology (31\%) and morphology (36\%). Through
human preference evaluation with 95 annotators, we demonstrate a strong
correlation between KoBALT scores and human judgments, validating our
benchmark's effectiveness as a discriminative measure of Korean language
understanding. KoBALT addresses critical gaps in linguistic evaluation for
typologically diverse languages and provides a robust framework for assessing
genuine linguistic competence in Korean language models.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在人口统计偏见上的深层次表现，尤其是在教育和评估场景中的潜在风险。

Method: 通过数学、编程、常识和写作问题的实验，分析五种与人类价值观对齐的LLMs的偏见表现，包括归因偏见和评估偏见。

Result: LLMs在数学和编程中更少将正确答案归因于非裔美国人群体，而在写作评估中更少偏好亚洲作者；此外，模型在可视化代码中自动为人口统计群体分配刻板颜色。

Conclusion: LLMs的人口统计偏见不仅限于表面刻板印象，而是深植于其推理过程，对其在教育与评估中的应用提出了警示。

Abstract: Despite LLMs' explicit alignment against demographic stereotypes, they have
been shown to exhibit biases under various social contexts. In this work, we
find that LLMs exhibit concerning biases in how they associate solution
veracity with demographics. Through experiments across five human value-aligned
LLMs on mathematics, coding, commonsense, and writing problems, we reveal two
forms of such veracity biases: Attribution Bias, where models
disproportionately attribute correct solutions to certain demographic groups,
and Evaluation Bias, where models' assessment of identical solutions varies
based on perceived demographic authorship. Our results show pervasive biases:
LLMs consistently attribute fewer correct solutions and more incorrect ones to
African-American groups in math and coding, while Asian authorships are least
preferred in writing evaluation. In additional studies, we show LLMs
automatically assign racially stereotypical colors to demographic groups in
visualization code, suggesting these biases are deeply embedded in models'
reasoning processes. Our findings indicate that demographic bias extends beyond
surface-level stereotypes and social context provocations, raising concerns
about LLMs' deployment in educational and evaluation settings.

Motivation: 现有直接评分方法在片段级别与人类判断相关性低，需要更准确的评估方法。

Method: 使用解码器LLMs生成参考，结合语义相似性评分，覆盖8种LLMs和8种语言对。

Result: 方法优于直接评分基线和非LLM参考无关指标，支持生成与语义评估结合的混合方法。

Conclusion: 生成式评估具有优势，未来应转向结合流畅生成与准确语义评估的混合方法。

Abstract: Recent studies have applied large language models (LLMs) to machine
translation quality estimation (MTQE) by prompting models to assign numeric
scores. Nonetheless, these direct scoring methods tend to show low
segment-level correlation with human judgments. In this paper, we propose a
generation-based evaluation paradigm that leverages decoder-only LLMs to
produce high-quality references, followed by semantic similarity scoring using
sentence embeddings. We conduct the most extensive evaluation to date in MTQE,
covering 8 LLMs and 8 language pairs. Empirical results show that our method
outperforms both intra-LLM direct scoring baselines and external non-LLM
reference-free metrics from MTME. These findings demonstrate the strength of
generation-based evaluation and support a shift toward hybrid approaches that
combine fluent generation with accurate semantic assessment.

Conclusion: 位置偏见是模型驱动的，且显式指导可能适得其反，需重新思考提示工程策略。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit positional bias -- systematic neglect of
information at specific context positions -- yet its interplay with linguistic
diversity remains poorly understood. We present a cross-linguistic study across
five typologically distinct languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi,
Vietnamese), examining how positional bias interacts with model uncertainty,
syntax, and prompting. Key findings: (1) Positional bias is model-driven, with
language-specific variations -- Qwen2.5-7B favors late positions, challenging
assumptions of early-token bias; (2) Explicit positional guidance (e.g.,
correct context is at position X) reduces accuracy across languages,
undermining prompt-engineering practices; (3) Aligning context with positional
bias increases entropy, yet minimal entropy does not predict accuracy. (4) We
further uncover that LLMs differently impose dominant word order in
free-word-order languages like Hindi.

Motivation: 教师模型的推理路径仅反映表面推理痕迹，而真实推理涉及元推理与子问题解决的复杂交织，SFT无法有效蒸馏这种结构。

Method: 提出RLKD框架，结合生成结构奖励模型（GSRM）和强化学习，衡量学生与教师推理的结构对齐。

Result: 实验显示RLKD在少量数据下超越标准SFT-RL方法，显著提升学生模型的推理潜力。

Conclusion: RLKD能有效蒸馏教师模型的隐含多分支推理结构，优于传统SFT方法。

Abstract: Distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) provides a shortcut for improving the reasoning ability of
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reasoning paths generated by
teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying
authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that
authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning
(which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving
(which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an
implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich
structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning
path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To
address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based
distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model
(GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving
steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and
teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to
internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than
merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard
SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime,
unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation.

Abstract: As large language models continue to advance, their application in

we address this gap by introducing the first diverse benchmark tailored for
educational scenarios, incorporating synthetic data containing 9 major
scenarios and over 4,000 distinct educational contexts. To enable comprehensive
assessment, we propose a set of multi-dimensional evaluation metrics that cover
12 critical aspects relevant to both teachers and students. We further apply
human annotation to ensure the effectiveness of the model-generated evaluation
responses. Additionally, we succeed to train a relatively small-scale model on
our constructed dataset and demonstrate that it can achieve performance
comparable to state-of-the-art large models (e.g., Deepseek V3, Qwen Max) on
the test set. Overall, this work provides a practical foundation for the

Result: 在多种模型和任务中验证，加速效果达1.3x-1.6x。

Conclusion: KNN-SSD有效提升自推测解码的领域适应性，显著加速LLM推理。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a widely used paradigm to accelerate
the inference of large language models (LLMs) without compromising generation
quality. It works by efficiently drafting multiple tokens using a compact model
and then verifying them in parallel using the target LLM. Notably,
Self-Speculative Decoding proposes skipping certain layers to construct the
draft model, which eliminates the need for additional parameters or training.
Despite its strengths, we observe in this work that drafting with layer
skipping exhibits significant sensitivity to domain shifts, leading to a
substantial drop in acceleration performance. To enhance the domain
generalizability of this paradigm, we introduce KNN-SSD, an algorithm that
leverages K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search to match different skipped layers
with various domain inputs. We evaluated our algorithm in various models and
multiple tasks, observing that its application leads to 1.3x-1.6x speedup in
LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM是否能模拟人类在音素流畅性任务中的个体差异。

Method: 评估34种LLM配置（包括提示特异性、采样温度和模型类型），并与106名人类参与者的表现对比。

Result: 某些LLM配置（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet）能匹配人类平均值和词汇偏好，但无法重现人类变异性，且输出多样性低、结构僵化。

Conclusion: LLM在模拟人类认知和行为时存在关键局限性，无法完全替代人类参与者。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as substitutes for
human participants in cognitive tasks, but their ability to simulate human
behavioral variability remains unclear. This study examines whether LLMs can
approximate individual differences in the phonemic fluency task, where
participants generate words beginning with a target letter. We evaluated 34
model configurations, varying prompt specificity, sampling temperature, and
model type, and compared outputs to responses from 106 human participants.
While some configurations, especially Claude 3.7 Sonnet, matched human averages
and lexical preferences, none reproduced the scope of human variability. LLM
outputs were consistently less diverse and structurally rigid, and LLM
ensembles failed to increase diversity. Network analyses further revealed
fundamental differences in retrieval structure between humans and models. These
results highlight key limitations in using LLMs to simulate human cognition and
behavior.

Result: 发现可逆遗忘中模型保留潜在特征，而不可逆遗忘中表示层受损；任务类型和超参数调节可逆性。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法存在根本缺陷，新工具包为可信赖的遗忘提供了诊断基础。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is intended to remove the
influence of specific data, yet current evaluations rely heavily on token-level
metrics such as accuracy and perplexity. We show that these metrics can be
misleading: models often appear to forget, but their original behavior can be
rapidly restored with minimal fine-tuning, revealing that unlearning may
obscure information rather than erase it. To diagnose this phenomenon, we
introduce a representation-level evaluation framework using PCA-based
similarity and shift, centered kernel alignment, and Fisher information.
Applying this toolkit across six unlearning methods, three domains (text, code,
math), and two open-source LLMs, we uncover a critical distinction between
reversible and irreversible forgetting. In reversible cases, models suffer
token-level collapse yet retain latent features; in irreversible cases, deeper
representational damage occurs. We further provide a theoretical account
linking shallow weight perturbations near output layers to misleading
unlearning signals, and show that reversibility is modulated by task type and
hyperparameters. Our findings reveal a fundamental gap in current evaluation
practices and establish a new diagnostic foundation for trustworthy unlearning
in LLMs. We provide a unified toolkit for analyzing LLM representation changes
under unlearning and relearning:

Motivation: 理解LLM何时及为何会撤回错误答案，以揭示其内部信念与行为的关系。

Method: 构建模型特定数据集评估LLM是否会撤回与自身参数知识矛盾的错误答案，并进行引导实验验证内部信念对撤回行为的影响。

Result: LLM虽能撤回错误答案，但频率较低；撤回行为与模型内部信念密切相关，且监督微调可显著提升撤回表现。

Conclusion: 内部信念是影响LLM撤回行为的关键因素，通过微调可优化其撤回能力。

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) admit their mistakes when they should know
better? In this work, we define the behavior of acknowledging errors in
previously generated answers as "retraction" and aim to understand when and why
LLMs choose to retract. We first construct model-specific datasets to evaluate
whether a model will retract an incorrect answer that contradicts its own
parametric knowledge. While LLMs are capable of retraction, they do so only
infrequently. We demonstrate that retraction is closely tied to previously
identified indicators of models' internal belief: models fail to retract wrong
answers that they "believe" to be factually correct. Steering experiments
further demonstrate that internal belief causally influences model retraction.
In particular, when the model does not believe its answer, this not only
encourages the model to attempt to verify the answer, but also alters attention
behavior during self-verification. Finally, we demonstrate that simple
supervised fine-tuning significantly improves retraction performance by helping
the model learn more accurate internal beliefs. Code and datasets are available
on https://github.com/ayyyq/llm-retraction.

Abstract: Understanding health information is essential in achieving and maintaining a
healthy life. We focus on simplifying health information for better
understanding. With the availability of generative AI, the simplification
process has become efficient and of reasonable quality, however, the algorithms
remove information that may be crucial for comprehension. In this study, we
compare generative AI to detect missing information in simplified text,
evaluate its importance, and fix the text with the missing information. We
collected 50 health information texts and simplified them using gpt-4-0613. We
compare five approaches to identify missing elements and regenerate the text by
inserting the missing elements. These five approaches involve adding missing
entities and missing words in various ways: 1) adding all the missing entities,
2) adding all missing words, 3) adding the top-3 entities ranked by gpt-4-0613,
and 4, 5) serving as controls for comparison, adding randomly chosen entities.
We use cosine similarity and ROUGE scores to evaluate the semantic similarity
and content overlap between the original, simplified, and reconstructed
simplified text. We do this for both summaries and full text. Overall, we find
that adding missing entities improves the text. Adding all the missing entities
resulted in better text regeneration, which was better than adding the
top-ranked entities or words, or random words. Current tools can identify these
entities, but are not valuable in ranking them.

Result: 混合训练促进了更大且更集中的共享参数形成，这些参数可能在模型泛化事实知识中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 共享参数的形成是混合训练提升事实召回能力的关键机制，为优化语言模型训练提供了新视角。

Abstract: Fact recall, the ability of language models (LMs) to retrieve specific
factual knowledge, remains a challenging task despite their impressive general
capabilities. Common training strategies often struggle to promote robust
recall behavior with two-stage training, which first trains a model with
fact-storing examples (e.g., factual statements) and then with fact-recalling
examples (question-answer pairs), tending to encourage rote memorization rather
than generalizable fact retrieval. In contrast, mixed training, which jointly
uses both types of examples, has been empirically shown to improve the ability
to recall facts, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In
this work, we investigate how these training strategies affect how model
parameters are shaped during training and how these differences relate to their
ability to recall facts. We introduce cross-task gradient trace to identify
shared parameters, those strongly influenced by both fact-storing and
fact-recalling examples. Our analysis on synthetic fact recall datasets with
the Llama-3.2B and Pythia-2.8B models reveals that mixed training encouraging a
larger and more centralized set of shared parameters. These findings suggest
that the emergence of parameters may play a key role in enabling LMs to
generalize factual knowledge across task formulations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation, but controlling their behavior
reliably remains challenging, especially in open-ended generation settings.
This paper introduces a novel supervised steering approach that operates in
sparse, interpretable representation spaces. We employ sparse autoencoders
(SAEs)to obtain sparse latent representations that aim to disentangle semantic
attributes from model activations. Then we train linear classifiers to identify
a small subspace of task-relevant dimensions in latent representations.
Finally, we learn supervised steering vectors constrained to this subspace,
optimized to align with target behaviors. Experiments across sentiment,
truthfulness, and politics polarity steering tasks with multiple LLMs
demonstrate that our supervised steering vectors achieve higher success rates
with minimal degradation in generation quality compared to existing methods.
Further analysis reveals that a notably small subspace is sufficient for
effective steering, enabling more targeted and interpretable interventions.

TLDR: 该论文首次研究了情感、具身性与日常语言在大规模自然语言数据中的联系，发现身体部位提及（BPMs）在文本中常见且与情感和健康结果相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索情感、具身性与语言之间的关系，填补大规模自然语言数据中这一领域的研究空白。

Method: 构建在线英语文本（博客和推文）中身体部位提及的语料库，结合人工标注情感和词-情感关联词典分析。

Result: BPMs在文本中常见（5%-10%的帖子包含），使用模式因时间和地点而异；含BPMs的文本情感更强烈，且与较差健康结果显著相关。

Conclusion: 研究身体部位相关语言可为NLP、情感科学和人类福祉研究提供新方向。

Abstract: This paper is the first investigation of the connection between emotion,
embodiment, and everyday language in a large sample of natural language data.
We created corpora of body part mentions (BPMs) in online English text (blog
posts and tweets). This includes a subset featuring human annotations for the
emotions of the person whose body part is mentioned in the text. We show that
BPMs are common in personal narratives and tweets (~5% to 10% of posts include
BPMs) and that their usage patterns vary markedly by time and %geographic
location. Using word-emotion association lexicons and our annotated data, we
show that text containing BPMs tends to be more emotionally charged, even when
the BPM is not explicitly used to describe a physical reaction to the emotion
in the text. Finally, we discover a strong and statistically significant
correlation between body-related language and a variety of poorer health
outcomes. In sum, we argue that investigating the role of body-part related
words in language can open up valuable avenues of future research at the
intersection of NLP, the affective sciences, and the study of human wellbeing.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在零样本范式下处理多模态情感分析（MSA）的不足，并通过上下文学习（ICL）优化演示配置，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析（MSA）是通用人工智能的关键挑战，但零样本范式在MSA上表现不佳，引发了对MLLMs情感感知能力的质疑。

Method: 通过扩展零样本范式至上下文学习（ICL），并深入研究演示的检索、呈现和分布三个关键因素，优化了MLLMs的性能。

Result: 优化后的方法在六个MSA数据集上平均准确率比零样本范式提高了15.9%，比随机ICL基线提高了11.2%。

Conclusion: MLLMs确实具备感知情感的能力，通过优化演示配置可以有效提升其在MSA任务中的表现。

Abstract: The advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
various multimodal tasks to be addressed under a zero-shot paradigm. This
paradigm sidesteps the cost of model fine-tuning, emerging as a dominant trend
in practical application. Nevertheless, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), a
pivotal challenge in the quest for general artificial intelligence, fails to
accommodate this convenience. The zero-shot paradigm exhibits undesirable
performance on MSA, casting doubt on whether MLLMs can perceive sentiments as
competent as supervised models. By extending the zero-shot paradigm to
In-Context Learning (ICL) and conducting an in-depth study on configuring
demonstrations, we validate that MLLMs indeed possess such capability.
Specifically, three key factors that cover demonstrations' retrieval,
presentation, and distribution are comprehensively investigated and optimized.
A sentimental predictive bias inherent in MLLMs is also discovered and later
effectively counteracted. By complementing each other, the devised strategies
for three factors result in average accuracy improvements of 15.9% on six MSA
datasets against the zero-shot paradigm and 11.2% against the random ICL
baseline.

TLDR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在纠正儿童对话语音自动语音识别（ASR）错误中的应用，发现LLMs对零样本和微调CTC-based ASR输出有帮助，但在上下文信息或微调自回归ASR（如Whisper）输出中效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童语音的ASR转录准确性仍具挑战性，LLMs的应用潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 在两种儿童对话语音数据集上测试LLMs对零样本和微调ASR输出的纠错能力。

Result: LLMs能改进零样本和CTC-based ASR输出，但对上下文信息或自回归ASR（如Whisper）输出效果不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在儿童语音ASR纠错中具有潜力，但需进一步解决上下文和自回归模型的挑战。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has recently shown remarkable progress,
but accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge.
Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
improving ASR transcriptions. However, their applications in child speech
including conversational scenarios are underexplored. In this study, we explore
the use of LLMs in correcting ASR errors for conversational child speech. We
demonstrate the promises and challenges of LLMs through experiments on two
children's conversational speech datasets with both zero-shot and fine-tuned
ASR outputs. We find that while LLMs are helpful in correcting zero-shot ASR
outputs and fine-tuned CTC-based ASR outputs, it remains challenging for LLMs
to improve ASR performance when incorporating contextual information or when
using fine-tuned autoregressive ASR (e.g., Whisper) outputs.

TLDR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）处理习语的机制，提出了一个多语言习语数据集MIDAS，并发现LLMs不仅依赖记忆，还结合上下文和推理处理习语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语的独特语言特性使其与其他表达不同，但LLMs处理习语的机制，尤其是多语言环境下的机制尚不明确。

Method: 引入MIDAS数据集，包含六种语言的习语及其含义，并全面评估LLMs的习语处理能力。

Result: LLMs处理习语时不仅依赖记忆，还结合上下文和推理，尤其是对组合性习语。

Conclusion: LLMs对习语的理解是内部知识检索与推理推断相互作用的结果。

Abstract: Idioms have long posed a challenge due to their unique linguistic properties,
which set them apart from other common expressions. While recent studies have
leveraged large language models (LLMs) to handle idioms across various tasks,
e.g., idiom-containing sentence generation and idiomatic machine translation,
little is known about the underlying mechanisms of idiom processing in LLMs,
particularly in multilingual settings. To this end, we introduce MIDAS, a new
large-scale dataset of idioms in six languages, each paired with its
corresponding meaning. Leveraging this resource, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' idiom processing ability, identifying key factors that
influence their performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs rely not only on
memorization, but also adopt a hybrid approach that integrates contextual cues
and reasoning, especially when processing compositional idioms. This implies
that idiom understanding in LLMs emerges from an interplay between internal
knowledge retrieval and reasoning-based inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在代码评估中的广泛应用，其是否能公平评估语义等效但表面差异的代码成为关键问题。

Method: 定义了六种代码评估中的潜在偏见，并在五种编程语言和多个LLMs上进行了实证研究。

Result: 所有测试的LLM评委均表现出正负偏见，导致评分偏高或偏低，即使生成测试用例后仍存在偏见。

Conclusion: 研究表明当前LLM评委在代码评估中存在系统性偏见，需开发更鲁棒的评估方法。

Abstract: With the growing use of large language models(LLMs) as evaluators, their
application has expanded to code evaluation tasks, where they assess the
correctness of generated code without relying on reference implementations.
While this offers scalability and flexibility, it also raises a critical,
unresolved question: Can LLM judges fairly and robustly evaluate semantically
equivalent code with superficial variations? Functionally correct code often
exhibits variations-such as differences in variable names, comments, or
formatting-that should not influence its correctness. Yet, whether LLM judges
can reliably handle these variations remains unclear. We present the first
comprehensive study of this issue, defining six types of potential bias in code
evaluation and revealing their systematic impact on LLM judges. Across five
programming languages and multiple LLMs, we empirically demonstrate that all
tested LLM judges are susceptible to both positive and negative biases,
resulting in inflated or unfairly low scores. Moreover, we observe that LLM
judges remain vulnerable to these biases even when prompted to generate test
cases before scoring, highlighting the need for more robust code evaluation
methods.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种高效且可扩展的个性化术语检测方法，通过轻量级微调和个性化提示策略，显著提升了性能，同时减少了标注数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了使技术文档对不同学科背景的读者更易理解，需要个性化的术语检测和解释方法，但传统方法需要大量标注和计算资源。

Method: 研究了两种个性化策略：1）使用LoRA对开源模型进行轻量级微调；2）个性化提示，无需重新训练即可调整模型行为。还探索了结合有限标注数据和无监督用户背景信号的混合方法。

Result: 个性化LoRA模型的F1分数比GPT-4高21.4%，比最佳基线高8.3%，且仅需10%的标注数据即可达到可比性能。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统探索了基于开源语言模型的高效、低资源个性化术语检测，为可扩展的用户自适应NLP系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making
technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary
backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires
substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific
finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized
jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for
real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1)
lightweight fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models,
and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time
without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate hybrid
approaches that combine limited annotated data with unsupervised user
background signals. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 by 21.4% in
F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably,
our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated
training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained
settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient,
low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language
models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

TLDR: MuseRAG是一种自动化方法，利用LLM和RAG框架评估创意的新颖性，通过语义相似性聚类和零样本提示实现高效评分，效果接近人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖人工分类创意的新颖性，效率低且易出错，难以规模化。

Method: 结合LLM和RAG框架，通过检索语义相似的创意桶并零样本提示LLM判断新创意是否属于现有桶或新建桶。

Result: 在五个数据集上，MuseRAG与人工标注的聚类结构和评分高度一致（AMI=0.59，r=0.89），并表现出良好的效度。

Conclusion: MuseRAG实现了规模化、高效且与人工一致的创意新颖性评分，为创造力研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: An objective, face-valid way to assess the originality of creative ideas is
to measure how rare each idea is within a population -- an approach long used
in creativity research but difficult to automate at scale. Tabulating response
frequencies via manual bucketing of idea rephrasings is labor-intensive,
error-prone, and brittle under large corpora. We introduce a fully automated,
psychometrically validated pipeline for frequency-based originality scoring.
Our method, MuseRAG, combines large language models (LLMs) with an externally
orchestrated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. Given a new idea,
the system retrieves semantically similar prior idea buckets and zero-shot
prompts the LLM to judge whether the new idea belongs to an existing bucket or
forms a new one. The resulting buckets enable computation of frequency-based
originality metrics. Across five datasets (N=1143, n_ideas=16294), MuseRAG
matches human annotators in idea clustering structure and resolution (AMI =
0.59) and in participant-level scoring (r = 0.89) -- while exhibiting strong
convergent and external validity. Our work enables intent-sensitive,
human-aligned originality scoring at scale to aid creativity research.

TLDR: LIFEBench评估LLMs在遵循长度指令方面的能力，发现大多数模型在短长度指令上表现良好，但在长长度指令上表现急剧下降，且几乎所有模型无法达到厂商声称的最大输出长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs能解决复杂的推理问题，但在遵循明确长度指令（如生成特定长度的文本）方面表现不佳，现有基准测试对此关注不足。

Method: 引入LIFEBench，包含10,800个实例，覆盖4个任务类别和多种长度约束（16到8192词），评估26个常用LLMs。

Result: 大多数模型在短长度指令上表现合理，但在长长度指令上表现显著下降；几乎所有模型无法达到厂商声称的最大输出长度；推理型LLMs表现优于专用长文本生成模型。

Conclusion: LIFEBench揭示了当前LLMs在遵循长度指令方面的根本局限性，为未来改进提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) can solve PhD-level reasoning problems
over long context inputs, they still struggle with a seemingly simpler task:
following explicit length instructions-e.g., write a 10,000-word novel.
Additionally, models often generate far too short outputs, terminate
prematurely, or even refuse the request. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on
evaluating generations quality, but often overlook whether the generations meet
length constraints. To this end, we introduce Length Instruction Following
Evaluation Benchmark (LIFEBench) to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' ability to
follow length instructions across diverse tasks and a wide range of specified
lengths. LIFEBench consists of 10,800 instances across 4 task categories in
both English and Chinese, covering length constraints ranging from 16 to 8192
words. We evaluate 26 widely-used LLMs and find that most models reasonably
follow short-length instructions but deteriorate sharply beyond a certain
threshold. Surprisingly, almost all models fail to reach the vendor-claimed
maximum output lengths in practice, as further confirmed by our evaluations
extending up to 32K words. Even long-context LLMs, despite their extended
input-output windows, counterintuitively fail to improve length-instructions
following. Notably, Reasoning LLMs outperform even specialized long-text
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art length following. Overall,
LIFEBench uncovers fundamental limitations in current LLMs' length instructions
following ability, offering critical insights for future progress.

TLDR: Align-GRAG 是一个基于图结构的检索增强生成框架，通过双重对齐优化解决图 RAG 中的信息冗余和表示差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在幻觉和过时信息问题，图 RAG 虽能提供更全面的上下文，但面临信息冗余和表示差距的挑战。

Method: 提出 Align-GRAG，通过检索子图、双重对齐优化（KL 散度损失和对比损失）和生成器整合，实现高效知识修剪和统一语义空间。

Result: 在 GraphQA 基准测试的三个任务中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Align-GRAG 能够高效利用图结构提升 LLM 的理解和生成能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but
still struggle with issues like hallucinations and outdated information.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses these issues by grounding LLM
outputs in external knowledge with an Information Retrieval (IR) system.
Building on this foundation, graph-based RAG systems go a step further by
retrieving subgraphs, which preserve the relationships between knowledge
entities and provide more comprehensive context. However, graph RAG faces two
challenges: (1) Retrieving relevant information introduces irrelevant nodes
(especially in dense graph databases, where retrieval usually extends to
adjacent nodes), and leads to overly lengthy inputs that hinder efficiency; (2)
The representation gap between graph and language during generation with LLMs
limits the ability to fully leverage graph structures for enhanced
understanding. To address these limitations, we propose Align-GRAG, a novel
reasoning-guided dual alignment framework in post-retrieval phrase. It first
formulates a subgraph by retrieving nodes and edges. Then an Aligner is
proposed to jointly optimizes a graph encoder with LLM-summarized reasoning. It
achieves dual alignment of graph node and representation by leveraging KL
divergence loss and contrastive loss, facilitating efficient pruning of
irrelevant knowledge and establishing a unified semantic space. The Generator
integrates the aligned graph data with LLM to produce coherent and accurate
answers. Experiments on GraphQA benchmark across three tasks (including common
sense reasoning, scene graph understanding, and knowledge graph reasoning)
validate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be available upon
accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LRMs在逻辑能力上表现优异，但其更强的推理能力可能带来更严重的安全漏洞，现有越狱方法难以平衡有效性与鲁棒性。

Method: SEAL采用堆叠加密方法结合动态策略（随机和自适应），调整密码长度、顺序和组合，以绕过模型的安全机制。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1、Claude Sonnet和OpenAI GPT-o4等模型上验证，SEAL在GPT o4-mini上的攻击成功率达80.8%，优于现有基线27.2%。

Conclusion: SEAL展示了LRMs在安全方面的潜在脆弱性，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated superior logical
capabilities compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), gaining
significant attention. Despite their impressive performance, the potential for
stronger reasoning abilities to introduce more severe security vulnerabilities
remains largely underexplored. Existing jailbreak methods often struggle to
balance effectiveness with robustness against adaptive safety mechanisms. In
this work, we propose SEAL, a novel jailbreak attack that targets LRMs through
an adaptive encryption pipeline designed to override their reasoning processes
and evade potential adaptive alignment. Specifically, SEAL introduces a stacked
encryption approach that combines multiple ciphers to overwhelm the models
reasoning capabilities, effectively bypassing built-in safety mechanisms. To
further prevent LRMs from developing countermeasures, we incorporate two
dynamic strategies - random and adaptive - that adjust the cipher length,
order, and combination. Extensive experiments on real-world reasoning models,
including DeepSeek-R1, Claude Sonnet, and OpenAI GPT-o4, validate the
effectiveness of our approach. Notably, SEAL achieves an attack success rate of
80.8% on GPT o4-mini, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a significant
margin of 27.2%. Warning: This paper contains examples of inappropriate,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多样性指标和奖励模型偏向短输出，限制了表达的多样性。

Method: 引入Diverse-NS框架，通过生成和筛选平衡多样性、质量和长度的偏好数据，仅需3000对偏好数据进行训练。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1-8B和Olmo-2系列模型上显著提升词汇和语义多样性，小模型（如Olmo-2-7B）可作为大模型的“多样性教师”。

Conclusion: Diverse-NS有效解决了长度偏差问题，提升了模型的多样性和表达能力。

Abstract: Diverse language model responses are crucial for creative generation,
open-ended tasks, and self-improvement training. We show that common diversity
metrics, and even reward models used for preference optimization,
systematically bias models toward shorter outputs, limiting expressiveness. To
address this, we introduce Diverse, not Short (Diverse-NS), a length-controlled
self-learning framework that improves response diversity while maintaining
length parity. By generating and filtering preference data that balances
diversity, quality, and length, Diverse-NS enables effective training using
only 3,000 preference pairs. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B and the Olmo-2 family,
Diverse-NS substantially enhances lexical and semantic diversity. We show
consistent improvement in diversity with minor reduction or gains in response
quality on four creative generation tasks: Divergent Associations, Persona
Generation, Alternate Uses, and Creative Writing. Surprisingly, experiments
with the Olmo-2 model family (7B, and 13B) show that smaller models like
Olmo-2-7B can serve as effective "diversity teachers" for larger models. By
explicitly addressing length bias, our method efficiently pushes models toward
more diverse and expressive outputs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型常保留非预期内容，引发对知识遗忘的兴趣，但现有局部化遗忘方法的有效性存疑。

Method: 重新审视现有局部化遗忘方法，并进行控制实验，评估局部参数更新对遗忘的因果贡献。

Result: 实验表明，有效遗忘所需的参数修改并不严格确定，挑战了局部化遗忘的核心假设。

Conclusion: 参数局部性并非有效知识移除的固有指标，需重新思考局部化遗忘方法的理论基础。

Abstract: Large language models often retain unintended content, prompting growing
interest in knowledge unlearning. Recent approaches emphasize localized
unlearning, which restricts parameter updates to specific regions in an effort
to remove target knowledge while preserving unrelated general knowledge.
However, their effectiveness remains uncertain due to the lack of robust and
thorough evaluation of the trade-off between the competing goals of unlearning.
In this paper, we begin by revisiting existing localized unlearning approaches.
We then conduct controlled experiments to rigorously evaluate whether local
parameter updates causally contribute to unlearning. Our findings reveal that
the set of parameters that must be modified for effective unlearning is not
strictly determined, challenging the core assumption of localized unlearning
that parameter locality is inherently indicative of effective knowledge
removal.

Motivation: 传统微调方法仅关注生成损失，而忽略了模型自身的学习信号。论文旨在通过记录和利用模型的错误，模拟人类学习过程以提升性能。

Method: 引入Mistake Log记录模型错误，设计Copilot模型通过logits修正优化Pilot模型的推理性能，提出联合训练和融合推理范式。

Result: 在12个基准测试中，性能提升高达34.5%，计算开销低且具有强扩展性和迁移性。

Conclusion: Transformer Copilot框架通过利用模型自身学习信号，显著提升了生成任务的性能，且计算成本低。

Abstract: Large language models are typically adapted to downstream tasks through
supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific data. While standard fine-tuning
focuses on minimizing generation loss to optimize model parameters, we take a
deeper step by retaining and leveraging the model's own learning signals,
analogous to how human learners reflect on past mistakes to improve future
performance. We first introduce the concept of Mistake Log to systematically
track the model's learning behavior and recurring errors throughout
fine-tuning. Treating the original transformer-based model as the Pilot, we
correspondingly design a Copilot model to refine the Pilot's inference
performance via logits rectification. We name the overall Pilot-Copilot
framework the Transformer Copilot, which introduces (i) a novel Copilot model
design, (ii) a joint training paradigm where the Copilot continuously learns
from the evolving Mistake Log alongside the Pilot, and (iii) a fused inference
paradigm where the Copilot rectifies the Pilot's logits for enhanced
generation. We provide both theoretical and empirical analyses on our new
learning framework. Experiments on 12 benchmarks spanning commonsense,
arithmetic, and recommendation tasks demonstrate that Transformer Copilot
consistently improves performance by up to 34.5%, while introducing marginal
computational overhead to Pilot models and exhibiting strong scalability and
transferability.

Conclusion: 高质量语音语料库可作为评估大语言模型的有效基准，语音数据在预测生产变量上更具优势。

Abstract: The achievements of Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing,
especially for high-resource languages, call for a better understanding of
their characteristics from a cognitive perspective. Researchers have attempted
to evaluate artificial models by testing their ability to predict behavioral
(e.g., eye-tracking fixations) and physiological (e.g., brain responses)
variables during language processing (e.g., reading/listening). In this paper,
we propose using spontaneous speech corpora to derive production variables
(speech reductions, prosodic prominences) and applying them in a similar
fashion. More precisely, we extract. We then test models trained with a
standard procedure on different pretraining datasets (written, spoken, and
mixed genres) for their ability to predict these two variables. Our results
show that, after some fine-tuning, the models can predict these production
variables well above baselines. We also observe that spoken genre training data
provides more accurate predictions than written genres. These results
contribute to the broader effort of using high-quality speech corpora as
benchmarks for LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的机器翻译评估方法在错误定位和严重性评估上存在不足，未能充分利用MQM的层次结构信息。

Method: 提出HiMATE框架，结合分层多代理系统和MQM错误类型学，引入自反思能力和代理间非对称信息讨论以减少系统幻觉。

Result: HiMATE在多个数据集上表现优于基线方法，错误检测F1分数平均提升89%。

Conclusion: HiMATE通过分层多代理框架有效提升了机器翻译评估的准确性和人类对齐性，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables flexible and
interpretable automatic evaluations. In the field of machine translation
evaluation, utilizing LLMs with translation error annotations based on
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) yields more human-aligned judgments.
However, current LLM-based evaluation methods still face challenges in
accurately identifying error spans and assessing their severity. In this paper,
we propose HiMATE, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Machine Translation
Evaluation. We argue that existing approaches inadequately exploit the
fine-grained structural and semantic information within the MQM hierarchy. To
address this, we develop a hierarchical multi-agent system grounded in the MQM
error typology, enabling granular evaluation of subtype errors. Two key
strategies are incorporated to further mitigate systemic hallucinations within
the framework: the utilization of the model's self-reflection capability and
the facilitation of agent discussion involving asymmetric information.
Empirically, HiMATE outperforms competitive baselines across different datasets
in conducting human-aligned evaluations. Further analyses underscore its
significant advantage in error span detection and severity assessment,
achieving an average F1-score improvement of 89% over the best-performing
baseline. We make our code and data publicly available at

*Rishabh Maheshwary,Masoud Hashemi,Khyati Mahajan,Shiva Krishna Reddy Malay,Sai Rajeswar,Sathwik Tejaswi Madhusudhan,Spandana Gella,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为“Notes Writing”的方法，用于解决迭代RAG在多跳问答中因上下文过长和无关信息积累导致的性能限制问题。该方法通过生成简洁且相关的笔记来减少噪声，间接增加LLM的有效上下文长度，从而提升推理和规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迭代RAG在多跳问答中面临上下文过长和无关信息积累的挑战，限制了模型的推理能力和性能。现有的方法要么仅适用于单轮RAG，要么需要微调或缺乏可扩展性。

Method: 提出Notes Writing方法，在每一步从检索到的文档中生成简洁且相关的笔记，减少噪声并保留关键信息。该方法与框架无关，可集成到不同迭代RAG方法中。

Result: 在三种迭代RAG方法、两种模型和四个评估数据集上，Notes Writing平均提升了15.6个百分点，且输出标记的增加极少。

Conclusion: Notes Writing通过减少噪声和保留关键信息，显著提升了迭代RAG在多跳问答中的性能，且具有框架无关性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Iterative RAG for multi-hop question answering faces challenges with lengthy
contexts and the buildup of irrelevant information. This hinders a model's
capacity to process and reason over retrieved content and limits performance.
While recent methods focus on compressing retrieved information, they are
either restricted to single-round RAG, require finetuning or lack scalability
in iterative RAG. To address these challenges, we propose Notes Writing, a
method that generates concise and relevant notes from retrieved documents at
each step, thereby reducing noise and retaining only essential information.
This indirectly increases the effective context length of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling them to reason and plan more effectively while processing
larger volumes of input text. Notes Writing is framework agnostic and can be
integrated with different iterative RAG methods. We demonstrate its
effectiveness with three iterative RAG methods, across two models and four
evaluation datasets. Notes writing yields an average improvement of 15.6
percentage points overall, with minimal increase in output tokens.

*Seongryong Jung,Suwan Yoon,DongGeon Kim,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为ToDi的新型知识蒸馏方法，通过动态结合FKL和RKL两种损失函数，针对每个token自适应调整权重，显著提升了小模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在资源受限环境下部署时存在高延迟和能耗问题，传统知识蒸馏方法（如FKL和RKL）忽略了token级别的预测差异。

Method: 通过梯度分析发现FKL和RKL的互补作用，提出ToDi方法，利用基于sigmoid的权重函数动态结合两种损失函数。

Result: ToDi在指令跟随基准测试中表现优于现有蒸馏方法，并通过消融实验和效率分析验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: ToDi通过token级别的自适应策略，实现了更精确的知识蒸馏，为资源受限环境提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer impressive performance but are impractical
for resource-constrained deployment due to high latency and energy consumption.
Knowledge distillation (KD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from a
large teacher to a smaller student model. However, conventional KD, notably
approaches like Forward KL (FKL) and Reverse KL (RKL), apply uniform divergence
loss across the entire vocabulary, neglecting token-level prediction
discrepancies. By investigating these representative divergences via gradient
analysis, we reveal that FKL boosts underestimated tokens, while RKL suppresses
overestimated ones, showing their complementary roles. Based on this
observation, we propose Token-wise Distillation (ToDi), a novel method that
adaptively combines FKL and RKL per token using a sigmoid-based weighting
function derived from the teacher-student probability log-ratio. ToDi
dynamically emphasizes the appropriate divergence for each token, enabling
precise distribution alignment. We demonstrate that ToDi consistently
outperforms recent distillation baselines using uniform or less granular
strategies across instruction-following benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies
and efficiency analysis further validate ToDi's effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing is a pivotal technique for navigating a
diverse landscape of LLMs, aiming to select the best-performing LLMs tailored
to the domains of user queries, while managing computational resources.
However, current routing approaches often face limitations in scalability when
dealing with a large pool of specialized LLMs, or in their adaptability to
extending model scope and evolving capability domains. To overcome those
challenges, we propose InferenceDynamics, a flexible and scalable
multi-dimensional routing framework by modeling the capability and knowledge of
models. We operate it on our comprehensive dataset RouteMix, and demonstrate
its effectiveness and generalizability in group-level routing using modern
benchmarks including MMLU-Pro, GPQA, BigGenBench, and LiveBench, showcasing its
ability to identify and leverage top-performing models for given tasks, leading
to superior outcomes with efficient resource utilization. The broader adoption
of Inference Dynamics can empower users to harness the full specialized
potential of the LLM ecosystem, and our code will be made publicly available to
encourage further research.

*Chenzhuo Zhao,Ziqian Liu,Xingda Wang,Junting Lu,Chaoyi Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: PMPO是一种轻量级提示优化框架，通过交叉熵损失直接评估信号改进提示，无需输出采样或人工评估，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法依赖高成本输出生成或人工标注，限制了其可扩展性，尤其是对小模型或非指令调优模型。

Method: PMPO通过掩码和损失影响识别低质量提示段，利用正负例最小化损失优化提示，仅需前向传播和似然计算。

Result: PMPO在BBH、GSM8K、AQUA-RAT等任务中表现优于现有方法，AlpacaEval 2.0胜率提升19点以上。

Conclusion: PMPO高效、通用，为提示优化提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt optimization offers a practical and broadly applicable alternative to
fine-tuning for improving large language model (LLM) performance. However,
existing methods often rely on costly output generation, self-critiquing
abilities, or human-annotated preferences, which limit their scalability,
especially for smaller or non-instruction-tuned models. We introduce PMPO
(Probabilistic Metric Prompt Optimization), a unified framework that refines
prompts using token-level cross-entropy loss as a direct, lightweight
evaluation signal. PMPO identifies low-quality prompt segments by masking and
measuring their impact on loss, then rewrites and selects improved variants by
minimizing loss over positive and negative examples. Unlike prior methods, it
requires no output sampling or human evaluation during optimization, relying
only on forward passes and log-likelihoods. PMPO supports both supervised and
preference-based tasks through a closely aligned loss-based evaluation
strategy. Experiments show that PMPO consistently outperforms prior methods
across model sizes and tasks: it achieves the highest average accuracy on BBH,
performs strongly on GSM8K and AQUA-RAT, and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 win rates
by over 19 points. These results highlight PMPO's effectiveness, efficiency,
and broad applicability.

TLDR: CLEAR是一个用于放射学报告评估的临床基础框架，通过多维度属性级比较提供更全面且可解释的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标缺乏对临床细微差异的捕捉能力，导致评估效果不佳。

Method: 引入CLEAR框架，结合专家标注和属性级比较，评估报告的临床准确性。

Result: CLEAR在提取临床属性和自动化指标方面表现优异，与临床判断高度一致。

Conclusion: CLEAR为放射学报告评估提供了更全面且临床可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing metrics often lack the granularity and interpretability to capture
nuanced clinical differences between candidate and ground-truth radiology
reports, resulting in suboptimal evaluation. We introduce a Clinically-grounded
tabular framework with Expert-curated labels and Attribute-level comparison for
Radiology report evaluation (CLEAR). CLEAR not only examines whether a report
can accurately identify the presence or absence of medical conditions, but also
assesses whether it can precisely describe each positively identified condition
across five key attributes: first occurrence, change, severity, descriptive
location, and recommendation. Compared to prior works, CLEAR's
multi-dimensional, attribute-level outputs enable a more comprehensive and
clinically interpretable evaluation of report quality. Additionally, to measure
the clinical alignment of CLEAR, we collaborate with five board-certified
radiologists to develop CLEAR-Bench, a dataset of 100 chest X-ray reports from
MIMIC-CXR, annotated across 6 curated attributes and 13 CheXpert conditions.
Our experiments show that CLEAR achieves high accuracy in extracting clinical
attributes and provides automated metrics that are strongly aligned with
clinical judgment.

TLDR: 论文探讨了如何通过不同章节组合评估学术论文的新颖性，发现引言、结果和讨论是最佳组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对新颖性评估有限，需探索论文不同章节组合对自动化评估的影响。

Method: 使用自然语言处理技术识别论文结构，以不同章节组合输入预训练语言模型和大语言模型预测新颖性分数。

Result: 引言、结果和讨论是最佳组合，全文输入效果不明显。引言和结果对预测最重要。

Conclusion: 引言、结果和讨论是评估论文新颖性的关键章节，为自动化评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Novelty is a core component of academic papers, and there are multiple
perspectives on the assessment of novelty. Existing methods often focus on word
or entity combinations, which provide limited insights. The content related to
a paper's novelty is typically distributed across different core sections,
e.g., Introduction, Methodology and Results. Therefore, exploring the optimal
combination of sections for evaluating the novelty of a paper is important for
advancing automated novelty assessment. In this paper, we utilize different
combinations of sections from academic papers as inputs to drive language
models to predict novelty scores. We then analyze the results to determine the
optimal section combinations for novelty score prediction. We first employ
natural language processing techniques to identify the sectional structure of
academic papers, categorizing them into introduction, methods, results, and
discussion (IMRaD). Subsequently, we used different combinations of these
sections (e.g., introduction and methods) as inputs for pretrained language
models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), employing novelty scores
provided by human expert reviewers as ground truth labels to obtain prediction
results. The results indicate that using introduction, results and discussion
is most appropriate for assessing the novelty of a paper, while the use of the
entire text does not yield significant results. Furthermore, based on the
results of the PLMs and LLMs, the introduction and results appear to be the
most important section for the task of novelty score prediction. The code and
dataset for this paper can be accessed at

<details>

Motivation: 现有具身代理在单轮交互任务中表现良好，但缺乏对用户个性化语义的理解，需探索记忆利用能力以提供更有效的个性化帮助。

Method: 提出MEMENTO框架，通过两阶段记忆评估设计（对象语义和用户模式）量化记忆利用对任务性能的影响。

Result: 实验显示现有LLMs（包括GPT-4o）在多记忆任务中性能下降30.5%，尤其在用户模式任务中表现较差。

Conclusion: MEMENTO为未来研究提供了评估工具和洞察，推动更有效的个性化具身代理开发。

Abstract: Embodied agents empowered by large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in household object rearrangement tasks. However, these tasks
primarily focus on single-turn interactions with simplified instructions, which
do not truly reflect the challenges of providing meaningful assistance to
users. To provide personalized assistance, embodied agents must understand the
unique semantics that users assign to the physical world (e.g., favorite cup,
breakfast routine) by leveraging prior interaction history to interpret
dynamic, real-world instructions. Yet, the effectiveness of embodied agents in
utilizing memory for personalized assistance remains largely underexplored. To
address this gap, we present MEMENTO, a personalized embodied agent evaluation
framework designed to comprehensively assess memory utilization capabilities to
provide personalized assistance. Our framework consists of a two-stage memory
evaluation process design that enables quantifying the impact of memory
utilization on task performance. This process enables the evaluation of agents'
understanding of personalized knowledge in object rearrangement tasks by
focusing on its role in goal interpretation: (1) the ability to identify target
objects based on personal meaning (object semantics), and (2) the ability to
infer object-location configurations from consistent user patterns, such as
routines (user patterns). Our experiments across various LLMs reveal
significant limitations in memory utilization, with even frontier models like
GPT-4o experiencing a 30.5% performance drop when required to reference
multiple memories, particularly in tasks involving user patterns. These
findings, along with our detailed analyses and case studies, provide valuable
insights for future research in developing more effective personalized embodied
agents. Project website: https://connoriginal.github.io/MEMENTO

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有ICL方法，显著提升LLMs的复杂推理能力。

Conclusion: 课程式ICL策略能有效选择和排序示例，提升LLMs性能，未来将公开项目。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) can significantly enhance the complex reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with the key lying in the
selection and ordering of demonstration examples. Previous methods typically
relied on simple features to measure the relevance between examples. We argue
that these features are not sufficient to reflect the intrinsic connections
between examples. In this study, we propose a curriculum ICL strategy guided by
problem-solving logic. We select demonstration examples by analyzing the
problem-solving logic and order them based on curriculum learning.
Specifically, we constructed a problem-solving logic instruction set based on
the BREAK dataset and fine-tuned a language model to analyze the
problem-solving logic of examples. Subsequently, we selected appropriate
demonstration examples based on problem-solving logic and assessed their
difficulty according to the number of problem-solving steps. In accordance with
the principles of curriculum learning, we ordered the examples from easy to
hard to serve as contextual prompts. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarks indicate that our method outperforms previous ICL approaches in
terms of performance and efficiency, effectively enhancing the complex
reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our project will be publicly available
subsequently.

Result: ULTRAEDIT编辑速度比现有最快方法快7倍，VRAM消耗减少2/3，支持百万级编辑并保持高准确性。

Conclusion: ULTRAEDIT在多种模型编辑场景中表现优异，是首个能在消费级GPU上编辑7B LLM的方法。

Abstract: Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving
information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system
should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing
capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a
promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to
revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made
notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong
adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose ULTRAEDIT-a fundamentally
new editing solution that is training-, subject- and memory-free, making it
particularly well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing.
ULTRAEDIT performs editing through a self-contained process that relies solely
on lightweight linear algebra operations to compute parameter shifts, enabling
fast and consistent parameter modifications with minimal overhead. To improve
scalability in lifelong settings, ULTRAEDIT employs a lifelong normalization
strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it
to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. ULTRAEDIT
achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art
method-which was also the fastest known approach-while consuming less than 1/3
the VRAM, making it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a
24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct ULTRAEDITBENCH-the largest
dataset in the field to date, with over 2M editing pairs-and demonstrate that
our method supports up to 1M edits while maintaining high accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and six models show that ULTRAEDIT
consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing
scenarios. Our code is available at: https://github.com/XiaojieGu/UltraEdit.

TLDR: PaTH是一种基于数据依赖的Householder变换的位置编码方案，相比RoPE在表达能力和性能上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE的位置编码仅依赖相对位置而忽略输入内容，限制了其表达能力。PaTH旨在通过数据依赖的变换提升位置编码的灵活性。

Method: PaTH利用Householder变换的累积乘积，每个变换基于输入数据。采用并行算法训练，并通过FlashAttention风格的分块算法减少I/O开销。

Result: 在合成基准和实际语言建模实验中，PaTH表现优于RoPE及其他基线方法。

Conclusion: PaTH通过数据依赖的位置编码显著提升了模型的表达能力，为位置编码提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core primitive in modern large language models
(LLMs) and AI more broadly. Since attention by itself is permutation-invariant,
position encoding is essential for modeling structured domains such as
language. Rotary position encoding (RoPE) has emerged as the de facto standard
approach for position encoding and is part of many modern LLMs. However, in
RoPE the key/query transformation between two elements in a sequence is only a
function of their relative position and otherwise independent of the actual
input. This limits the expressivity of RoPE-based transformers.
  This paper describes PaTH, a flexible data-dependent position encoding scheme
based on accumulated products of Householder(like) transformations, where each
transformation is data-dependent, i.e., a function of the input. We derive an
efficient parallel algorithm for training through exploiting a compact
representation of products of Householder matrices, and implement a
FlashAttention-style blockwise algorithm that minimizes I/O cost. Across both
targeted synthetic benchmarks and moderate-scale real-world language modeling
experiments, we find that PaTH demonstrates superior performance compared to
RoPE and other recent baselines.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在提升跨语言能力上的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为大语言模型的可解释性提供了见解，并提出了一种改进跨语言能力的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability in cross-lingual
tasks. Understanding how LLMs acquire this ability is crucial for their
interpretability. To quantify the cross-lingual ability of LLMs accurately, we
propose a Word-Level Cross-Lingual Translation Task. To find how LLMs learn
cross-lingual ability, we trace the outputs of LLMs' intermediate layers in the
word translation task. We identify and distinguish two distinct behaviors in
the forward pass of LLMs: co-occurrence behavior and semantic pivot behavior.
We attribute LLMs' two distinct behaviors to the co-occurrence frequency of
words and find the semantic pivot from the pre-training dataset. Finally, to
apply our findings to improve the cross-lingual ability of LLMs, we reconstruct
a semantic pivot-aware pre-training dataset using documents with a high
proportion of semantic pivots. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach in enhancing cross-lingual ability. Our research contributes
insights into the interpretability of LLMs and offers a method for improving
LLMs' cross-lingual ability.

Conclusion: 该研究为改进ATS评估和模型开发提供了工具，有助于提升自动简化文本的质量。

Abstract: The general public often encounters complex texts but does not have the time
or expertise to fully understand them, leading to the spread of misinformation.
Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) helps make information more accessible, but
its evaluation methods have not kept up with advances in text generation,
especially with Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, recent studies
have shown that current ATS metrics do not correlate with the presence of
errors. Manual inspections have further revealed a variety of errors,
underscoring the need for a more nuanced evaluation framework, which is
currently lacking. This resource paper addresses this gap by introducing a test
collection for detecting and classifying errors in simplified texts. First, we
propose a taxonomy of errors, with a formal focus on information distortion.
Next, we introduce a parallel dataset of automatically simplified scientific
texts. This dataset has been human-annotated with labels based on our proposed
taxonomy. Finally, we analyze the quality of the dataset, and we study the
performance of existing models to detect and classify errors from that
taxonomy. These contributions give researchers the tools to better evaluate
errors in ATS, develop more reliable models, and ultimately improve the quality
of automatically simplified texts.

Motivation: 随着大规模预训练模型的发展，理解其输出决定因素变得更重要，而语音输入的特殊性使特征归因方法的应用更具挑战性。

Method: 研究了输入类型、聚合和扰动时间跨度等因素对特征归因方法可靠性的影响，以及这些因素与分类任务特性的交互作用。

Result: 标准特征归因方法在语音领域通常不可靠，但词对齐扰动方法在基于词的分类任务中表现可靠。

Conclusion: 语音处理中需谨慎选择特征归因方法，词对齐扰动方法在特定任务中可能更适用。

Abstract: As the capabilities of large-scale pre-trained models evolve, understanding
the determinants of their outputs becomes more important. Feature attribution
aims to reveal which parts of the input elements contribute the most to model
outputs. In speech processing, the unique characteristics of the input signal
make the application of feature attribution methods challenging. We study how
factors such as input type and aggregation and perturbation timespan impact the
reliability of standard feature attribution methods, and how these factors
interact with characteristics of each classification task. We find that
standard approaches to feature attribution are generally unreliable when
applied to the speech domain, with the exception of word-aligned perturbation
methods when applied to word-based classification tasks.

*Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda,Chen Cecilia Liu,Iryna Gurevych,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文探讨了使用世界价值观调查（WVS）数据调整大型语言模型（LLMs）文化价值观的局限性，并提出通过结合百科全书和情景文化叙事来改善文化独特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖WVS数据调整LLMs的文化价值观，但无法有效捕捉文化细微差别，且可能同质化文化规范。

Method: 作者系统研究了WVS数据训练，并补充了来自Wikipedia和NormAd的百科全书和情景文化叙事。

Result: 结合叙事数据比单独使用WVS数据更能提高文化独特性，但对下游任务效果不一。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了文化价值观对齐的复杂性，需结合多种数据源以指导任务特定行为。

Abstract: Adapting cultural values in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant
challenges, particularly due to biases and limited training data. Prior work
primarily aligns LLMs with different cultural values using World Values Survey
(WVS) data. However, it remains unclear whether this approach effectively
captures cultural nuances or produces distinct cultural representations for
various downstream tasks. In this paper, we systematically investigate
WVS-based training for cultural value adaptation and find that relying solely
on survey data can homogenize cultural norms and interfere with factual
knowledge. To investigate these issues, we augment WVS with encyclopedic and
scenario-based cultural narratives from Wikipedia and NormAd. While these
narratives may have variable effects on downstream tasks, they consistently
improve cultural distinctiveness than survey data alone. Our work highlights
the inherent complexity of aligning cultural values with the goal of guiding
task-specific behavior.

TLDR: Tool-Star是一个基于强化学习的框架，旨在通过多工具协作提升大语言模型的推理能力，解决了工具使用数据稀缺和协作效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多工具协作推理方面仍存在挑战，Tool-Star旨在通过强化学习框架解决这一问题。

Method: 提出工具集成推理数据合成管道和两阶段训练框架，包括冷启动微调和多工具自评强化学习算法。

Result: 在10多个推理基准测试中验证了Tool-Star的有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: Tool-Star通过数据合成和强化学习设计，显著提升了多工具协作推理能力。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning
capabilities via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). However, leveraging
the RL algorithm to empower effective multi-tool collaborative reasoning in
LLMs remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tool-Star, an
RL-based framework designed to empower LLMs to autonomously invoke multiple
external tools during stepwise reasoning. Tool-Star integrates six types of
tools and incorporates systematic designs in both data synthesis and training.
To address the scarcity of tool-use data, we propose a general tool-integrated
reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which combines tool-integrated prompting
with hint-based sampling to automatically and scalably generate tool-use
trajectories. A subsequent quality normalization and difficulty-aware
classification process filters out low-quality samples and organizes the
dataset from easy to hard. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training
framework to enhance multi-tool collaborative reasoning by: (1) cold-start
fine-tuning, which guides LLMs to explore reasoning patterns via
tool-invocation feedback; and (2) a multi-tool self-critic RL algorithm with
hierarchical reward design, which reinforces reward understanding and promotes
effective tool collaboration. Experimental analyses on over 10 challenging
reasoning benchmarks highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of Tool-Star.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于Jensen-Shannon Divergence的方法（ARC-JSD），用于高效准确地在RAG模型中识别关键上下文句子，无需额外微调或代理建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG模型中，将生成内容可靠地归因于特定上下文段（上下文归因）具有挑战性，现有方法计算量大且依赖微调或人工标注。

Method: 采用Jensen-Shannon Divergence驱动的方法（ARC-JSD），无需额外微调或代理建模，高效识别关键上下文句子。

Result: 在多个RAG基准测试（如TyDi QA、Hotpot QA、Musique）中表现出更高的准确性和显著的计算效率提升。

Conclusion: ARC-JSD方法不仅提升了RAG模型的性能，还通过机制分析揭示了负责上下文归因的注意力头和MLP层，为模型内部工作机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs)
combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of
generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to
specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the
computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require
extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel
Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context
(ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context
sentences without additional fine-tuning or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on
a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using
instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and
significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous
surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific
attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context
attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 广告文本生成中多样性的重要性未被充分研究，且广告文本与其他任务（如摘要和机器翻译）在风格和要求上存在显著差异。

Method: 通过考虑多样性增强方法、超参数、输入输出格式和模型，研究多样性与广告质量的关系。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但研究框架为广告文本生成提供了新的分析视角。

Conclusion: 研究填补了广告文本生成中多样性研究的空白，为未来工作提供了基础。

Abstract: In natural language generation for advertising, creating diverse and engaging
ad texts is crucial for capturing a broad audience and avoiding advertising
fatigue. Regardless of the importance of diversity, the impact of the
diversity-enhancing methods in ad text generation -- mainly tested on tasks
such as summarization and machine translation -- has not been thoroughly
explored. Ad text generation significantly differs from these tasks owing to
the text style and requirements. This research explores the relationship
between diversity and ad quality in ad text generation by considering multiple
factors, such as diversity-enhancing methods, their hyperparameters,
input-output formats, and the models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习主要关注单轮任务，而多轮交互的网络代理训练因长时决策复杂性仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过异步生成多样化轨迹，完全依赖任务成功的二元奖励进行在线学习。

Result: 在WebArena-Lite基准测试中，WebAgent-R1显著提升了模型的任务成功率（如Qwen-2.5-3B从6.1%提升至33.9%）。

Conclusion: WebAgent-R1展示了基于思考的提示策略和测试时扩展的有效性，并强调了预热训练阶段的重要性。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
enhancing large language models (LLMs), it has primarily focused on single-turn
tasks such as solving math problems. Training effective web agents for
multi-turn interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of
long-horizon decision-making across dynamic web interfaces. In this work, we
present WebAgent-R1, a simple yet effective end-to-end multi-turn RL framework
for training web agents. It learns directly from online interactions with web
environments by asynchronously generating diverse trajectories, entirely guided
by binary rewards depending on task success. Experiments on the WebArena-Lite
benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of WebAgent-R1, boosting the task
success rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1% to 33.9% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5% to
44.8%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and strong
proprietary models such as OpenAI o3. In-depth analyses reveal the
effectiveness of the thinking-based prompting strategy and test-time scaling
through increased interactions for web tasks. We further investigate different
RL initialization policies by introducing two variants, namely WebAgent-R1-Zero
and WebAgent-R1-CoT, which highlight the importance of the warm-up training
stage (i.e., behavior cloning) and provide insights on incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in web agents.

Motivation: 解决NLP中程序性知识传达的挑战，纯文本难以表达复杂物理动作和空间关系。

Method: 1. 基于选区分析的文本编码机制；2. 成对话语连贯性模型；3. 新的评估协议。

Result: 在三个数据集上显著优于基线，生成更准确的视觉内容。

Conclusion: 为程序性语言与视觉内容的结合提供了新方法，适用于教育、任务指导和多模态语言理解。

Abstract: The effective communication of procedural knowledge remains a significant
challenge in natural language processing (NLP), as purely textual instructions
often fail to convey complex physical actions and spatial relationships. We
address this limitation by proposing a language-driven framework that
translates procedural text into coherent visual instructions. Our approach
models the linguistic structure of instructional content by decomposing it into
goal statements and sequential steps, then conditioning visual generation on
these linguistic elements. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a
constituency parser-based text encoding mechanism that preserves semantic
completeness even with lengthy instructions, (2) a pairwise discourse coherence
model that maintains consistency across instruction sequences, and (3) a novel
evaluation protocol specifically designed for procedural language-to-image
alignment. Our experiments across three instructional datasets (HTStep,
CaptainCook4D, and WikiAll) demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing baselines in generating visuals that accurately reflect
the linguistic content and sequential nature of instructions. This work
contributes to the growing body of research on grounding procedural language in
visual content, with applications spanning education, task guidance, and
multimodal language understanding.

TLDR: RecInter是一个基于代理的推荐系统模拟平台，通过动态交互机制和高级用户建模，显著提升了模拟的真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统A/B测试资源消耗大，离线方法难以捕捉动态用户-平台交互，而现有模拟平台缺乏动态环境重塑机制。

Method: 引入RecInter平台，支持用户行为动态更新物品属性，并加入商家代理响应机制，结合多维用户画像和LLM微调技术。

Result: 平台显著提升了模拟可信度，成功复现了品牌忠诚度等涌现现象。

Conclusion: RecInter为推荐系统研究提供了一个可信的测试平台，动态交互机制是关键。

Abstract: Evaluating and iterating upon recommender systems is crucial, yet traditional
A/B testing is resource-intensive, and offline methods struggle with dynamic
user-platform interactions. While agent-based simulation is promising, existing
platforms often lack a mechanism for user actions to dynamically reshape the
environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecInter, a novel agent-based
simulation platform for recommender systems featuring a robust interaction
mechanism. In RecInter platform, simulated user actions (e.g., likes, reviews,
purchases) dynamically update item attributes in real-time, and introduced
Merchant Agents can reply, fostering a more realistic and evolving ecosystem.
High-fidelity simulation is ensured through Multidimensional User Profiling
module, Advanced Agent Architecture, and LLM fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) enriched interaction data. Our platform achieves significantly improved
simulation credibility and successfully replicates emergent phenomena like
Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect. Experiments demonstrate that this
interaction mechanism is pivotal for simulating realistic system evolution,
establishing our platform as a credible testbed for recommender systems
research.

Method: 采用两种策略：完全微调Transformer模型和仅训练分类器，评估不同设置（如微调策略、模型架构、损失函数等）。

Result: 基于提示的编码器（如mE5和BGE）结合分类器表现优于完全微调XLMR和mBERT，集成模型平均F1-macro得分为56.58。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for SemEval 2025 Task 11 Track A, focusing
on multilabel emotion classification across 28 languages. We explore two main
strategies: fully fine-tuning transformer models and classifier-only training,
evaluating different settings such as fine-tuning strategies, model
architectures, loss functions, encoders, and classifiers. Our findings suggest
that training a classifier on top of prompt-based encoders such as mE5 and BGE
yields significantly better results than fully fine-tuning XLMR and mBERT. Our
best-performing model on the final leaderboard is an ensemble combining
multiple BGE models, where CatBoost serves as the classifier, with different
configurations. This ensemble achieves an average F1-macro score of 56.58

TLDR: LLMs通过对话中的隐性线索推断用户人口统计信息，可能导致对少数群体的低质量回应。研究发现，即使用户明确表明身份，LLMs仍基于刻板印象推断属性，但可通过干预模型内部表征缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs如何基于刻板印象推断用户身份，并研究其对回应质量的影响。

Method: 使用合成对话分析LLMs的潜在用户表征，包括模型内部和生成答案。

Result: LLMs确实基于刻板信号推断人口属性，且干预内部表征可有效缓解偏见。

Conclusion: 需提高LLMs在用户身份表征上的透明度和控制力。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) infer user's demographic information
from subtle cues in the conversation -- a phenomenon called implicit
personalization. Prior work has shown that such inferences can lead to lower
quality responses for users assumed to be from minority groups, even when no
demographic information is explicitly provided. In this work, we systematically
explore how LLMs respond to stereotypical cues using controlled synthetic
conversations, by analyzing the models' latent user representations through
both model internals and generated answers to targeted user questions. Our
findings reveal that LLMs do infer demographic attributes based on these
stereotypical signals, which for a number of groups even persists when the user
explicitly identifies with a different demographic group. Finally, we show that
this form of stereotype-driven implicit personalization can be effectively
mitigated by intervening on the model's internal representations using a
trained linear probe to steer them toward the explicitly stated identity. Our
results highlight the need for greater transparency and control in how LLMs
represent user identity.

Motivation: 提升大型语言模型（LLM）在信息检索系统中的忠实性，确保生成内容的可靠性。

Method: 1. 合成短问答数据构建高质量训练集；2. 提出Dual-GRPO强化学习方法，结合规则奖励优化短长文本生成。

Result: CANOE在11个下游任务中显著提升LLM的忠实性，甚至超越GPT-4o等先进模型。

Conclusion: CANOE框架有效且无需人工标注，为LLM的忠实性提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to be faithful in the provided context
is crucial for building reliable information-seeking systems. Therefore, we
propose a systematic framework, CANOE, to improve the faithfulness of LLMs in
both short-form and long-form generation tasks without human annotations.
Specifically, we first synthesize short-form question-answering (QA) data with
four diverse tasks to construct high-quality and easily verifiable training
data without human annotation. Also, we propose Dual-GRPO, a rule-based
reinforcement learning method that includes three tailored rule-based rewards
derived from synthesized short-form QA data, while simultaneously optimizing
both short-form and long-form response generation. Notably, Dual-GRPO
eliminates the need to manually label preference data to train reward models
and avoids over-optimizing short-form generation when relying only on the
synthesized short-form QA data. Experimental results show that CANOE greatly
improves the faithfulness of LLMs across 11 different downstream tasks, even
outperforming the most advanced LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o and OpenAI o1.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在情感分析等任务中表现出色，但其如何捕捉情感信息的机制尚不明确。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用探测分类器分析Llama模型各层的情感编码，识别最佳捕捉情感信号的层和池化方法。

Result: 情感信息在中间层最集中，检测准确率比提示技术提高14%；解码器模型中，最后一个标记并非最有效；内存需求平均减少57%。

Conclusion: 层特异性探测是情感任务的有效方法，可提升模型效用并降低内存需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become central to NLP,
demonstrating their ability to adapt to various tasks through prompting
techniques, including sentiment analysis. However, we still have a limited
understanding of how these models capture sentiment-related information. This
study probes the hidden layers of Llama models to pinpoint where sentiment
features are most represented and to assess how this affects sentiment
analysis.
  Using probe classifiers, we analyze sentiment encoding across layers and
scales, identifying the layers and pooling methods that best capture sentiment
signals. Our results show that sentiment information is most concentrated in
mid-layers for binary polarity tasks, with detection accuracy increasing up to
14% over prompting techniques. Additionally, we find that in decoder-only
models, the last token is not consistently the most informative for sentiment
encoding. Finally, this approach enables sentiment tasks to be performed with
memory requirements reduced by an average of 57%.
  These insights contribute to a broader understanding of sentiment in LLMs,
suggesting layer-specific probing as an effective approach for sentiment tasks
beyond prompting, with potential to enhance model utility and reduce memory
requirements.

complex narratives, Concise-SAE demonstrates state-of-the-art instruction
adherence across varied tasks without compromising generation quality.

Motivation: 上诉是司法系统中纠错和确保公平的核心机制，但现有LegalAI研究多关注一审案件，忽略了上诉过程。

Method: 构建了包含10,000对匹配的一审和二审文档的数据集，并标注了五个关键维度，提出了五项新任务，评估了20个主流模型。

Result: 所有模型在判决逆转预测任务上的F1分数均低于50%，表明上诉场景的复杂性。

Conclusion: AppealCase数据集有望推动LegalAI在上诉案件分析中的研究，提升司法决策一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in LegalAI have primarily focused on individual case judgment
analysis, often overlooking the critical appellate process within the judicial
system. Appeals serve as a core mechanism for error correction and ensuring
fair trials, making them highly significant both in practice and in research.
To address this gap, we present the AppealCase dataset, consisting of 10,000
pairs of real-world, matched first-instance and second-instance documents
across 91 categories of civil cases. The dataset also includes detailed
annotations along five dimensions central to appellate review: judgment
reversals, reversal reasons, cited legal provisions, claim-level decisions, and
whether there is new information in the second instance. Based on these
annotations, we propose five novel LegalAI tasks and conduct a comprehensive
evaluation across 20 mainstream models. Experimental results reveal that all
current models achieve less than 50% F1 scores on the judgment reversal
prediction task, highlighting the complexity and challenge of the appeal
scenario. We hope that the AppealCase dataset will spur further research in
LegalAI for appellate case analysis and contribute to improving consistency in
judicial decision-making.

Motivation: 语言模型（LMs）在处理知识密集型任务时可能忽略或误用上下文信息，现有CMTs缺乏系统性比较。

Method: 开发CUB基准，测试七种代表性CMTs在三种上下文类型和多样化数据集上的表现。

Result: 多数CMTs难以应对真实场景中的多样化上下文，且在简单合成数据集上表现虚高。

Conclusion: 需开发能处理多种上下文类型的CMTs，并采用更全面的测试方法。

Abstract: Incorporating external knowledge is crucial for knowledge-intensive tasks,
such as question answering and fact checking. However, language models (LMs)
may ignore relevant information that contradicts outdated parametric memory or
be distracted by irrelevant contexts. While many context utilisation
manipulation techniques (CMTs) that encourage or suppress context utilisation
have recently been proposed to alleviate these issues, few have seen systematic
comparison. In this paper, we develop CUB (Context Utilisation Benchmark) to
help practitioners within retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) identify the
best CMT for their needs. CUB allows for rigorous testing on three distinct
context types, observed to capture key challenges in realistic context
utilisation scenarios. With this benchmark, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
methods, representative of the main categories of CMTs, across three diverse
datasets and tasks, applied to nine LMs. Our results show that most of the
existing CMTs struggle to handle the full set of types of contexts that may be
encountered in real-world retrieval-augmented scenarios. Moreover, we find that
many CMTs display an inflated performance on simple synthesised datasets,
compared to more realistic datasets with naturally occurring samples.
Altogether, our results show the need for holistic tests of CMTs and the
development of CMTs that can handle multiple context types.

Abstract: Factual hallucinations are a major challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). They undermine reliability and user trust by generating inaccurate or
fabricated content. Recent studies suggest that when generating false
statements, the internal states of LLMs encode information about truthfulness.
However, these studies often rely on synthetic datasets that lack realism,
which limits generalization when evaluating the factual accuracy of text
generated by the model itself. In this paper, we challenge the findings of
previous work by investigating truthfulness encoding capabilities, leading to
the generation of a more realistic and challenging dataset. Specifically, we
extend previous work by introducing: (1) a strategy for sampling plausible
true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and (2) a procedure for
generating realistic, LLM-dependent true-false datasets from Question Answering
collections. Our analysis of two open-source LLMs reveals that while the
findings from previous studies are partially validated, generalization to
LLM-generated datasets remains challenging. This study lays the groundwork for
future research on factuality in LLMs and offers practical guidelines for more
effective evaluation.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在推理时仍存在偏差问题，且现有基准测试通常只针对单一偏差，无法反映实际应用中多种偏差并存的情况。

Method: 提出多偏差基准测试，并设计因果效应估计引导的多偏差消除方法（CMBE），通过估计和消除多种偏差的因果效应来提升模型性能。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, recent studies have indicated that current
large language models (LLMs) may still utilize bias during inference, leading
to the poor generalizability of LLMs. Some benchmarks are proposed to
investigate the generalizability of LLMs, with each piece of data typically
containing one type of controlled bias. However, a single piece of data may
contain multiple types of biases in practical applications. To bridge this gap,
we propose a multi-bias benchmark where each piece of data contains five types
of biases. The evaluations conducted on this benchmark reveal that the
performance of existing LLMs and debiasing methods is unsatisfying,
highlighting the challenge of eliminating multiple types of biases
simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we propose a causal effect
estimation-guided multi-bias elimination method (CMBE). This method first
estimates the causal effect of multiple types of biases simultaneously.
Subsequently, we eliminate the causal effect of biases from the total causal
effect exerted by both the semantic information and biases during inference.
Experimental results show that CMBE can effectively eliminate multiple types of
bias simultaneously to enhance the generalizability of LLMs.

*Heejae Suh,Yejin Jeon,Deokhyung Kang,Taehee Park,Yejin Min,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为EnSToM的新方法，通过动态调整引导强度来提升小型大语言模型（sLLMs）在任务导向对话系统中的主题一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型大语言模型（sLLMs）在资源受限环境中具有优势，但在任务导向对话系统中难以保持主题一致性，可能导致偏离主题或恶意输入的问题。

Method: 提出Entropy-scaled Steering vectors for Topic Maintenance（EnSToM），根据输入不确定性动态调整引导强度，有效处理偏离主题的干扰。

Result: 实验表明，EnSToM在较小数据量下显著提升了性能，优于微调方法。

Conclusion: EnSToM在不牺牲效率的情况下提升了主题一致性，为sLLM对话系统提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Small large language models (sLLMs) offer the advantage of being lightweight
and efficient, which makes them suitable for resource-constrained environments.
However, sLLMs often struggle to maintain topic consistency in task-oriented
dialogue systems, which is critical for scenarios such as service chatbots.
Specifically, it is important to ensure that the model denies off-topic or
malicious inputs and adheres to its intended functionality so as to prevent
potential misuse and uphold reliability. Towards this, existing activation
engineering approaches have been proposed to manipulate internal activations
during inference. While these methods are effective in certain scenarios, our
preliminary experiments reveal their limitations in ensuring topic adherence.
Therefore, to address this, we propose a novel approach termed Entropy-scaled
Steering vectors for Topic Maintenance (EnSToM). EnSToM dynamically adjusts the
steering intensity based on input uncertainty, which allows the model to handle
off-topic distractors effectively while preserving on-topic accuracy. Our
experiments demonstrate that EnSToM achieves significant performance gain with
a relatively small data size compared to fine-tuning approaches. By improving
topic adherence without compromising efficiency, our approach provides a robust
solution for enhancing sLLM-based dialogue systems.

TLDR: 论文研究了语言混淆现象，通过机制解释性方法揭示了混淆点的位置及原因，并提出通过编辑关键神经元来减少混淆的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言混淆是英语中心模型的主要挑战，研究旨在通过机制解释性方法理解其内部动态。

Method: 结合行为基准测试和神经元级分析，使用LCB基准和TunedLens工具，识别混淆点并分析关键神经元。

Result: 发现混淆主要由最后几层的转换失败引起，编辑关键神经元可显著减少混淆且不影响模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM内部动态提供了新见解，神经元级干预是提升多语言建模鲁棒性的有效方向。

Abstract: Language confusion -- where large language models (LLMs) generate unintended
languages against the user's need -- remains a critical challenge, especially
for English-centric models. We present the first mechanistic interpretability
(MI) study of language confusion, combining behavioral benchmarking with
neuron-level analysis. Using the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB), we show
that confusion points (CPs) -- specific positions where language switches occur
-- are central to this phenomenon. Through layer-wise analysis with TunedLens
and targeted neuron attribution, we reveal that transition failures in the
final layers drive confusion. We further demonstrate that editing a small set
of critical neurons, identified via comparative analysis with
multilingual-tuned models, substantially mitigates confusion without harming
general competence or fluency. Our approach matches multilingual alignment in
confusion reduction for most languages and yields cleaner, higher-quality
outputs. These findings provide new insights into the internal dynamics of LLMs
and highlight neuron-level interventions as a promising direction for robust,
interpretable multilingual language modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: CoLaR框架通过动态压缩潜在空间中的推理过程，显著减少计算开销，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs中Chain-of-Thought推理的计算开销大和效率低的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1) 监督微调中预测压缩嵌入；2) 强化学习探索多样化推理路径。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，CoLaR比基线方法准确率提升14.1%，推理链长度减少53.3%。

Conclusion: CoLaR在高效推理和动态调整方面表现出色，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are
computationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce
Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically
compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training
approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token
prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction
objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a
compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a
specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed
embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that
leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse
reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to:
i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially
reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at
inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive
experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR
achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable
compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8%
performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied
to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR
demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent
reasoning chain length by 82.8%. The code and models will be released upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: 	exttt{ScholarBench}为评估LLMs在学术领域的推理能力提供了有效工具，并展示了其高难度。

Abstract: Prior benchmarks for evaluating the domain-specific knowledge of large
language models (LLMs) lack the scalability to handle complex academic tasks.
To address this, we introduce \texttt{ScholarBench}, a benchmark centered on
deep expert knowledge and complex academic problem-solving, which evaluates the
academic reasoning ability of LLMs and is constructed through a three-step
process. \texttt{ScholarBench} targets more specialized and logically complex
contexts derived from academic literature, encompassing five distinct problem
types. Unlike prior benchmarks, \texttt{ScholarBench} evaluates the
abstraction, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs across eight
distinct research domains. To ensure high-quality evaluation data, we define
category-specific example attributes and design questions that are aligned with
the characteristic research methodologies and discourse structures of each
domain. Additionally, this benchmark operates as an English-Korean bilingual
dataset, facilitating simultaneous evaluation for linguistic capabilities of
LLMs in both languages. The benchmark comprises 5,031 examples in Korean and
5,309 in English, with even state-of-the-art models like o3-mini achieving an
average evaluation score of only 0.543, demonstrating the challenging nature of
this benchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究发现，并非所有元数据类型对LLM训练和性能都有同等贡献，仅URL上下文能加速训练，而质量评分和主题/格式信息无明显帮助。URL条件化仅在推理时使用较长提示时提升性能。此外，上下文感知预训练比无上下文预训练更具可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同类型元数据对LLM训练效率和下游性能的影响，以优化预训练策略。

Method: 系统评估不同元数据类型（如URL、质量评分、主题/格式）在LLM预训练中的作用。

Result: URL上下文加速训练，质量评分和主题/格式信息无显著效果；URL条件化在长提示推理时提升性能；主题/格式元数据可用于生成控制。

Conclusion: 元数据选择对LLM训练和生成控制至关重要，URL上下文最有效，而主题/格式信息适合输出引导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly pretrained on vast corpora of text
without utilizing contextual metadata such as source, quality, or topic,
leading to a context-free learning paradigm. While recent studies suggest that
adding metadata like URL information as context (i.e., auxiliary inputs not
used in the loss calculation) can improve training efficiency and downstream
performance, they offer limited understanding of which types of metadata are
truly effective and under what conditions. In this work, we conduct a
systematic evaluation and find that not all metadata types contribute equally.
Only URL context speeds up training, whereas quality scores and topic/format
domain information offer no clear benefit. Furthermore, the improved downstream
performances of URL conditioning emerge only when longer prompts are used at
inference time. In addition, we demonstrate that context-aware pretraining
enables more controllable generation than context-free pretraining, in a
classifier-free guidance fashion. Although topic and format metadata do not
accelerate training, they are effective for steering outputs, offering
human-interpretable control over generation.

*Spencer Hong,Meng Luo,Xinyi Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: EMULATE是一个新的多代理框架，通过模拟人类行为改进事实核查系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实核查系统通过检索证据和分类的方式偏离了人类行为，因此需要更接近人类的方法。

Method: 提出EMULATE系统，采用多代理框架，每个代理执行小任务（如搜索结果排序、网页内容评估）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于先前工作。

Conclusion: 多代理框架有效提升了事实核查系统的性能。

Abstract: Determining the veracity of atomic claims is an imperative component of many
recently proposed fact-checking systems. Many approaches tackle this problem by
first retrieving evidence by querying a search engine and then performing
classification by providing the evidence set and atomic claim to a large
language model, but this process deviates from what a human would do in order
to perform the task. Recent work attempted to address this issue by proposing
iterative evidence retrieval, allowing for evidence to be collected several
times and only when necessary. Continuing along this line of research, we
propose a novel claim verification system, called EMULATE, which is designed to
better emulate human actions through the use of a multi-agent framework where
each agent performs a small part of the larger task, such as ranking search
results according to predefined criteria or evaluating webpage content.
Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show clear improvements over prior
work, demonstrating the efficacy of our new multi-agent framework.

TLDR: O²-Searcher是一个基于强化学习的搜索代理，旨在解决开放域中开放性和封闭性问题，通过动态知识获取和统一训练机制显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的静态参数知识限制了其在需要开放域最新信息的任务中的表现，尤其是开放性问题。

Method: O²-Searcher利用强化学习，在本地模拟搜索环境中动态获取知识，并通过精心设计的奖励函数统一训练。

Result: O²-Searcher在O²-QA基准上显著优于其他LLM代理，并在封闭性问题基准上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: O²-Searcher通过动态知识获取和适应性策略，有效解决了开放性和封闭性问题，展示了小模型也能实现高性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advancements, are fundamentally
limited by their static parametric knowledge, hindering performance on tasks
requiring open-domain up-to-date information. While enabling LLMs to interact
with external knowledge environments is a promising solution, current efforts
primarily address closed-end problems. Open-ended questions, which
characterized by lacking a standard answer or providing non-unique and diverse
answers, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present O$^2$-Searcher, a
novel search agent leveraging reinforcement learning to effectively tackle both
open-ended and closed-ended questions in the open domain. O$^2$-Searcher
leverages an efficient, locally simulated search environment for dynamic
knowledge acquisition, effectively decoupling the external world knowledge from
model's sophisticated reasoning processes. It employs a unified training
mechanism with meticulously designed reward functions, enabling the agent to
identify problem types and adapt different answer generation strategies.
Furthermore, to evaluate performance on complex open-ended tasks, we construct
O$^2$-QA, a high-quality benchmark featuring 300 manually curated, multi-domain
open-ended questions with associated web page caches. Extensive experiments
show that O$^2$-Searcher, using only a 3B model, significantly surpasses
leading LLM agents on O$^2$-QA. It also achieves SOTA results on various
closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models, while performing on
par with much larger ones.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对LLM多语言事实能力的全面评估，KoLasSimpleQA旨在填补这一空白，支持全球适用性评估。

Method: 通过设计具有单知识点覆盖、绝对客观性、唯一答案和时间稳定性的问题集，采用LLM-as-judge范式评估LLM的事实记忆和自我意识。

Result: 主流LLM在通用领域和语言特定领域表现差异显著，尤其在性能指标、排名、校准和鲁棒性方面。

Conclusion: KoLasSimpleQA有助于识别LLM在多语言环境中的能力边界，并为模型优化提供指导。

Abstract: We introduce KoLasSimpleQA, the first benchmark evaluating the multilingual
factual ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by existing research,
we created the question set with features such as single knowledge point
coverage, absolute objectivity, unique answers, and temporal stability. These
questions enable efficient evaluation using the LLM-as-judge paradigm, testing
both the LLMs' factual memory and self-awareness ("know what they don't know").
KoLasSimpleQA expands existing research in two key dimensions: (1) Breadth
(Multilingual Coverage): It includes 9 languages, supporting global
applicability evaluation. (2) Depth (Dual Domain Design): It covers both the
general domain (global facts) and the language-specific domain (such as
history, culture, and regional traditions) for a comprehensive assessment of
multilingual capabilities. We evaluated mainstream LLMs, including traditional
LLM and emerging Large Reasoning Models. Results show significant performance
differences between the two domains, particularly in performance metrics,
ranking, calibration, and robustness. This highlights the need for targeted
evaluation and optimization in multilingual contexts. We hope KoLasSimpleQA
will help the research community better identify LLM capability boundaries in
multilingual contexts and provide guidance for model optimization. We will
release KoLasSimpleQA at https://github.com/opendatalab/KoLasSimpleQA .

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs在处理气候变迁迷因中复杂框架和立场表达时的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Media framing refers to the emphasis on specific aspects of perceived reality
to shape how an issue is defined and understood. Its primary purpose is to
shape public perceptions often in alignment with the authors' opinions and
stances. However, the interaction between stance and media frame remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we apply an interdisciplinary approach to
conceptualize and computationally explore this interaction with internet memes
on climate change. We curate CLIMATEMEMES, the first dataset of climate-change
memes annotated with both stance and media frames, inspired by research in
communication science. CLIMATEMEMES includes 1,184 memes sourced from 47
subreddits, enabling analysis of frame prominence over time and communities,
and sheds light on the framing preferences of different stance holders. We
propose two meme understanding tasks: stance detection and media frame
detection. We evaluate LLaVA-NeXT and Molmo in various setups, and report the
corresponding results on their LLM backbone. Human captions consistently
enhance performance. Synthetic captions and human-corrected OCR also help
occasionally. Our findings highlight that VLMs perform well on stance, but
struggle on frames, where LLMs outperform VLMs. Finally, we analyze VLMs'
limitations in handling nuanced frames and stance expressions on climate change
internet memes.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在情感支持中常提供通用回复，无法满足用户个性化需求，需改进以更好地理解用户偏好。

Method: 框架分为两阶段：情感支持经验获取（基础支持微调）和自改进（通过自反思和优化生成个性化响应）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型的情感支持能力，减少了无用回复和用户偏好与输出的差异。

Conclusion: 自进化框架有效提升了LLMs在情感支持中的个性化响应能力。

Abstract: Effective emotional support hinges on understanding users' emotions and needs
to provide meaningful comfort during multi-turn interactions. Large Language
Models (LLMs) show great potential for expressing empathy; however, they often
deliver generic and one-size-fits-all responses that fail to address users'
specific needs. To tackle this issue, we propose a self-evolution framework
designed to help LLMs improve their responses to better align with users'
implicit preferences concerning user profiles (personalities), emotional
states, and specific situations. Our framework consists of two distinct phases:
\textit{(1)} \textit{Emotional Support Experience Acquisition}, where LLMs are
fine-tuned on limited emotional support conversation data to provide basic
support, and \textit{(2)} \textit{Self-Improvement for Personalized Emotional
Support}, where LLMs leverage self-reflection and self-refinement to generate
personalized responses. Through iterative direct preference optimization
between the pre- and post-refined responses, our model generates responses that
reflect a better understanding of the user's implicit preferences. Extensive
experiments and evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly enhances
the model's performance in emotional support, reducing unhelpful responses and
minimizing discrepancies between user preferences and model outputs.

Abstract: High-quality machine translation systems based on large language models
(LLMs) have simplified the production of personalized translations reflecting
specific stylistic constraints. However, these systems still struggle in
settings where stylistic requirements are less explicit and might be harder to
convey via prompting. We explore various strategies for personalizing
LLM-generated translations in low-resource settings, focusing on the
challenging literary translation domain. We explore prompting strategies and
inference-time interventions for steering model generations towards a
personalized style, and propose a contrastive framework exploiting latent
concepts extracted from sparse autoencoders to identify salient personalization
properties. Our results show that steering achieves strong personalization
while preserving translation quality. We further examine the impact of steering
on LLM representations, finding model layers with a relevant impact for
personalization are impacted similarly by multi-shot prompting and our steering
method, suggesting similar mechanism at play.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in machine translation (MT). However, most advanced MT-specific
LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as
human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often
expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for
MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging
rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as
the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs,
e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like
Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks
from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR
with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B,
achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese
translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters
and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.
Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism
compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its
complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide
valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have
publicly released our code, data and models.

alleviate their divergence among questions. We also measure an LLM's confidence
when it confronts with adversary opinions from other LLMs and observe a
concurrence between LLM's confidence and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges in intelligent processing of Chinese

evaluating classical texts based on Suanjing Shishu. It systematically assesses
the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of mainstream reasoning models
under the unique linguistic constraints of classical Chinese. Through
machine-assisted annotation and manual verification, 538 mathematical problems
were extracted from 8 canonical texts, forming a structured dataset centered on
the "Question-Answer-Solution" framework, supplemented by problem types and
difficulty levels. Dual evaluation modes--closed-book (autonomous
problem-solving) and open-book (reproducing classical solution methods)--were
designed to evaluate the performance of six reasoning models on ancient Chinese
mathematical problems. Results indicate that reasoning models can partially
comprehend and solve these problems, yet their overall performance remains
inferior to benchmarks on modern mathematical tasks. Enhancing models'
classical Chinese comprehension and cultural knowledge should be prioritized
for optimization. This study provides methodological support for mining
mathematical knowledge from ancient texts and disseminating traditional
culture, while offering new perspectives for evaluating cross-linguistic and
cross-cultural capabilities of reasoning models.

field, developed through continual pretraining on 2 billion Japanese
pharmaceutical tokens and 8 billion English biomedical tokens. To enable
rigorous evaluation, we introduce three new benchmarks: YakugakuQA, based on
national pharmacist licensing exams; NayoseQA, which tests cross-lingual
synonym and terminology normalization; and SogoCheck, a novel task designed to
assess consistency reasoning between paired statements. We evaluate our model
against both open-source medical LLMs and commercial models, including GPT-4o.
Results show that our domain-specific model outperforms existing open models
and achieves competitive performance with commercial ones, particularly on
terminology-heavy and knowledge-based tasks. Interestingly, even GPT-4o
performs poorly on SogoCheck, suggesting that cross-sentence consistency
reasoning remains an open challenge. Our benchmark suite offers a broader
diagnostic lens for pharmaceutical NLP, covering factual recall, lexical
variation, and logical consistency. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
building practical, secure, and cost-effective language models for Japanese
domain-specific applications, and provides reusable evaluation resources for
future research in pharmaceutical and healthcare NLP. Our model, codes, and
datasets are released at https://github.com/EQUES-Inc/pharma-LLM-eval.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文研究了Transformer语言模型如何通过训练获得元学习能力，以解决上下文中的任务，而不仅仅是复制答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型如何通过上下文元学习任务，而非仅复制答案，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 扩展了复制任务为上下文元学习任务，分析模型训练过程中电路动态变化。

Result: 发现元学习能力获取分为多个阶段，每个阶段出现独特电路，与单阶段变化的归纳头形成对比。

Conclusion: 揭示了Transformer上下文学习能力的来源，深化了对模型动态的理解。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), where
predictions are made adaptively based on context. While prior work links
induction heads to ICL through a sudden jump in accuracy, this can only account
for ICL when the answer is included within the context. However, an important
property of practical ICL in large language models is the ability to meta-learn
how to solve tasks from context, rather than just copying answers from context;
how such an ability is obtained during training is largely unexplored. In this
paper, we experimentally clarify how such meta-learning ability is acquired by
analyzing the dynamics of the model's circuit during training. Specifically, we
extend the copy task from previous research into an In-Context Meta Learning
setting, where models must infer a task from examples to answer queries.
Interestingly, in this setting, we find that there are multiple phases in the
process of acquiring such abilities, and that a unique circuit emerges in each
phase, contrasting with the single-phases change in induction heads. The
emergence of such circuits can be related to several phenomena known in large
language models, and our analysis lead to a deeper understanding of the source
of the transformer's ICL ability.

*Zeping Yu,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种名为Locate-then-Merge的无训练参数融合框架，通过定位重要参数并选择性融合，解决了多模态大语言模型在指令调优阶段的语言能力退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在指令调优阶段会导致基础语言模型的语言能力严重退化，即使是强大的Llama3模型也存在此问题。

Method: 提出Locate-then-Merge框架，结合Neuron-Fusion策略，通过定位重要参数并选择性融合，保留视觉能力的同时减少语言能力退化。

Result: 在13个语言和视觉任务基准测试中，Neuron-Fusion优于现有模型融合方法，并有效减少生成中的上下文幻觉。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态任务中实现了视觉适应能力的保留和语言能力的稳定，为模型融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive
performance, the multimodal instruction tuning stage often causes catastrophic
forgetting of the base LLM's language ability, even in strong models like
Llama3. To address this, we propose Locate-then-Merge, a training-free
parameter fusion framework that first locates important parameters and then
selectively merges them. We further introduce Neuron-Fusion, a neuron-level
strategy that preserves the influence of neurons with large parameter
shifts--neurons likely responsible for newly acquired visual
capabilities--while attenuating the influence of neurons with smaller changes
that likely encode general-purpose language skills. This design enables better
retention of visual adaptation while mitigating language degradation.
Experiments on 13 benchmarks across both language and visual tasks show that
Neuron-Fusion consistently outperforms existing model merging methods. Further
analysis reveals that our method effectively reduces context hallucination in
generation.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在全球应用中的普及，确保其在多语言环境中无毒性成为关键挑战。

Method: 采用跨语言范式，通过有限数据评估毒性减少效果，并研究其对非毒性任务性能的影响。

Result: 揭示了安全性与知识保留之间的权衡，代码和数据集已公开。

Conclusion: 跨语言去毒方法在多语言环境中有效，但需平衡安全性与模型性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in global
applications, ensuring that they are toxicity-free across diverse linguistic
contexts remains a critical challenge. We explore "Cross-lingual
Detoxification", a cross-lingual paradigm that mitigates toxicity, enabling
detoxification capabilities to transfer between high and low-resource languages
across different script families. We analyze cross-lingual detoxification's
effectiveness through 504 extensive settings to evaluate toxicity reduction in
cross-distribution settings with limited data and investigate how mitigation
impacts model performance on non-toxic tasks, revealing trade-offs between
safety and knowledge preservation. Our code and dataset are publicly available

*Florentin Beck,William Rudman,Carsten Eickhoff*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: TRIM是一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）的新型剪枝方法，通过逐行调整稀疏度，显著提升模型在高稀疏率下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一次性剪枝方法在高稀疏率下表现不佳，需要更精细的稀疏度分配策略。

Method: TRIM采用迭代调整过程，基于质量指标为每层的输出维度（行）分配不同的稀疏度，以减少质量保留的方差。

Result: 在多种LLM和稀疏率下，TRIM显著降低了困惑度（如Qwen2.5-14B降低48%），并提升了稳定性。

Conclusion: 细粒度的维度稀疏度调整是极端LLM压缩的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant computational and memory
challenges due to their extensive size, making pruning essential for their
efficient deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods often apply uniform
sparsity constraints across layers or within each layer, resulting in
suboptimal performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. This work
introduces TRIM (Targeted Row-wise Iterative Metric-driven pruning), a novel
approach that applies varying sparsity ratios to individual output dimensions
(rows) within each layer. TRIM employs an iterative adjustment process guided
by quality metrics to optimize dimension-wise sparsity allocation, focusing on
reducing variance in quality retention across outputs to preserve critical
information. TRIM can be seamlessly integrated with existing layer-wise pruning
strategies. Our evaluations on perplexity and zero-shot tasks across diverse
LLM families (Qwen2.5, LLaMA-2, and OPT) and sparsity levels demonstrate that
TRIM achieves new state-of-the-art results and enhances stability. For
instance, at 80% sparsity, TRIM reduces perplexity by 48% for Qwen2.5-14B and
over 90% for OPT-13B compared to baseline methods. We conclude that
fine-grained, dimension-wise sparsity adaptation is crucial for pushing the
limits of extreme LLM compression. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本和视觉语言模型的指令跟随能力已被研究，但音频LLM的指令跟随能力尚未深入探索。

Method: 提出IFEval-Audio数据集，包含280个音频-指令-答案三元组，覆盖六个维度，用于评估模型性能。

Result: 通过该数据集对现有音频LLM进行基准测试，评估其指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: IFEval-Audio为音频LLM的指令跟随研究提供了工具，并公开数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong instruction-following
capabilities in text-based tasks. However, this ability often deteriorates in
multimodal models after alignment with non-text modalities such as images or
audio. While several recent efforts have investigated instruction-following
performance in text and vision-language models, instruction-following in
audio-based large language models remains largely unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we introduce IFEval-Audio, a novel evaluation dataset designed to assess
the ability to follow instructions in an audio LLM. IFEval-Audio contains 280
audio-instruction-answer triples across six diverse dimensions: Content,
Capitalization, Symbol, List Structure, Length, and Format. Each example pairs
an audio input with a text instruction, requiring the model to generate an
output that follows a specified structure. We benchmark state-of-the-art audio
LLMs on their ability to follow audio-involved instructions. The dataset is
released publicly to support future research in this emerging area.

Motivation: 传统CoT依赖显式语言推理，效率低且不适用于抽象推理，潜在CoT通过解耦推理与语言，提供更灵活高效的解决方案。

Method: 从四个角度（token-wise策略、内部机制、分析和应用）提出分类法，并对代表性方法进行比较分析。

Result: 潜在CoT推理在认知表示和推理效率方面表现出优势，但仍存在开放挑战。

Conclusion: 本文为潜在CoT推理的研究提供了结构化基础，并展望了未来发展方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, conventional
CoT relies on reasoning steps explicitly verbalized in natural language,
introducing inefficiencies and limiting its applicability to abstract
reasoning. To address this, there has been growing research interest in latent
CoT reasoning, where inference occurs within latent spaces. By decoupling
reasoning from language, latent reasoning promises richer cognitive
representations and more flexible, faster inference. Researchers have explored
various directions in this promising field, including training methodologies,
structural innovations, and internal reasoning mechanisms. This paper presents
a comprehensive overview and analysis of this reasoning paradigm. We begin by
proposing a unified taxonomy from four perspectives: token-wise strategies,
internal mechanisms, analysis, and applications. We then provide in-depth
discussions and comparative analyses of representative methods, highlighting
their design patterns, strengths, and open challenges. We aim to provide a
structured foundation for advancing this emerging direction in LLM reasoning.

Result: 发现数据特征与模型脆弱性相关，提出了防御策略。

Conclusion: 数据集设计对保持模型对齐至关重要，需关注数据特征以减少脆弱性。

Abstract: As large language models gain popularity, their vulnerability to adversarial
attacks remains a primary concern. While fine-tuning models on domain-specific
datasets is often employed to improve model performance, it can introduce
vulnerabilities within the underlying model. In this work, we investigate
Accidental Misalignment, unexpected vulnerabilities arising from
characteristics of fine-tuning data. We begin by identifying potential
correlation factors such as linguistic features, semantic similarity, and
toxicity within our experimental datasets. We then evaluate the adversarial
performance of these fine-tuned models and assess how dataset factors correlate
with attack success rates. Lastly, we explore potential causal links, offering
new insights into adversarial defense strategies and highlighting the crucial
role of dataset design in preserving model alignment. Our code is available at

glosses from orthographic input, leveraging shared linguistic representations
obtained through a common documentary process to enhance model generalization.
To further address data scarcity, we integrate synthetic training data

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为ESA-DGR的统一框架，通过双向证据自对齐（TW-ESA）和双门推理增强（DGR）模块，解决了大语言模型在知识密集型多步推理任务中的证据提取和推理问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型多步推理任务中面临证据提取和逻辑推理的挑战，现有方法常提取语义相关但逻辑无关的证据，导致推理错误。

Method: 提出TW-ESA模块，通过严格推理与LLM推理的双向对齐增强证据因果逻辑理解；提出DGR模块，逐步融合LLM内在知识以提升推理准确性和鲁棒性。

Result: 在三个KIMSR数据集上，ESA-DGR显著优于现有方法，平均EM和F1分数分别提升4%和5%。

Conclusion: ESA-DGR框架有效解决了LLM在复杂推理任务中的证据提取和推理问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encounter difficulties in knowledge-intensive
multi-step reasoning (KIMSR) tasks. One challenge is how to effectively extract
and represent rationale evidence. The current methods often extract
semantically relevant but logically irrelevant evidence, resulting in flawed
reasoning and inaccurate responses. We propose a two-way evidence
self-alignment (TW-ESA) module, which utilizes the mutual alignment between
strict reasoning and LLM reasoning to enhance its understanding of the causal
logic of evidence, thereby addressing the first challenge. Another challenge is
how to utilize the rationale evidence and LLM's intrinsic knowledge for
accurate reasoning when the evidence contains uncertainty. We propose a
dual-gated reasoning enhancement (DGR) module to gradually fuse useful
knowledge of LLM within strict reasoning, which can enable the model to perform
accurate reasoning by focusing on causal elements in the evidence and exhibit
greater robustness. The two modules are collaboratively trained in a unified
framework ESA-DGR. Extensive experiments on three diverse and challenging KIMSR
datasets reveal that ESA-DGR significantly surpasses state-of-the-art LLM-based
fine-tuning methods, with remarkable average improvements of 4% in exact match
(EM) and 5% in F1 score. The implementation code is available at

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition(NER) for low-resource languages aims to produce
robust systems for languages where there is limited labeled training data
available, and has been an area of increasing interest within NLP. Data
augmentation for increasing the amount of low-resource labeled data is a common
practice. In this paper, we explore the role of synthetic data in the context
of multilingual, low-resource NER, considering 11 languages from diverse
language families. Our results suggest that synthetic data does in fact hold
promise for low-resource language NER, though we see significant variation
between languages.

Result: 在五个基准测试中，仅用871个样本的SFT表现优于RL基线。

Conclusion: SFT是解决数据稀缺瓶颈的有效途径，为高效深度搜索系统提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have advanced large language
models (LLMs) in complex deep search scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning
and iterative information retrieval. However, existing approaches face critical
limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the
distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive
computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces
SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap
through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our
approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user
interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria
curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output
side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that
SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based
baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically
addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for
efficient deep search systems. Our code is available at

TLDR: R1-Compress是一种两阶段分块级压缩框架，用于减少Long-CoT的令牌使用量，同时保持推理准确性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩方法（实例级和令牌级）会牺牲局部推理信号或导致输出不连贯，因此需要一种新方法来解决这些限制。

Method: R1-Compress将Long-CoT分块，应用LLM驱动的块内压缩，并通过块间搜索机制选择简短且连贯的序列。

Result: 在MATH500等数据集上，R1-Compress显著减少令牌使用量（约20%），同时保持高推理准确性（92.4%）。

Conclusion: R1-Compress是一种高效且有效的压缩方法，适用于长链推理任务。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances large language models (LLMs) by
enabling step-by-step problem-solving, yet its extension to Long-CoT introduces
substantial computational overhead due to increased token length. Existing
compression approaches -- instance-level and token-level -- either sacrifice
essential local reasoning signals like reflection or yield incoherent outputs.
To address these limitations, we propose R1-Compress, a two-stage chunk-level
compression framework that preserves both local information and coherence. Our
method segments Long-CoT into manageable chunks, applies LLM-driven inner-chunk
compression, and employs an inter-chunk search mechanism to select the short
and coherent sequence. Experiments on Qwen2.5-Instruct models across MATH500,
AIME24, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that R1-Compress significantly reduces
token usage while maintaining comparable reasoning accuracy. On MATH500,
R1-Compress achieves an accuracy of 92.4%, with only a 0.6% drop compared to
the Long-CoT baseline, while reducing token usage by about 20%. Source code

comments that target individuals or groups. Our approach involves a
comprehensive annotation framework that labels a diverse data set for various
target categories and specific target words within the conversational context.
We perform a comparative analysis of annotations from human experts, crowd
annotators, and ChatGPT, revealing strengths and limitations of each method in
recognizing both explicit hate speech and subtler discriminatory language. Our
findings highlight the significant role of contextual factors in identifying
hate speech and uncover new categories of targeting, such as social belief and
body image. We also address the challenges and subjective judgments involved in
annotation and the limitations of ChatGPT in grasping nuanced language. This
study provides insights for improving automated content moderation strategies

Motivation: 印度语言具有复杂的形态结构，需要合适的子词分词技术来优化机器翻译效果。

Method: 比较了SentencePiece、BPE和WordPiece在统计、神经及多语言神经MT模型中的表现，使用BLEU等标准指标评估。

Conclusion: 子词分词技术的选择对机器翻译性能有显著影响，需根据模型类型和语言对选择合适的分词方法。

Abstract: Tokenization is the act of breaking down text into smaller parts, or tokens,
that are easier for machines to process. This is a key phase in machine
translation (MT) models. Subword tokenization enhances this process by breaking
down words into smaller subword units, which is especially beneficial in
languages with complicated morphology or a vast vocabulary. It is useful in
capturing the intricate structure of words in Indian languages (ILs), such as
prefixes, suffixes, and other morphological variations. These languages
frequently use agglutinative structures, in which words are formed by the
combination of multiple morphemes such as suffixes, prefixes, and stems. As a
result, a suitable tokenization strategy must be chosen to address these
scenarios. This paper examines how different subword tokenization techniques,
such as SentencePiece, Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), and WordPiece Tokenization,
affect ILs. The effectiveness of these subword tokenization techniques is
investigated in statistical, neural, and multilingual neural machine
translation models. All models are examined using standard evaluation metrics,
such as the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score, TER, METEOR, CHRF,
RIBES, and COMET. Based on the results, it appears that for the majority of
language pairs for the Statistical and Neural MT models, the SentencePiece
tokenizer continuously performed better than other tokenizers in terms of BLEU
score. However, BPE tokenization outperformed other tokenization techniques in
the context of Multilingual Neural Machine Translation model. The results show
that, despite using the same tokenizer and dataset for each model, translations
from ILs to English surpassed translations from English to ILs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在全球AI应用中的重要性日益增加，但现有的安全对齐方法（如RLHF和DPO）主要针对单语言，难以处理多语言数据。

Method: 提出Multilingual reward gaP Optimization (MPO)，利用主导语言（英语）的安全能力，通过最小化奖励差距来提升多语言安全对齐。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1、Gemma-2和Qwen2.5三个模型上的实验验证了MPO的有效性，且不影响多语言通用性能。

Conclusion: MPO是一种有效的多语言安全对齐方法，能够在不损害通用性能的情况下提升安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to AI
applications worldwide, necessitating robust multilingual safety alignment to
ensure secure deployment across diverse linguistic contexts. Existing
preference learning methods for safety alignment, such as RLHF and DPO, are
primarily monolingual and struggle with noisy multilingual data. To address
these limitations, we introduce Multilingual reward gaP Optimization (MPO), a
novel approach that leverages the well-aligned safety capabilities of the
dominant language (English) to improve safety alignment across multiple
languages. MPO directly minimizes the reward gap difference between the
dominant language and target languages, effectively transferring safety
capabilities while preserving the original strengths of the dominant language.
Extensive experiments on three LLMs, LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2 and Qwen2.5, validate
MPO's efficacy in multilingual safety alignment without degrading general
multilingual utility.

### [262] [CASTILLO: Characterizing Response Length Distributions of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16881)
*Daniel F. Perez-Ramirez,Dejan Kostic,Magnus Boman*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文介绍了CASTILLO数据集，用于分析13种开源大语言模型在7种指令遵循语料库上的响应长度分布，揭示了模型间和模型内的显著变异性，并支持预测模型的开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自回归文本生成的随机性和变长特性，高效管理大语言模型的计算资源具有挑战性。准确预测响应长度有助于资源分配，但现有方法存在偏差或忽略模型和提示的变异性。

Method: 通过固定解码超参数为每个〈提示，模型〉样本对生成10个独立完成，记录响应长度，并发布统计数据和生成设置。

Result: 分析显示响应长度在模型间和模型内存在显著变异性，以及模型特定行为和部分文本退化现象。

Conclusion: CASTILLO数据集支持预测模型的开发，并为分析模型生成行为提供了系统框架，相关数据和代码已公开。

Abstract: Efficiently managing compute resources for Large Language Model (LLM)
inference remains challenging due to the inherently stochastic and variable
lengths of autoregressive text generation. Accurately estimating response
lengths in advance enables proactive resource allocation, yet existing
approaches either bias text generation towards certain lengths or rely on
assumptions that ignore model- and prompt-specific variability. We introduce
CASTILLO, a dataset characterizing response length distributions across 13
widely-used open-source LLMs evaluated on seven distinct instruction-following
corpora. For each $\langle$prompt, model$\rangle$ sample pair, we generate 10
independent completions using fixed decoding hyper-parameters, record the token
length of each response, and publish summary statistics (mean, std-dev,
percentiles), along with the shortest and longest completions, and the exact
generation settings. Our analysis reveals significant inter- and intra-model
variability in response lengths (even under identical generation settings), as
well as model-specific behaviors and occurrences of partial text degeneration
in only subsets of responses. CASTILLO enables the development of predictive
models for proactive scheduling and provides a systematic framework for
analyzing model-specific generation behaviors. We publicly release the dataset
and code to foster research at the intersection of generative language modeling
and systems.

*Zeyu Wei,Shuo Wang,Xiaohui Rong,Xuemin Liu,He Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该研究首次系统性探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）幻觉现象与增量上下文注入导致内部状态漂移的关系，揭示了幻觉频率与表征漂移的规律，并提出了预测和缓解机制的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉（可信但错误的输出）是LLM可靠部署的主要障碍，研究旨在揭示其与上下文注入导致的内部状态漂移的关联。

Method: 使用TruthfulQA构建两种16轮“滴定”测试，分别注入相关但有缺陷的片段和误导内容，通过三视角检测器和多种指标（余弦、熵、JS、Spearman）跟踪隐藏状态和注意力图的漂移。

Result: 结果显示幻觉频率和表征漂移单调增长并在5-7轮后趋于稳定；相关上下文导致高置信度“自洽”幻觉，无关上下文引发主题漂移错误；JS和Spearman漂移的收敛标志幻觉固化的阈值。

Conclusion: 研究为内在幻觉预测和上下文感知缓解机制提供了实证基础，揭示了模型规模与错误模式的关联。

Abstract: Hallucinations -- plausible yet erroneous outputs -- remain a critical
barrier to reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). We present the
first systematic study linking hallucination incidence to internal-state drift
induced by incremental context injection. Using TruthfulQA, we construct two
16-round "titration" tracks per question: one appends relevant but partially
flawed snippets, the other injects deliberately misleading content. Across six
open-source LLMs, we track overt hallucination rates with a tri-perspective
detector and covert dynamics via cosine, entropy, JS and Spearman drifts of
hidden states and attention maps. Results reveal (1) monotonic growth of
hallucination frequency and representation drift that plateaus after 5--7
rounds; (2) relevant context drives deeper semantic assimilation, producing
high-confidence "self-consistent" hallucinations, whereas irrelevant context
induces topic-drift errors anchored by attention re-routing; and (3)
convergence of JS-Drift ($\sim0.69$) and Spearman-Drift ($\sim0$) marks an
"attention-locking" threshold beyond which hallucinations solidify and become
resistant to correction. Correlation analyses expose a seesaw between
assimilation capacity and attention diffusion, clarifying size-dependent error
modes. These findings supply empirical foundations for intrinsic hallucination
prediction and context-aware mitigation mechanisms.

*Jintian Shao,Hongyi Huang,Jiayi Wu,Beiwen Zhang,ZhiYu Wu,You Shan,MingKai Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的损失函数Power-Law Decay Loss (PDL)，用于优化文本生成任务的微调过程，通过降低高频词权重、提高低频词权重，提升生成文本的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准交叉熵损失函数在微调阶段对所有词元平等对待，导致模型过度关注高频低信息词元，而忽视低频高信息词元。PDL的动机源于信息理论和语言学观察：词元的信息量通常与其出现频率成反比。

Method: PDL基于词元在训练语料中的频率，按幂律衰减重新加权标准交叉熵损失中的词元贡献。高频词权重降低，低频高信息词权重提高。

Result: PDL引导模型在微调时更关注学习生成具有特定和独特信息的词元，从而提升生成文本的质量、多样性和信息量。

Conclusion: PDL在抽象摘要、对话系统和风格转换等文本生成微调任务中具有潜在应用和优势。

Abstract: During the finetuning stage of text generation tasks, standard cross-entropy
loss treats all tokens equally. This can lead models to overemphasize
high-frequency, low-information tokens, neglecting lower-frequency tokens
crucial for specificity and informativeness in generated content. This paper
introduces a novel loss function, Power-Law Decay Loss (PDL), specifically
designed to optimize the finetuning process for text generation. The core
motivation for PDL stems from observations in information theory and
linguistics: the informativeness of a token is often inversely proportional to
its frequency of occurrence. PDL re-weights the contribution of each token in
the standard cross-entropy loss based on its frequency in the training corpus,
following a power-law decay. Specifically, the weights for high-frequency
tokens are reduced, while low-frequency, information-dense tokens are assigned
higher weights. This mechanism guides the model during finetuning to focus more
on learning and generating tokens that convey specific and unique information,
thereby enhancing the quality, diversity, and informativeness of the generated
text. We theoretically elaborate on the motivation and construction of PDL and
discuss its potential applications and advantages across various text
generation finetuning tasks, such as abstractive summarization, dialogue
systems, and style transfer.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文介绍了UNCLE基准，用于评估大语言模型在长短期问答中表达不确定性的能力，发现现有模型在长文本生成中表现不佳，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在长文本生成中易产生幻觉的问题，通过评估和改进其表达不确定性的能力。

Method: 引入UNCLE基准，包含多领域数据和新评估指标，探索提示和训练方法改进模型表现。

Result: 当前模型在长文本生成中无法有效表达不确定性，训练方法改进效果更显著。

Conclusion: UNCLE为未来研究提供了方向，揭示了长短期问答中不确定性表达的差异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, particularly in
long-form generations. A promising direction to mitigate hallucination is to
teach LLMs to express uncertainty explicitly when they lack sufficient
knowledge. However, existing work lacks direct and fair evaluation of LLMs'
ability to express uncertainty effectively in long-form generation. To address
this gap, we first introduce UNCLE, a benchmark designed to evaluate
uncertainty expression in both long- and short-form question answering (QA).
UNCLE spans five domains and comprises 4k long-form QA instances and over 20k
short-form QA pairs. Our dataset is the first to directly bridge short- and
long-form QA with paired questions and gold-standard answers. Along with the
benchmark, we propose a suite of new metrics to assess the models' capabilities
to selectively express uncertainty. Using UNCLE, we then demonstrate that
current models fail to convey uncertainty appropriately in long-form
generation. We further explore both prompt-based and training-based methods to
improve models' performance, with the training-based methods yielding greater
gains. Further analysis of alignment gaps between short- and long-form
uncertainty expression highlights promising directions for future research
using UNCLE.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种自动化方法，通过建模潜在行为属性来指导语言模型生成更符合人类偏好的响应，并通过聚类压缩这些属性。实验表明，该方法能显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要人工标注行为属性，耗时耗力。本文旨在自动化这一过程，通过挖掘模型自身的潜在属性来优化生成质量。

Method: 采用后验正则化的蒙特卡洛期望最大化方法，挖掘并压缩潜在行为属性，通过聚类生成可解释的规则集，并指导模型自我改进。

Result: 实验显示，该方法使较小模型（7-8B参数）在AlpacaEval胜率提升8-10%，MT-Bench平均提升0.3分，IFEval原则遵循胜率提升19-23%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了自动化原则驱动后训练在持续自我改进中的潜力，同时保持了模型的性能与可解释性。

Abstract: When language model (LM) users aim to improve the quality of its generations,
it is crucial to specify concrete behavioral attributes that the model should
strive to reflect. However, curating such principles across many domains, even
non-exhaustively, requires a labor-intensive annotation process. To automate
this process, we propose eliciting these latent attributes guiding model
reasoning towards human-preferred responses by explicitly modeling them in a
self-correction setting. Our approach mines new principles from the LM itself
and compresses the discovered elements to an interpretable set via clustering.
Specifically, we employ an approximation of posterior-regularized Monte Carlo
Expectation-Maximization to both identify a condensed set of the most effective
latent principles and teach the LM to strategically invoke them in order to
intrinsically refine its responses. We demonstrate that bootstrapping our
algorithm over multiple iterations enables smaller language models (7-8B
parameters) to self-improve, achieving +8-10% in AlpacaEval win-rate, an
average of +0.3 on MT-Bench, and +19-23% in principle-following win-rate on
IFEval. We also show that clustering the principles yields interpretable and
diverse model-generated constitutions while retaining model performance. The
gains our method achieves highlight the potential of automated,
principle-driven post-training recipes toward continual self-improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PII匿名化是开放科学数据共享的重要障碍，现有方法在误差阈值和召回/精确度权衡上仍有局限。

Method: 提出PIIvot框架，利用数据上下文简化PII检测问题。

Result: 发布了QATD-2k数据集，是目前最大的开源教育对话数据集。

Conclusion: PIIvot框架有效简化PII匿名化，QATD-2k数据集填补了教育对话数据的空白。

Abstract: Personally identifiable information (PII) anonymization is a high-stakes task
that poses a barrier to many open-science data sharing initiatives. While PII
identification has made large strides in recent years, in practice, error
thresholds and the recall/precision trade-off still limit the uptake of these
anonymization pipelines. We present PIIvot, a lighter-weight framework for PII
anonymization that leverages knowledge of the data context to simplify the PII
detection problem. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we also contribute
QATD-2k, the largest open-source real-world tutoring dataset of its kind, to
support the demand for quality educational dialogue data.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为In-Context Watermarking (ICW)的水印技术，通过提示工程在LLM生成的文本中嵌入水印，解决了现有方法需要访问解码过程的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印技术需要访问解码过程，限制了实际应用，例如学术评审中无法检测AI生成的评论。

Method: 通过提示工程在LLM生成的文本中嵌入水印，研究了四种不同粒度的ICW策略及检测方法，并以间接提示注入（IPI）为案例。

Result: 实验验证了ICW作为一种模型无关的实用水印方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 随着LLM能力的提升，ICW为可扩展和易用的内容归属提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for sensitive applications
has highlighted the need for effective watermarking techniques to ensure the
provenance and accountability of AI-generated text. However, most existing
watermarking methods require access to the decoding process, limiting their
applicability in real-world settings. One illustrative example is the use of
LLMs by dishonest reviewers in the context of academic peer review, where
conference organizers have no access to the model used but still need to detect
AI-generated reviews. Motivated by this gap, we introduce In-Context
Watermarking (ICW), which embeds watermarks into generated text solely through
prompt engineering, leveraging LLMs' in-context learning and
instruction-following abilities. We investigate four ICW strategies at
different levels of granularity, each paired with a tailored detection method.
We further examine the Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) setting as a specific
case study, in which watermarking is covertly triggered by modifying input
documents such as academic manuscripts. Our experiments validate the
feasibility of ICW as a model-agnostic, practical watermarking approach.
Moreover, our findings suggest that as LLMs become more capable, ICW offers a
promising direction for scalable and accessible content attribution.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种结合知识蒸馏、结构化剪枝、截断和词汇修剪的方法，用于高效压缩多语言编码器模型，特别针对低资源语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对低资源语言的多语言模型压缩需求，通过结合现有技术并极致优化，实现模型大小显著减小，同时保留关键语言知识。

Method: 采用两步知识蒸馏、结构化剪枝、截断和词汇修剪，减少层深度、前馈隐藏层大小和中间层嵌入尺寸。

Result: 压缩率高达92%，下游任务性能仅下降2-10%，性能损失与教师模型中语言特定数据量相关。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言模型压缩提供了有效实践，性能损失可控且与数据量相关。

Abstract: In this paper, we combine two-step knowledge distillation, structured
pruning, truncation, and vocabulary trimming for extremely compressing
multilingual encoder-only language models for low-resource languages. Our novel
approach systematically combines existing techniques and takes them to the
extreme, reducing layer depth, feed-forward hidden size, and intermediate layer
embedding size to create significantly smaller monolingual models while
retaining essential language-specific knowledge. We achieve compression rates
of up to 92% with only a marginal performance drop of 2-10% in four downstream
tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic classification, named entity
recognition, and part-of-speech tagging, across three low-resource languages.
Notably, the performance degradation correlates with the amount of
language-specific data in the teacher model, with larger datasets resulting in
smaller performance losses. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
to identify best practices for multilingual model compression using these
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本分割是许多下游应用的基础任务，但现有方法可能无法同时处理局部连贯性和远距离语义相似性。

Method: 通过在图模型上应用信念传播（belief propagation），同时捕捉相邻句子的相关性和远距离句子的语义相似性。

Result: 在示例和长文档数据集上的实验表明，BP-Seg优于其他竞争方法。

Conclusion: BP-Seg是一种有效的文本分割方法，能够同时处理局部和全局语义关系。

Abstract: Text segmentation based on the semantic meaning of sentences is a fundamental
task with broad utility in many downstream applications. In this paper, we
propose a graphical model-based unsupervised learning approach, named BP-Seg
for efficient text segmentation. Our method not only considers local coherence,
capturing the intuition that adjacent sentences are often more related, but
also effectively groups sentences that are distant in the text yet semantically
similar. This is achieved through belief propagation on the carefully
constructed graphical models. Experimental results on both an illustrative
example and a dataset with long-form documents demonstrate that our method
performs favorably compared to competing approaches.

Method: 使用现成的TTS模型将文本语料库转换为合成语音，开发基于可懂度的评估框架确定合成数据的有效性。

Result: 生成超过50万小时的合成语音，Whisper-large-v3模型的转录错误平均降低30%。

Conclusion: Speech Back-Translation是一种高效且可扩展的方法，显著提升了多语言ASR系统的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have been largely
fueled by massive speech corpora. However, extending coverage to diverse
languages with limited resources remains a formidable challenge. This paper
introduces Speech Back-Translation, a scalable pipeline that improves
multilingual ASR models by converting large-scale text corpora into synthetic
speech via off-the-shelf text-to-speech (TTS) models. We demonstrate that just
tens of hours of real transcribed speech can effectively train TTS models to
generate synthetic speech at hundreds of times the original volume while
maintaining high quality. To evaluate synthetic speech quality, we develop an
intelligibility-based assessment framework and establish clear thresholds for
when synthetic data benefits ASR training. Using Speech Back-Translation, we
generate more than 500,000 hours of synthetic speech in ten languages and
continue pre-training Whisper-large-v3, achieving average transcription error
reductions of over 30\%. These results highlight the scalability and
effectiveness of Speech Back-Translation for enhancing multilingual ASR
systems.

Motivation: 现有方法（如FactScore和VeriScore）虽然有效，但耗时且不适用于大规模评估和训练。

Method: 利用合成数据微调Llama3.1 8B模型，同时提取和验证所有可验证声明，基于Google搜索的证据。

Result: VeriFastScore与VeriScore在示例级别（r=0.80）和系统级别（r=0.94）强相关，速度提升6.6倍。

Conclusion: VeriFastScore是一种高效且实用的长文本事实性评估方法，模型和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Metrics like FactScore and VeriScore that evaluate long-form factuality
operate by decomposing an input response into atomic claims and then
individually verifying each claim. While effective and interpretable, these
methods incur numerous LLM calls and can take upwards of 100 seconds to
evaluate a single response, limiting their practicality in large-scale
evaluation and training scenarios. To address this, we propose VeriFastScore,
which leverages synthetic data to fine-tune Llama3.1 8B for simultaneously
extracting and verifying all verifiable claims within a given text based on
evidence from Google Search. We show that this task cannot be solved via
few-shot prompting with closed LLMs due to its complexity: the model receives
~4K tokens of evidence on average and needs to concurrently decompose claims,
judge their verifiability, and verify them against noisy evidence. However, our
fine-tuned VeriFastScore model demonstrates strong correlation with the
original VeriScore pipeline at both the example level (r=0.80) and system level
(r=0.94) while achieving an overall speedup of 6.6x (9.9x excluding evidence
retrieval) over VeriScore. To facilitate future factuality research, we
publicly release our VeriFastScore model and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: 研究表明，保持源和目标上下文中的相对位置比绝对顺序更重要，提出的方法在性能和通用性上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily designed for batch processing.
Existing methods for adapting LLMs to streaming rely either on expensive
re-encoding or specialized architectures with limited scalability. This work
identifies three key mismatches in adapting batch-oriented LLMs to streaming:
(1) input-attention, (2) output-attention, and (3) position-ID mismatches.
While it is commonly assumed that the latter two mismatches require frequent
re-encoding, our analysis reveals that only the input-attention mismatch
significantly impacts performance, indicating re-encoding outputs is largely
unnecessary. To better understand this discrepancy with the common assumption,
we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of position encoding
on LLMs in streaming, showing that preserving relative positions within source
and target contexts is more critical than maintaining absolute order. Motivated
by the above analysis, we introduce a group position encoding paradigm built on
batch architectures to enhance consistency between streaming and batch modes.
Extensive experiments on cross-lingual and cross-modal tasks demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing approaches. Our method requires no
architectural modifications, exhibits strong generalization in both streaming
and batch modes. The code is available at repository

To address this, we introduce T1, a tool-augmented, multi-domain, multi-turn
conversational dataset specifically designed to capture and manage inter-tool
dependencies across diverse domains. T1 enables rigorous evaluation of agents'
ability to coordinate tool use across nine distinct domains (4 single domain
and 5 multi-domain) with the help of an integrated caching mechanism for both
short- and long-term memory, while supporting dynamic replanning-such as
deciding whether to recompute or reuse cached results. Beyond facilitating
research on tool use and planning, T1 also serves as a benchmark for evaluating
the performance of open-source language models. We present results powered by
T1-Agent, highlighting their ability to plan and reason in complex,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感支持对话（ESC）中，直接偏好优化（DPO）因数据结构和优化模糊性受限，需解决心理策略与内容纠缠问题。

Method: 提出IPM构建偏好数据IPM-PrefDial，并设计解耦ESC框架，分策略规划和共情生成两步，分别用SFT和DPO优化。

Result: 实验表明解耦框架优于联合优化基线，减少偏好偏差并提升响应质量。

Conclusion: 解耦框架结合IPM和DPO有效解决ESC任务中的心理错误，为情感支持生成提供新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) have improved
emotional support generation by fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) via
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, common psychological errors still
persist. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) shows promise in reducing
such errors through pairwise preference learning, its effectiveness in ESC
tasks is limited by two key challenges: (1) Entangled data structure: Existing
ESC data inherently entangles psychological strategies and response content,
making it difficult to construct high-quality preference pairs; and (2)
Optimization ambiguity: Applying vanilla DPO to such entangled pairwise data
leads to ambiguous training objectives. To address these issues, we introduce
Inferential Preference Mining (IPM) to construct high-quality preference data,
forming the IPM-PrefDial dataset. Building upon this data, we propose a
Decoupled ESC framework inspired by Gross's Extended Process Model of Emotion
Regulation, which decomposes the ESC task into two sequential subtasks:
strategy planning and empathic response generation. Each was trained via SFT
and subsequently enhanced by DPO to align with the psychological preference.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Decoupled ESC framework outperforms
joint optimization baselines, reducing preference bias and improving response
quality.

TLDR: 该论文对大型语言模型（LLMs）在逻辑推理任务中的表现进行了全面评估，重点关注形式语言的使用。研究发现，思考模型优于指导模型，LLMs在归纳推理方面存在局限，而PoT格式数据表现最佳。

Motivation: 现有研究多关注形式语言引导LLMs推理，但对其能力的系统评估有限，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 从LLMs谱系、任务分类和轨迹格式三个维度评估，并利用形式相关数据增强小模型。

Result: 思考模型表现更优，LLMs归纳推理能力有限，PoT格式数据泛化性能最佳。

Conclusion: 简单的拒绝微调方法可提升LLMs在形式语言间的泛化能力，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve breakthrough
performance on complex logical reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, most existing
research focuses on employing formal language to guide LLMs to derive reliable
reasoning paths, while systematic evaluations of these capabilities are still
limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs
across various logical reasoning problems utilizing formal languages. From the
perspective of three dimensions, i.e., spectrum of LLMs, taxonomy of tasks, and
format of trajectories, our key findings are: 1) Thinking models significantly
outperform Instruct models, especially when formal language is employed; 2) All
LLMs exhibit limitations in inductive reasoning capability, irrespective of
whether they use a formal language; 3) Data with PoT format achieves the best
generalization performance across other languages. Additionally, we also curate
the formal-relative training data to further enhance the small language models,
and the experimental results indicate that a simple rejected fine-tuning method
can better enable LLMs to generalize across formal languages and achieve the
best overall performance. Our codes and reports are available at

TLDR: R1-Searcher++ 是一个新框架，通过两阶段训练策略（SFT 和 RL）使 LLMs 自适应利用内外知识，提升检索增强推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有 RAG 方法成本高、泛化差或忽视模型内部知识的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：SFT 冷启动阶段学习格式，RL 阶段动态获取知识，结合奖励机制和记忆机制。

Result: 实验表明 R1-Searcher++ 优于现有 RAG 和推理方法，实现高效检索。

Conclusion: R1-Searcher++ 通过结合内外知识，持续提升模型能力，为检索增强推理提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but prone to hallucinations due to
static knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps by injecting
external information, but current methods often are costly, generalize poorly,
or ignore the internal knowledge of the model. In this paper, we introduce
R1-Searcher++, a novel framework designed to train LLMs to adaptively leverage
both internal and external knowledge sources. R1-Searcher++ employs a two-stage
training strategy: an initial SFT Cold-start phase for preliminary format
learning, followed by RL for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition. The RL stage uses
outcome-supervision to encourage exploration, incorporates a reward mechanism
for internal knowledge utilization, and integrates a memorization mechanism to
continuously assimilate retrieved information, thereby enriching the model's
internal knowledge. By leveraging internal knowledge and external search
engine, the model continuously improves its capabilities, enabling efficient
retrieval-augmented reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that R1-Searcher++
outperforms previous RAG and reasoning methods and achieves efficient
retrieval. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 提出了一种基于多臂老虎机模型的动态候选边选择方法，改进了LKH算法及其扩展LKH-3的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法（如LKH）使用静态候选边可能导致陷入局部最优，限制了搜索效率和解的质量。

Method: 通过多臂老虎机模型动态选择候选边，扩展候选集以包含更有潜力的边。

Result: 在多个TSP基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了LKH和LKH-3的性能。

Conclusion: 动态候选边选择方法有效提升了算法性能，适用于TSP及其变体问题。

Abstract: Algorithms designed for routing problems typically rely on high-quality
candidate edges to guide their search, aiming to reduce the search space and
enhance the search efficiency. However, many existing algorithms, like the
classical Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP), often use predetermined candidate edges that remain static
throughout local searches. This rigidity could cause the algorithm to get
trapped in local optima, limiting its potential to find better solutions. To
address this issue, we propose expanding the candidate sets to include other
promising edges, providing them an opportunity for selection. Specifically, we
incorporate multi-armed bandit models to dynamically select the most suitable
candidate edges in each iteration, enabling LKH to make smarter choices and
lead to improved solutions. Extensive experiments on multiple TSP benchmarks
show the excellent performance of our method. Moreover, we employ this
bandit-based method to LKH-3, an extension of LKH tailored for solving various
TSP variant problems, and our method also significantly enhances LKH-3's
performance across typical TSP variants.

Motivation: 现有基准测试未能全面评估物理推理能力，PhyX填补了这一空白。

Method: PhyX包含3K多模态问题，覆盖6种推理类型和6个物理领域，通过多种评估范式分析模型表现。

Result: GPT-4o、Claude3.7-Sonnet和GPT-o4-mini的准确率仅为32.5%、42.2%和45.8%，远低于人类专家。

Conclusion: 当前模型在物理推理上存在严重不足，需改进对真实物理理解的能力。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks fail to capture a crucial aspect of intelligence:
physical reasoning, the integrated ability to combine domain knowledge,
symbolic reasoning, and understanding of real-world constraints. To address
this gap, we introduce PhyX: the first large-scale benchmark designed to assess
models capacity for physics-grounded reasoning in visual scenarios. PhyX
includes 3K meticulously curated multimodal questions spanning 6 reasoning
types across 25 sub-domains and 6 core physics domains: thermodynamics,
electromagnetism, mechanics, modern physics, optics, and wave\&acoustics. In
our comprehensive evaluation, even state-of-the-art models struggle
significantly with physical reasoning. GPT-4o, Claude3.7-Sonnet, and
GPT-o4-mini achieve only 32.5\%, 42.2\%, and 45.8\% accuracy
respectively-performance gaps exceeding 29\% compared to human experts. Our
analysis exposes critical limitations in current models: over-reliance on
memorized disciplinary knowledge, excessive dependence on mathematical
formulations, and surface-level visual pattern matching rather than genuine
physical understanding. We provide in-depth analysis through fine-grained
statistics, detailed case studies, and multiple evaluation paradigms to
thoroughly examine physical reasoning capabilities. To ensure reproducibility,
we implement a compatible evaluation protocol based on widely-used toolkits
such as VLMEvalKit, enabling one-click evaluation.

Abstract: We present a method for the automated discovery of system-level dynamics in
Flow-Lenia$-$a continuous cellular automaton (CA) with mass conservation and
parameter localization$-$using a curiosity-driven AI scientist. This method
aims to uncover processes leading to self-organization of evolutionary and
ecosystemic dynamics in CAs. We build on previous work which uses diversity
search algorithms in Lenia to find self-organized individual patterns, and
extend it to large environments that support distinct interacting patterns. We
adapt Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEPs) to drive
exploration of diverse Flow-Lenia environments using simulation-wide metrics,
such as evolutionary activity, compression-based complexity, and multi-scale
entropy. We test our method in two experiments, showcasing its ability to
illuminate significantly more diverse dynamics compared to random search. We
show qualitative results illustrating how ecosystemic simulations enable
self-organization of complex collective behaviors not captured by previous
individual pattern search and analysis. We complement automated discovery with
an interactive exploration tool, creating an effective human-AI collaborative
workflow for scientific investigation. Though demonstrated specifically with
Flow-Lenia, this methodology provides a framework potentially applicable to
other parameterizable complex systems where understanding emergent collective
properties is of interest.

Motivation: 随着AI推理能力的发展，尤其是大型推理模型（LRMs）的出现，了解儿童如何理解AI的推理过程对培养AI素养至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：先与8名儿童进行共同设计，再对106名儿童（3-8年级）进行实地研究。

Result: 发现儿童对AI推理的三种模型：演绎、归纳和固有。低年级儿童（3-5年级）倾向于认为AI具有固有智能，而高年级儿童（6-8年级）更倾向于认为AI是模式识别者。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了儿童对AI推理理解的三种矛盾，并提出了对AI课程设计和可解释AI工具开发的启示。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances in reasoning capabilities, most
recently with the emergence of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), understanding how
children conceptualize AI's reasoning processes becomes critical for fostering
AI literacy. While one of the "Five Big Ideas" in AI education highlights
reasoning algorithms as central to AI decision-making, less is known about
children's mental models in this area. Through a two-phase approach, consisting
of a co-design session with 8 children followed by a field study with 106
children (grades 3-8), we identified three models of AI reasoning: Deductive,
Inductive, and Inherent. Our findings reveal that younger children (grades 3-5)
often attribute AI's reasoning to inherent intelligence, while older children
(grades 6-8) recognize AI as a pattern recognizer. We highlight three tensions
that surfaced in children's understanding of AI reasoning and conclude with
implications for scaffolding AI curricula and designing explainable AI tools.

Motivation: 传统LLM路由方法采用解耦策略，容易产生复合误差且依赖高成本的全反馈数据。本文旨在通过学习观测数据优化路由策略。

Method: 提出因果端到端框架，引入两种理论支持的代理目标（分类上界和softmax加权遗憾近似），并扩展框架以处理异构成本偏好。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，该方法优于现有基线，实现了不同嵌入模型上的最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过因果框架和高效优化目标，显著提升了LLM路由的性能和实用性。

Abstract: LLM routing aims to select the most appropriate model for each query,
balancing competing performance metrics such as accuracy and cost across a pool
of language models. Prior approaches typically adopt a decoupled strategy,
where the metrics are first predicted and the model is then selected based on
these estimates. This setup is prone to compounding errors and often relies on
full-feedback data, where each query is evaluated by all candidate models,
which is costly to obtain and maintain in practice. In contrast, we learn from
observational data, which records only the outcome of the model actually
deployed. We propose a causal end-to-end framework that learns routing policies
by minimizing decision-making regret from observational data. To enable
efficient optimization, we introduce two theoretically grounded surrogate
objectives: a classification-based upper bound, and a softmax-weighted regret
approximation shown to recover the optimal policy at convergence. We further
extend our framework to handle heterogeneous cost preferences via an
interval-conditioned architecture. Experiments on public benchmarks show that
our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across different embedding models.

provided with conditions such as 2D boundary, applied forces and supports, and
must reason about the resulting optimal material distribution. The dataset
includes a variety of tasks, ranging from filling in masked regions within
partial structures to predicting complete material distributions. Solving these
tasks requires understanding the flow of forces and the required material
distribution under given constraints, without access to simulation tools or
explicit physical models, challenging models to reason about structural
stability and spatial organization. Our dataset targets the evaluation of
spatial and physical reasoning abilities in 2D settings, offering a

Abstract: Memory is a critical component in large language model (LLM)-based agents,
enabling them to store and retrieve past executions to improve task performance
over time. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on how memory
management choices impact the LLM agents' behavior, especially their long-term
performance. Specifically, we focus on two fundamental memory operations that
are widely used by many agent frameworks-addition, which incorporates new
experiences into the memory base, and deletion, which selectively removes past
experiences-to systematically study their impact on the agent behavior. Through
our quantitative analysis, we find that LLM agents display an
experience-following property: high similarity between a task input and the
input in a retrieved memory record often results in highly similar agent
outputs. Our analysis further reveals two significant challenges associated
with this property: error propagation, where inaccuracies in past experiences
compound and degrade future performance, and misaligned experience replay,
where outdated or irrelevant experiences negatively influence current tasks.
Through controlled experiments, we show that combining selective addition and
deletion strategies can help mitigate these negative effects, yielding an
average absolute performance gain of 10% compared to naive memory growth.
Furthermore, we highlight how memory management choices affect agents' behavior
under challenging conditions such as task distribution shifts and constrained
memory resources. Our findings offer insights into the behavioral dynamics of
LLM agent memory systems and provide practical guidance for designing memory
components that support robust, long-term agent performance. We also release
our code to facilitate further study.

Result: 实验表明，SynEVO在跨领域场景下泛化能力提升高达42%。

Conclusion: SynEVO为知识迁移和适应提供了NeuroAI范式。

Abstract: Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various
scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train
an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited
transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design
and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable
collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by
neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information
boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a
Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the
model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and
aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the
human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic
common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and
task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic
coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group
should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under
various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization
capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a
paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.

identifying underperforming agents with their failure explanations utilizing
textual feedback and then optimizing system prompts of identified agents
utilizing failure explanations. We then study the impact of various
optimization settings on system performance with two comparison groups: online

group optimization, we study two prompting strategies: one-pass and multi-pass

Abstract: As of 2025, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has become a central
tool for productivity across industries. Beyond text generation, GenAI now
plays a critical role in coding, data analysis, and research workflows. As
large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is essential to assess the
reliability and accuracy of their outputs, especially in specialized,
high-stakes domains like finance. Most modern LLMs transform text into
numerical vectors, which are used in operations such as cosine similarity
searches to generate responses. However, this abstraction process can lead to
misinterpretation of emotional tone, particularly in nuanced financial
contexts. While LLMs generally excel at identifying sentiment in everyday
language, these models often struggle with the nuanced, strategically ambiguous
language found in earnings call transcripts. Financial disclosures frequently
embed sentiment in hedged statements, forward-looking language, and
industry-specific jargon, making it difficult even for human analysts to
interpret consistently, let alone AI models. This paper presents findings from
the Santa Clara Microsoft Practicum Project, led by Professor Charlie
Goldenberg, which benchmarks the performance of Microsoft's Copilot, OpenAI's
ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and traditional machine learning models for sentiment
analysis of financial text. Using Microsoft earnings call transcripts, the
analysis assesses how well LLM-derived sentiment correlates with market
sentiment and stock movements and evaluates the accuracy of model outputs.
Prompt engineering techniques are also examined to improve sentiment analysis
results. Visualizations of sentiment consistency are developed to evaluate
alignment between tone and stock performance, with sentiment trends analyzed
across Microsoft's lines of business to determine which segments exert the
greatest influence.

Abstract: Developing artificial intelligence (AI) for vertical domains requires a solid
data foundation for both training and evaluation. In this work, we introduce
TrialPanorama, a large-scale, structured database comprising 1,657,476 clinical
trial records aggregated from 15 global sources. The database captures key
aspects of trial design and execution, including trial setups, interventions,
conditions, biomarkers, and outcomes, and links them to standard biomedical
ontologies such as DrugBank and MedDRA. This structured and ontology-grounded
design enables TrialPanorama to serve as a unified, extensible resource for a
wide range of clinical trial tasks, including trial planning, design, and
summarization. To demonstrate its utility, we derive a suite of benchmark tasks
directly from the TrialPanorama database. The benchmark spans eight tasks
across two categories: three for systematic review (study search, study
screening, and evidence summarization) and five for trial design (arm design,
eligibility criteria, endpoint selection, sample size estimation, and trial
completion assessment). The experiments using five state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) show that while general-purpose LLMs exhibit some
zero-shot capability, their performance is still inadequate for high-stakes
clinical trial workflows. We release TrialPanorama database and the benchmark
to facilitate further research on AI for clinical trials.

Abstract: Validating scientific hypotheses is a central challenge in biomedical
research, and remains difficult for artificial intelligence (AI) agents due to
the complexity of real-world data analysis and evidence interpretation. In this
work, we present BioDSA-1K, a benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on
realistic, data-driven biomedical hypothesis validation tasks. BioDSA-1K
consists of 1,029 hypothesis-centric tasks paired with 1,177 analysis plans,
curated from over 300 published biomedical studies to reflect the structure and
reasoning found in authentic research workflows. Each task includes a
structured hypothesis derived from the original study's conclusions, expressed
in the affirmative to reflect the language of scientific reporting, and one or
more pieces of supporting evidence grounded in empirical data tables. While
these hypotheses mirror published claims, they remain testable using standard
statistical or machine learning methods. The benchmark enables evaluation along
four axes: (1) hypothesis decision accuracy, (2) alignment between evidence and
conclusion, (3) correctness of the reasoning process, and (4) executability of
the AI-generated analysis code. Importantly, BioDSA-1K includes non-verifiable
hypotheses: cases where the available data are insufficient to support or
refute a claim, reflecting a common yet underexplored scenario in real-world
science. We propose BioDSA-1K as a foundation for building and evaluating
generalizable, trustworthy AI agents for biomedical discovery.

Conclusion: Logot框架成功结合LLMs的自然语言理解与逻辑程序的精确推理能力，为复杂谜题提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Solving puzzles in natural language poses a long-standing challenge in AI.
While large language models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive capabilities
in a variety of tasks, they continue to struggle with complex puzzles that
demand precise reasoning and exhaustive search. In this paper, we propose
Logic-of-Thought (Logot), a novel framework that bridges LLMs with logic
programming to address this problem. Our method leverages LLMs to translate
puzzle rules and states into answer set programs (ASPs), the solution of which
are then accurately and efficiently inferred by an ASP interpreter. This hybrid
approach combines the natural language understanding of LLMs with the precise
reasoning capabilities of logic programs. We evaluate our method on various
grid puzzles and dynamic puzzles involving actions, demonstrating near-perfect
accuracy across all tasks. Our code and data are available at:

Method: 分类代理系统为软件型、物理型和混合型，并分析其在多个领域的应用，同时识别LLM代理的主要挑战。

Result: LLM代理在灵活性、多模态处理和适应性方面表现优异，但面临推理延迟、输出不确定性等挑战。

Conclusion: LLM代理具有巨大潜力，但需解决技术挑战以实现更广泛的应用。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has reshaped agent systems.
Unlike traditional rule-based agents with limited task scope, LLM-powered
agents offer greater flexibility, cross-domain reasoning, and natural language
interaction. Moreover, with the integration of multi-modal LLMs, current agent
systems are highly capable of processing diverse data modalities, including
text, images, audio, and structured tabular data, enabling richer and more
adaptive real-world behavior. This paper comprehensively examines the evolution
of agent systems from the pre-LLM era to current LLM-powered architectures. We
categorize agent systems into software-based, physical, and adaptive hybrid
systems, highlighting applications across customer service, software
development, manufacturing automation, personalized education, financial
trading, and healthcare. We further discuss the primary challenges posed by
LLM-powered agents, including high inference latency, output uncertainty, lack
of evaluation metrics, and security vulnerabilities, and propose potential
solutions to mitigate these concerns.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: Sudoku-Bench是一个新的推理基准，旨在评估LLMs的创造性和多步逻辑推理能力，而非依赖记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准未能捕捉真实创造力，常奖励记忆模式。Sudoku-Bench通过独特的数独变体解决这一问题。

Method: 使用精心挑选的数独变体，提供标准化文本表示和工具，支持扩展为通用研究环境。

Result: 当前最先进的LLMs在无辅助情况下解决不到15%的谜题。

Conclusion: Sudoku-Bench为推进长时程战略推理能力提供了重要机会。

Abstract: Existing reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) frequently
fail to capture authentic creativity, often rewarding memorization of
previously observed patterns. We address this shortcoming with Sudoku-Bench, a
curated benchmark of challenging and unconventional Sudoku variants
specifically selected to evaluate creative, multi-step logical reasoning.
Sudoku variants form an unusually effective domain for reasoning research: each
puzzle introduces unique or subtly interacting constraints, making memorization
infeasible and requiring solvers to identify novel logical breakthroughs
(``break-ins''). Despite their diversity, Sudoku variants maintain a common and
compact structure, enabling clear and consistent evaluation. Sudoku-Bench
includes a carefully chosen puzzle set, a standardized text-based puzzle
representation, and flexible tools compatible with thousands of publicly
available puzzles -- making it easy to extend into a general research
environment. Baseline experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs solve fewer
than 15\% of puzzles unaided, highlighting significant opportunities to advance
long-horizon, strategic reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 提出了一种名为Unlearning Shapley的新框架，通过机器遗忘技术高效估计数据价值，解决了传统方法计算成本高或依赖完整数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型的普及增加了对高效数据估值方法的需求，传统方法如Shapley值和影响函数技术因计算成本高或依赖完整数据而难以实现部分数据估值。

Method: 利用机器遗忘技术从预训练模型中移除目标数据，并通过蒙特卡洛采样计算Shapley值，避免了重新训练和依赖完整数据。

Result: 在基准数据集和大规模文本语料上的实验表明，该方法在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算开销。

Conclusion: Unlearning Shapley为现代AI生态系统提供了一种可扩展且符合隐私要求的解决方案，填补了数据估值理论与实际应用之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: The proliferation of large models has intensified the need for efficient data
valuation methods to quantify the contribution of individual data providers.
Traditional approaches, such as game-theory-based Shapley value and
influence-function-based techniques, face prohibitive computational costs or
require access to full data and model training details, making them hardly
achieve partial data valuation. To address this, we propose Unlearning Shapley,
a novel framework that leverages machine unlearning to estimate data values
efficiently. By unlearning target data from a pretrained model and measuring
performance shifts on a reachable test set, our method computes Shapley values
via Monte Carlo sampling, avoiding retraining and eliminating dependence on
full data. Crucially, Unlearning Shapley supports both full and partial data
valuation, making it scalable for large models (e.g., LLMs) and practical for
data markets. Experiments on benchmark datasets and large-scale text corpora
demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods
while reducing computational overhead by orders of magnitude. Further analysis
confirms a strong correlation between estimated values and the true impact of
data subsets, validating its reliability in real-world scenarios. This work
bridges the gap between data valuation theory and practical deployment,
offering a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for modern AI ecosystems.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: SAI-DPO算法通过动态选择训练数据，实时评估模型在不同训练阶段的推理能力，显著提升了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖静态指标，无法适应动态训练过程，限制了模型能力的持续提升。

Method: 提出SAI-DPO算法，通过实时反馈模型性能动态调整数据选择，适应模型能力的演变。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，SAI-DPO平均性能提升21.3个百分点，AIME24和AMC23分别提升10和15分。

Conclusion: 动态、模型自适应的数据选择策略优于静态方法，显著提升了推理任务的性能。

Abstract: In the realm of data selection for reasoning tasks, existing approaches
predominantly rely on externally predefined static metrics such as difficulty
and diversity, which are often designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
lack adaptability to continuous training processes. A critical limitation of
these methods is their inability to dynamically align with the evolving
capabilities of models during online training, a gap that becomes increasingly
pronounced with the rise of dynamic training paradigms and online reinforcement
learning (RL) frameworks (e.g., R1 models). To address this, we introduce
SAI-DPO, an algorithm that dynamically selects training data by continuously
assessing a model's stage-specific reasoning abilities across different
training phases. By integrating real-time model performance feedback, SAI-DPO
adaptively adapts data selection to the evolving strengths and weaknesses of
the model, thus enhancing both data utilization efficiency and final task
performance. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art models and eight
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including challenging competition-level
datasets (e.g., AIME24 and AMC23), demonstrate that SAI-DPO achieves an average
performance boost of up to 21.3 percentage points, with particularly notable
improvements of 10 and 15 points on AIME24 and AMC23, respectively. These
results highlight the superiority of dynamic, model-adaptive data selection
over static, externally defined strategies in advancing reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务中表现出色，但对有害查询和对抗攻击存在安全风险。现有方法（如监督微调）难以泛化到未见过的越狱提示。

Method: 提出SafeKey，包含两个目标：(1) 双路径安全头增强安全信号，(2) 查询掩码建模目标提升模型对查询理解的注意力。

Result: 实验表明，SafeKey显著提升安全性，平均有害率降低9.6%，同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: SafeKey通过重塑内部注意力和提升隐藏表示质量，有效增强模型安全性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) introduce a new generation paradigm of
explicitly reasoning before answering, leading to remarkable improvements in
complex tasks. However, they pose great safety risks against harmful queries
and adversarial attacks. While recent mainstream safety efforts on LRMs,
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), improve safety performance, we find that
SFT-aligned models struggle to generalize to unseen jailbreak prompts. After
thorough investigation of LRMs' generation, we identify a safety aha moment
that can activate safety reasoning and lead to a safe response. This aha moment
typically appears in the `key sentence', which follows models' query
understanding process and can indicate whether the model will proceed safely.
Based on these insights, we propose SafeKey, including two complementary
objectives to better activate the safety aha moment in the key sentence: (1) a
Dual-Path Safety Head to enhance the safety signal in the model's internal
representations before the key sentence, and (2) a Query-Mask Modeling
objective to improve the models' attention on its query understanding, which
has important safety hints. Experiments across multiple safety benchmarks
demonstrate that our methods significantly improve safety generalization to a
wide range of jailbreak attacks and out-of-distribution harmful prompts,
lowering the average harmfulness rate by 9.6\%, while maintaining general
abilities. Our analysis reveals how SafeKey enhances safety by reshaping
internal attention and improving the quality of hidden representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 提出了一种基于神经网络的方法，通过事件数据补全多智能体系统中的速度信息，提升团队运动分析的深度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件数据缺乏连续时间信息，限制了动态分析的深度，尤其是速度和交互行为的理解。

Method: 利用神经网络补全事件数据中的速度信息，考虑时间依赖性和交互图结构。

Result: 神经网络方法在速度补全误差上优于规则方法，空间评估结果更接近完整跟踪数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为团队运动系统分析提供了更全面的动态信息，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: In many real-world complex systems, the behavior can be observed as a
collection of discrete events generated by multiple interacting agents.
Analyzing the dynamics of these multi-agent systems, especially team sports,
often relies on understanding the movement and interactions of individual
agents. However, while providing valuable snapshots, event-based positional
data typically lacks the continuous temporal information needed to directly
calculate crucial properties such as velocity. This absence severely limits the
depth of dynamic analysis, preventing a comprehensive understanding of
individual agent behaviors and emergent team strategies. To address this
challenge, we propose a new method to simultaneously complete the velocity of
all agents using only the event-based positional data from team sports. Based
on this completed velocity information, we investigate the applicability of
existing team sports analysis and evaluation methods. Experiments using soccer
event data demonstrate that neural network-based approaches outperformed
rule-based methods regarding velocity completion error, considering the
underlying temporal dependencies and graph structure of player-to-player or
player-to-ball interaction. Moreover, the space evaluation results obtained
using the completed velocity are closer to those derived from complete tracking
data, highlighting our method's potential for enhanced team sports system
analysis.

Result: 实验表明，LightRouter在多个基准测试中性能优于基线，准确率提升25%，成本降低27%。

Conclusion: LightRouter为高效LLM选择提供了实用方法，并揭示了模型组合的最优策略。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has unlocked remarkable
capabilities across a diverse array of natural language processing tasks.
However, the considerable differences among available LLMs-in terms of cost,
performance, and computational demands-pose significant challenges for users
aiming to identify the most suitable model for specific tasks. In this work, we
present LightRouter, a novel framework designed to systematically select and
integrate a small subset of LLMs from a larger pool, with the objective of
jointly optimizing both task performance and cost efficiency. LightRouter
leverages an adaptive selection mechanism to identify models that require only
a minimal number of boot tokens, thereby reducing costs, and further employs an
effective integration strategy to combine their outputs. Extensive experiments
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LightRouter matches or outperforms
widely-used ensemble baselines, achieving up to a 25% improvement in accuracy.
Compared with leading high-performing models, LightRouter achieves comparable
performance while reducing inference costs by up to 27%. Importantly, our
framework operates without any prior knowledge of individual models and relies
exclusively on inexpensive, lightweight models. This work introduces a
practical approach for efficient LLM selection and provides valuable insights
into optimal strategies for model combination.

Result: 在四个时间序列基准数据集上验证了MADCluster能显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: MADCluster具有广泛的架构兼容性，能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly
detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is
applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the
'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly
detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a
'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping
data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective
single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The
optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of
three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal
dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous
center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying
various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series
benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall
performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of
MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在上下文学习中因标记数据不足而导致的性能限制问题。

Method: 提出MAPLE框架，利用影响力分析选择未标记样本进行伪标记，并自适应地选择伪标记样本作为输入。

Result: 实验证明MAPLE能显著提升LLMs在标记数据有限的情况下的适应性和性能。

Conclusion: MAPLE是一种高效且低成本的方法，能够增强LLMs在上下文学习中的表现。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle
diverse tasks by incorporating multiple input-output examples, known as
demonstrations, into the input of LLMs. More recently, advancements in the
expanded context windows of LLMs have led to many-shot ICL, which uses hundreds
of demonstrations and outperforms few-shot ICL, which relies on fewer examples.
However, this approach is often hindered by the high cost of obtaining large
amounts of labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Many-Shot
Adaptive Pseudo-LabEling, namely MAPLE, a novel influence-based many-shot ICL
framework that utilizes pseudo-labeled samples to compensate for the lack of
label information. We first identify a subset of impactful unlabeled samples
and perform pseudo-labeling on them by querying LLMs. These pseudo-labeled
samples are then adaptively selected and tailored to each test query as input
to improve the performance of many-shot ICL, without significant labeling
costs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its ability to enhance LLM
adaptability and performance with limited labeled data.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: LLM-KG-Bench框架用于比较不同规模LLM在知识图谱工程任务中的表现，发现模型大小与性能通常相关，但存在性能平台或天花板效应，建议测试同家族相邻规模模型以提高成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）在知识图谱工程（KGE）任务中的表现与模型规模的关系，以平衡性能与资源成本。

Method: 使用LLM-KG-Bench框架评估26个开源LLM在KGE任务中的表现，分析模型规模与性能的关系。

Result: 模型规模与性能通常相关，但存在性能平台或天花板效应；某些情况下，同家族中较小模型表现优于较大模型。

Conclusion: 建议在特定任务中测试同家族相邻规模模型，以提高成本效益。

Abstract: When using Large Language Models (LLMs) to support Knowledge Graph
Engineering (KGE), one of the first indications when searching for an
appropriate model is its size. According to the scaling laws, larger models
typically show higher capabilities. However, in practice, resource costs are
also an important factor and thus it makes sense to consider the ratio between
model performance and costs. The LLM-KG-Bench framework enables the comparison
of LLMs in the context of KGE tasks and assesses their capabilities of
understanding and producing KGs and KG queries. Based on a dataset created in
an LLM-KG-Bench run covering 26 open state-of-the-art LLMs, we explore the
model size scaling laws specific to KGE tasks. In our analyses, we assess how
benchmark scores evolve between different model size categories. Additionally,
we inspect how the general score development of single models and families of
models correlates to their size. Our analyses revealed that, with a few
exceptions, the model size scaling laws generally also apply to the selected
KGE tasks. However, in some cases, plateau or ceiling effects occurred, i.e.,
the task performance did not change much between a model and the next larger
model. In these cases, smaller models could be considered to achieve high
cost-effectiveness. Regarding models of the same family, sometimes larger
models performed worse than smaller models of the same family. These effects
occurred only locally. Hence it is advisable to additionally test the next
smallest and largest model of the same family.

Method: 提出II-KEA框架，整合个性化知识库和智能代理LLMs，通过因果分析和显式推理增强可解释性，支持医生交互式输入。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优异，案例研究证实其可解释性和交互性提升。

Conclusion: II-KEA为医疗诊断提供了更透明和交互式的解决方案，有望辅助临床决策。

Abstract: Deep learning models trained on extensive Electronic Health Records (EHR)
data have achieved high accuracy in diagnosis prediction, offering the
potential to assist clinicians in decision-making and treatment planning.
However, these models lack two crucial features that clinicians highly value:
interpretability and interactivity. The ``black-box'' nature of these models
makes it difficult for clinicians to understand the reasoning behind
predictions, limiting their ability to make informed decisions. Additionally,
the absence of interactive mechanisms prevents clinicians from incorporating
their own knowledge and experience into the decision-making process. To address
these limitations, we propose II-KEA, a knowledge-enhanced agent-driven causal
discovery framework that integrates personalized knowledge databases and
agentic LLMs. II-KEA enhances interpretability through explicit reasoning and
causal analysis, while also improving interactivity by allowing clinicians to
inject their knowledge and experience through customized knowledge bases and
prompts. II-KEA is evaluated on both MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrating
superior performance along with enhanced interpretability and interactivity, as
evidenced by its strong results from extensive case studies.

Conclusion: EquivPruner是一种简单有效的方法，能显著提升大语言模型推理搜索的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning through search
algorithms, yet current strategies often suffer from massive token consumption
due to redundant exploration of semantically equivalent steps. Existing
semantic similarity methods struggle to accurately identify such equivalence in
domain-specific contexts like mathematical reasoning. To address this, we
propose EquivPruner, a simple yet effective approach that identifies and prunes
semantically equivalent actions during LLM reasoning search. We also introduce
MathEquiv, the first dataset we created for mathematical statement equivalence,
which enables the training of a lightweight equivalence detector. Extensive
experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate that EquivPruner
significantly reduces token consumption, improving searching efficiency and
often bolstering reasoning accuracy. For instance, when applied to
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on GSM8K, EquivPruner reduced token consumption by
48.1\% while also improving accuracy. Our code is available at

Result: 实验结果表明，ACPO能有效减少冗余推理，并根据任务复杂度自适应调整认知分配，实现高效混合推理。

Conclusion: ACPO通过自适应认知策略优化，显著提升了大型推理模型的推理效率和透明度。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, but often suffer from overthinking, generating redundant
content regardless of task difficulty. Inspired by the dual process theory in
cognitive science, we propose Adaptive Cognition Policy Optimization (ACPO), a
reinforcement learning framework that enables LRMs to achieve efficient
reasoning through adaptive cognitive allocation and dynamic system switch. ACPO
incorporates two key components: (1) introducing system-aware reasoning tokens
to explicitly represent the thinking modes thereby making the model's cognitive
process transparent, and (2) integrating online difficulty estimation and token
length budget to guide adaptive system switch and reasoning during
reinforcement learning. To this end, we propose a two-stage training strategy.
The first stage begins with supervised fine-tuning to cold start the model,
enabling it to generate reasoning paths with explicit thinking modes. In the
second stage, we apply ACPO to further enhance adaptive system switch for
difficulty-aware reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPO
effectively reduces redundant reasoning while adaptively adjusting cognitive
allocation based on task complexity, achieving efficient hybrid reasoning.

Method: 选取了三种广泛接受的EGT模型（鹰鸽博弈、重复囚徒困境和消耗战）进行分析，探讨其与人类-AI动态的关联。

Conclusion: EGT为理解人类-AI进化动态提供了框架，但需结合其他方法、实证验证及跨学科视角，并关注伦理与认知影响。

Abstract: The serious games between humans and AI have only just begun. Evolutionary
Game Theory (EGT) models the competitive and cooperative strategies of
biological entities. EGT could help predict the potential evolutionary
equilibrium of humans and AI. The objective of this work was to examine some of
the EGT models relevant to human-AI interaction, evolution, and coevolution. Of
thirteen EGT models considered, three were examined: the Hawk-Dove Game,
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, and the War of Attrition. This selection was based
on the widespread acceptance and clear relevance of these models to potential
human-AI evolutionary dynamics and coevolutionary trajectories. The Hawk-Dove
Game predicts balanced mixed-strategy equilibria based on the costs of
conflict. It also shows the potential for balanced coevolution rather than
dominance. Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma suggests that repeated interaction may
lead to cognitive coevolution. It demonstrates how memory and reciprocity can
lead to cooperation. The War of Attrition suggests that competition for
resources may result in strategic coevolution, asymmetric equilibria, and
conventions on sharing resources. Therefore, EGT may provide a suitable
framework to understand and predict the human-AI evolutionary dynamic. However,
future research could extend beyond EGT and explore additional frameworks,
empirical validation methods, and interdisciplinary perspectives. AI is being
shaped by human input and is evolving in response to it. So too,
neuroplasticity allows the human brain to grow and evolve in response to
stimuli. If humans and AI converge in future, what might be the result of human
neuroplasticity combined with an ever-evolving AI? Future research should be
mindful of the ethical and cognitive implications of human-AI interaction,
evolution, and coevolution.

Conclusion: FREESON框架有效解决了检索瓶颈问题，性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
multi-step reasoning and calling search engines at appropriate steps. However,
existing retrieval-augmented reasoning approaches rely on separate retrieval
models, limiting the LRM's role in retrieval to deciding when to retrieve and
how to query. This separation not only increases hardware and operational costs
but also leads to errors in the retrieval process due to the representation
bottleneck, a phenomenon where the retriever's embedding space is not
expressive enough to meet the generator's requirements. To address this, we
shift our perspective from sequence-to-sequence matching to locating the
answer-containing paths within the corpus, and propose a novel framework called
FREESON (Retriever-FREE Retrieval-Augmented ReaSONing). This framework enables
LRMs to retrieve relevant knowledge on their own by acting as both a generator
and retriever. To achieve this, we introduce a variant of the MCTS algorithm
specialized for the retrieval task, which we call CT-MCTS (Corpus-Traversing
Monte Carlo Tree Search). In this algorithm, LRMs traverse through the corpus
toward answer-containing regions. Our results on five open-domain QA
benchmarks, including single-hop and multi-hop questions, show that FREESON
achieves an average improvement of 14.4% in EM and F1 over four multi-step
reasoning models with a separate retriever, and it also performs comparably to
the strongest baseline, surpassing it by 3% on PopQA and 2WikiMultihopQA.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 研究发现推理模型因内部偏见导致过度思考，通过屏蔽输入部分可减少推理长度并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示推理模型过度思考的原因，即内部偏见对决策过程的影响。

Method: 通过解释性实验分析模型行为，并尝试屏蔽输入部分以验证效果。

Result: 屏蔽输入部分后，推理长度减少31%-53%，且多数情况下准确性提高。

Conclusion: 内部偏见与过度思考存在因果关系，屏蔽输入是有效缓解方法。

Abstract: While current reasoning models possess strong exploratory capabilities, they
are often criticized for overthinking due to redundant and unnecessary
reflections. In this work, we reveal for the first time that overthinking in
reasoning models may stem from their internal bias towards input texts. Upon
encountering a reasoning problem, the model immediately forms a preliminary
guess about the answer, which we term as an internal bias since it is not
derived through actual reasoning. When this guess conflicts with its reasoning
result, the model tends to engage in reflection, leading to the waste of
computational resources. Through further interpretability experiments, we find
that this behavior is largely driven by the model's excessive attention to the
input section, which amplifies the influence of internal bias on its
decision-making process. Additionally, by masking out the original input
section, the affect of internal bias can be effectively alleviated and the
reasoning length could be reduced by 31%-53% across different complex reasoning
tasks. Notably, in most cases, this approach also leads to improvements in
accuracy. These findings demonstrate a causal relationship between internal
bias and overthinking.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种心理学驱动的生成代理框架（PsychoAgent），用于基于情绪唤起理论的可解释恐慌预测，解决了数据标注不足、风险感知未建模和解释性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在突发灾难事件中，准确预测社交媒体上的公众恐慌情绪对主动治理和危机管理至关重要，但现有研究面临数据标注不足、风险感知未建模和解释性不足的挑战。

Method: 通过人机协作构建细粒度恐慌情绪数据集（COPE），开发整合跨领域异构数据的框架，并设计基于大语言模型的角色扮演代理模拟心理机制。

Result: 实验表明，PsychoAgent比基线模型在恐慌情绪预测性能上提升了12.6%至21.7%，同时验证了方法的可解释性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究实现了从‘数据驱动拟合’到‘基于角色模拟与机制解释’的范式转变，为紧急事件中的恐慌情绪预测提供了透明且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: During sudden disaster events, accurately predicting public panic sentiment
on social media is crucial for proactive governance and crisis management.
Current efforts on this problem face three main challenges: lack of finely
annotated data hinders emotion prediction studies, unmodeled risk perception
causes prediction inaccuracies, and insufficient interpretability of panic
formation mechanisms. We address these issues by proposing a Psychology-driven
generative Agent framework (PsychoAgent) for explainable panic prediction based
on emotion arousal theory. Specifically, we first construct a fine-grained open
panic emotion dataset (namely COPE) via human-large language models (LLMs)
collaboration to mitigate semantic bias. Then, we develop a framework
integrating cross-domain heterogeneous data grounded in psychological
mechanisms to model risk perception and cognitive differences in emotion
generation. To enhance interpretability, we design an LLM-based role-playing
agent that simulates individual psychological chains through dedicatedly
designed prompts. Experimental results on our annotated dataset show that
PsychoAgent improves panic emotion prediction performance by 12.6% to 21.7%
compared to baseline models. Furthermore, the explainability and generalization
of our approach is validated. Crucially, this represents a paradigm shift from
opaque "data-driven fitting" to transparent "role-based simulation with
mechanistic interpretation" for panic emotion prediction during emergencies.

TLDR: MMMR是一个新的多模态推理基准，旨在通过显式思维评估多模态推理能力，揭示现有模型的推理缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂任务中表现出潜力，但其推理能力尤其是带有中间思维痕迹的模型（MLLMs-T）仍缺乏标准化评估基准。

Method: 提出了MMMR基准，包括1）一个包含1,083个高难度问题的数据集，涵盖六种推理类型；2）一个模块化的推理痕迹评估管道（RTEP），用于评估推理质量。

Result: 实验表明，MLLMs-T总体上优于非思维模型，但即使是顶级模型也存在推理缺陷（如不一致和过度思考）。

Conclusion: MMMR为评估、比较和改进下一代多模态推理系统提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door
to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific
analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs,
particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T),
remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing
work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering
limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address
this gap, we introduce the MMMR, a new benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMMR comprises 1) a
high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types
with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace
Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy
through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations.
Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking
counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro
suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This
benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and
provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development.
Overall, the MMMR offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and
improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.

Conclusion: ReflectEvo展示了通过迭代反思学习持续提升小型语言模型推理能力的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present a novel pipeline, ReflectEvo, to demonstrate that small language
models (SLMs) can enhance meta introspection through reflection learning. This
process iteratively generates self-reflection for self-training, fostering a
continuous and self-evolving process. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct
ReflectEvo-460k, a large-scale, comprehensive, self-generated reflection
dataset with broadened instructions and diverse multi-domain tasks. Building
upon this dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of reflection learning to
improve SLMs' reasoning abilities using SFT and DPO with remarkable
performance, substantially boosting Llama-3 from 52.4% to 71.2% and Mistral
from 44.4% to 71.1%. It validates that ReflectEvo can rival or even surpass the
reasoning capability of the three prominent open-sourced models on BIG-bench
without distillation from superior models or fine-grained human annotation. We
further conduct a deeper analysis of the high quality of self-generated
reflections and their impact on error localization and correction. Our work
highlights the potential of continuously enhancing the reasoning performance of
SLMs through iterative reflection learning in the long run.

Abstract: With recent Nobel Prizes recognising AI contributions to science, Large
Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scientific research by enhancing
productivity and reshaping the scientific method. LLMs are now involved in
experimental design, data analysis, and workflows, particularly in chemistry
and biology. However, challenges such as hallucinations and reliability
persist. In this contribution, we review how Large Language Models (LLMs) are
redefining the scientific method and explore their potential applications
across different stages of the scientific cycle, from hypothesis testing to
discovery. We conclude that, for LLMs to serve as relevant and effective
creative engines and productivity enhancers, their deep integration into all
steps of the scientific process should be pursued in collaboration and
alignment with human scientific goals, with clear evaluation metrics. The
transition to AI-driven science raises ethical questions about creativity,
oversight, and responsibility. With careful guidance, LLMs could evolve into
creative engines, driving transformative breakthroughs across scientific
disciplines responsibly and effectively. However, the scientific community must
also decide how much it leaves to LLMs to drive science, even when associations
with 'reasoning', mostly currently undeserved, are made in exchange for the
potential to explore hypothesis and solution regions that might otherwise
remain unexplored by human exploration alone.

Result: 实验验证表明，所提算法在多种网络场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 部分充电方法和双层优化方案有效解决了WRSNs中的能量耗尽问题，提升了充电效率。

Abstract: Recently, Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) that leveraged the
advantage of wireless energy transfer technology have opened a promising
opportunity in solving the limited energy issue. However, an ineffective
charging strategy may reduce the charging performance. Although many practical
charging algorithms have been introduced, these studies mainly focus on
optimizing the charging path with a fully charging approach. This approach may
lead to the death of a series of sensors due to their extended charging
latency. This paper introduces a novel partial charging approach that follows a
bi-level optimized scheme to minimize energy depletion in WRSNs. We aim at
optimizing simultaneously two factors: the charging path and time. To
accomplish this, we first formulate a mathematical model of the investigated
problem. We then propose two approximate algorithms in which the optimization
of the charging path and the charging time are considered as the upper and
lower level, respectively. The first algorithm combines a Multi-start Local
Search method and a Genetic Algorithm to find a solution. The second algorithm
adopts a nested approach that utilizes the advantages of the Multitasking and
Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies. Experimental validations
on various network scenarios demonstrate that our proposed algorithms
outperform the existing works.

Motivation: 扩展不完整论证框架中单个论证的稳定性概念，研究论证集验证稳定性的相关性，以解决IAF中不确定性对验证结果的影响。

Method: 提出论证集验证稳定性的相关性和强相关性概念，并通过复杂度分析检测这些性质的计算效率。

Result: 在大多数语义下，检测（强）相关性可在P时间内完成；但基于基础语义的检测方法较难实现。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了相关性的概念，并揭示了其在不同语义下的计算复杂度，为不完整论证框架的稳定性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: The notion of relevance was proposed for stability of justification status of
a single argument in incomplete argumentation frameworks (IAFs) in 2024 by
Odekerken et al. To extend the notion, we study the relevance for stability of
verification status of a set of arguments in this paper, i.e., the
uncertainties in an IAF that have to be resolved in some situations so that
answering whether a given set of arguments is an extension obtains the same
result in every completion of the IAF. Further we propose the notion of strong
relevance for describing the necessity of resolution in all situations reaching
stability. An analysis of complexity reveals that detecting the (strong)
relevance for stability of sets of arguments can be accomplished in P time
under the most semantics discussed in the paper. We also discuss the difficulty
in finding tractable methods for relevance detection under grounded semantics.

Abstract: While chains-of-thought (CoT) have advanced complex reasoning in multimodal
large language models (MLLMs), existing methods remain confined to text or
static visual domains, often faltering in dynamic spatial reasoning tasks. To
bridge this gap, we present GRASSLAND, a novel maze navigation benchmark
designed to evaluate dynamic spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that
augmenting textual reasoning chains with dynamic visual drafts, overlaid on
input images, significantly outperforms conventional approaches, offering new
insights into spatial reasoning in evolving environments. To generalize this
capability, we propose D2R (Dynamic Draft-Augmented Reasoning), a training-free
framework that seamlessly integrates textual CoT with corresponding visual
drafts into MLLMs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that D2R consistently
enhances performance across diverse tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
dynamic spatial reasoning without requiring model fine-tuning. Project is open

Result: 应用于21个LLM，发现各维度能力差异显著。

Conclusion: 需采用更全面的评估指标以准确衡量LLM的数学问题解决能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved remarkable results on a variety of
mathematical benchmarks. However, concerns remain as to whether these successes
reflect genuine mathematical reasoning or superficial pattern recognition.
Common evaluation metrics, such as final answer accuracy, fail to disentangle
the underlying competencies involved, offering limited diagnostic value. To
address these limitations, we introduce SMART: a Self-Generating and
Self-Validating Multi-Dimensional Assessment Framework. SMART decomposes
mathematical problem solving into four distinct dimensions: understanding,
reasoning, arithmetic, and reflection \& refinement. Each dimension is
evaluated independently through tailored tasks, enabling interpretable and
fine-grained analysis of LLM behavior. Crucially, SMART integrates an automated
self-generating and self-validating mechanism to produce and verify benchmark
data, ensuring both scalability and reliability. We apply SMART to 21
state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs, uncovering significant
discrepancies in their abilities across different dimensions. Our findings
demonstrate the inadequacy of final answer accuracy as a sole metric and
motivate a new holistic metric to better capture true problem-solving
capabilities. Code and benchmarks will be released upon acceptance.

Method: 引入SPaRC数据集，包含1000个2D网格路径规划谜题，要求逐步规划和算术几何规则。

Result: 人类准确率接近完美（98.0%；94.5%困难题），而最佳模型（如o4-mini）表现差（15.8%；1.1%困难题）。模型常生成无效路径，导航和空间逻辑错误。

Conclusion: SPaRC揭示了模型在空间推理上的局限，推动改进训练和测试时间扩展方法的研究。

Abstract: Existing reasoning datasets saturate and fail to test abstract, multi-step
problems, especially pathfinding and complex rule constraint satisfaction. We
introduce SPaRC (Spatial Pathfinding Reasoning Challenge), a dataset of 1,000
2D grid pathfinding puzzles to evaluate spatial and symbolic reasoning,
requiring step-by-step planning with arithmetic and geometric rules. Humans
achieve near-perfect accuracy (98.0%; 94.5% on hard puzzles), while the best
reasoning models, such as o4-mini, struggle (15.8%; 1.1% on hard puzzles).
Models often generate invalid paths (>50% of puzzles for o4-mini), and
reasoning tokens reveal they make errors in navigation and spatial logic.
Unlike humans, who take longer on hard puzzles, models fail to scale test-time
compute with difficulty. Allowing models to make multiple solution attempts
improves accuracy, suggesting potential for better spatial reasoning with
improved training and efficient test-time scaling methods. SPaRC can be used as
a window into models' spatial reasoning limitations and drive research toward
new methods that excel in abstract, multi-step problem-solving.

Motivation: 现有评估方法无法充分衡量LLM在新范式下的工具利用能力，需要一种更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出MCP-RADAR基准，采用五维评估方法，覆盖多个任务领域（如软件工程、数学推理等），并对主流LLM进行评估。

Result: 评估揭示了LLM在准确性、效率和速度之间的显著权衡，挑战了传统单一指标排名，并为开发者提供了优化工具兼容性和有效性的指导。

Conclusion: MCP-RADAR不仅适用于MCP框架，还可推广到其他LLM工具集成框架，为LLM和工具开发者提供了优化交互生态的宝贵见解。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from passive text generators to active
reasoning agents capable of tool interaction, the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
has emerged as a standardized framework for dynamic tool discovery and
orchestration. Despite widespread industry adoption, existing evaluation
methodologies fail to adequately assess tool utilization capabilities within
this new paradigm. This paper introduces MCP-RADAR, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in the MCP
framework through a novel five-dimensional approach measuring: answer accuracy,
tool selection efficiency, computational resource efficiency, parameter
construction accuracy, and execution speed. Unlike conventional benchmarks that
rely on subjective human evaluations or binary success metrics, MCP-RADAR
employs objective, quantifiable measurements across multiple task domains
including software engineering, mathematical reasoning, and general
problem-solving. Our evaluations of leading commercial and open-source LLMs
reveal distinctive capability profiles with significant trade-offs between
accuracy, efficiency, and speed, challenging traditional single-metric
performance rankings. Besides, we provide valuable guidance for developers to
optimize their tools for maximum model compatibility and effectiveness. While
focused on MCP due to its standardized approach, our methodology remains
applicable across all LLM agent tool integration frameworks, providing valuable
insights for both LLM developers and tool creators to optimize the entire
LLM-tool interaction ecosystem. The implementation, configurations, and
datasets used in our evaluation are publicly available at

must now embrace data centric approaches. In response to rising privacy
concerns and tightening regulations, the paper evaluates emerging solutions
like federated learning, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs), and the data
site paradigm, which reframe data access and security. In cases where real
world data remains inaccessible, the paper also assesses the utility and
constraints of mock and synthetic data generation. By aligning technical
insights with evolving data infrastructure, this study offers strategic
guidance for future AI research and policy development.

Abstract: In group decision-making (GDM) scenarios, uncertainty, dynamic social
structures, and vague information present major challenges for traditional
opinion dynamics models. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel
social network group decision-making (SNGDM) framework that integrates
three-way decision (3WD) theory, dynamic network reconstruction, and linguistic
opinion representation. First, the 3WD mechanism is introduced to explicitly
model hesitation and ambiguity in agent judgments, thereby preventing
irrational decisions. Second, a connection adjustment rule based on opinion
similarity is developed, enabling agents to adaptively update their
communication links and better reflect the evolving nature of social
relationships. Third, linguistic terms are used to describe agent opinions,
allowing the model to handle subjective, vague, or incomplete information more
effectively. Finally, an integrated multi-agent decision-making framework is
constructed, which simultaneously considers individual uncertainty, opinion
evolution, and network dynamics. The proposed model is applied to a multi-UAV
cooperative decision-making scenario, where simulation results and consensus
analysis demonstrate its effectiveness. Experimental comparisons further verify
the advantages of the algorithm in enhancing system stability and representing
realistic decision-making behaviors.

*Ashish Sundar,Chunbo Luo,Xiaoyang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 提出了一种基于模型强化学习（MBRL）的新方法，通过主动寻找高熵状态优化世界模型学习，显著提升了样本效率和策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MBRL方法忽视了世界模型学习的优化，而改进世界模型的保真度和收敛速度可以显著提升下游任务性能。

Method: 利用世界模型生成的短时潜在预测主动寻找高熵状态，并设计了一种分层规划器动态决定重新规划时机、规划长度和奖励与熵的权重。

Result: 在Miniworld迷宫任务中，该方法比基础Dreamer收敛速度快50%，且策略训练所需环境步数仅为60%。

Conclusion: 该方法为MBRL提供了一种更高效的世界模型优化策略，显著提升了样本效率和策略性能。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers an intuitive way to increase
the sample efficiency of model-free RL methods by simultaneously training a
world model that learns to predict the future. MBRL methods have progressed by
largely prioritising the actor; optimising the world model learning has been
neglected meanwhile. Improving the fidelity of the world model and reducing its
time to convergence can yield significant downstream benefits, one of which is
improving the ensuing performance of any actor it may train. We propose a novel
approach that anticipates and actively seeks out high-entropy states using
short-horizon latent predictions generated by the world model, offering a
principled alternative to traditional curiosity-driven methods that chase
once-novel states well after they were stumbled into. While many model
predictive control (MPC) based methods offer similar alternatives, they
typically lack commitment, synthesising multi step plans after every step. To
mitigate this, we present a hierarchical planner that dynamically decides when
to replan, planning horizon length, and the weighting between reward and
entropy. While our method can theoretically be applied to any model that trains
its own actors with solely model generated data, we have applied it to just
Dreamer as a proof of concept. Our method finishes the Miniworld procedurally
generated mazes 50% faster than base Dreamer at convergence and the policy
trained in imagination converges in only 60% of the environment steps that base
Dreamer needs.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为KTAE的新算法，通过细粒度的token级优势估计，解决了现有强化学习算法在计算优势时的粗粒度问题，显著提升了模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习算法（如GRPO及其变体DAPO）在计算优势时存在粗粒度问题，无法捕捉token对最终结果的贡献，限制了模型的学习效果。

Method: 提出KTAE算法，通过统计分析和采样rollout的正确性，量化token的重要性，并与rollout级优势结合，实现细粒度的token级优势估计。

Result: 实验表明，GRPO+KTAE和DAPO+KTAE在五个数学推理基准测试中优于基线方法，且能以更短的响应达到更高的准确性。

Conclusion: KTAE算法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了模型的推理能力，尤其在数学推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated that integrating reinforcement learning
with rule-based rewards can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, even without supervised fine-tuning. However, prevalent
reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO and its variants like DAPO,
suffer from a coarse granularity issue when computing the advantage.
Specifically, they compute rollout-level advantages that assign identical
values to every token within a sequence, failing to capture token-specific
contributions and hindering effective learning. To address this limitation, we
propose Key-token Advantage Estimation (KTAE) - a novel algorithm that
estimates fine-grained, token-level advantages without introducing additional
models. KTAE leverages the correctness of sampled rollouts and applies
statistical analysis to quantify the importance of individual tokens within a
sequence to the final outcome. This quantified token-level importance is then
combined with the rollout-level advantage to obtain a more fine-grained
token-level advantage estimation. Empirical results show that models trained
with GRPO+KTAE and DAPO+KTAE outperform baseline methods across five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Notably, they achieve higher accuracy with
shorter responses and even surpass R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B using the same base
model.

Conclusion: GUI-explorer无需参数更新，适用于新应用，已开源。

Abstract: GUI automation faces critical challenges in dynamic environments. MLLMs
suffer from two key issues: misinterpreting UI components and outdated
knowledge. Traditional fine-tuning methods are costly for app-specific
knowledge updates. We propose GUI-explorer, a training-free GUI agent that
incorporates two fundamental mechanisms: (1) Autonomous Exploration of
Function-aware Trajectory. To comprehensively cover all application
functionalities, we design a Function-aware Task Goal Generator that
automatically constructs exploration goals by analyzing GUI structural
information (e.g., screenshots and activity hierarchies). This enables
systematic exploration to collect diverse trajectories. (2) Unsupervised Mining
of Transition-aware Knowledge. To establish precise screen-operation logic, we
develop a Transition-aware Knowledge Extractor that extracts effective
screen-operation logic through unsupervised analysis the state transition of
structured interaction triples (observation, action, outcome). This eliminates
the need for human involvement in knowledge extraction. With a task success
rate of 53.7% on SPA-Bench and 47.4% on AndroidWorld, GUI-explorer shows
significant improvements over SOTA agents. It requires no parameter updates for
new apps. GUI-explorer is open-sourced and publicly available at

Motivation: 现有基础模型在生成教学有效的视觉解释方面能力有限，且多关注文本推理，忽视了结构化可视化对概念理解的重要性。

Method: 引入EduVisBench多领域、多级别基准，并提出EduVisAgent多代理协作框架，用于分解复杂推理并生成符合认知过程的视觉表示。

Result: 实验表明，EduVisAgent显著优于基线模型，性能提升40.2%，生成更符合教育需求的视觉化内容。

Conclusion: EduVisBench和EduVisAgent为教育场景中的视觉推理能力评估和改进提供了有效工具。

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs), such as diffusion models and large
vision-language models (LVLMs), have been widely applied in educational
contexts, their ability to generate pedagogically effective visual explanations
remains limited. Most existing approaches focus primarily on textual reasoning,
overlooking the critical role of structured and interpretable visualizations in
supporting conceptual understanding. To better assess the visual reasoning
capabilities of FMs in educational settings, we introduce EduVisBench, a
multi-domain, multi-level benchmark. EduVisBench features diverse STEM problem
sets requiring visually grounded solutions, along with a fine-grained
evaluation rubric informed by pedagogical theory. Our empirical analysis
reveals that existing models frequently struggle with the inherent challenge of
decomposing complex reasoning and translating it into visual representations
aligned with human cognitive processes. To address these limitations, we
propose EduVisAgent, a multi-agent collaborative framework that coordinates
specialized agents for instructional planning, reasoning decomposition,
metacognitive prompting, and visualization design. Experimental results show
that EduVisAgent substantially outperforms all baselines, achieving a 40.2%
improvement and delivering more educationally aligned visualizations.

TLDR: TON是一种两阶段训练策略，通过选择性推理减少计算成本，同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类思考过程启发，探索如何在需要时进行推理，避免不必要的计算开销。

Method: 两阶段训练：SFT阶段引入‘thought dropout’操作，GRPO阶段自由选择推理时机。

Result: TON比GRPO减少90%完成长度，性能不降反升。

Conclusion: TON为强化学习实现类人推理模式提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective post-training
strategy for enhancing reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a recent prominent method that
encourages models to generate complete reasoning traces before answering,
leading to increased token usage and computational cost. Inspired by the
human-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but
think carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when
reasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training
strategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective
'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with
empty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold
start for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to
freely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome
rewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by
up to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even
improving it. Further evaluations across diverse vision-language tasks-covering
a range of reasoning difficulties under both 3B and 7B models-consistently
reveal that the model progressively learns to bypass unnecessary reasoning
steps as training advances. These findings shed light on the path toward
human-like reasoning patterns in reinforcement learning approaches. Our code is

Motivation: 在高风险应用中（如医学诊断），现有知识图谱嵌入方法仅提供平均覆盖保证，无法满足每查询一致覆盖的需求。

Result: 理论证明和实验评估表明，CondKGCP能有效实现条件覆盖保证。

Conclusion: CondKGCP为知识图谱嵌入提供了一种更可靠的、条件覆盖的预测方法。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods is
crucial for ensuring the reliability of downstream applications. A recent work
applies conformal prediction to KGE methods, providing uncertainty estimates by
generating a set of answers that is guaranteed to include the true answer with
a predefined confidence level. However, existing methods provide probabilistic
guarantees averaged over a reference set of queries and answers (marginal
coverage guarantee). In high-stakes applications such as medical diagnosis, a
stronger guarantee is often required: the predicted sets must provide
consistent coverage per query (conditional coverage guarantee). We propose
CondKGCP, a novel method that approximates predicate-conditional coverage
guarantees while maintaining compact prediction sets. CondKGCP merges
predicates with similar vector representations and augments calibration with
rank information. We prove the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate empirical
effectiveness of CondKGCP by comprehensive evaluations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have historically been used as tools
that execute narrowly defined tasks. Yet recent advances in AI have unlocked
possibilities for a new class of models that genuinely collaborate with humans
in complex reasoning, from conceptualizing problems to brainstorming solutions.
Such AI thought partners enable novel forms of collaboration and extended
cognition, yet they also pose major risks-including and beyond risks of typical
AI tools and agents. In this commentary, we systematically identify risks of AI
thought partners through a novel framework that identifies risks at multiple
levels of analysis, including Real-time, Individual, and Societal risks arising
from collaborative cognition (RISc). We leverage this framework to propose
concrete metrics for risk evaluation, and finally suggest specific mitigation
strategies for developers and policymakers. As AI thought partners continue to
proliferate, these strategies can help prevent major harms and ensure that
humans actively benefit from productive thought partnerships.

Abstract: We introduce $\infty$-THOR, a new framework for long-horizon embodied tasks
that advances long-context understanding in embodied AI. $\infty$-THOR
provides: (1) a generation framework for synthesizing scalable, reproducible,
and unlimited long-horizon trajectories; (2) a novel embodied QA task,
Needle(s) in the Embodied Haystack, where multiple scattered clues across
extended trajectories test agents' long-context reasoning ability; and (3) a
long-horizon dataset and benchmark suite featuring complex tasks that span
hundreds of environment steps, each paired with ground-truth action sequences.
To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including
interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and
Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context
reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the
challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies
and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a
foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust,

Result: 现有LLM在复杂约束和工具规范方面表现较差，尤其在长指令和元约束条件下。

Conclusion: AgentIF为未来研究提供了基准，揭示了LLM在代理场景中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced capabilities in
real-world agentic applications. Growing research efforts aim to develop
LLM-based agents to address practical demands, introducing a new challenge:
agentic scenarios often involve lengthy instructions with complex constraints,
such as extended system prompts and detailed tool specifications. While
adherence to such instructions is crucial for agentic applications, whether
LLMs can reliably follow them remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce AgentIF, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating LLM
instruction following ability in agentic scenarios. AgentIF features three key
characteristics: (1) Realistic, constructed from 50 real-world agentic
applications. (2) Long, averaging 1,723 words with a maximum of 15,630 words.
(3) Complex, averaging 11.9 constraints per instruction, covering diverse
constraint types, such as tool specifications and condition constraints. To
construct AgentIF, we collect 707 human-annotated instructions across 50
agentic tasks from industrial application agents and open-source agentic
systems. For each instruction, we annotate the associated constraints and
corresponding evaluation metrics, including code-based evaluation, LLM-based
evaluation, and hybrid code-LLM evaluation. We use AgentIF to systematically
evaluate existing advanced LLMs. We observe that current models generally
perform poorly, especially in handling complex constraint structures and tool
specifications. We further conduct error analysis and analytical experiments on
instruction length and meta constraints, providing some findings about the
failure modes of existing LLMs. We have released the code and data to
facilitate future research.

Conclusion: HyGenar为LLMs在语法生成任务中提供了有效改进方向。

Abstract: Grammar plays a critical role in natural language processing and text/code
generation by enabling the definition of syntax, the creation of parsers, and
guiding structured outputs. Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate
impressive capabilities across domains, their ability to infer and generate
grammars has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we aim to study
and improve the ability of LLMs for few-shot grammar generation, where grammars
are inferred from sets of a small number of positive and negative examples and
generated in Backus-Naur Form. To explore this, we introduced a novel dataset
comprising 540 structured grammar generation challenges, devised 6 metrics, and
evaluated 8 various LLMs against it. Our findings reveal that existing LLMs
perform sub-optimally in grammar generation. To address this, we propose an
LLM-driven hybrid genetic algorithm, namely HyGenar, to optimize grammar
generation. HyGenar achieves substantial improvements in both the syntactic and
semantic correctness of generated grammars across LLMs.

Motivation: 单智能体LLM存在上下文限制、角色过载和领域迁移脆弱性，传统多智能体方法又带来分解不明确、合约模糊和验证开销等问题。

Method: KtR框架将任务递归分解为类型化的子任务，通过控制器协调，结合零样本或轻量级增强方法（如思维链、微调、自检）解决问题。

Conclusion: KtR通过算法感知的任务分解和针对性增强，使小型模型成为可靠的协作工具，无需依赖大型模型。

Abstract: Single-agent LLMs hit hard limits--finite context, role overload, and brittle
domain transfer. Conventional multi-agent fixes soften those edges yet expose
fresh pains: ill-posed decompositions, fuzzy contracts, and verification
overhead that blunts the gains. We therefore present Know-The-Ropes (KtR), a
framework that converts domain priors into an algorithmic blueprint hierarchy,
in which tasks are recursively split into typed, controller-mediated subtasks,
each solved zero-shot or with the lightest viable boost (e.g.,
chain-of-thought, micro-tune, self-check). Grounded in the No-Free-Lunch
theorem, KtR trades the chase for a universal prompt for disciplined
decomposition. On the Knapsack problem (3-8 items), three GPT-4o-mini agents
raise accuracy from 3% zero-shot to 95% on size-5 instances after patching a
single bottleneck agent. On the tougher Task-Assignment problem (6-15 jobs), a
six-agent o3-mini blueprint hits 100% up to size 10 and 84% on sizes 13-15,
versus 11% zero-shot. Algorithm-aware decomposition plus targeted augmentation
thus turns modest models into reliable collaborators--no ever-larger monoliths
required.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in biomedicine but lack true causal
understanding, relying instead on correlations. This paper envisions causal LLM
agents that integrate multimodal data (text, images, genomics, etc.) and
perform intervention-based reasoning to infer cause-and-effect. Addressing this
requires overcoming key challenges: designing safe, controllable agentic
frameworks; developing rigorous benchmarks for causal evaluation; integrating
heterogeneous data sources; and synergistically combining LLMs with structured
knowledge (KGs) and formal causal inference tools. Such agents could unlock
transformative opportunities, including accelerating drug discovery through
automated hypothesis generation and simulation, enabling personalized medicine
through patient-specific causal models. This research agenda aims to foster
interdisciplinary efforts, bridging causal concepts and foundation models to

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) extend the capabilities of single LLMs by
enabling cooperation among multiple specialized agents. However, most existing
MAS frameworks rely on a single LLM to drive all agents, constraining the
system's intelligence to the limit of that model. This paper explores the
paradigm of heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS (X-MAS), where agents are powered by
diverse LLMs, elevating the system's potential to the collective intelligence
of diverse LLMs. We introduce X-MAS-Bench, a comprehensive testbed designed to
evaluate the performance of various LLMs across different domains and
MAS-related functions. As an extensive empirical study, we assess 27 LLMs
across 5 domains (encompassing 21 test sets) and 5 functions, conducting over
1.7 million evaluations to identify optimal model selections for each
domain-function combination. Building on these findings, we demonstrate that
transitioning from homogeneous to heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS can
significantly enhance system performance without requiring structural redesign.
Specifically, in a chatbot-only MAS scenario, the heterogeneous configuration
yields up to 8.4\% performance improvement on the MATH dataset. In a mixed
chatbot-reasoner scenario, the heterogeneous MAS could achieve a remarkable
47\% performance boost on the AIME dataset. Our results underscore the
transformative potential of heterogeneous LLMs in MAS, highlighting a promising
avenue for advancing scalable, collaborative AI systems.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为BCPG-NSA的细粒度离线强化学习框架，通过利用负面样本中的有价值信息提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么完全丢弃负面样本，要么对所有标记施加相同的惩罚，未能充分利用负面样本中的自反思和错误纠正步骤等有价值信息。

Method: BCPG-NSA框架包括三个阶段：样本分割、基于共识的步骤正确性评估（结合LLM和PRM判断器）以及带有NSA的策略优化。

Conclusion: BCPG-NSA通过有效挖掘负面样本中的正面步骤，显著提升了模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift
from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of
rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets
becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable
components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary
existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply
equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential
learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy
Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline
RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2)
consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and
3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps
within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms
baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the
same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating
robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.

Motivation: 行人重识别是视频监控中的关键挑战，现有方法在特征提取和表示上仍有改进空间。

Method: 采用HDFF方法融合CNN和LOMO特征，引入张量融合方案，并结合TXQDA进行多线性子空间学习。

Result: 在VIPeR、GRID和PRID450S数据集上验证了方法的有效性，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: HDFF和TXQDA的结合显著提升了行人重识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video surveillance image analysis and processing is a challenging field in
computer vision, with one of its most difficult tasks being Person
Re-Identification (PRe-ID). PRe-ID aims to identify and track target
individuals who have already been detected in a network of cameras, using a
robust description of their pedestrian images. The success of recent research
in person PRe-ID is largely due to effective feature extraction and
representation, as well as the powerful learning of these features to reliably
discriminate between pedestrian images. To this end, two powerful features,
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO), are
modeled on multidimensional data using the proposed method, High-Dimensional
Feature Fusion (HDFF). Specifically, a new tensor fusion scheme is introduced
to leverage and combine these two types of features in a single tensor, even
though their dimensions are not identical. To enhance the system's accuracy, we
employ Tensor Cross-View Quadratic Analysis (TXQDA) for multilinear subspace
learning, followed by cosine similarity for matching. TXQDA efficiently
facilitates learning while reducing the high dimensionality inherent in
high-order tensor data. The effectiveness of our approach is verified through
experiments on three widely-used PRe-ID datasets: VIPeR, GRID, and PRID450S.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）取得了显著进展，但其在解释性和图像中文本定位与理解方面仍存在不足。本文旨在探索LVLMs中负责文本识别的头部机制。

Method: 通过分析多种LVLMs，识别出负责文本识别的OCR Head，并研究其特性（稀疏性、性质差异和激活频率）。通过下游任务（如Chain-of-Thought和头部掩码）验证发现。

Result: OCR Head具有低稀疏性、独特性质和静态激活的特点，且通过调整其sink-token值可提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLMs处理图像中文本信息的内部机制，为模型解释性和性能优化提供了新见解。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), a
gap remains, particularly regarding their interpretability and how they locate
and interpret textual information within images. In this paper, we explore
various LVLMs to identify the specific heads responsible for recognizing text
from images, which we term the Optical Character Recognition Head (OCR Head).
Our findings regarding these heads are as follows: (1) Less Sparse: Unlike
previous retrieval heads, a large number of heads are activated to extract
textual information from images. (2) Qualitatively Distinct: OCR heads possess
properties that differ significantly from general retrieval heads, exhibiting
low similarity in their characteristics. (3) Statically Activated: The
frequency of activation for these heads closely aligns with their OCR scores.
We validate our findings in downstream tasks by applying Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
to both OCR and conventional retrieval heads and by masking these heads. We
also demonstrate that redistributing sink-token values within the OCR heads
improves performance. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the
internal mechanisms LVLMs employ in processing embedded textual information in
images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有卷积和Transformer架构在图像检索中易受低层视觉特征（如颜色）的偏差影响，且缺乏语义理解。此外，基于监督GNN的方法依赖不一致的标注数据，影响检索可靠性。

Method: 提出SCENIR，一种基于图自编码器的无监督检索框架，无需标注数据，并首次引入图编辑距离（GED）作为场景图相似性的确定性度量。

Result: SCENIR在性能和效率上优于现有视觉、多模态和监督GNN方法，并在未标注数据集上展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SCENIR通过无监督学习和GED度量，显著提升了图像检索的语义理解和可靠性，推动了反事实图像检索的进展。

Abstract: Despite the dominance of convolutional and transformer-based architectures in
image-to-image retrieval, these models are prone to biases arising from
low-level visual features, such as color. Recognizing the lack of semantic
understanding as a key limitation, we propose a novel scene graph-based
retrieval framework that emphasizes semantic content over superficial image
characteristics. Prior approaches to scene graph retrieval predominantly rely
on supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which require ground truth graph
pairs driven from image captions. However, the inconsistency of caption-based
supervision stemming from variable text encodings undermine retrieval
reliability. To address these, we present SCENIR, a Graph Autoencoder-based
unsupervised retrieval framework, which eliminates the dependence on labeled
training data. Our model demonstrates superior performance across metrics and
runtime efficiency, outperforming existing vision-based, multimodal, and
supervised GNN approaches. We further advocate for Graph Edit Distance (GED) as
a deterministic and robust ground truth measure for scene graph similarity,
replacing the inconsistent caption-based alternatives for the first time in
image-to-image retrieval evaluation. Finally, we validate the generalizability
of our method by applying it to unannotated datasets via automated scene graph
generation, while substantially contributing in advancing state-of-the-art in
counterfactual image retrieval.

TLDR: 论文提出GlODGen，利用卫星图像生成全球城市的通勤OD流数据，替代传统高成本数据收集方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通勤OD流数据对城市可持续发展至关重要，但传统获取方式成本高且涉及隐私问题。卫星图像提供了一种替代方案。

Method: GlODGen结合视觉语言地理基础模型从卫星图像提取语义信号，并与人口数据结合，通过图扩散模型生成OD流。

Result: 在四大洲六个城市的实验中，GlODGen生成的OD流数据与真实数据高度一致。

Conclusion: GlODGen是一种自动化工具，可高效生成全球城市的OD流数据，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Commuting Origin-destination~(OD) flows, capturing daily population mobility
of citizens, are vital for sustainable development across cities around the
world. However, it is challenging to obtain the data due to the high cost of
travel surveys and privacy concerns. Surprisingly, we find that satellite
imagery, publicly available across the globe, contains rich urban semantic
signals to support high-quality OD flow generation, with over 98\%
expressiveness of traditional multisource hard-to-collect urban
sociodemographic, economics, land use, and point of interest data. This
inspires us to design a novel data generator, GlODGen, which can generate OD
flow data for any cities of interest around the world. Specifically, GlODGen
first leverages Vision-Language Geo-Foundation Models to extract urban semantic
signals related to human mobility from satellite imagery. These features are
then combined with population data to form region-level representations, which
are used to generate OD flows via graph diffusion models. Extensive experiments
on 4 continents and 6 representative cities show that GlODGen has great
generalizability across diverse urban environments on different continents and
can generate OD flow data for global cities highly consistent with real-world
mobility data. We implement GlODGen as an automated tool, seamlessly
integrating data acquisition and curation, urban semantic feature extraction,
and OD flow generation together. It has been released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型合并方法主要针对全微调模型，忽视了流行的LoRA模块，而现有方法在LoRA上表现不佳，且参数幅度方差大导致合并性能下降。

Method: 提出DO-Merging方法，将参数解耦为幅度和方向分量独立合并，并引入无数据、分层梯度下降和正交约束以减少干扰。

Result: 实验验证DO-Merging在视觉、语言和多模态任务中显著优于现有方法，且各组件可灵活集成现有方法。

Conclusion: DO-Merging通过解耦和正交合并有效解决了LoRA合并问题，性能提升显著且成本低。

Abstract: With more open-source models available for diverse tasks, model merging has
gained attention by combining models into one, reducing training, storage, and
inference costs. Current research mainly focuses on model merging for full
fine-tuning, overlooking the popular LoRA. However, our empirical analysis
reveals that: a) existing merging methods designed for full fine-tuning perform
poorly on LoRA; b) LoRA modules show much larger parameter magnitude variance
than full fine-tuned weights; c) greater parameter magnitude variance
correlates with worse merging performance. Considering that large magnitude
variances cause deviations in the distribution of the merged parameters,
resulting in information loss and performance degradation, we propose a
Decoupled and Orthogonal merging approach(DO-Merging). By separating parameters
into magnitude and direction components and merging them independently, we
reduce the impact of magnitude differences on the directional alignment of the
merged models, thereby preserving task information. Furthermore, we introduce a
data-free, layer-wise gradient descent method with orthogonal constraints to
mitigate interference during the merging of direction components. We provide
theoretical guarantees for both the decoupling and orthogonal components. And
we validate through extensive experiments across vision, language, and
multi-modal domains that our proposed DO-Merging can achieve significantly
higher performance than existing merging methods at a minimal cost. Notably,
each component can be flexibly integrated with existing methods, offering near
free-lunch improvements across tasks.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像检索器（如CLIP）在处理属性查询时表现不佳，因其图像嵌入关注全局语义而忽略细节。

Method: 提出使用多模态检索器生成可提示的图像嵌入，并通过预处理和线性近似加速策略优化性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在Recall@5上分别提升15%（预处理）和8%（线性近似）。

Conclusion: 使用可提示的图像嵌入能有效提升属性查询的检索性能，且方法具有通用性和实用性。

Abstract: While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide
crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of
this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual
attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling
attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with
9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like
retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot
ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image
embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other
details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model
(MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with
this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image
embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose
to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers,
which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for
deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base
retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two
acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear
approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5
when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when
prompts are only available during inference.

Motivation: 现有视觉推理模型仅用自然语言生成推理内容，缺乏视觉信息的显式整合，限制了其推理链的清晰性和视觉基础。

Method: 提出GRIT方法，结合自然语言和边界框坐标生成推理链，并采用GRPO-GR强化学习算法优化模型。

Conclusion: GRIT成功统一了推理和视觉基础能力，为多模态语言模型提供了更高效的训练方法。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using Reinforcement Learning
(RL) in building reasoning models that articulate chains of thoughts prior to
producing final answers. However, despite ongoing advances that aim at enabling
reasoning for vision-language tasks, existing open-source visual reasoning
models typically generate reasoning content with pure natural language, lacking
explicit integration of visual information. This limits their ability to
produce clearly articulated and visually grounded reasoning chains. To this
end, we propose Grounded Reasoning with Images and Texts (GRIT), a novel method
for training MLLMs to think with images. GRIT introduces a grounded reasoning
paradigm, in which models generate reasoning chains that interleave natural
language and explicit bounding box coordinates. These coordinates point to
regions of the input image that the model consults during its reasoning
process. Additionally, GRIT is equipped with a reinforcement learning approach,
GRPO-GR, built upon the GRPO algorithm. GRPO-GR employs robust rewards focused
on the final answer accuracy and format of the grounded reasoning output, which
eliminates the need for data with reasoning chain annotations or explicit
bounding box labels. As a result, GRIT achieves exceptional data efficiency,
requiring as few as 20 image-question-answer triplets from existing datasets.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that GRIT effectively trains MLLMs to
produce coherent and visually grounded reasoning chains, showing a successful
unification of reasoning and grounding abilities.

Motivation: 当前方法主要关注普通驾驶场景，缺乏逼真的对抗性场景以有效测试自动驾驶系统。

Method: 采用多轮轨迹优化和评分函数，生成物理合理且逼真的对抗性驾驶视频。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上生成多样化的对抗性场景，显著提高了多个先进自动驾驶模型的碰撞率。

Conclusion: Challenger能有效生成逼真的对抗性驾驶视频，且对抗行为在不同模型间具有可迁移性。

Abstract: Generating photorealistic driving videos has seen significant progress
recently, but current methods largely focus on ordinary, non-adversarial
scenarios. Meanwhile, efforts to generate adversarial driving scenarios often
operate on abstract trajectory or BEV representations, falling short of
delivering realistic sensor data that can truly stress-test autonomous driving
(AD) systems. In this work, we introduce Challenger, a framework that produces
physically plausible yet photorealistic adversarial driving videos. Generating
such videos poses a fundamental challenge: it requires jointly optimizing over
the space of traffic interactions and high-fidelity sensor observations.
Challenger makes this affordable through two techniques: (1) a physics-aware
multi-round trajectory refinement process that narrows down candidate
adversarial maneuvers, and (2) a tailored trajectory scoring function that
encourages realistic yet adversarial behavior while maintaining compatibility
with downstream video synthesis. As tested on the nuScenes dataset, Challenger
generates a diverse range of aggressive driving scenarios-including cut-ins,
sudden lane changes, tailgating, and blind spot intrusions-and renders them
into multiview photorealistic videos. Extensive evaluations show that these
scenarios significantly increase the collision rate of state-of-the-art
end-to-end AD models (UniAD, VAD, SparseDrive, and DiffusionDrive), and
importantly, adversarial behaviors discovered for one model often transfer to
others.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Video Question Answering (VideoQA) have introduced
LLM-based agents, modular frameworks, and procedural solutions, yielding
promising results. These systems use dynamic agents and memory-based mechanisms
to break down complex tasks and refine answers. However, significant
improvements remain in tracking objects for grounding over time and
decision-making based on reasoning to better align object references with
language model outputs, as newer models get better at both tasks. This work
presents an LLM-brained agent for zero-shot Video Question Answering (VideoQA)
that combines a Chain-of-Thought framework with grounding reasoning alongside
YOLO-World to enhance object tracking and alignment. This approach establishes
a new state-of-the-art in VideoQA and Video Understanding, showing enhanced
performance on NExT-QA, iVQA, and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. Our framework also

Abstract: With video games now generating the highest revenues in the entertainment
industry, optimizing game development workflows has become essential for the
sector's sustained growth. Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
offer considerable potential to automate and enhance various aspects of game

accurately evaluate the performance of VLMs in video game QA tasks and
determine their effectiveness in handling real-world scenarios, there is a
clear need for standardized benchmarks, as existing benchmarks are insufficient

Conclusion: 利用伪随机运动和凸优化，可实现大幅分辨率提升，且运动模糊可成为超分辨率的助力。

Abstract: We consider the limits of super-resolution using imaging constraints. Due to
various theoretical and practical limitations, reconstruction-based methods
have been largely restricted to small increases in resolution. In addition,
motion-blur is usually seen as a nuisance that impedes super-resolution. We
show that by using high-precision motion information, sparse image priors, and
convex optimization, it is possible to increase resolution by large factors. A
key operation in super-resolution is deconvolution with a box. In general,
convolution with a box is not invertible. However, we obtain perfect
reconstructions of sparse signals using convex optimization. We also show that
motion blur can be helpful for super-resolution. We demonstrate that using
pseudo-random motion it is possible to reconstruct a high-resolution target
using a single low-resolution image. We present numerical experiments with
simulated data and results with real data captured by a camera mounted on a
computer controlled stage.

Method: 提出OViP框架，动态构建基于模型自身幻觉输出的对比训练数据，利用扩散模型合成负样本，实时生成监督信号。

Result: 实验表明，OViP在减少幻觉的同时保留了多模态能力。

Conclusion: OViP通过失败驱动的训练和动态数据构建，显著提升了模型的对齐能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to hallucination,
often generating content misaligned with visual inputs. While recent approaches
advance multi-modal Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate
hallucination, they typically rely on predefined or randomly edited negative
samples that fail to reflect actual model errors, limiting training efficacy.
In this work, we propose an Online Vision-language Preference Learning (OViP)
framework that dynamically constructs contrastive training data based on the
model's own hallucinated outputs. By identifying semantic differences between
sampled response pairs and synthesizing negative images using a diffusion
model, OViP generates more relevant supervision signals in real time. This
failure-driven training enables adaptive alignment of both textual and visual
preferences. Moreover, we refine existing evaluation protocols to better
capture the trade-off between hallucination suppression and expressiveness.
Experiments on hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate that OViP
effectively reduces hallucinations while preserving core multi-modal
capabilities.

Conclusion: 像素空间推理对提升视觉任务性能至关重要，提出的框架有效解决了视觉推理中的挑战。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of
Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. However, this reasoning
process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its
effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we
introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel
framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual
reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable
VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby
enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space
reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the
model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly
introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a
two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on
synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual
operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a
curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space
reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can
interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos
to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning
benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on
TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy
achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the
importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉模型是否能够学习并编码ImageNet分类学的层次结构。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分析DINOv2模型的内部表示，研究其层次关系。

Result: SAEs揭示了模型激活中的层次关系，表明模型隐含地编码了分类学结构。

Conclusion: SAEs是分析视觉模型语义结构的有效工具，为系统化层次分析提供了框架。

Abstract: The ImageNet hierarchy provides a structured taxonomy of object categories,
offering a valuable lens through which to analyze the representations learned
by deep vision models. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how
vision models encode the ImageNet hierarchy, leveraging Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to probe their internal representations. SAEs have been widely used as
an explanation tool for large language models (LLMs), where they enable the
discovery of semantically meaningful features. Here, we extend their use to
vision models to investigate whether learned representations align with the
ontological structure defined by the ImageNet taxonomy. Our results show that
SAEs uncover hierarchical relationships in model activations, revealing an
implicit encoding of taxonomic structure. We analyze the consistency of these
representations across different layers of the popular vision foundation model
DINOv2 and provide insights into how deep vision models internalize
hierarchical category information by increasing information in the class token
through each layer. Our study establishes a framework for systematic
hierarchical analysis of vision model representations and highlights the
potential of SAEs as a tool for probing semantic structure in deep networks.

Motivation: 在医学影像等关键领域，深度学习模型的可靠性至关重要。传统方法在域偏移场景下表现不佳，因此需要一种能够增强模型适应性和鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 提出CE-ViTs框架，利用视觉变换器模型的集成学习，结合HAM10000、Dermofit和ISIC数据集，通过一致性学习提升域适应性。

Conclusion: CE-ViTs通过集成学习和一致性学习显著提升了模型的域适应性和鲁棒性，适用于关键领域的图像分类任务。

Abstract: Exploring the trustworthiness of deep learning models is crucial, especially
in critical domains such as medical imaging decision support systems. Conformal
prediction has emerged as a rigorous means of providing deep learning models
with reliable uncertainty estimates and safety guarantees. However, conformal
prediction results face challenges due to the backbone model's struggles in
domain-shifted scenarios, such as variations in different sources. To aim this
challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework termed Conformal Ensemble of
Vision Transformers (CE-ViTs) designed to enhance image classification
performance by prioritizing domain adaptation and model robustness, while
accounting for uncertainty. The proposed method leverages an ensemble of vision
transformer models in the backbone, trained on diverse datasets including
HAM10000, Dermofit, and Skin Cancer ISIC datasets. This ensemble learning
approach, calibrated through the combined mentioned datasets, aims to enhance
domain adaptation through conformal learning. Experimental results underscore
that the framework achieves a high coverage rate of 90.38\%, representing an
improvement of 9.95\% compared to the HAM10000 model. This indicates a strong
likelihood that the prediction set includes the true label compared to singular
models. Ensemble learning in CE-ViTs significantly improves conformal
prediction performance, increasing the average prediction set size for
challenging misclassified samples from 1.86 to 3.075.

Result: 在face2comics和edges2shoes数据集上验证，DiT框架实现了高质量且语义一致的翻译效果。

Conclusion: DiT框架为图像到图像翻译任务提供了一种有前景的替代方案，尤其适用于需要细粒度控制的场景。

Abstract: Image-to-image translation aims to learn a mapping between a source and a
target domain, enabling tasks such as style transfer, appearance
transformation, and domain adaptation. In this work, we explore a
diffusion-based framework for image-to-image translation by adapting Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), which combine the denoising capabilities of diffusion
models with the global modeling power of transformers. To guide the translation
process, we condition the model on image embeddings extracted from a
pre-trained CLIP encoder, allowing for fine-grained and structurally consistent
translations without relying on text or class labels. We incorporate both a
CLIP similarity loss to enforce semantic consistency and an LPIPS perceptual
loss to enhance visual fidelity during training. We validate our approach on
two benchmark datasets: face2comics, which translates real human faces to
comic-style illustrations, and edges2shoes, which translates edge maps to
realistic shoe images. Experimental results demonstrate that DiT, combined with
CLIP-based conditioning and perceptual similarity objectives, achieves
high-quality, semantically faithful translations, offering a promising
alternative to GAN-based models for paired image-to-image translation tasks.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the image processing community should broaden
its focus from purely model-centric development to include agentic system
design as an essential complementary paradigm. While deep learning has
significantly advanced capabilities for specific image processing tasks,
current approaches face critical limitations in generalization, adaptability,
and real-world problem-solving flexibility. We propose that developing
intelligent agentic systems, capable of dynamically selecting, combining, and
optimizing existing image processing tools, represents the next evolutionary
step for the field. Such systems would emulate human experts' ability to
strategically orchestrate different tools to solve complex problems, overcoming
the brittleness of monolithic models. The paper analyzes key limitations of
model-centric paradigms, establishes design principles for agentic image
processing systems, and outlines different capability levels for such agents.

TLDR: CP-LLM是一种新型多模态大语言模型，通过双视觉编码器分别分析视频上下文和像素失真，结合语言解码器实现高质量评分和描述生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA模型缺乏上下文理解或对小失真敏感，CP-LLM旨在同时解决这两方面问题。

Method: 采用双视觉编码器分别处理高/低层次信息，结合语言解码器进行多任务训练（评分、描述生成、成对比较）。

Result: CP-LLM在VQA基准测试中表现最优，对小失真具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CP-LLM为视频质量评估提供了全面且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a challenging research topic with broad
applications. Effective VQA necessitates sensitivity to pixel-level distortions
and a comprehensive understanding of video context to accurately determine the
perceptual impact of distortions. Traditional hand-crafted and learning-based
VQA models mainly focus on pixel-level distortions and lack contextual
understanding, while recent LLM-based models struggle with sensitivity to small
distortions or handle quality scoring and description as separate tasks. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce CP-LLM: a Context and Pixel aware
Large Language Model. CP-LLM is a novel multimodal LLM architecture featuring
dual vision encoders designed to independently analyze perceptual quality at
both high-level (video context) and low-level (pixel distortion) granularity,
along with a language decoder subsequently reasons about the interplay between
these aspects. This design enables CP-LLM to simultaneously produce robust
quality scores and interpretable quality descriptions, with enhanced
sensitivity to pixel distortions (e.g. compression artifacts). The model is
trained via a multi-task pipeline optimizing for score prediction, description
generation, and pairwise comparisons. Experiment results demonstrate that
CP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset performance on established VQA
benchmarks and superior robustness to pixel distortions, confirming its
efficacy for comprehensive and practical video quality assessment in real-world
scenarios.

Abstract: Perceiving pedestrians in highly crowded urban environments is a difficult
long-tail problem for learning-based autonomous perception. Speeding up 3D
ground truth generation for such challenging scenes is performance-critical yet
very challenging. The difficulties include the sparsity of the captured
pedestrian point cloud and a lack of suitable benchmarks for a specific system
design study. To tackle the challenges, we first collect a new multi-view
LiDAR-camera 3D multiple-object-tracking benchmark of highly crowded
pedestrians for in-depth analysis. We then build an offboard auto-labeling
system that reconstructs pedestrian trajectories from LiDAR point cloud and
multi-view images. To improve the generalization power for crowded scenes and
the performance for small objects, we propose to learn high-resolution
representations that are density-aware and relationship-aware. Extensive
experiments validate that our approach significantly improves the 3D pedestrian
tracking performance towards higher auto-labeling efficiency. The code will be

Abstract: Leaf diseases are harmful conditions that affect the health, appearance and
productivity of plants, leading to significant plant loss and negatively
impacting farmers' livelihoods. These diseases cause visible symptoms such as
lesions, color changes, and texture variations, making it difficult for farmers
to manage plant health, especially in large or remote farms where expert
knowledge is limited. The main motivation of this study is to provide an
efficient and accessible solution for identifying plant leaf diseases in
Bangladesh, where agriculture plays a critical role in food security. The
objective of our research is to classify 21 distinct leaf diseases across six
plants using deep learning models, improving disease detection accuracy while
reducing the need for expert involvement. Deep Learning (DL) techniques,
including CNN and Transfer Learning (TL) models like VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2,
InceptionV3, ResNet50V2 and Xception are used. VGG19 and Xception achieve the
highest accuracies, with 98.90% and 98.66% respectively. Additionally,
Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as GradCAM, GradCAM++, LayerCAM, ScoreCAM
and FasterScoreCAM are used to enhance transparency by highlighting the regions
of the models focused on during disease classification. This transparency
ensures that farmers can understand the model's predictions and take necessary
action. This approach not only improves disease management but also supports
farmers in making informed decisions, leading to better plant protection and
increased agricultural productivity.

Abstract: The brain is a highly complex organ that manages many important tasks,
including movement, memory and thinking. Brain-related conditions, like tumors
and degenerative disorders, can be hard to diagnose and treat. Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) serves as a key tool for identifying these conditions,
offering high-resolution images of brain structures. Despite this, interpreting

Result: 在HOPE和YCB-Video数据集上，GMatch-SIFT表现优于传统和基于学习的方法，达到或超过实例级姿态网络的性能。

Conclusion: GMatch-SIFT不仅验证了其在物体姿态估计中的有效性，还展示了其作为通用特征匹配器的广泛适用性。

Abstract: We present GMatch, a learning-free feature matcher designed for robust 6DoF
object pose estimation, addressing common local ambiguities in sparse feature
matching. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on descriptor similarity,
GMatch performs a guided, incremental search, enforcing SE(3)-invariant
geometric consistency throughout the matching process. It leverages a provably
complete set of geometric features that uniquely determine 3D keypoint
configurations, ensuring globally consistent correspondences without the need
for training or GPU support. When combined with classical descriptors such as
SIFT, GMatch-SIFT forms a general-purpose pose estimation pipeline that offers
strong interpretability and generalization across diverse objects and scenes.
Experiments on the HOPE dataset show that GMatch outperforms both traditional
and learning-based matchers, with GMatch-SIFT achieving or surpassing the
performance of instance-level pose networks. On the YCB-Video dataset,
GMatch-SIFT demonstrates high accuracy and low variance on texture-rich
objects. These results not only validate the effectiveness of GMatch-SIFT for
object pose estimation but also highlight the broader applicability of GMatch
as a general-purpose feature matcher. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Result: 实验表明，SSL在减少幻觉方面显著优于现有解码方法，且具有跨模型架构的迁移性和低时间开销。

Conclusion: SSL是一种高效、无需训练的方法，能有效减少LVLM的幻觉问题，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on
multimodal tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning.
However, they still suffer from hallucinations, generating text inconsistent
with visual input, posing significant risks in real-world applications.
Existing approaches to address this issue focus on incorporating external
knowledge bases, alignment training, or decoding strategies, all of which
require substantial computational cost and time. Recent works try to explore
more efficient alternatives by adjusting LVLMs' internal representations.
Although promising, these methods may cause hallucinations to be insufficiently
suppressed or lead to excessive interventions that negatively affect normal
semantics. In this work, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify
semantic directions closely associated with either hallucinations or actuality,
realizing more precise and direct hallucination-related representations. Our
analysis demonstrates that interventions along the faithful direction we
identified can mitigate hallucinations, while those along the hallucinatory
direction can exacerbate them. Building on these insights, we propose Steering
LVLMs via SAE Latent Directions (SSL), a training-free method based on
SAE-derived latent directions to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly outperforms existing decoding
approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining transferability
across different model architectures with negligible additional time overhead.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分类数据集存在噪声标签和缺失标签问题，导致模型评估不准确，REVEAL旨在系统解决这些问题。

Method: 整合预训练视觉语言模型（如LLaVA、BLIP）与标签清理方法（如Cleanlab），通过置信度预测和共识过滤检测并修正标签。

Result: REVEAL显著提升6个基准测试集的质量，提供软标签结果，并通过人工验证与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: REVEAL为图像分类数据集提供了一种有效的标签清理方法，支持更准确的模型评估。

Abstract: Image classification benchmark datasets such as CIFAR, MNIST, and ImageNet
serve as critical tools for model evaluation. However, despite the cleaning
efforts, these datasets still suffer from pervasive noisy labels and often
contain missing labels due to the co-existing image pattern where multiple
classes appear in an image sample. This results in misleading model comparisons
and unfair evaluations. Existing label cleaning methods focus primarily on
noisy labels, but the issue of missing labels remains largely overlooked.
Motivated by these challenges, we present a comprehensive framework named
REVEAL, integrating state-of-the-art pre-trained vision-language models (e.g.,
LLaVA, BLIP, Janus, Qwen) with advanced machine/human label curation methods
(e.g., Docta, Cleanlab, MTurk), to systematically address both noisy labels and
missing label detection in widely-used image classification test sets. REVEAL
detects potential noisy labels and omissions, aggregates predictions from
various methods, and refines label accuracy through confidence-informed
predictions and consensus-based filtering. Additionally, we provide a thorough
analysis of state-of-the-art vision-language models and pre-trained image
classifiers, highlighting their strengths and limitations within the context of
dataset renovation by revealing 10 observations. Our method effectively reveals
missing labels from public datasets and provides soft-labeled results with
likelihoods. Through human verifications, REVEAL significantly improves the
quality of 6 benchmark test sets, highly aligning to human judgments and
enabling more accurate and meaningful comparisons in image classification.

Conclusion: FRANK Model通过无需训练的方法有效提升了MLLM的推理能力，为多模态推理任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1) have
showcased impressive reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning.
However, extending these capabilities to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is hampered by
the prohibitive costs of retraining and the scarcity of high-quality,
verifiable multimodal reasoning datasets. This paper introduces FRANK Model, a
training-FRee ANd r1-liKe MLLM that imbues off-the-shelf MLLMs with reasoning
and reflection abilities, without any gradient updates or extra supervision.
Our key insight is to decouple perception and reasoning across MLLM decoder
layers. Specifically, we observe that compared to the deeper decoder layers,
the shallow decoder layers allocate more attention to visual tokens, while the
deeper decoder layers concentrate on textual semantics. This observation
motivates a hierarchical weight merging approach that combines a
visual-pretrained MLLM with a reasoning-specialized LLM. To this end, we
propose a layer-wise, Taylor-derived closed-form fusion mechanism that
integrates reasoning capacity into deep decoder layers while preserving visual
grounding in shallow decoder layers. Extensive experiments on challenging
multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
On the MMMU benchmark, our model FRANK-38B achieves an accuracy of 69.2,
outperforming the strongest baseline InternVL2.5-38B by +5.3, and even
surpasses the proprietary GPT-4o model. Our project homepage is at:

Conclusion: BadDepth填补了MDE模型后门攻击的研究空白，展示了其在复杂场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models
have been widely applied in fields such as autonomous driving and robotics.
However, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains unexplored. To fill
the gap in this area, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of backdoor
attacks against MDE models. Typically, existing backdoor attack methods can not
be applied to MDE models. This is because the label used in MDE is in the form
of a depth map. To address this, we propose BadDepth, the first backdoor attack
targeting MDE models. BadDepth overcomes this limitation by selectively
manipulating the target object's depth using an image segmentation model and
restoring the surrounding areas via depth completion, thereby generating
poisoned datasets for object-level backdoor attacks. To improve robustness in
physical world scenarios, we further introduce digital-to-physical augmentation
to adapt to the domain gap between the physical world and the digital domain.
Extensive experiments on multiple models validate the effectiveness of BadDepth
in both the digital domain and the physical world, without being affected by
environmental factors.

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上测试，SuperPure对局部补丁攻击的鲁棒性提升20%，清洁准确率提升10%；对分布式补丁攻击的鲁棒性达58%（现有方法为0%）；延迟降低98%。

Conclusion: SuperPure在鲁棒性、效率和实用性上显著优于现有方法，适用于延迟敏感的网络物理系统。

Abstract: As vision-based machine learning models are increasingly integrated into
autonomous and cyber-physical systems, concerns about (physical) adversarial
patch attacks are growing. While state-of-the-art defenses can achieve
certified robustness with minimal impact on utility against highly-concentrated
localized patch attacks, they fall short in two important areas: (i)
State-of-the-art methods are vulnerable to low-noise distributed patches where
perturbations are subtly dispersed to evade detection or masking, as shown
recently by the DorPatch attack; (ii) Achieving high robustness with
state-of-the-art methods is extremely time and resource-consuming, rendering
them impractical for latency-sensitive applications in many cyber-physical
systems.
  To address both robustness and latency issues, this paper proposes a new
defense strategy for adversarial patch attacks called SuperPure. The key
novelty is developing a pixel-wise masking scheme that is robust against both
distributed and localized patches. The masking involves leveraging a GAN-based
super-resolution scheme to gradually purify the image from adversarial patches.
Our extensive evaluations using ImageNet and two standard classifiers, ResNet
and EfficientNet, show that SuperPure advances the state-of-the-art in three
major directions: (i) it improves the robustness against conventional localized
patches by more than 20%, on average, while also improving top-1 clean accuracy
by almost 10%; (ii) It achieves 58% robustness against distributed patch
attacks (as opposed to 0% in state-of-the-art method, PatchCleanser); (iii) It
decreases the defense end-to-end latency by over 98% compared to PatchCleanser.
Our further analysis shows that SuperPure is robust against white-box attacks
and different patch sizes. Our code is open-source.

*Yuang Ai,Huaibo Huang,Tao Wu,Qihang Fan,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为RELA的线性注意力增强方法，并基于此构建了高效的图像恢复Transformer模型LAformer，解决了传统Transformer在高分辨率图像处理中的计算复杂性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在图像恢复任务中表现出色，但自注意力的二次复杂度限制了其在高分辨率图像上的应用。现有方法通过稀疏或窗口注意力缓解问题，但牺牲了全局上下文建模能力。

Method: 提出Rank Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA)，通过轻量级深度卷积增强特征表示，并构建LAformer模型，结合线性注意力和通道注意力实现高效全局感知。

Result: LAformer在7个图像恢复任务和21个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并显著提升了计算效率。

Conclusion: LAformer通过消除硬件低效操作（如softmax和窗口移位），实现了高效的高分辨率图像处理，同时保持了优异的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made remarkable progress in image restoration
(IR) tasks. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer
hinders its applicability to high-resolution images. Existing methods mitigate
this issue with sparse or window-based attention, yet inherently limit global
context modeling. Linear attention, a variant of softmax attention,
demonstrates promise in global context modeling while maintaining linear
complexity, offering a potential solution to the above challenge. Despite its
efficiency benefits, vanilla linear attention suffers from a significant
performance drop in IR, largely due to the low-rank nature of its attention
map. To counter this, we propose Rank Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA), a
simple yet effective method that enriches feature representations by
integrating a lightweight depthwise convolution. Building upon RELA, we propose
an efficient and effective image restoration Transformer, named LAformer.
LAformer achieves effective global perception by integrating linear attention
and channel attention, while also enhancing local fitting capabilities through
a convolutional gated feed-forward network. Notably, LAformer eliminates
hardware-inefficient operations such as softmax and window shifting, enabling
efficient processing of high-resolution images. Extensive experiments across 7
IR tasks and 21 benchmarks demonstrate that LAformer outperforms SOTA methods
and offers significant computational advantages.

Abstract: Ultra-high-definition (UHD) image restoration aims to specifically solve the
problem of quality degradation in ultra-high-resolution images. Recent
advancements in this field are predominantly driven by deep learning-based
innovations, including enhancements in dataset construction, network
architecture, sampling strategies, prior knowledge integration, and loss
functions. In this paper, we systematically review recent progress in UHD image
restoration, covering various aspects ranging from dataset construction to
algorithm design. This serves as a valuable resource for understanding
state-of-the-art developments in the field. We begin by summarizing degradation
models for various image restoration subproblems, such as super-resolution,
low-light enhancement, deblurring, dehazing, deraining, and desnowing, and
emphasizing the unique challenges of their application to UHD image
restoration. We then highlight existing UHD benchmark datasets and organize the
literature according to degradation types and dataset construction methods.
Following this, we showcase major milestones in deep learning-driven UHD image
restoration, reviewing the progression of restoration tasks, technological
developments, and evaluations of existing methods. We further propose a
classification framework based on network architectures and sampling
strategies, helping to clearly organize existing methods. Finally, we share
insights into the current research landscape and propose directions for further
advancements. A related repository is available at

Motivation: 随着连接设备数量增加，需快速检测安全问题，且需处理大量数据。设备异构性要求轻量化解决方案。

Result: 该方法能有效突出异常，减少复杂架构需求。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督学习方法能高效检测异常，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Due to the recent increase in the number of connected devices, the need to
promptly detect security issues is emerging. Moreover, the high number of
communication flows creates the necessity of processing huge amounts of data.
Furthermore, the connected devices are heterogeneous in nature, having
different computational capacities. For this reason, in this work we propose an
image-based representation of network traffic which allows to realize a compact
summary of the current network conditions with 1-second time windows. The
proposed representation highlights the presence of anomalies thus reducing the
need for complex processing architectures. Finally, we present an unsupervised
learning approach which effectively detects the presence of anomalies. The code

TLDR: 论文提出了一种结合几何和反射率信息的3D地点识别描述符RE-TRIP，通过实验验证其在复杂场景中的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR地点识别方法仅依赖几何信息，忽略了反射率数据，导致在几何退化或动态环境中表现不佳。

Method: 提出RE-TRIP描述符，结合几何和反射率信息，并开发了关键点提取、实例分割、匹配及闭环验证方法。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，RE-TRIP在Scan Context、Intensity Scan Context和STD等指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RE-TRIP通过利用反射率信息提升了地点识别的鲁棒性，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: While most people associate LiDAR primarily with its ability to measure
distances and provide geometric information about the environment (via point
clouds), LiDAR also captures additional data, including reflectivity or
intensity values. Unfortunately, when LiDAR is applied to Place Recognition
(PR) in mobile robotics, most previous works on LiDAR-based PR rely only on
geometric measurements, neglecting the additional reflectivity information that
LiDAR provides. In this paper, we propose a novel descriptor for 3D PR, named
RE-TRIP (REflectivity-instance augmented TRIangle descriPtor). This new
descriptor leverages both geometric measurements and reflectivity to enhance
robustness in challenging scenarios such as geometric degeneracy, high
geometric similarity, and the presence of dynamic objects. To implement RE-TRIP
in real-world applications, we further propose (1) a keypoint extraction
method, (2) a key instance segmentation method, (3) a RE-TRIP matching method,
and (4) a reflectivity-combined loop verification method. Finally, we conduct a
series of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of RE-TRIP. Applied to
public datasets (i.e., HELIPR, FusionPortable) containing diverse scenarios
such as long corridors, bridges, large-scale urban areas, and highly dynamic
environments -- our experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Scan Context,
Intensity Scan Context, and STD.

TLDR: TRAIL提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的测试时适应框架，通过结合对抗目标和感知约束生成分布对齐的对抗样本，显著提升了跨模型攻击的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法因生成的对抗特征与真实数据分布不匹配，导致跨模型可迁移性受限。

Method: TRAIL在攻击时更新扩散U-Net权重，结合对抗目标（误导受害者模型）和感知约束（保持图像真实性），通过迭代噪声注入和去噪生成对抗样本。

Result: 实验表明，TRAIL在跨模型攻击可迁移性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 分布对齐的对抗特征合成对实际黑盒攻击至关重要。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks exploiting unrestricted natural perturbations present
severe security risks to deep learning systems, yet their transferability
across models remains limited due to distribution mismatches between generated
adversarial features and real-world data. While recent works utilize
pre-trained diffusion models as adversarial priors, they still encounter
challenges due to the distribution shift between the distribution of ideal
adversarial samples and the natural image distribution learned by the diffusion
model. To address the challenge, we propose Transferable Robust Adversarial
Images via Latent Diffusion (TRAIL), a test-time adaptation framework that
enables the model to generate images from a distribution of images with
adversarial features and closely resembles the target images. To mitigate the
distribution shift, during attacks, TRAIL updates the diffusion U-Net's weights
by combining adversarial objectives (to mislead victim models) and perceptual
constraints (to preserve image realism). The adapted model then generates
adversarial samples through iterative noise injection and denoising guided by
these objectives. Experiments demonstrate that TRAIL significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in cross-model attack transferability, validating that
distribution-aligned adversarial feature synthesis is critical for practical
black-box attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是验证当前概念擦除技术是否真正移除了生成目标概念的能力，而非仅实现表面的抑制。

Method: 采用实例级评估策略，通过轻量级微调测试擦除概念的再激活潜力，定量和定性分析两种代表性方法（统一概念编辑和擦除稳定扩散）。

Result: 结果显示擦除的概念在轻微适应后仍能重现，表明现有方法仅抑制了潜在生成表示而未完全消除。

Conclusion: 结论指出现有概念擦除方法存在关键局限性，需更深层次的表示级干预和更严格的评估标准以实现真正的概念移除。

Abstract: To what extent does concept erasure eliminate generative capacity in
diffusion models? While prior evaluations have primarily focused on measuring
concept suppression under specific textual prompts, we explore a complementary
and fundamental question: do current concept erasure techniques genuinely
remove the ability to generate targeted concepts, or do they merely achieve
superficial, prompt-specific suppression? We systematically evaluate the
robustness and reversibility of two representative concept erasure methods,
Unified Concept Editing and Erased Stable Diffusion, by probing their ability
to eliminate targeted generative behaviors in text-to-image models. These
methods attempt to suppress undesired semantic concepts by modifying internal
model parameters, either through targeted attention edits or model-level
fine-tuning strategies. To rigorously assess whether these techniques truly
erase generative capacity, we propose an instance-level evaluation strategy
that employs lightweight fine-tuning to explicitly test the reactivation
potential of erased concepts. Through quantitative metrics and qualitative
analyses, we show that erased concepts often reemerge with substantial visual
fidelity after minimal adaptation, indicating that current methods suppress
latent generative representations without fully eliminating them. Our findings
reveal critical limitations in existing concept erasure approaches and
highlight the need for deeper, representation-level interventions and more
rigorous evaluation standards to ensure genuine, irreversible removal of
concepts from generative models.

Motivation: 长视频理解在现实应用中至关重要，但现有方法因视频解码和预填充的高计算成本而受限。

Method: 提出QuickVideo，包含并行解码器QuickDecoder、内存高效预填充方法QuickPrefill，以及CPU解码与GPU推理的重叠方案。

Result: 实验表明，QuickVideo显著减少推理时间，支持在有限硬件上实现高质量视频理解。

Conclusion: QuickVideo为长视频处理提供了可行的解决方案，适用于不同时长和采样率的视频。

Abstract: Long-video understanding has emerged as a crucial capability in real-world
applications such as video surveillance, meeting summarization, educational
lecture analysis, and sports broadcasting. However, it remains computationally
prohibitive for VideoLLMs, primarily due to two bottlenecks: 1) sequential
video decoding, the process of converting the raw bit stream to RGB frames can
take up to a minute for hour-long video inputs, and 2) costly prefilling of up
to several million tokens for LLM inference, resulting in high latency and
memory use. To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a
system-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video
understanding to support real-time downstream applications. It comprises three
key innovations: QuickDecoder, a parallelized CPU-based video decoder that
achieves 2-3 times speedup by splitting videos into keyframe-aligned intervals
processed concurrently; QuickPrefill, a memory-efficient prefilling method
using KV-cache pruning to support more frames with less GPU memory; and an
overlapping scheme that overlaps CPU video decoding with GPU inference.
Together, these components infernece time reduce by a minute on long video
inputs, enabling scalable, high-quality video understanding even on limited
hardware. Experiments show that QuickVideo generalizes across durations and
sampling rates, making long video processing feasible in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像标题评估指标未能完全捕捉视觉语义和语言语用学，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出Redemption Score框架，结合MID、DINO感知相似性和BERTScore三种信号进行校准融合。

Result: 在Flickr8k基准测试中，Kendall-τ达56.43，优于12种现有方法，且无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: Redemption Score通过有效结合视觉和语言信号，提供了更鲁棒和细致的评估。

Abstract: Evaluating image captions requires cohesive assessment of both visual
semantics and language pragmatics, which is often not entirely captured by most
metrics. We introduce Redemption Score, a novel hybrid framework that ranks
image captions by triangulating three complementary signals: (1) Mutual
Information Divergence (MID) for global image-text distributional alignment,
(2) DINO-based perceptual similarity of cycle-generated images for visual
grounding, and (3) BERTScore for contextual text similarity against human
references. A calibrated fusion of these signals allows Redemption Score to
offer a more holistic assessment. On the Flickr8k benchmark, Redemption Score
achieves a Kendall-$\tau$ of 56.43, outperforming twelve prior methods and
demonstrating superior correlation with human judgments without requiring
task-specific training. Our framework provides a more robust and nuanced
evaluation by effectively redeeming image semantics and linguistic
interpretability indicated by strong transfer of knowledge in the Conceptual
Captions and MS COCO datasets.

Result: AI编辑器在低创造性任务中表现不佳，且偏好非请求的修饰；VLM评分与人类评分存在差异。

Conclusion: AI编辑器需改进精确编辑能力，VLM评分标准需进一步研究。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) holds significant promise for automating everyday image
editing tasks, especially following the recent release of GPT-4o on March 25,
2025. However, what subjects do people most often want edited? What kinds of
editing actions do they want to perform (e.g., removing or stylizing the
subject)? Do people prefer precise edits with predictable outcomes or highly
creative ones? By understanding the characteristics of real-world requests and
the corresponding edits made by freelance photo-editing wizards, can we draw
lessons for improving AI-based editors and determine which types of requests
can currently be handled successfully by AI editors? In this paper, we present
a unique study addressing these questions by analyzing 83k requests from the
past 12 years (2013-2025) on the Reddit community, which collected 305k
PSR-wizard edits. According to human ratings, approximately only 33% of
requests can be fulfilled by the best AI editors (including GPT-4o,
Gemini-2.0-Flash, SeedEdit). Interestingly, AI editors perform worse on
low-creativity requests that require precise editing than on more open-ended
tasks. They often struggle to preserve the identity of people and animals, and
frequently make non-requested touch-ups. On the other side of the table, VLM
judges (e.g., o1) perform differently from human judges and may prefer AI edits
more than human edits. Code and qualitative examples are available at:

Result: 在MathVista、ScienceQA等基准测试中，VLM-R³在零样本和少样本设置下达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: VLM-R³通过动态视觉区域聚焦和强化学习优化，显著提升了复杂视觉推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Recently, reasoning-based MLLMs have achieved a degree of success in
generating long-form textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle
with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on and
revisiting of visual regions to achieve precise grounding of textual reasoning
in visual evidence. We introduce \textbf{VLM-R$^3$} (\textbf{V}isual
\textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel with \textbf{R}egion \textbf{R}ecognition and
\textbf{R}easoning), a framework that equips an MLLM with the ability to (i)
decide \emph{when} additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine
\emph{where} to ground within the image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the
relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved chain-of-thought. The core
of our method is \textbf{Region-Conditioned Reinforcement Policy Optimization
(R-GRPO)}, a training paradigm that rewards the model for selecting informative
regions, formulating appropriate transformations (e.g.\ crop, zoom), and
integrating the resulting visual context into subsequent reasoning steps. To
bootstrap this policy, we compile a modest but carefully curated Visuo-Lingual
Interleaved Rationale (VLIR) corpus that provides step-level supervision on
region selection and textual justification. Extensive experiments on MathVista,
ScienceQA, and other benchmarks show that VLM-R$^3$ sets a new state of the art
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, with the largest gains appearing on
questions demanding subtle spatial reasoning or fine-grained visual cue
extraction.

Result: MedCFVQA在SLAKE、RadVQA及其CP数据集上显著优于非因果模型。

Conclusion: MedCFVQA有效解决了模态偏好偏差问题，提升了MedVQA的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is crucial for enhancing the
efficiency of clinical diagnosis by providing accurate and timely responses to
clinicians' inquiries regarding medical images. Existing MedVQA models suffered
from modality preference bias, where predictions are heavily dominated by one
modality while overlooking the other (in MedVQA, usually questions dominate the
answer but images are overlooked), thereby failing to learn multimodal
knowledge. To overcome the modality preference bias, we proposed a Medical
CounterFactual VQA (MedCFVQA) model, which trains with bias and leverages
causal graphs to eliminate the modality preference bias during inference.
Existing MedVQA datasets exhibit substantial prior dependencies between
questions and answers, which results in acceptable performance even if the
model significantly suffers from the modality preference bias. To address this
issue, we reconstructed new datasets by leveraging existing MedVQA datasets and
Changed their P3rior dependencies (CP) between questions and their answers in
the training and test set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MedCFVQA
significantly outperforms its non-causal counterpart on both SLAKE, RadVQA and
SLAKE-CP, RadVQA-CP datasets.

Abstract: Total Body Photography (TBP) is becoming a useful screening tool for patients
at high risk for skin cancer. While much progress has been made, existing TBP
systems can be further improved for automatic detection and analysis of
suspicious skin lesions, which is in part related to the resolution and
sharpness of acquired images. This paper proposes a novel shape-aware TBP
system automatically capturing full-body images while optimizing image quality
in terms of resolution and sharpness over the body surface. The system uses
depth and RGB cameras mounted on a 360-degree rotary beam, along with 3D body
shape estimation and an in-focus surface optimization method to select the
optimal focus distance for each camera pose. This allows for optimizing the
focused coverage over the complex 3D geometry of the human body given the
calibrated camera poses. We evaluate the effectiveness of the system in
capturing high-fidelity body images. The proposed system achieves an average
resolution of 0.068 mm/pixel and 0.0566 mm/pixel with approximately 85% and 95%
of surface area in-focus, evaluated on simulation data of diverse body shapes
and poses as well as a real scan of a mannequin respectively. Furthermore, the
proposed shape-aware focus method outperforms existing focus protocols (e.g.
auto-focus). We believe the high-fidelity imaging enabled by the proposed
system will improve automated skin lesion analysis for skin cancer screening.

Conclusion: CT-Agent有效解决了CTQA任务中的关键问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) scan, which produces 3D volumetric medical data that
can be viewed as hundreds of cross-sectional images (a.k.a. slices), provides
detailed anatomical information for diagnosis. For radiologists, creating CT
radiology reports is time-consuming and error-prone. A visual question
answering (VQA) system that can answer radiologists' questions about some
anatomical regions on the CT scan and even automatically generate a radiology
report is urgently needed. However, existing VQA systems cannot adequately
handle the CT radiology question answering (CTQA) task for: (1) anatomic
complexity makes CT images difficult to understand; (2) spatial relationship
across hundreds slices is difficult to capture. To address these issues, this
paper proposes CT-Agent, a multimodal agentic framework for CTQA. CT-Agent
adopts anatomically independent tools to break down the anatomic complexity;
furthermore, it efficiently captures the across-slice spatial relationship with
a global-local token compression strategy. Experimental results on two 3D chest
CT datasets, CT-RATE and RadGenome-ChestCT, verify the superior performance of
CT-Agent.

VSR remains challenging, due to the high training overhead on video data and
stringent fidelity demands. To tackle the above issues, we propose DOVE, an
efficient one-step diffusion model for real-world VSR. DOVE is obtained by
fine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion model (*i.e.*, CogVideoX). To
effectively train DOVE, we introduce the latent-pixel training strategy. The
strategy employs a two-stage scheme to gradually adapt the model to the video
super-resolution task. Meanwhile, we design a video processing pipeline to
construct a high-quality dataset tailored for VSR, termed HQ-VSR. Fine-tuning
on this dataset further enhances the restoration capability of DOVE. Extensive
experiments show that DOVE exhibits comparable or superior performance to
multi-step diffusion-based VSR methods. It also offers outstanding inference
efficiency, achieving up to a **28$\times$** speed-up over existing methods
such as MGLD-VSR. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/DOVE.

### [379] [Swin Transformer for Robust CGI Images Detection: Intra- and Inter-Dataset Analysis across Multiple Color Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16253)
*Preeti Mehta,Aman Sagar,Suchi Kumari*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 该研究提出了一种基于Swin Transformer的模型，用于在RGB、YCbCr和HSV三种颜色空间中区分计算机生成图像（CGI）和真实数字图像。模型在多个数据集上表现出色，RGB颜色空间效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类方法在处理CGI的复杂性和变异性时存在局限性，需要一种更准确的区分方法。

Method: 采用Swin Transformer的分层架构捕捉局部和全局特征，结合数据增强技术解决数据集不平衡问题，并通过t-SNE可视化展示特征可分离性。

Result: RGB颜色空间在各数据集中表现最佳，模型在域泛化分析中优于VGG-19和ResNet-50。

Conclusion: Swin Transformer模型在数字图像取证中具有潜力，尤其在区分CGI和自然图像方面表现出色，适合需要高精度分类的场景。

Abstract: This study aims to address the growing challenge of distinguishing
computer-generated imagery (CGI) from authentic digital images across three
different color spaces; RGB, YCbCr, and HSV. Given the limitations of existing
classification methods in handling the complexity and variability of CGI, this
research proposes a Swin Transformer based model for accurate differentiation
between natural and synthetic images. The proposed model leverages the Swin
Transformer's hierarchical architecture to capture local and global features
for distinguishing CGI from natural images. Its performance was assessed
through intra- and inter-dataset testing across three datasets: CiFAKE, JSSSTU,
and Columbia. The model was evaluated individually on each dataset (D1, D2, D3)
and on the combined datasets (D1+D2+D3) to test its robustness and domain
generalization. To address dataset imbalance, data augmentation techniques were
applied. Additionally, t-SNE visualization was used to demonstrate the feature
separability achieved by the Swin Transformer across the selected color spaces.
The model's performance was tested across all color schemes, with the RGB color
scheme yielding the highest accuracy for each dataset. As a result, RGB was
selected for domain generalization analysis and compared with other CNN-based
models, VGG-19 and ResNet-50. The comparative results demonstrate the proposed
model's effectiveness in detecting CGI, highlighting its robustness and
reliability in both intra-dataset and inter-dataset evaluations. The findings
of this study highlight the Swin Transformer model's potential as an advanced
tool for digital image forensics, particularly in distinguishing CGI from
natural images. The model's strong performance indicates its capability for
domain generalization, making it a valuable asset in scenarios requiring
precise and reliable image classification.

*Yan Zhao,Zhengxue Cheng,Junxuan Zhang,Qunshan Gu,Qi Wang,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: DualComp是一种轻量级、统一的学习型双模态无损压缩器，针对图像和文本设计，通过结构增强和参数共享实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型压缩器多为单模态设计，多模态数据需单独模型，缺乏灵活性且效率低。多模态大语言模型虽能统一压缩，但复杂度高难以实用。

Method: DualComp采用轻量级主干网络，结合模态统一标记化、模态切换上下文学习和模态路由专家混合三项结构增强，辅以重参数化训练策略。

Result: DualComp在桌面CPU上实现近实时推理（200KB/s），参数更少但压缩性能与SOTA LLM方法相当，单模态变体在Kodak数据集上超越之前最佳图像压缩器9%。

Conclusion: DualComp通过统一设计和轻量化结构，解决了多模态压缩的灵活性和效率问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Most learning-based lossless compressors are designed for a single modality,
requiring separate models for multi-modal data and lacking flexibility.
However, different modalities vary significantly in format and statistical
properties, making it ineffective to use compressors that lack
modality-specific adaptations. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
offer a potential solution for modality-unified compression, their excessive
complexity hinders practical deployment. To address these challenges, we focus
on the two most common modalities, image and text, and propose DualComp, the
first unified and lightweight learning-based dual-modality lossless compressor.
Built on a lightweight backbone, DualComp incorporates three key structural
enhancements to handle modality heterogeneity: modality-unified tokenization,
modality-switching contextual learning, and modality-routing
mixture-of-experts. A reparameterization training strategy is also used to
boost compression performance. DualComp integrates both modality-specific and
shared parameters for efficient parameter utilization, enabling near real-time
inference (200KB/s) on desktop CPUs. With much fewer parameters, DualComp
achieves compression performance on par with the SOTA LLM-based methods for
both text and image datasets. Its simplified single-modality variant surpasses
the previous best image compressor on the Kodak dataset by about 9% using just
1.2% of the model size.

*Sebastian Janampa,Marios Pattichis*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于变形线注意力（DLA）的快速Transformer方法LINEA，无需在大数据集上预训练注意力机制，显著提升了线检测的速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的线检测方法虽然准确，但推理速度慢且需要在大数据集上预训练注意力机制，限制了其在低延迟视频分析中的应用。

Method: 开发了新的变形线注意力（DLA）机制，无需预训练注意力机制，构建了LINEA模型。

Result: LINEA在速度上显著提升，并在分布外数据集测试中表现优于先前模型。

Conclusion: LINEA为线检测提供了一种高效且无需预训练的新方法，适用于低延迟场景。

Abstract: Line detection is a basic digital image processing operation used by
higher-level processing methods. Recently, transformer-based methods for line
detection have proven to be more accurate than methods based on CNNs, at the
expense of significantly lower inference speeds. As a result, video analysis
methods that require low latencies cannot benefit from current
transformer-based methods for line detection. In addition, current
transformer-based models require pretraining attention mechanisms on large
datasets (e.g., COCO or Object360). This paper develops a new transformer-based
method that is significantly faster without requiring pretraining the attention
mechanism on large datasets. We eliminate the need to pre-train the attention
mechanism using a new mechanism, Deformable Line Attention (DLA). We use the
term LINEA to refer to our new transformer-based method based on DLA. Extensive
experiments show that LINEA is significantly faster and outperforms previous
models on sAP in out-of-distribution dataset testing.

TLDR: DriveMoE是一个基于Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)架构的端到端自动驾驶框架，通过视觉和动作MoE模块处理复杂驾驶场景，实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端自动驾驶在处理多视角数据和复杂场景（如激进转弯）时的挑战，借鉴MoE架构在LLMs中的成功经验。

Method: 提出DriveMoE框架，包含Scene-Specialized Vision MoE和Skill-Specialized Action MoE，动态选择摄像头和激活专家模块。

Result: 在Bench2Drive闭环评估中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DriveMoE通过视觉和动作MoE的结合，有效提升了自动驾驶任务的性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) demands effective processing of
multi-view sensory data and robust handling of diverse and complex driving
scenarios, particularly rare maneuvers such as aggressive turns. Recent success
of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrates that specialization of parameters enables strong scalability. In
this work, we propose DriveMoE, a novel MoE-based E2E-AD framework, with a
Scene-Specialized Vision MoE and a Skill-Specialized Action MoE. DriveMoE is
built upon our $\pi_0$ Vision-Language-Action (VLA) baseline (originally from
the embodied AI field), called Drive-$\pi_0$. Specifically, we add Vision MoE
to Drive-$\pi_0$ by training a router to select relevant cameras according to
the driving context dynamically. This design mirrors human driving cognition,
where drivers selectively attend to crucial visual cues rather than
exhaustively processing all visual information. In addition, we add Action MoE
by training another router to activate specialized expert modules for different
driving behaviors. Through explicit behavioral specialization, DriveMoE is able
to handle diverse scenarios without suffering from modes averaging like
existing models. In Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation experiments, DriveMoE
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness
of combining vision and action MoE in autonomous driving tasks. We will release
our code and models of DriveMoE and Drive-$\pi_0$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型（LLM）作为交互式代理控制图形用户界面（GUI）面临长时程动作序列和多模态反馈的优化挑战，现有方法在GUI代理中的应用较少。

Method: 提出Agentic Replay Policy Optimization (ARPO)，结合Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和回放缓冲区，并引入任务选择策略以稳定训练。

Result: 在OSWorld基准测试中，ARPO表现优异，为基于LLM的GUI代理设定了新的性能基准。

Conclusion: 强化学习在训练多轮视觉语言GUI代理以处理复杂UI交互方面具有显著效果。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) as interactive agents for controlling
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents a unique challenge to optimize
long-horizon action sequences with multimodal feedback from complex
environments. While recent works have advanced multi-turn reinforcement
learning (RL) for reasoning and tool-using capabilities in LLMs, their
application to GUI-based agents remains relatively underexplored due to the
difficulty of sparse rewards, delayed feedback, and high rollout costs. In this
paper, we investigate end-to-end policy optimization for vision-language-based
GUI agents with the aim of improving performance on complex, long-horizon
computer tasks. We propose Agentic Replay Policy Optimization (ARPO), an
end-to-end RL approach that augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with a replay buffer to reuse the successful experience across training
iterations. To further stabilize the training process, we propose a task
selection strategy that filters tasks based on baseline agent performance,
allowing the agent to focus on learning from informative interactions.
Additionally, we compare ARPO with offline preference optimization approaches,
highlighting the advantages of policy-based methods in GUI environments.
Experiments on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that ARPO achieves competitive
results, establishing a new performance baseline for LLM-based GUI agents
trained via reinforcement learning. Our findings underscore the effectiveness
of reinforcement learning for training multi-turn, vision-language GUI agents
capable of managing complex real-world UI interactions. Codes and

TLDR: 提出了一种基于原型一致性的半监督医学图像分割方法EPCL-JUDA，通过联合不确定性量化和数据增强提升原型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因标记数据稀缺导致原型表达能力受限，无法充分表示类别嵌入。

Method: 结合Mean-Teacher框架，利用原始和增强标记数据生成原型，通过联合不确定性量化优化伪标签，并融合标记和未标记数据生成高质量全局原型。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: EPCL-JUDA通过增强原型表达和一致性学习，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Recently, prototype learning has emerged in semi-supervised medical image
segmentation and achieved remarkable performance. However, the scarcity of
labeled data limits the expressiveness of prototypes in previous methods,
potentially hindering the complete representation of prototypes for class
embedding. To overcome this issue, we propose an efficient prototype
consistency learning via joint uncertainty quantification and data augmentation
(EPCL-JUDA) to enhance the semantic expression of prototypes based on the
framework of Mean-Teacher. The concatenation of original and augmented labeled
data is fed into student network to generate expressive prototypes. Then, a
joint uncertainty quantification method is devised to optimize pseudo-labels
and generate reliable prototypes for original and augmented unlabeled data
separately. High-quality global prototypes for each class are formed by fusing
labeled and unlabeled prototypes, which are utilized to generate
prototype-to-features to conduct consistency learning. Notably, a prototype
network is proposed to reduce high memory requirements brought by the
introduction of augmented data. Extensive experiments on Left Atrium,
Pancreas-NIH, Type B Aortic Dissection datasets demonstrate EPCL-JUDA's
superiority over previous state-of-the-art approaches, confirming the
effectiveness of our framework. The code will be released soon.

TLDR: 提出了一种新的弱监督目标检测框架，通过自分类增强模块和自分类校正算法，解决了多类分类任务中的分类模糊问题，并在VOC数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督目标检测（WSOD）因标注成本低而备受关注，但现有方法在多类分类任务中存在分类模糊问题，未能充分利用其优势。

Method: 提出自分类增强模块（ICBC）以弥合多类分类任务间的差距，并在推理阶段引入自分类校正算法以减少误分类。

Result: 在VOC 2007和2012数据集上的实验表明，该框架性能优越。

Conclusion: 新框架通过ICBC和自分类校正算法有效提升了WSOD的性能，解决了分类模糊问题。

Abstract: In recent years, weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted much
attention due to its low labeling cost. The success of recent WSOD models is
often ascribed to the two-stage multi-class classification (MCC) task, i.e.,
multiple instance learning and online classification refinement. Despite
achieving non-trivial progresses, these methods overlook potential
classification ambiguities between these two MCC tasks and fail to leverage
their unique strengths. In this work, we introduce a novel WSOD framework to
ameliorate these two issues. For one thing, we propose a self-classification
enhancement module that integrates intra-class binary classification (ICBC) to
bridge the gap between the two distinct MCC tasks. The ICBC task enhances the
network's discrimination between positive and mis-located samples in a
class-wise manner and forges a mutually reinforcing relationship with the MCC
task. For another, we propose a self-classification correction algorithm during
inference, which combines the results of both MCC tasks to effectively reduce
the mis-classified predictions. Extensive experiments on the prevalent VOC 2007
& 2012 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework.

Conclusion: 为心脏疾病自动化诊断提供了高效可靠的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: To address the challenge of complex pathological feature extraction in
automated cardiac MRI segmentation, this study proposes an innovative
dual-encoder architecture named SAMba-UNet. The framework achieves cross-modal
feature collaborative learning by integrating the vision foundation model SAM2,
the state-space model Mamba, and the classical UNet. To mitigate domain
discrepancies between medical and natural images, a Dynamic Feature Fusion
Refiner is designed, which enhances small lesion feature extraction through
multi-scale pooling and a dual-path calibration mechanism across channel and
spatial dimensions. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Omni-Attention Convergence
Module (HOACM) is introduced, combining global contextual attention with
branch-selective emphasis mechanisms to effectively fuse SAM2's local
positional semantics and Mamba's long-range dependency modeling capabilities.
Experiments on the ACDC cardiac MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.9103 and an HD95 boundary error of 1.0859 mm,
significantly outperforming existing methods, particularly in boundary
localization for complex pathological structures such as right ventricular
anomalies. This work provides an efficient and reliable solution for automated
cardiac disease diagnosis, and the code will be open-sourced.

Recent architectures leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to
transform input images from one domain to another. In this work, we focus on
the study of both paired and unpaired image translation across multiple image
domains. For the paired task, we used a conditional GAN model, and for the
unpaired task, we trained it using cycle consistency loss. We experimented with
different types of loss functions, multiple Patch-GAN sizes, and model
architectures. New quantitative metrics - precision, recall, and FID score -
were used for analysis. In addition, a qualitative study of the results of
different experiments was conducted.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为TEA的新型对抗攻击方法，利用目标图像的边缘信息生成对抗样本，显著减少了查询次数，并在低查询设置下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对黑盒设置中目标攻击的挑战，现有方法主要依赖决策边界的几何特性，而忽略了图像本身的信息。

Method: 提出TEA方法，通过利用目标图像的边缘信息生成对抗样本，使其更接近源图像但仍能实现目标分类。

Result: 在低查询设置下，TEA比现有方法减少了近70%的查询次数，并在不同模型中表现更优。

Conclusion: TEA不仅高效生成对抗样本，还为几何攻击提供了更好的初始化，适用于实际应用中的黑盒场景。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for image classification remain vulnerable to
adversarial examples -- small, imperceptible perturbations that induce
misclassifications. In black-box settings, where only the final prediction is
accessible, crafting targeted attacks that aim to misclassify into a specific
target class is particularly challenging due to narrow decision regions.
Current state-of-the-art methods often exploit the geometric properties of the
decision boundary separating a source image and a target image rather than
incorporating information from the images themselves. In contrast, we propose
Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA), a novel attack that utilizes edge
information from the target image to carefully perturb it, thereby producing an
adversarial image that is closer to the source image while still achieving the
desired target classification. Our approach consistently outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods across different models in low query settings (nearly
70\% fewer queries are used), a scenario especially relevant in real-world
applications with limited queries and black-box access. Furthermore, by
efficiently generating a suitable adversarial example, TEA provides an improved
target initialization for established geometry-based attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器主要依赖视觉区分性，忽视了视频数据的时间一致性，导致跟踪效果受限。

Method: 设计了一个运动编码器（含三种位置编码）将长期运动轨迹编码到视觉嵌入空间，并通过融合解码器和自适应权重机制动态融合视觉与运动特征。

Result: 在七个挑战性跟踪基准测试中，该方法显著提升了基于视觉的跟踪器的鲁棒性，且训练成本低、速度损失小。

Conclusion: 提出的运动模块能有效增强现有跟踪器的性能，具有高效和易集成的特点。

Abstract: Due to the challenges of processing temporal information, most trackers
depend solely on visual discriminability and overlook the unique temporal
coherence of video data. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and
plug-and-play motion prompt tracking method. It can be easily integrated into
existing vision-based trackers to build a joint tracking framework leveraging
both motion and vision cues, thereby achieving robust tracking through
efficient prompt learning. A motion encoder with three different positional
encodings is proposed to encode the long-term motion trajectory into the visual
embedding space, while a fusion decoder and an adaptive weight mechanism are
designed to dynamically fuse visual and motion features. We integrate our
motion module into three different trackers with five models in total.
Experiments on seven challenging tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed motion module significantly improves the robustness of vision-based
trackers, with minimal training costs and negligible speed sacrifice. Code is
available at https://github.com/zj5559/Motion-Prompt-Tracking.

Motivation: 自回归（AR）图像生成器缺乏修正先前预测的机制，限制了生成质量。

Result: 在LlamaGEN、Open-MAGVIT2和RAR上的实验表明，TensorAR显著提升了自回归模型的生成性能。

Conclusion: TensorAR作为一种即插即用模块，有效改进了自回归模型的生成能力。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generators offer a language-model-friendly approach
to image generation by predicting discrete image tokens in a causal sequence.
However, unlike diffusion models, AR models lack a mechanism to refine previous
predictions, limiting their generation quality. In this paper, we introduce
TensorAR, a new AR paradigm that reformulates image generation from next-token
prediction to next-tensor prediction. By generating overlapping windows of
image patches (tensors) in a sliding fashion, TensorAR enables iterative
refinement of previously generated content. To prevent information leakage
during training, we propose a discrete tensor noising scheme, which perturbs
input tokens via codebook-indexed noise. TensorAR is implemented as a
plug-and-play module compatible with existing AR models. Extensive experiments
on LlamaGEN, Open-MAGVIT2, and RAR demonstrate that TensorAR significantly
improves the generation performance of autoregressive models.

Abstract: This work introduces panoptic captioning, a novel task striving to seek the
minimum text equivalence of images. We take the first step towards panoptic
captioning by formulating it as a task of generating a comprehensive textual
description for an image, which encapsulates all entities, their respective
locations and attributes, relationships among entities, as well as global image
state.Through an extensive evaluation, our work reveals that state-of-the-art
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have limited performance in solving
panoptic captioning. To address this, we propose an effective data engine named
PancapEngine to produce high-quality data and a novel method named PancapChain
to improve panoptic captioning. Specifically, our PancapEngine first detects
diverse categories of entities in images by an elaborate detection suite, and
then generates required panoptic captions using entity-aware prompts.
Additionally, our PancapChain explicitly decouples the challenging panoptic
captioning task into multiple stages and generates panoptic captions step by
step. More importantly, we contribute a comprehensive metric named PancapScore
and a human-curated test set for reliable model evaluation.Experiments show
that our PancapChain-13B model can beat state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs like
InternVL-2.5-78B and even surpass proprietary models like GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.0-Pro, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data engine and method.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: FPQVAR是一种高效的浮点量化框架，用于优化视觉自回归模型（VAR），通过算法和硬件协同设计显著降低内存和计算成本，同时提升图像生成质量和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型在图像生成中表现出色，但参数规模和计算成本高，难以在边缘设备上部署。FPQVAR旨在通过量化技术解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Dual Format Quantization处理输入激活的不平衡性，Group-wise Hadamard Transformation和GHT-Aware Learnable Transformation应对时变异常通道，并设计低比特FP量化器和乘法器。

Result: 在4位量化下，FID从10.83降至3.58，IS从175.9提升至241.5；6位量化性能接近FP16模型。FPGA加速器吞吐量达1.1 image/s，能效显著提升。

Conclusion: FPQVAR通过算法和硬件优化，显著提升了VAR模型的效率和性能，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling has marked a paradigm shift in image
generation from next-token prediction to next-scale prediction. VAR predicts a
set of tokens at each step from coarse to fine scale, leading to better image
quality and faster inference speed compared to existing diffusion models.
However, the large parameter size and computation cost hinder its deployment on
edge devices. To reduce the memory and computation cost, we propose FPQVAR, an
efficient post-training floating-point (FP) quantization framework for VAR
featuring algorithm and hardware co-design. At the algorithm level, we first
identify the challenges of quantizing VAR. To address them, we propose Dual
Format Quantization for the highly imbalanced input activation. We further
propose Group-wise Hadamard Transformation and GHT-Aware Learnable
Transformation to address the time-varying outlier channels. At the hardware
level, we design the first low-bit FP quantizer and multiplier with lookup
tables on FPGA and propose the first FPGA-based VAR accelerator featuring
low-bit FP computation and an elaborate two-level pipeline. Extensive
experiments show that compared to the state-of-the-art quantization method, our
proposed FPQVAR significantly improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from
10.83 to 3.58, Inception Score (IS) from 175.9 to 241.5 under 4-bit
quantization. FPQVAR also significantly improves the performance of 6-bit
quantized VAR, bringing it on par with the FP16 model. Our accelerator on
AMD-Xilinx VCK190 FPGA achieves a throughput of 1.1 image/s, which is 3.1x
higher than the integer-based accelerator. It also demonstrates 3.6x and 2.8x
higher energy efficiency compared to the integer-based accelerator and GPU
baseline, respectively.

Abstract: Accurate classification of skin lesions from dermatoscopic images is
essential for diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer. In this study, we
investigate the utility of a dermatology-specific foundation model, PanDerm, in
comparison with two Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures (ViT base and Swin
Transformer V2 base) for the task of skin lesion classification. Using frozen
features extracted from PanDerm, we apply non-linear probing with three
different classifiers, namely, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), XGBoost, and
TabNet. For the ViT-based models, we perform full fine-tuning to optimize
classification performance. Our experiments on the HAM10000 and MSKCC datasets
demonstrate that the PanDerm-based MLP model performs comparably to the
fine-tuned Swin transformer model, while fusion of PanDerm and Swin Transformer
predictions leads to further performance improvements. Future work will explore
additional foundation models, fine-tuning strategies, and advanced fusion
techniques.

Method: 提出CACTI和CACTIF技术，通过类自适应实例归一化和选择性注意力过滤实现语义一致的风格迁移。

Result: 在GTA5到Cityscapes/ACDC的实验中，生成图像质量更高（FID分数更低），内容保留更好。

Conclusion: 类感知的扩散风格迁移能有效缩小合成到真实的域差距，提升鲁棒感知系统性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic data often perform poorly
on real-world images due to domain gaps, particularly in adverse conditions
where labeled data is scarce. Yet, recent foundation models enable to generate
realistic images without any training. This paper proposes to leverage such
diffusion models to improve the performance of vision models when learned on
synthetic data. We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent
style transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance
Normalization and Cross-Attention (CACTI) and its extension with selective
attention Filtering (CACTIF). CACTI applies statistical normalization
selectively based on semantic classes, while CACTIF further filters
cross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in
regions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style
characteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence,
unlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without
constraints. Experiments using GTA5 as source and Cityscapes/ACDC as target
domains show that our approach produces higher quality images with lower FID
scores and better content preservation. Our work demonstrates that class-aware
diffusion-based style transfer effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain
gap even with minimal target domain data, advancing robust perception systems
for challenging real-world applications. The source code is available at:

Motivation: 微表情因其短暂性和局部性难以准确识别，现有方法准确率仅50%，亟需新方法提升性能。

Method: 提出TSFmicro框架，结合RetNet和Transformer网络，并行融合时空特征，增强语义信息。

Result: 在三个知名微表情数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSFmicro通过高效时空特征融合，显著提升了微表情识别性能。

Abstract: When emotions are repressed, an individual's true feelings may be revealed
through micro-expressions. Consequently, micro-expressions are regarded as a
genuine source of insight into an individual's authentic emotions. However, the
transient and highly localised nature of micro-expressions poses a significant
challenge to their accurate recognition, with the accuracy rate of
micro-expression recognition being as low as 50%, even for professionals. In
order to address these challenges, it is necessary to explore the field of
dynamic micro expression recognition (DMER) using multimodal fusion techniques,
with special attention to the diverse fusion of temporal and spatial modal
features. In this paper, we propose a novel Temporal and Spatial feature Fusion
framework for DMER (TSFmicro). This framework integrates a Retention Network
(RetNet) and a transformer-based DMER network, with the objective of efficient
micro-expression recognition through the capture and fusion of temporal and
spatial relations. Meanwhile, we propose a novel parallel time-space fusion
method from the perspective of modal fusion, which fuses spatio-temporal
information in high-dimensional feature space, resulting in complementary
"where-how" relationships at the semantic level and providing richer semantic
information for the model. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance of the TSFmicro method in comparison to other contemporary
state-of-the-art methods. This is evidenced by its effectiveness on three
well-recognised micro-expression datasets.

Result: 在基准数据集上，DeCafNet减少47%计算量，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeCafNet在效率和性能上均达到新水平，为长视频时间定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long Video Temporal Grounding (LVTG) aims at identifying specific moments
within lengthy videos based on user-provided text queries for effective content
retrieval. The approach taken by existing methods of dividing video into clips
and processing each clip via a full-scale expert encoder is challenging to
scale due to prohibitive computational costs of processing a large number of
clips in long videos. To address this issue, we introduce DeCafNet, an approach
employing ``delegate-and-conquer'' strategy to achieve computation efficiency
without sacrificing grounding performance. DeCafNet introduces a sidekick
encoder that performs dense feature extraction over all video clips in a
resource-efficient manner, while generating a saliency map to identify the most
relevant clips for full processing by the expert encoder. To effectively
leverage features from sidekick and expert encoders that exist at different
temporal resolutions, we introduce DeCaf-Grounder, which unifies and refines
them via query-aware temporal aggregation and multi-scale temporal refinement
for accurate grounding. Experiments on two LTVG benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DeCafNet reduces computation by up to 47\% while still outperforming
existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art for LTVG in terms of both
efficiency and performance. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视线估计方法仅预测视线方向或屏幕注视点，无法提供3D空间中全面的6自由度分析，且个体差异影响泛化能力。

Method: 提出MAGE架构，结合多任务学习和高效校准模块（Easy-Calibration），从面部图像编码方向与位置特征，并通过多解码器预测结果。

Result: 在MPIIFaceGaze、EYEDIAP和IMRGaze数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MAGE方法有效解决了6自由度视线估计问题，并提升了泛化能力，适用于真实人机交互场景。

Abstract: Eye gaze can provide rich information on human psychological activities, and
has garnered significant attention in the field of Human-Robot Interaction
(HRI). However, existing gaze estimation methods merely predict either the gaze
direction or the Point-of-Gaze (PoG) on the screen, failing to provide
sufficient information for a comprehensive six Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) gaze
analysis in 3D space. Moreover, the variations of eye shape and structure among
individuals also impede the generalization capability of these methods. In this
study, we propose MAGE, a Multi-task Architecture for Gaze Estimation with an
efficient calibration module, to predict the 6-DoF gaze information that is
applicable for the real-word HRI. Our basic model encodes both the directional
and positional features from facial images, and predicts gaze results with
dedicated information flow and multiple decoders. To reduce the impact of
individual variations, we propose a novel calibration module, namely
Easy-Calibration, to fine-tune the basic model with subject-specific data,
which is efficient to implement without the need of a screen. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the public MPIIFaceGaze, EYEDIAP, and our built IMRGaze datasets.

Conclusion: Sketchy-3DIS框架在粗略边界框监督下表现出色，为弱监督3D实例分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Bounding box supervision has gained considerable attention in weakly
supervised 3D instance segmentation. While this approach alleviates the need
for extensive point-level annotations, obtaining accurate bounding boxes in
practical applications remains challenging. To this end, we explore the
inaccurate bounding box, named sketchy bounding box, which is imitated through
perturbing ground truth bounding box by adding scaling, translation, and
rotation. In this paper, we propose Sketchy-3DIS, a novel weakly 3D instance
segmentation framework, which jointly learns pseudo labeler and segmentator to
improve the performance under the sketchy bounding-box supervisions.
Specifically, we first propose an adaptive box-to-point pseudo labeler that
adaptively learns to assign points located in the overlapped parts between two
sketchy bounding boxes to the correct instance, resulting in compact and pure
pseudo instance labels. Then, we present a coarse-to-fine instance segmentator
that first predicts coarse instances from the entire point cloud and then
learns fine instances based on the region of coarse instances. Finally, by
using the pseudo instance labels to supervise the instance segmentator, we can
gradually generate high-quality instances through joint training. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
the ScanNetV2 and S3DIS benchmarks, and even outperforms several fully
supervised methods using sketchy bounding boxes. Code is available at

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are typical complex intelligent systems with artificial
intelligence at their core. However, perception methods based on deep learning
are extremely vulnerable to adversarial samples, resulting in safety accidents.
How to generate effective adversarial examples in the physical world and
evaluate object detection systems is a huge challenge. In this study, we
propose a unified joint adversarial training framework for both 2D and 3D
samples to address the challenges of intra-class diversity and environmental
variations in real-world scenarios. Building upon this framework, we introduce
an adversarial sample reality enhancement approach that incorporates non-rigid
surface modeling and a realistic 3D matching mechanism. We compare with 5
advanced adversarial patches and evaluate their attack performance on 8 object
detecotrs, including single-stage, two-stage, and transformer-based models.
Extensive experiment results in digital and physical environments demonstrate
that the adversarial textures generated by our method can effectively mislead
the target detection model. Moreover, proposed method demonstrates excellent
robustness and transferability under multi-angle attacks, varying lighting
conditions, and different distance in the physical world. The demo video and

Conclusion: SPIN是一种高效且无需额外开销的减少幻觉的方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable progress in multimodal understanding tasks, large
vision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from "hallucinations", generating
texts misaligned with the visual context. Existing methods aimed at reducing
hallucinations through inference time intervention incur a significant increase
in latency. To mitigate this, we present SPIN, a task-agnostic attention-guided
head suppression strategy that can be seamlessly integrated during inference,
without incurring any significant compute or latency overhead. We investigate
whether hallucination in LVLMs can be linked to specific model components. Our
analysis suggests that hallucinations can be attributed to a dynamic subset of
attention heads in each layer. Leveraging this insight, for each text query
token, we selectively suppress attention heads that exhibit low attention to
image tokens, keeping the top-K attention heads intact. Extensive evaluations
on visual question answering and image description tasks demonstrate the
efficacy of SPIN in reducing hallucination scores up to 2.7x while maintaining
F1, and improving throughput by 1.8x compared to existing alternatives. Code is

Abstract: Pose-invariant face recognition has become a challenging problem for modern
AI-based face recognition systems. It aims at matching a profile face captured
in the wild with a frontal face registered in a database. Existing methods
perform face frontalization via either generative models or learning a pose
robust feature representation. In this paper, a new method is presented to
perform face frontalization and recognition within the feature space. First, a
novel feature space pose frontalization module (FSPFM) is proposed to transform
profile images with arbitrary angles into frontal counterparts. Second, a new
training paradigm is proposed to maximize the potential of FSPFM and boost its
performance. The latter consists of a pre-training and an attention-guided
fine-tuning stage. Moreover, extensive experiments have been conducted on five
popular face recognition benchmarks. Results show that not only our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art in the pose-invariant face recognition task
but also maintains superior performance in other standard scenarios.

TLDR: 论文提出Circle-RoPE，一种新的位置编码方案，用于减少视觉语言模型中跨模态位置偏差，同时保留图像空间信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE在视觉语言模型中引入跨模态位置偏差，导致虚假对齐，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Per-Token Distance（PTD）度量位置编码独立性，并设计Circle-RoPE方案，将图像标记映射到与文本标记正交的圆形轨迹上。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效减少位置偏差并保留图像空间信息。

Conclusion: Circle-RoPE为视觉语言模型提供了更鲁棒和灵活的位置编码框架。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is a widely adopted technique for encoding
relative positional information in large language models (LLMs). However, when
extended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), its variants introduce
unintended cross-modal positional biases. Specifically, they enforce relative
positional dependencies between text token indices and image tokens, causing
spurious alignments. This issue arises because image tokens representing the
same content but located at different spatial positions are assigned distinct
positional biases, leading to inconsistent cross-modal associations. To address
this, we propose Per-Token Distance (PTD) - a simple yet effective metric for
quantifying the independence of positional encodings across modalities.
Informed by this analysis, we introduce Circle-RoPE, a novel encoding scheme
that maps image token indices onto a circular trajectory orthogonal to the
linear path of text token indices, forming a cone-like structure. This
configuration ensures that each text token maintains an equal distance to all
image tokens, reducing artificial cross-modal biases while preserving
intra-image spatial information. To further enhance performance, we propose a
staggered layer strategy that applies different RoPE variants across layers.
This design leverages the complementary strengths of each RoPE variant, thereby
enhancing the model's overall performance. Our experimental results demonstrate
that our method effectively preserves spatial information from images while
reducing relative positional bias, offering a more robust and flexible
positional encoding framework for LVLMs. The code is available at

Conclusion: 语言信息对获取精确对象表征起关键作用，自监督学习在捕捉粗粒度类别结构上具有潜力。

Abstract: The learning mechanisms by which humans acquire internal representations of
objects are not fully understood. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a
useful tool for investigating this question, as they have internal
representations similar to those of humans as a byproduct of optimizing their
objective functions. While previous studies have shown that models trained with
various learning paradigms - such as supervised, self-supervised, and CLIP -
acquire human-like representations, it remains unclear whether their similarity
to human representations is primarily at a coarse category level or extends to
finer details. Here, we employ an unsupervised alignment method based on
Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport to compare human and model object
representations at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. The unique
feature of this method compared to conventional representational similarity
analysis is that it estimates optimal fine-grained mappings between the
representation of each object in human and model representations. We used this
unsupervised alignment method to assess the extent to which the representation
of each object in humans is correctly mapped to the corresponding
representation of the same object in models. Using human similarity judgments
of 1,854 objects from the THINGS dataset, we find that models trained with CLIP
consistently achieve strong fine- and coarse-grained matching with human object
representations. In contrast, self-supervised models showed limited matching at
both fine- and coarse-grained levels, but still formed object clusters that
reflected human coarse category structure. Our results offer new insights into
the role of linguistic information in acquiring precise object representations
and the potential of self-supervised learning to capture coarse categorical
structures.

Conclusion: FPWC通过全局理解和前瞻性规划，显著优化了移动设备的自动控制性能。

Abstract: The automatic control of mobile devices is essential for efficiently
performing complex tasks that involve multiple sequential steps. However, these
tasks pose significant challenges due to the limited environmental information
available at each step, primarily through visual observations. As a result,
current approaches, which typically rely on reactive policies, focus solely on
immediate observations and often lead to suboptimal decision-making. To address
this problem, we propose \textbf{Foresighted Planning with World Model-Driven
Code Execution (FPWC)},a framework that prioritizes natural language
understanding and structured reasoning to enhance the agent's global
understanding of the environment by developing a task-oriented, refinable
\emph{world model} at the outset of the task. Foresighted actions are
subsequently generated through iterative planning within this world model,
executed in the form of executable code. Extensive experiments conducted in
simulated environments and on real mobile devices demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous approaches, particularly achieving a 44.4\% relative
improvement in task success rate compared to the state-of-the-art in the
simulated environment. Code and demo are provided in the supplementary

Conclusion: JFFRA通过协同优化光流和特征修复，显著提升了视频修复的效果和时间一致性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video restoration have focused on recovering
high-quality video frames from low-quality inputs. Compared with static images,
the performance of video restoration significantly depends on efficient
exploitation of temporal correlations among successive video frames. The
numerous techniques make use of temporal information via flow-based strategies
or recurrent architectures. However, these methods often encounter difficulties
in preserving temporal consistency as they utilize degraded input video frames.
To resolve this issue, we propose a novel video restoration framework named
Joint Flow and Feature Refinement using Attention (JFFRA). The proposed JFFRA
is based on key philosophy of iteratively enhancing data through the
synergistic collaboration of flow (alignment) and restoration. By leveraging
previously enhanced features to refine flow and vice versa, JFFRA enables
efficient feature enhancement using temporal information. This interplay
between flow and restoration is executed at multiple scales, reducing the
dependence on precise flow estimation. Moreover, we incorporate an
occlusion-aware temporal loss function to enhance the network's capability in
eliminating flickering artifacts. Comprehensive experiments validate the
versatility of JFFRA across various restoration tasks such as denoising,
deblurring, and super-resolution. Our method demonstrates a remarkable
performance improvement of up to 1.62 dB compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种排名熵最小化方法，用于解决测试时适应中的模型崩溃问题，并扩展其到连续场景的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 熵最小化方法在测试时适应中效率高且适应性强，但在连续测试时适应中稳定性不足，容易导致模型崩溃。

Method: 通过渐进掩码策略结构化预测难度，逐步对齐模型在不同预测难度下的概率分布，同时保持熵的排名顺序。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 排名熵最小化方法显著提升了连续测试时适应的稳定性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to adapt to realistic environments in an online
manner by learning during test time. Entropy minimization has emerged as a
principal strategy for test-time adaptation due to its efficiency and
adaptability. Nevertheless, it remains underexplored in continual test-time
adaptation, where stability is more important. We observe that the entropy
minimization method often suffers from model collapse, where the model
converges to predicting a single class for all images due to a trivial
solution. We propose ranked entropy minimization to mitigate the stability
problem of the entropy minimization method and extend its applicability to
continuous scenarios. Our approach explicitly structures the prediction
difficulty through a progressive masking strategy. Specifically, it gradually
aligns the model's probability distributions across different levels of
prediction difficulty while preserving the rank order of entropy. The proposed
method is extensively evaluated across various benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness through empirical results. Our code is available at

TLDR: 提出了一种名为MAFE R-CNN的方法，通过多线索样本选择和类别感知特征增强机制，解决了小目标检测中的特征学习和样本选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小目标检测在复杂环境中存在困难，主要由于检测器难以学习小目标的判别性特征，以及训练中高质量小目标样本的选择问题。

Method: MAFE R-CNN包含多线索样本选择（MCSS）策略和类别感知特征增强机制（CFEM），分别优化样本选择和特征表示。

Result: 在大规模小目标数据集SODA上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MAFE R-CNN通过改进样本选择和特征增强，显著提升了小目标检测性能。

Abstract: Small object detection in intricate environments has consistently represented
a major challenge in the field of object detection. In this paper, we identify
that this difficulty stems from the detectors' inability to effectively learn
discriminative features for objects of small size, compounded by the complexity
of selecting high-quality small object samples during training, which motivates
the proposal of the Multi-Clue Assignment and Feature Enhancement
R-CNN.Specifically, MAFE R-CNN integrates two pivotal components.The first is
the Multi-Clue Sample Selection (MCSS) strategy, in which the Intersection over
Union (IoU) distance, predicted category confidence, and ground truth region
sizes are leveraged as informative clues in the sample selection process. This
methodology facilitates the selection of diverse positive samples and ensures a
balanced distribution of object sizes during training, thereby promoting
effective model learning.The second is the Category-aware Feature Enhancement
Mechanism (CFEM), where we propose a simple yet effective category-aware memory
module to explore the relationships among object features. Subsequently, we
enhance the object feature representation by facilitating the interaction
between category-aware features and candidate box features.Comprehensive
experiments conducted on the large-scale small object dataset SODA validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 左心室射血分数（LVEF）作为心脏功能评估指标存在局限性，如观察者间变异性和负荷依赖性。心肌应变可作为补充指标，但现有方法通常分开处理配准和分割任务，限制了心脏功能的全面评估。

Method: 提出了一种解剖学引导的深度分组配准网络（Deep GW），联合估计分组配准和分割，用于心脏cine-MRI图像分析。

Result: 在大规模数据集（374名受试者）上验证，与传统的elastix配准和两种基于深度学习的方法相比，性能提升且计算时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 该模型为心脏功能评估提供了一种高效且全面的解决方案，结合了LVEF和心肌应变的优势。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient quantification of cardiac function is essential for
the estimation of prognosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). One of the most
commonly used metrics for evaluating cardiac pumping performance is left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, LVEF can be affected by factors
such as inter-observer variability and varying pre-load and after-load
conditions, which can reduce its reproducibility. Additionally, cardiac
dysfunction may not always manifest as alterations in LVEF, such as in heart
failure and cardiotoxicity diseases. An alternative measure that can provide a
relatively load-independent quantitative assessment of myocardial contractility
is myocardial strain and strain rate. By using LVEF in combination with
myocardial strain, it is possible to obtain a thorough description of cardiac
function. Automated estimation of LVEF and other volumetric measures from
cine-MRI sequences can be achieved through segmentation models, while strain
calculation requires the estimation of tissue displacement between sequential
frames, which can be accomplished using registration models. These tasks are
often performed separately, potentially limiting the assessment of cardiac
function. To address this issue, in this study we propose an end-to-end deep
learning (DL) model that jointly estimates groupwise (GW) registration and
segmentation for cardiac cine-MRI images. The proposed anatomically-guided Deep
GW network was trained and validated on a large dataset of 4-chamber view
cine-MRI image series of 374 subjects. A quantitative comparison with
conventional GW registration using elastix and two DL-based methods showed that
the proposed model improved performance and substantially reduced computation
time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态生成方法注重视觉真实但忽略物理合理性，且依赖大规模标注数据或微调，计算和数据负担重。

Method: 结合图像到视频扩散模型和LLM迭代推理，通过置信度驱动的反馈循环优化物理运动，并引入可微分MPM模拟器。

Result: MAGIC在推理准确性和时间一致性上优于现有物理感知生成方法和视频扩散模型。

Conclusion: MAGIC无需训练或监督，填补了视觉与物理间的鸿沟，生成物理合理且模拟就绪的动态内容。

Abstract: Recent advances in static 3D generation have intensified the demand for
physically consistent dynamic 3D content. However, existing video generation
models, including diffusion-based methods, often prioritize visual realism
while neglecting physical plausibility, resulting in implausible object
dynamics. Prior approaches for physics-aware dynamic generation typically rely
on large-scale annotated datasets or extensive model fine-tuning, which imposes
significant computational and data collection burdens and limits scalability
across scenarios. To address these challenges, we present MAGIC, a
training-free framework for single-image physical property inference and
dynamic generation, integrating pretrained image-to-video diffusion models with
iterative LLM-based reasoning. Our framework generates motion-rich videos from
a static image and closes the visual-to-physical gap through a
confidence-driven LLM feedback loop that adaptively steers the diffusion model
toward physics-relevant motion. To translate visual dynamics into controllable
physical behavior, we further introduce a differentiable MPM simulator
operating directly on 3D Gaussians reconstructed from the single image,
enabling physically grounded, simulation-ready outputs without any supervision
or model tuning. Experiments show that MAGIC outperforms existing physics-aware
generative methods in inference accuracy and achieves greater temporal
coherence than state-of-the-art video diffusion models.

Motivation: 传统ViT因全局自注意力计算复杂度高且部分令牌对下游任务无益，需改进效率与性能。

Method: 提出AnchorFormer，利用锚点令牌学习关键信息，通过二分注意力降低复杂度，并用神经网络层可微分学习锚点分布。

Result: 在分类、检测和分割任务中表现优异，如ImageNet分类准确率提升9.0%，FLOPs减少46.7%，COCO检测mAP提升81.3%。

Conclusion: AnchorFormer通过高效注意力机制显著提升ViT性能，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance on
vision tasks by measuring the global self-attention among the image patches.
Given $n$ patches, they will have quadratic complexity such as
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and the time cost is high when splitting the input image
with a small granularity. Meanwhile, the pivotal information is often randomly
gathered in a few regions of an input image, some tokens may not be helpful for
the downstream tasks. To handle this problem, we introduce an anchor-based
efficient vision transformer (AnchorFormer), which employs the anchor tokens to
learn the pivotal information and accelerate the inference. Firstly, by
estimating the bipartite attention between the anchors and tokens, the
complexity will be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$, where
$m$ is an anchor number and $m < n$. Notably, by representing the anchors with
the neurons in a neural layer, we can differentiable learn these distributions
and approximate global self-attention through the Markov process. Moreover, we
extend the proposed model to three downstream tasks including classification,
detection, and segmentation. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of
our AnchorFormer, e.g., achieving up to a 9.0% higher accuracy or 46.7% FLOPs
reduction on ImageNet classification, 81.3% higher mAP on COCO detection under
comparable FLOPs, as compared to the current baselines.

Result: 在机器人视频预测和时空预测任务中，ForeDiff显著提升了预测准确性和样本一致性。

Conclusion: ForeDiff为扩散模型在世界建模中的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based models have enabled significant progress in
generation tasks across various modalities and have recently found applications
in world modeling. However, unlike typical generation tasks that encourage
sample diversity, world models entail different sources of uncertainty and
require consistent samples aligned with the ground-truth trajectory, which is a
limitation we empirically observe in diffusion models. We argue that a key
bottleneck in learning consistent diffusion-based world models lies in the
suboptimal predictive ability, which we attribute to the entanglement of
condition understanding and target denoising within shared architectures and
co-training schemes. To address this, we propose Foresight Diffusion
(ForeDiff), a diffusion-based world modeling framework that enhances
consistency by decoupling condition understanding from target denoising.
ForeDiff incorporates a separate deterministic predictive stream to process
conditioning inputs independently of the denoising stream, and further
leverages a pretrained predictor to extract informative representations that
guide generation. Extensive experiments on robot video prediction and
scientific spatiotemporal forecasting show that ForeDiff improves both
predictive accuracy and sample consistency over strong baselines, offering a
promising direction for diffusion-based world models.

Result: ClearNight在合成和真实图像上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: AllWeatherNight数据集和ClearNight框架的有效性通过实验验证，为夜间多天气图像恢复提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Restoring nighttime images affected by multiple adverse weather conditions is
a practical yet under-explored research problem, as multiple weather conditions
often coexist in the real world alongside various lighting effects at night.
This paper first explores the challenging multi-weather nighttime image
restoration task, where various types of weather degradations are intertwined
with flare effects. To support the research, we contribute the AllWeatherNight
dataset, featuring large-scale high-quality nighttime images with diverse
compositional degradations, synthesized using our introduced illumination-aware
degradation generation. Moreover, we present ClearNight, a unified nighttime
image restoration framework, which effectively removes complex degradations in
one go. Specifically, ClearNight extracts Retinex-based dual priors and
explicitly guides the network to focus on uneven illumination regions and
intrinsic texture contents respectively, thereby enhancing restoration
effectiveness in nighttime scenarios. In order to better represent the common
and unique characters of multiple weather degradations, we introduce a
weather-aware dynamic specific-commonality collaboration method, which
identifies weather degradations and adaptively selects optimal candidate units
associated with specific weather types. Our ClearNight achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world images.
Comprehensive ablation experiments validate the necessity of AllWeatherNight
dataset as well as the effectiveness of ClearNight. Project page:

Conclusion: InspectionV3通过自动化分级和数据分析，显著提升了烟草加工的效率和决策能力。

Abstract: The problems that tobacco workshops encounter include poor curing,
inconsistencies in supplies, irregular scheduling, and a lack of oversight, all
of which drive up expenses and worse quality. Large quantities make manual
examination costly, sluggish, and unreliable. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently made strides in capabilities that transcend those of
conventional methods. To effectively enhance them, nevertheless, extensive
customization is needed to account for subtle variations in tobacco grade. This
study introduces InspectionV3, an integrated solution for automated flue-cured
tobacco grading that makes use of a customized deep convolutional neural
network architecture. A scope that covers color, maturity, and curing
subtleties is established via a labelled dataset consisting of 21,113 images
spanning 20 quality classes. Expert annotators performed preprocessing on the
tobacco leaf images, including cleaning, labelling, and augmentation.
Multi-layer CNN factors use batch normalization to describe domain properties
like as permeability and moisture spots, and so account for the subtleties of
the workshop. Its expertise lies in converting visual patterns into useful
information for enhancing workflow. Fast notifications are made possible by
real-time, on-the-spot grading that matches human expertise. Images-powered
analytics dashboards facilitate the tracking of yield projections, inventories,
bottlenecks, and the optimization of data-driven choices. More labelled images
are assimilated after further retraining, improving representational capacities
and enabling adaptations for seasonal variability. Metrics demonstrate 97%
accuracy, 95% precision and recall, 96% F1-score and AUC, 95% specificity;
validating real-world viability.

is designed, along with a length regularization term and a differentiable token
chunking strategy. We further build ALToLLM that seamlessly integrates ALTo

Conclusion: DigiShield通过细粒度分析合成视频中面部特征的时序演化，有效识别隐蔽伪影，为深度伪造检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of deepfake technology has given rise
to an emerging and serious threat to public security: diffusion model-based
digital human generation. Unlike traditional face manipulation methods, such
models can generate highly realistic videos with consistency through multimodal
control signals. Their flexibility and covertness pose severe challenges to
existing detection strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DigiFakeAV, the
first large-scale multimodal digital human forgery dataset based on diffusion
models. Employing five latest digital human generation methods (Sonic, Hallo,
etc.) and voice cloning method, we systematically produce a dataset comprising
60,000 videos (8.4 million frames), covering multiple nationalities, skin
tones, genders, and real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing data
diversity and realism. User studies show that the confusion rate between forged
and real videos reaches 68%, and existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection
models exhibit large drops in AUC values on DigiFakeAV, highlighting the
challenge of the dataset. To address this problem, we further propose
DigiShield, a detection baseline based on spatiotemporal and cross-modal
fusion. By jointly modeling the 3D spatiotemporal features of videos and the
semantic-acoustic features of audio, DigiShield achieves SOTA performance on
both the DigiFakeAV and DF-TIMIT datasets. Experiments show that this method
effectively identifies covert artifacts through fine-grained analysis of the
temporal evolution of facial features in synthetic videos.

TLDR: 本文探讨了光学识别技术在塑料自动分拣中的局限性，指出其依赖颜色和形状等物理特性，导致在真实场景中效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 塑料回收率低（仅8%），主要因污染、经济激励不足和技术难题。自动分拣是关键，但现有光学识别技术在实际应用中效果不佳。

Method: 通过20,000多张图像数据集，结合公共和自定义机器学习流程，评估光学识别能力，使用Grad-CAM、显著性图和混淆矩阵分析模型行为。

Result: 光学识别方法在真实MRF环境中对塑料分拣的准确性有限，因其依赖颜色和形状等物理特性。

Conclusion: 光学识别技术需进一步改进以应对真实场景中的挑战，提升塑料回收效率。

Abstract: According to the EPA, only 25% of waste is recycled, and just 60% of U.S.
municipalities offer curbside recycling. Plastics fare worse, with a recycling
rate of only 8%; an additional 16% is incinerated, while the remaining 76% ends
up in landfills. The low plastic recycling rate stems from contamination, poor
economic incentives, and technical difficulties, making efficient recycling a
challenge. To improve recovery, automated sorting plays a critical role.
Companies like AMP Robotics and Greyparrot utilize optical systems for sorting,
while Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs) employ Near-Infrared (NIR) sensors
to detect plastic types.
  Modern optical sorting uses advances in computer vision such as object
recognition and instance segmentation, powered by machine learning. Two-stage
detectors like Mask R-CNN use region proposals and classification with deep
backbones like ResNet. Single-stage detectors like YOLO handle detection in one
pass, trading some accuracy for speed. While such methods excel under ideal
conditions with a large volume of labeled training data, challenges arise in
realistic scenarios, emphasizing the need to further examine the efficacy of
optic detection for automated sorting.
  In this study, we compiled novel datasets totaling 20,000+ images from varied
sources. Using both public and custom machine learning pipelines, we assessed
the capabilities and limitations of optical recognition for sorting. Grad-CAM,
saliency maps, and confusion matrices were employed to interpret model
behavior. We perform this analysis on our custom trained models from the
compiled datasets. To conclude, our findings are that optic recognition methods
have limited success in accurate sorting of real-world plastics at MRFs,
primarily because they rely on physical properties such as color and shape.

Conclusion: CodeMerge是一种高效且可扩展的模型合并方法，显著提升了3D感知任务的性能。

Abstract: Maintaining robust 3D perception under dynamic and unpredictable test-time
conditions remains a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems.
Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often fail in high-variance tasks
like 3D object detection due to unstable optimization and sharp minima. While
recent model merging strategies based on linear mode connectivity (LMC) offer
improved stability by interpolating between fine-tuned checkpoints, they are
computationally expensive, requiring repeated checkpoint access and multiple
forward passes. In this paper, we introduce CodeMerge, a lightweight and
scalable model merging framework that bypasses these limitations by operating
in a compact latent space. Instead of loading full models, CodeMerge represents
each checkpoint with a low-dimensional fingerprint derived from the source
model's penultimate features and constructs a key-value codebook. We compute
merging coefficients using ridge leverage scores on these fingerprints,
enabling efficient model composition without compromising adaptation quality.
Our method achieves strong performance across challenging benchmarks, improving
end-to-end 3D detection 14.9% NDS on nuScenes-C and LiDAR-based detection by
over 7.6% mAP on nuScenes-to-KITTI, while benefiting downstream tasks such as
online mapping, motion prediction and planning even without training. Code and
pretrained models are released in the supplementary material.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a high-fidelity and efficient
paradigm for online free-viewpoint video (FVV) reconstruction, offering viewers
rapid responsiveness and immersive experiences. However, existing online
methods face challenge in prohibitive storage requirements primarily due to
point-wise modeling that fails to exploit the motion properties. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel Compact Gaussian Streaming (ComGS)
framework, leveraging the locality and consistency of motion in dynamic scene,
that models object-consistent Gaussian point motion through keypoint-driven
motion representation. By transmitting only the keypoint attributes, this
framework provides a more storage-efficient solution. Specifically, we first
identify a sparse set of motion-sensitive keypoints localized within motion
regions using a viewspace gradient difference strategy. Equipped with these
keypoints, we propose an adaptive motion-driven mechanism that predicts a
spatial influence field for propagating keypoint motion to neighboring Gaussian
points with similar motion. Moreover, ComGS adopts an error-aware correction
strategy for key frame reconstruction that selectively refines erroneous
regions and mitigates error accumulation without unnecessary overhead. Overall,
ComGS achieves a remarkable storage reduction of over 159 X compared to
3DGStream and 14 X compared to the SOTA method QUEEN, while maintaining
competitive visual fidelity and rendering speed. Our code will be released.

TLDR: 提出了一种动态3D场景重建的新框架，结合三平面变形场、基于球谐函数的辐射场和潜在扩散先验，实现高效时空表示和高质量渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态3D场景重建中时空表示效率低、运动建模复杂以及渲染质量不足的问题。

Method: 使用三平面变形场编码4D场景，结合球谐函数渲染头和潜在扩散模块优化特征表示和一致性。

Result: 在合成基准测试中表现优异，视觉质量、时间一致性和稀疏视图输入鲁棒性均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过高效表示和生成优化，显著提升了动态场景重建的性能。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction that
integrates three key components: an explicit tri-plane deformation field, a
view-conditioned canonical radiance field with spherical harmonics (SH)
attention, and a temporally-aware latent diffusion prior. Our method encodes 4D
scenes using three orthogonal 2D feature planes that evolve over time, enabling
efficient and compact spatiotemporal representation. These features are
explicitly warped into a canonical space via a deformation offset field,
eliminating the need for MLP-based motion modeling.
  In canonical space, we replace traditional MLP decoders with a structured
SH-based rendering head that synthesizes view-dependent color via attention
over learned frequency bands improving both interpretability and rendering
efficiency. To further enhance fidelity and temporal consistency, we introduce
a transformer-guided latent diffusion module that refines the tri-plane and
deformation features in a compressed latent space. This generative module
denoises scene representations under ambiguous or out-of-distribution (OOD)
motion, improving generalization.
  Our model is trained in two stages: the diffusion module is first pre-trained
independently, and then fine-tuned jointly with the full pipeline using a
combination of image reconstruction, diffusion denoising, and temporal
consistency losses. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on synthetic
benchmarks, surpassing recent methods such as HexPlane and 4D Gaussian
Splatting in visual quality, temporal coherence, and robustness to sparse-view
dynamic inputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: TextureSAM是一种新的纹理感知基础模型，通过纹理增强技术改进SAM模型，在纹理主导的场景中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型在对象分割任务中表现优异，但偏向于形状而非纹理，这在纹理定义边界的领域（如医学影像）中成为限制。

Method: 采用纹理增强技术微调SAM模型，并使用纹理修改后的ADE20K数据集训练TextureSAM。

Result: TextureSAM在自然和合成纹理数据集上的性能显著优于SAM-2（mIoU分别提升0.2和0.18）。

Conclusion: TextureSAM通过强调纹理特征，有效解决了SAM模型的形状偏差问题，适用于纹理主导的分割任务。

Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAM) have achieved remarkable success in object
segmentation tasks across diverse datasets. However, these models are
predominantly trained on large-scale semantic segmentation datasets, which
introduce a bias toward object shape rather than texture cues in the image.
This limitation is critical in domains such as medical imaging, material
classification, and remote sensing, where texture changes define object
boundaries. In this study, we investigate SAM's bias toward semantics over
textures and introduce a new texture-aware foundation model, TextureSAM, which
performs superior segmentation in texture-dominant scenarios. To achieve this,
we employ a novel fine-tuning approach that incorporates texture augmentation
techniques, incrementally modifying training images to emphasize texture
features. By leveraging a novel texture-alternation of the ADE20K dataset, we
guide TextureSAM to prioritize texture-defined regions, thereby mitigating the
inherent shape bias present in the original SAM model. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that TextureSAM significantly outperforms SAM-2 on both
natural (+0.2 mIoU) and synthetic (+0.18 mIoU) texture-based segmentation
datasets. The code and texture-augmented dataset will be publicly available.

Motivation: 现有nnU-Net框架虽自动化程度高，但受限于固定超参数和启发式设计，无法适应多样化MIS任务的需求。

Method: 提出Auto-nnU-Net，结合HPO、NAS和HNAS，并引入Regularized PriorBand优化资源分配。

Result: 在10个MIS数据集中，6个性能显著提升，其余持平，同时保持资源效率。

Conclusion: Auto-nnU-Net在提升分割性能的同时，解决了实际医疗环境中的资源限制问题。

Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) includes diverse tasks, from bone to organ
segmentation, each with its own challenges in finding the best segmentation
model. The state-of-the-art AutoML-related MIS-framework nnU-Net automates many
aspects of model configuration but remains constrained by fixed hyperparameters
and heuristic design choices. As a full-AutoML framework for MIS, we propose
Auto-nnU-Net, a novel nnU-Net variant enabling hyperparameter optimization
(HPO), neural architecture search (NAS), and hierarchical NAS (HNAS).
Additionally, we propose Regularized PriorBand to balance model accuracy with
the computational resources required for training, addressing the resource
constraints often faced in real-world medical settings that limit the
feasibility of extensive training procedures. We evaluate our approach across
diverse MIS datasets from the well-established Medical Segmentation Decathlon,
analyzing the impact of AutoML techniques on segmentation performance,
computational efficiency, and model design choices. The results demonstrate
that our AutoML approach substantially improves the segmentation performance of
nnU-Net on 6 out of 10 datasets and is on par on the other datasets while
maintaining practical resource requirements. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法在质量和效率上优于现有技术。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of monocular-to-stereo video conversion and propose a
novel architecture for inpainting and refinement of the warped right view
obtained by depth-based reprojection of the input left view. We extend the
Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) model to utilize the input left video, the warped
right video, and the disocclusion masks as conditioning input to generate a
high-quality right camera view. In order to effectively exploit information
from neighboring frames for inpainting, we modify the attention layers in SVD
to compute full attention for discoccluded pixels. Our model is trained to
generate the right view video in an end-to-end manner by minimizing image space
losses to ensure high-quality generation. Our approach outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods, obtaining an average rank of 1.43 among the 4
compared methods in a user study, while being 6x faster than the second placed

Conclusion: LiDAR生成的字幕监督能有效减少现有模型的视觉/静态偏差，增强时间理解。

Abstract: Video captioning models have seen notable advancements in recent years,
especially with regard to their ability to capture temporal information. While
many research efforts have focused on architectural advancements, such as
temporal attention mechanisms, there remains a notable gap in understanding how
models capture and utilize temporal semantics for effective temporal feature
extraction, especially in the context of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. We
propose an automated LiDAR-based captioning procedure that focuses on the
temporal dynamics of traffic participants. Our approach uses a rule-based
system to extract essential details such as lane position and relative motion
from object tracks, followed by a template-based caption generation. Our
findings show that training SwinBERT, a video captioning model, using only
front camera images and supervised with our template-based captions,
specifically designed to encapsulate fine-grained temporal behavior, leads to
improved temporal understanding consistently across three datasets. In
conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that integrating LiDAR-based
caption supervision significantly enhances temporal understanding, effectively
addressing and reducing the inherent visual/static biases prevalent in current
state-of-the-art model architectures.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种新的单应性几何参数化方法，基于相似-核-相似（SKS）分解，避免了传统四角位置偏移方法的线性系统求解需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于四角位置偏移的单应性参数化缺乏几何可解释性，且需要求解线性系统，限制了其效率和直观性。

Method: 利用相似-核-相似（SKS）分解，将单应性参数化为两组独立的几何参数：相似变换和核变换，并推导了核变换参数与角度偏移的线性关系。

Result: 提出的参数化方法通过矩阵乘法直接估计单应性，无需求解线性系统，性能与四角位置偏移方法相当。

Conclusion: 新方法在保持性能的同时，提高了单应性估计的几何可解释性和计算效率。

Abstract: Planar homography, with eight degrees of freedom (DOFs), is fundamental in
numerous computer vision tasks. While the positional offsets of four corners
are widely adopted (especially in neural network predictions), this
parameterization lacks geometric interpretability and typically requires
solving a linear system to compute the homography matrix. This paper presents a
novel geometric parameterization of homographies, leveraging the
similarity-kernel-similarity (SKS) decomposition for projective
transformations. Two independent sets of four geometric parameters are
decoupled: one for a similarity transformation and the other for the kernel
transformation. Additionally, the geometric interpretation linearly relating
the four kernel transformation parameters to angular offsets is derived. Our
proposed parameterization allows for direct homography estimation through
matrix multiplication, eliminating the need for solving a linear system, and
achieves performance comparable to the four-corner positional offsets in deep
homography estimation.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在新型物体上的泛化能力不足以及多模态方法因抽象文本提示和复杂建模导致的生成模糊和误差累积问题。

Method: 采用双层架构：高层利用视觉语言模型和深度估计器推断运动先验，低层基于DiT的流匹配策略生成细粒度轨迹，并通过时间正交滤波增强稳定性。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，显著减少了手腕平移误差（86.9%）和关节旋转误差（34.1%）。

Conclusion: MEgoHand能够精确建模手部关节结构，并在多样化场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Egocentric hand-object motion generation is crucial for immersive AR/VR and
robotic imitation but remains challenging due to unstable viewpoints,
self-occlusions, perspective distortion, and noisy ego-motion. Existing methods
rely on predefined 3D object priors, limiting generalization to novel objects,
which restricts their generalizability to novel objects. Meanwhile, recent
multimodal approaches suffer from ambiguous generation from abstract textual
cues, intricate pipelines for modeling 3D hand-object correlation, and
compounding errors in open-loop prediction. We propose MEgoHand, a multimodal
framework that synthesizes physically plausible hand-object interactions from
egocentric RGB, text, and initial hand pose. MEgoHand introduces a bi-level
architecture: a high-level "cerebrum" leverages a vision language model (VLM)
to infer motion priors from visual-textual context and a monocular depth
estimator for object-agnostic spatial reasoning, while a low-level DiT-based
flow-matching policy generates fine-grained trajectories with temporal
orthogonal filtering to enhance stability. To address dataset inconsistency, we
design a dataset curation paradigm with an Inverse MANO Retargeting Network and
Virtual RGB-D Renderer, curating a unified dataset of 3.35M RGB-D frames, 24K
interactions, and 1.2K objects. Extensive experiments across five in-domain and
two cross-domain datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MEgoHand, achieving
substantial reductions in wrist translation error (86.9%) and joint rotation
error (34.1%), highlighting its capacity to accurately model fine-grained hand
joint structures and generalize robustly across diverse scenarios.

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上实现最佳性能。

Conclusion: 整合放射报告显著提升CXR视觉问答性能，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Chest X-ray (CXR) Visual Question Answering
(VQA), addressing both single-image image-difference questions. Single-image
questions focus on abnormalities within a specific CXR ("What abnormalities are
seen in image X?"), while image-difference questions compare two longitudinal
CXRs acquired at different time points ("What are the differences between image
X and Y?"). We further explore how the integration of radiology reports can
enhance the performance of VQA models. While previous approaches have
demonstrated the utility of radiology reports during the pre-training phase, we
extend this idea by showing that the reports can also be leveraged as
additional input to improve the VQA model's predicted answers. First, we
propose a unified method that handles both types of questions and
auto-regressively generates the answers. For single-image questions, the model
is provided with a single CXR. For image-difference questions, the model is
provided with two CXRs from the same patient, captured at different time
points, enabling the model to detect and describe temporal changes. Taking
inspiration from 'Chain-of-Thought reasoning', we demonstrate that performance
on the CXR VQA task can be improved by grounding the answer generator module
with a radiology report predicted for the same CXR. In our approach, the VQA
model is divided into two steps: i) Report Generation (RG) and ii) Answer
Generation (AG). Our results demonstrate that incorporating predicted radiology
reports as evidence to the AG model enhances performance on both single-image
and image-difference questions, achieving state-of-the-art results on the
Medical-Diff-VQA dataset.

Motivation: 当前半监督医学图像分割方法主要关注前景建模，忽视了背景建模的潜在优势。本文旨在通过背景建模提升前景分割的置信度。

Method: 提出CVBM框架，结合背景建模作为辅助视角，并引入双向一致性机制确保前景与背景预测的对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，例如在Pancreas数据集上仅使用20%标注数据即超越全监督方法（DSC: 84.57% vs. 83.89%）。

Conclusion: CVBM通过背景建模和双向一致性机制显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) leverages unlabeled data
to reduce reliance on manually annotated images. However, current SOTA
approaches predominantly focus on foreground-oriented modeling (i.e.,
segmenting only the foreground region) and have largely overlooked the
potential benefits of explicitly modeling the background region. Our study
theoretically and empirically demonstrates that highly certain predictions in
background modeling enhance the confidence of corresponding foreground
modeling. Building on this insight, we propose the Cross-view Bidirectional
Modeling (CVBM) framework, which introduces a novel perspective by
incorporating background modeling to improve foreground modeling performance.
Within CVBM, background modeling serves as an auxiliary perspective, providing
complementary supervisory signals to enhance the confidence of the foreground
model. Additionally, CVBM introduces an innovative bidirectional consistency
mechanism, which ensures mutual alignment between foreground predictions and
background-guided predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves SOTA performance on the LA, Pancreas, ACDC, and HRF datasets.
Notably, on the Pancreas dataset, CVBM outperforms fully supervised methods
(i.e., DSC: 84.57% vs. 83.89%) while utilizing only 20% of the labeled data.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a texture-independent approach to estimate and
track 3D joint positions of multiple pigeons. For this purpose, we build upon
the existing 3D-MuPPET framework, which estimates and tracks the 3D poses of up
to 10 pigeons using a multi-view camera setup. We extend this framework by
using a segmentation method that generates silhouettes of the individuals,
which are then used to estimate 2D keypoints. Following 3D-MuPPET, these 2D
keypoints are triangulated to infer 3D poses, and identities are matched in the
first frame and tracked in 2D across subsequent frames. Our proposed
texture-independent approach achieves comparable accuracy to the original
texture-dependent 3D-MuPPET framework. Additionally, we explore our approach's
applicability to other bird species. To do that, we infer the 2D joint
positions of four bird species without additional fine-tuning the model trained
on pigeons and obtain preliminary promising results. Thus, we think that our
approach serves as a solid foundation and inspires the development of more
robust and accurate texture-independent pose estimation frameworks.

Conclusion: VideoSafety-R1框架成功将安全对齐从被动识别转向主动推理，显著提升了视频大语言模型的安全性。

Abstract: While the safety risks of image-based large language models have been
extensively studied, their video-based counterparts (Video LLMs) remain
critically under-examined. To systematically study this problem, we introduce
\textbf{VideoSafetyBench (VSB-77k) - the first large-scale, culturally diverse
benchmark for Video LLM safety}, which compromises 77,646 video-query pairs and
spans 19 principal risk categories across 10 language communities. \textit{We
reveal that integrating video modality degrades safety performance by an
average of 42.3\%, exposing systemic risks in multimodal attack exploitation.}
To address this vulnerability, we propose \textbf{VideoSafety-R1}, a dual-stage
framework achieving unprecedented safety gains through two innovations: (1)
Alarm Token-Guided Safety Fine-Tuning (AT-SFT) injects learnable alarm tokens
into visual and textual sequences, enabling explicit harm perception across
modalities via multitask objectives. (2) Then, Safety-Guided GRPO enhances
defensive reasoning through dynamic policy optimization with rule-based rewards
derived from dual-modality verification. These components synergize to shift
safety alignment from passive harm recognition to active reasoning. The
resulting framework achieves a 65.1\% improvement on VSB-Eval-HH, and improves
by 59.1\%, 44.3\%, and 15.0\% on the image safety datasets MMBench, VLGuard,
and FigStep, respectively. \textit{Our codes are available in the supplementary

Abstract: We investigate fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-task
medical image understanding, focusing on detection, localization, and counting
of findings in medical images. Our objective is to evaluate whether
instruction-tuned VLMs can simultaneously improve these tasks, with the goal of
enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Using MedMultiPoints, a
multimodal dataset with annotations from endoscopy (polyps and instruments) and
microscopy (sperm cells), we reformulate each task into instruction-based
prompts suitable for vision-language reasoning. We fine-tune
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) across multiple task
combinations. Results show that multi-task training improves robustness and
accuracy. For example, it reduces the Count Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and
increases Matching Accuracy in the Counting + Pointing task. However,
trade-offs emerge, such as more zero-case point predictions, indicating reduced
reliability in edge cases despite overall performance gains. Our study
highlights the potential of adapting general-purpose VLMs to specialized
medical tasks via prompt-driven fine-tuning. This approach mirrors clinical
workflows, where radiologists simultaneously localize, count, and describe
findings - demonstrating how VLMs can learn composite diagnostic reasoning
patterns. The model produces interpretable, structured outputs, offering a

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved performance in visual question answering. However, they
often suffer from hallucinations. In this work, hallucinations are categorized
into two main types: initial hallucinations and snowball hallucinations. We
argue that adequate contextual information can be extracted directly from the
token interaction process. Inspired by causal inference in the decoding
strategy, we propose to leverage causal masks to establish information
propagation between multimodal tokens. The hypothesis is that insufficient
interaction between those tokens may lead the model to rely on outlier tokens,
overlooking dense and rich contextual cues. Therefore, we propose to intervene
in the propagation process by tackling outlier tokens to enhance in-context
inference. With this goal, we present FarSight, a versatile plug-and-play
decoding strategy to reduce attention interference from outlier tokens merely
by optimizing the causal mask. The heart of our method is effective token
propagation. We design an attention register structure within the upper
triangular matrix of the causal mask, dynamically allocating attention to
capture attention diverted to outlier tokens. Moreover, a positional awareness
encoding method with a diminishing masking rate is proposed, allowing the model

*Giuseppe Guarino,Matteo Ciotola,Gemine Vivone,Giovanni Poggi,Giuseppe Scarpa*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 本文提出了一种轻量级神经网络方法，用于高光谱图像融合，解决了现有方法在光谱保真度上的不足，确保所有波段的一致质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像融合面临独特挑战，如波段数量多、噪声大、光谱不匹配等，现有方法难以保证所有波段的一致质量。

Method: 使用自适应权重的轻量级神经网络，动态调整空间损失以快速收敛光谱损失，并重新定义空间损失以考虑非线性依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在所有波段上均表现出色，与现有技术竞争，且无需外部数据训练。

Conclusion: 该方法完全无监督、灵活且复杂度低，为高光谱图像融合提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral pansharpening has received much attention in recent years due
to technological and methodological advances that open the door to new
application scenarios. However, research on this topic is only now gaining
momentum. The most popular methods are still borrowed from the more mature
field of multispectral pansharpening and often overlook the unique challenges
posed by hyperspectral data fusion, such as i) the very large number of bands,
ii) the overwhelming noise in selected spectral ranges, iii) the significant
spectral mismatch between panchromatic and hyperspectral components, iv) a
typically high resolution ratio. Imprecise data modeling especially affects
spectral fidelity. Even state-of-the-art methods perform well in certain
spectral ranges and much worse in others, failing to ensure consistent quality
across all bands, with the risk of generating unreliable results. Here, we
propose a hyperspectral pansharpening method that explicitly addresses this
problem and ensures uniform spectral quality. To this end, a single lightweight
neural network is used, with weights that adapt on the fly to each band. During
fine-tuning, the spatial loss is turned on and off to ensure a fast convergence
of the spectral loss to the desired level, according to a hysteresis-like
dynamic. Furthermore, the spatial loss itself is appropriately redefined to
account for nonlinear dependencies between panchromatic and spectral bands.
Overall, the proposed method is fully unsupervised, with no prior training on
external data, flexible, and low-complexity. Experiments on a recently
published benchmarking toolbox show that it ensures excellent sharpening
quality, competitive with the state-of-the-art, consistently across all bands.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种针对少样本医学异常检测的框架SD-MAD，通过结合多样化的文本描述和两阶段设计，解决了多异常类别识别的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学异常检测面临数据隐私和稀缺的挑战，现有方法常忽略多异常类别的区分，因此需要一种新框架。

Method: SD-MAD框架分两阶段：1）通过放大异常间差异对齐放射学特征；2）采用自动特征选择策略减少数据不足的影响。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，并提出了三种协议量化多异常检测性能。

Conclusion: SD-MAD框架在少样本医学异常检测中表现优异，尤其适用于多异常类别识别场景。

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is crucial for early clinical intervention,
yet it faces challenges due to limited access to high-quality medical imaging
data, caused by privacy concerns and data silos. Few-shot learning has emerged
as a promising approach to alleviate these limitations by leveraging the
large-scale prior knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs). Recent
advancements in few-shot medical AD have treated normal and abnormal cases as a
one-class classification problem, often overlooking the distinction among
multiple anomaly categories. Thus, in this paper, we propose a framework
tailored for few-shot medical anomaly detection in the scenario where the
identification of multiple anomaly categories is required. To capture the
detailed radiological signs of medical anomaly categories, our framework
incorporates diverse textual descriptions for each category generated by a
Large-Language model, under the assumption that different anomalies in medical
images may share common radiological signs in each category. Specifically, we
introduce SD-MAD, a two-stage Sign-Driven few-shot Multi-Anomaly Detection
framework: (i) Radiological signs are aligned with anomaly categories by
amplifying inter-anomaly discrepancy; (ii) Aligned signs are selected further
to mitigate the effect of the under-fitting and uncertain-sample issue caused
by limited medical data, employing an automatic sign selection strategy at
inference. Moreover, we propose three protocols to comprehensively quantify the
performance of multi-anomaly detection. Extensive experiments illustrate the
effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在融合2D图像、3D点云和文本指令时面临多模态数据稀缺和模态间冲突的挑战，需要一种更有效的跨模态协作方法。

Method: 提出Cross-Modal Belief Alignment，通过共享3D-text模型的文本假设，轻量级微调导航代理，整合视觉线索与空间语义知识。

Result: 在四个导航基准（R2R、CVDN、REVERIE、SOON）和两个空间推理基准（ScanQA、SQA3D）上表现优异，路径更短（SPL更高）。

Conclusion: CoNav展示了多模态数据融合在导航中的潜力，但挑战仍存。

Abstract: Embodied navigation demands comprehensive scene understanding and precise
spatial reasoning. While image-text models excel at interpreting pixel-level
color and lighting cues, 3D-text models capture volumetric structure and
spatial relationships. However, unified fusion approaches that jointly fuse 2D
images, 3D point clouds, and textual instructions face challenges in limited
availability of triple-modality data and difficulty resolving conflicting
beliefs among modalities. In this work, we introduce CoNav, a collaborative
cross-modal reasoning framework where a pretrained 3D-text model explicitly
guides an image-text navigation agent by providing structured spatial-semantic
knowledge to resolve ambiguities during navigation. Specifically, we introduce
Cross-Modal Belief Alignment, which operationalizes this cross-modal guidance
by simply sharing textual hypotheses from the 3D-text model to the navigation
agent. Through lightweight fine-tuning on a small 2D-3D-text corpus, the
navigation agent learns to integrate visual cues with spatial-semantic
knowledge derived from the 3D-text model, enabling effective reasoning in
embodied navigation. CoNav achieves significant improvements on four standard
embodied navigation benchmarks (R2R, CVDN, REVERIE, SOON) and two spatial
reasoning benchmarks (ScanQA, SQA3D). Moreover, under close navigation Success
Rate, CoNav often generates shorter paths compared to other methods (as
measured by SPL), showcasing the potential and challenges of fusing data from
different modalities in embodied navigation. Project Page:

Conclusion: Share-GRPO通过共享推理轨迹和奖励信息，有效提升了MLLMs的推理能力，并解决了强化学习中的关键问题。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to incentivize the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) and develop an
effective approach that mitigates the sparse reward and advantage vanishing
issues during RL. To this end, we propose Share-GRPO, a novel RL approach that
tackle these issues by exploring and sharing diverse reasoning trajectories
over expanded question space. Specifically, Share-GRPO first expands the
question space for a given question via data transformation techniques, and
then encourages MLLM to effectively explore diverse reasoning trajectories over
the expanded question space and shares the discovered reasoning trajectories
across the expanded questions during RL. In addition, Share-GRPO also shares
reward information during advantage computation, which estimates solution
advantages hierarchically across and within question variants, allowing more
accurate estimation of relative advantages and improving the stability of
policy training. Extensive evaluations over six widely-used reasoning
benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method. Code will be
available at https://github.com/HJYao00/R1-ShareVL.

Motivation: 电池安全与效率至关重要，但传统深度学习方法需要大量标注数据，而异常数据难以获取。

Method: 利用预训练的VQA模型（如ChatGPT-4o、LLaVa-13b和BLIP-2），通过文本提示结合电池正常行为先验知识，实现零样本异常检测。

Result: 尽管未针对电池数据进行微调，该方法在异常检测中表现出与现有最佳方法相当的竞争力。

Conclusion: VQA零样本学习在电池异常检测中具有潜力，未来可进一步优化其效果。

Abstract: Batteries are essential for various applications, including electric vehicles
and renewable energy storage, making safety and efficiency critical concerns.
Anomaly detection in battery thermal images helps identify failures early, but
traditional deep learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is
difficult to obtain, especially for anomalies due to safety risks and high data
collection costs. To overcome this, we explore zero-shot anomaly detection
using Visual Question Answering (VQA) models, which leverage pretrained
knowledge and textbased prompts to generalize across vision tasks. By
incorporating prior knowledge of normal battery thermal behavior, we design
prompts to detect anomalies without battery-specific training data. We evaluate
three VQA models (ChatGPT-4o, LLaVa-13b, and BLIP-2) analyzing their robustness
to prompt variations, repeated trials, and qualitative outputs. Despite the
lack of finetuning on battery data, our approach demonstrates competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art models that are trained with the
battery data. Our findings highlight the potential of VQA-based zero-shot
learning for battery anomaly detection and suggest future directions for
improving its effectiveness.

*Jordan Dotzel,Tony Montes,Mohamed S. Abdelfattah,Zhiru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 传统3D对象压缩方法仅处理顶点、多边形和纹理等结构信息，而语义压缩则直接操作核心概念，支持更高压缩率，且以自然语言存储，适合协作项目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在高压缩率下表现不佳，而语义压缩通过忽略结构信息并使用生成模型填补缺失信息，有望突破压缩极限。

Method: 构建基于公共生成模型的3D语义压缩流程，探索压缩与质量的平衡。

Result: 在Objaverse数据集上实现高达105x的压缩率，且在100x压缩附近优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 语义压缩在高压缩率下表现优越，适合大规模协作项目。

Abstract: Traditional methods for 3D object compression operate only on structural
information within the object vertices, polygons, and textures. These methods
are effective at compression rates up to 10x for standard object sizes but
quickly deteriorate at higher compression rates with texture artifacts,
low-polygon counts, and mesh gaps. In contrast, semantic compression ignores
structural information and operates directly on the core concepts to push to
extreme levels of compression. In addition, it uses natural language as its
storage format, which makes it natively human-readable and a natural fit for
emerging applications built around large-scale, collaborative projects within
augmented and virtual reality. It deprioritizes structural information like
location, size, and orientation and predicts the missing information with
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In this work, we construct a pipeline
for 3D semantic compression from public generative models and explore the
quality-compression frontier for 3D object compression. We apply this pipeline
to achieve rates as high as 105x for 3D objects taken from the Objaverse
dataset and show that semantic compression can outperform traditional methods
in the important quality-preserving region around 100x compression.

Motivation: 地球表面过程复杂且动态，卫星图像提供了全球监测能力，但传统方法难以处理其数据量和复杂性。图方法能更好地建模时空交互。

Result: 通过案例研究验证了图方法在土地覆盖制图和水资源预测中的有效性，展示了其潜力。

Conclusion: 图方法在遥感分析中具有广阔前景，但仍需解决当前限制并推动未来发展。

Abstract: The Earth's surface is subject to complex and dynamic processes, ranging from
large-scale phenomena such as tectonic plate movements to localized changes
associated with ecosystems, agriculture, or human activity. Satellite images
enable global monitoring of these processes with extensive spatial and temporal
coverage, offering advantages over in-situ methods. In particular, resulting
satellite image time series (SITS) datasets contain valuable information. To
handle their large volume and complexity, some recent works focus on the use of
graph-based techniques that abandon the regular Euclidean structure of
satellite data to work at an object level. Besides, graphs enable modelling
spatial and temporal interactions between identified objects, which are crucial
for pattern detection, classification and regression tasks. This paper is an
effort to examine the integration of graph-based methods in spatio-temporal
remote-sensing analysis. In particular, it aims to present a versatile
graph-based pipeline to tackle SITS analysis. It focuses on the construction of
spatio-temporal graphs from SITS and their application to downstream tasks. The
paper includes a comprehensive review and two case studies, which highlight the
potential of graph-based approaches for land cover mapping and water resource
forecasting. It also discusses numerous perspectives to resolve current
limitations and encourage future developments.

Result: OneDC在一步生成下实现SOTA感知质量，比特率降低40%以上，解码速度提升20倍。

Conclusion: OneDC展示了在生成压缩中一步扩散的潜力，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: While recent diffusion-based generative image codecs have shown impressive
performance, their iterative sampling process introduces unpleasing latency. In
this work, we revisit the design of a diffusion-based codec and argue that
multi-step sampling is not necessary for generative compression. Based on this
insight, we propose OneDC, a One-step Diffusion-based generative image Codec --
that integrates a latent compression module with a one-step diffusion
generator. Recognizing the critical role of semantic guidance in one-step
diffusion, we propose using the hyperprior as a semantic signal, overcoming the
limitations of text prompts in representing complex visual content. To further
enhance the semantic capability of the hyperprior, we introduce a semantic
distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge from a pretrained generative
tokenizer to the hyperprior codec. Additionally, we adopt a hybrid pixel- and
latent-domain optimization to jointly enhance both reconstruction fidelity and
perceptual realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneDC achieves SOTA
perceptual quality even with one-step generation, offering over 40% bitrate
reduction and 20x faster decoding compared to prior multi-step diffusion-based
codecs. Code will be released later.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal generative models have enabled significant
progress in instruction-based image editing. However, while these models
produce visually plausible outputs, their capacity for knowledge-based
reasoning editing tasks remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce
KRIS-Bench (Knowledge-based Reasoning in Image-editing Systems Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark designed to assess models through a cognitively informed
lens. Drawing from educational theory, KRIS-Bench categorizes editing tasks
across three foundational knowledge types: Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural.
Based on this taxonomy, we design 22 representative tasks spanning 7 reasoning
dimensions and release 1,267 high-quality annotated editing instances. To
support fine-grained evaluation, we propose a comprehensive protocol that
incorporates a novel Knowledge Plausibility metric, enhanced by knowledge hints
and calibrated through human studies. Empirical results on 10 state-of-the-art
models reveal significant gaps in reasoning performance, highlighting the need
for knowledge-centric benchmarks to advance the development of intelligent
image editing systems.

Motivation: 现有方法将几何和属性编码分开处理，增加了计算复杂度且未充分利用共享特征，SEDD-PCC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用单一编码器提取共享特征到统一潜在空间，双解码器依次重建几何和属性，并引入知识蒸馏提升特征表示。

Result: 在规则和基于学习的方法对比中，SEDD-PCC表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: SEDD-PCC是一种高效且实用的点云压缩解决方案，具有潜力。

Abstract: To encode point clouds containing both geometry and attributes, most
learning-based compression schemes treat geometry and attribute coding
separately, employing distinct encoders and decoders. This not only increases
computational complexity but also fails to fully exploit shared features
between geometry and attributes. To address this limitation, we propose
SEDD-PCC, an end-to-end learning-based framework for lossy point cloud
compression that jointly compresses geometry and attributes. SEDD-PCC employs a
single encoder to extract shared geometric and attribute features into a
unified latent space, followed by dual specialized decoders that sequentially
reconstruct geometry and attributes. Additionally, we incorporate knowledge
distillation to enhance feature representation learning from a teacher model,
further improving coding efficiency. With its simple yet effective design,
SEDD-PCC provides an efficient and practical solution for point cloud
compression. Comparative evaluations against both rule-based and learning-based
methods demonstrate its competitive performance, highlighting SEDD-PCC as a
promising AI-driven compression approach.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval (RSITR) plays a critical role in
geographic information interpretation, disaster monitoring, and urban planning
by establishing semantic associations between image and textual descriptions.
Existing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for Vision-and-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models typically adopt symmetric adapter structures for
exploring cross-modal correlations. However, the strong discriminative nature
of text modality may dominate the optimization process and inhibits image
representation learning. The nonnegligible imbalanced cross-modal optimization
remains a bottleneck to enhancing the model performance. To address this issue,
this study proposes a Representation Discrepancy Bridging (RDB) method for the
RSITR task. On the one hand, a Cross-Modal Asymmetric Adapter (CMAA) is
designed to enable modality-specific optimization and improve feature
alignment. The CMAA comprises a Visual Enhancement Adapter (VEA) and a Text
Semantic Adapter (TSA). VEA mines fine-grained image features by Differential
Attention (DA) mechanism, while TSA identifies key textual semantics through
Hierarchical Attention (HA) mechanism. On the other hand, this study extends
the traditional single-task retrieval framework to a dual-task optimization
framework and develops a Dual-Task Consistency Loss (DTCL). The DTCL improves
cross-modal alignment robustness through an adaptive weighted combination of
cross-modal, classification, and exponential moving average consistency
constraints. Experiments on RSICD and RSITMD datasets show that the proposed
RDB method achieves a 6%-11% improvement in mR metrics compared to
state-of-the-art PEFT methods and a 1.15%-2% improvement over the full
fine-tuned GeoRSCLIP model.

Abstract: Existing pretrained models for 3D mesh generation often suffer from data
biases and produce low-quality results, while global reinforcement learning
(RL) methods rely on object-level rewards that struggle to capture local
structure details. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{Mesh-RFT}, a
novel fine-grained reinforcement fine-tuning framework that employs Masked
Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable localized refinement via
quality-aware face masking. To facilitate efficient quality evaluation, we
introduce an objective topology-aware scoring system to evaluate geometric
integrity and topological regularity at both object and face levels through two
metrics: Boundary Edge Ratio (BER) and Topology Score (TS). By integrating
these metrics into a fine-grained RL strategy, Mesh-RFT becomes the first
method to optimize mesh quality at the granularity of individual faces,
resolving localized errors while preserving global coherence. Experiment
results show that our M-DPO approach reduces Hausdorff Distance (HD) by 24.6\%
and improves Topology Score (TS) by 3.8\% over pre-trained models, while
outperforming global DPO methods with a 17.4\% HD reduction and 4.9\% TS gain.
These results demonstrate Mesh-RFT's ability to improve geometric integrity and
topological regularity, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in
production-ready mesh generation. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了数据依赖和模型偏见，提升了提示优化的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image models are powerful for producing high-quality images based on
given text prompts, but crafting these prompts often requires specialized
vocabulary. To address this, existing methods train rewriting models with
supervision from large amounts of manually annotated data and trained aesthetic
assessment models. To alleviate the dependence on data scale for model training
and the biases introduced by trained models, we propose a novel prompt
optimization framework, designed to rephrase a simple user prompt into a
sophisticated prompt to a text-to-image model. Specifically, we employ the
large vision language models (LVLMs) as the solver to rewrite the user prompt,
and concurrently, employ LVLMs as a reward model to score the aesthetics and
alignment of the images generated by the optimized prompt. Instead of laborious
human feedback, we exploit the prior knowledge of the LVLM to provide rewards,
i.e., AI feedback. Simultaneously, the solver and the reward model are unified
into one model and iterated in reinforcement learning to achieve
self-improvement by giving a solution and judging itself. Results on two
popular datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other strong
competitors.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注多模态输入和纯文本推理，而忽视了多模态输出推理的重要性，因此需要一个新的评估工具。

Method: 通过精心挑选803个涵盖数学、物理、计数和游戏的问题，构建RBench-V基准，要求模型进行图像生成和辅助线构建等操作。

Result: 测试结果显示，即使是表现最好的模型o3，准确率仅为25.8%，远低于人类的82.3%。

Conclusion: 当前模型在多模态推理能力上仍有显著不足，RBench-V为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of native multi-modal models and omni-models,
exemplified by GPT-4o, Gemini, and o3, with their capability to process and
generate content across modalities such as text and images, marks a significant
milestone in the evolution of intelligence. Systematic evaluation of their
multi-modal output capabilities in visual thinking processes (also known as
multi-modal chain of thought, M-CoT) becomes critically important. However,
existing benchmarks for evaluating multi-modal models primarily focus on
assessing multi-modal inputs and text-only reasoning while neglecting the
importance of reasoning through multi-modal outputs. In this paper, we present
a benchmark, dubbed RBench-V, designed to assess models' vision-indispensable
reasoning abilities. To construct RBench-V, we carefully hand-pick 803
questions covering math, physics, counting, and games. Unlike previous
benchmarks that typically specify certain input modalities, RBench-V presents
problems centered on multi-modal outputs, which require image manipulation such
as generating novel images and constructing auxiliary lines to support the
reasoning process. We evaluate numerous open- and closed-source models on
RBench-V, including o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, etc. Even the
best-performing model, o3, achieves only 25.8% accuracy on RBench-V, far below
the human score of 82.3%, highlighting that current models struggle to leverage
multi-modal reasoning. Data and code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种无监督学习框架，用于提取皮肤病学特征，优于基于ImageNet的预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ImageNet预训练模型在医学影像中无法捕捉领域特定特征的问题。

Method: 使用变分自编码器（VAE）在皮肤病数据集上从头训练，构建临床相关的潜在空间。

Result: 自监督模型验证损失降低33.33%，准确率提升44.44%，泛化能力更强；ImageNet预训练模型过拟合严重。

Conclusion: 领域特定的无监督学习在医学影像中表现更优，泛化能力更强。

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision but relies heavily on large
labeled datasets and computational resources. Transfer learning, particularly
fine-tuning pretrained models, offers a practical alternative; however, models
pretrained on natural image datasets such as ImageNet may fail to capture
domain-specific characteristics in medical imaging. This study introduces an
unsupervised learning framework that extracts high-value dermatological
features instead of relying solely on ImageNet-based pretraining. We employ a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained from scratch on a proprietary
dermatological dataset, allowing the model to learn a structured and clinically
relevant latent space. This self-supervised feature extractor is then compared
to an ImageNet-pretrained backbone under identical classification conditions,
highlighting the trade-offs between general-purpose and domain-specific
pretraining. Our results reveal distinct learning patterns. The self-supervised
model achieves a final validation loss of 0.110 (-33.33%), while the
ImageNet-pretrained model stagnates at 0.100 (-16.67%), indicating overfitting.
Accuracy trends confirm this: the self-supervised model improves from 45% to
65% (+44.44%) with a near-zero overfitting gap, whereas the ImageNet-pretrained
model reaches 87% (+50.00%) but plateaus at 75% (+19.05%), with its overfitting
gap increasing to +0.060. These findings suggest that while ImageNet
pretraining accelerates convergence, it also amplifies overfitting on
non-clinically relevant features. In contrast, self-supervised learning
achieves steady improvements, stronger generalization, and superior
adaptability, underscoring the importance of domain-specific feature extraction
in medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为URM的单领域泛化少样本计数模型，通过引入通用视觉-语言表示提升对领域偏移的鲁棒性，并在性能和泛化能力上达到最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域偏移严重限制了现有少样本计数方法在未见场景中的泛化能力，而单领域泛化在该领域尚未被探索。

Method: 分析了现有方法的局限性，提出URM模型，利用大规模预训练视觉-语言模型的通用表示改进相关性构建过程。

Result: URM在领域内和新引入的领域泛化设置中均取得最优性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入通用视觉-语言表示，URM显著提升了少样本计数对领域偏移的鲁棒性，同时保持领域内性能。

Abstract: Few-shot counting estimates the number of target objects in an image using
only a few annotated exemplars. However, domain shift severely hinders existing
methods to generalize to unseen scenarios. This falls into the realm of single
domain generalization that remains unexplored in few-shot counting. To solve
this problem, we begin by analyzing the main limitations of current methods,
which typically follow a standard pipeline that extract the object prototypes
from exemplars and then match them with image feature to construct the
correlation map. We argue that existing methods overlook the significance of
learning highly generalized prototypes. Building on this insight, we propose
the first single domain generalization few-shot counting model, Universal
Representation Matching, termed URM. Our primary contribution is the discovery
that incorporating universal vision-language representations distilled from a
large scale pretrained vision-language model into the correlation construction
process substantially improves robustness to domain shifts without compromising
in domain performance. As a result, URM achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both in domain and the newly introduced domain generalization setting.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the runner-up solution for the Ego4D EgoSchema
Challenge at CVPR 2025 (Confirmed on May 20, 2025). Inspired by the success of
large models, we evaluate and leverage leading accessible multimodal large
models and adapt them to video understanding tasks via few-shot learning and
model ensemble strategies. Specifically, diversified prompt styles and process
paradigms are systematically explored and evaluated to effectively guide the
attention of large models, fully unleashing their powerful generalization and
adaptability abilities. Experimental results demonstrate that, with our
carefully designed approach, directly utilizing an individual multimodal model
already outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method which includes
several additional processes. Besides, an additional stage is further
introduced that facilitates the cooperation and ensemble of periodic results,
which achieves impressive performance improvements. We hope this work serves as
a valuable reference for the practical application of large models and inspires
future research in the field.

TLDR: HASTE是一种两阶段训练方法，通过早期对齐教师模型的特征和注意力图加速DiTs训练，后期终止对齐以释放生成能力，显著减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DiTs训练速度慢的问题，特别是REPA方法在后期性能下降的问题。

Method: HASTE分为两阶段：第一阶段使用整体对齐损失蒸馏教师模型的注意力图和特征；第二阶段在触发条件满足时终止对齐，专注于去噪。

Result: HASTE在ImageNet 256X256上仅需50个epoch达到基线FID，500个epoch匹配REPA最佳FID，训练步骤减少28倍。

Conclusion: HASTE是一种简单而有效的扩散训练方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art image quality, yet
their training remains notoriously slow. A recent remedy -- representation
alignment (REPA) that matches DiT hidden features to those of a non-generative
teacher (e.g. DINO) -- dramatically accelerates the early epochs but plateaus
or even degrades performance later. We trace this failure to a capacity
mismatch: once the generative student begins modelling the joint data
distribution, the teacher's lower-dimensional embeddings and attention patterns
become a straitjacket rather than a guide. We then introduce HASTE (Holistic
Alignment with Stage-wise Termination for Efficient training), a two-phase
schedule that keeps the help and drops the hindrance. Phase I applies a
holistic alignment loss that simultaneously distills attention maps (relational
priors) and feature projections (semantic anchors) from the teacher into
mid-level layers of the DiT, yielding rapid convergence. Phase II then performs
one-shot termination that deactivates the alignment loss, once a simple trigger
such as a fixed iteration is hit, freeing the DiT to focus on denoising and
exploit its generative capacity. HASTE speeds up training of diverse DiTs
without architecture changes. On ImageNet 256X256, it reaches the vanilla
SiT-XL/2 baseline FID in 50 epochs and matches REPA's best FID in 500 epochs,
amounting to a 28X reduction in optimization steps. HASTE also improves
text-to-image DiTs on MS-COCO, demonstrating to be a simple yet principled
recipe for efficient diffusion training across various tasks. Our code is
available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/HASTE .

TLDR: REOBench是首个评估地球观测基础模型在六项任务和十二种图像扰动下鲁棒性的基准测试，揭示了现有模型在输入扰动下性能显著下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测基础模型在真实世界扰动下的鲁棒性尚未充分研究，REOBench旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过高分辨率光学遥感图像，系统评估了掩码图像建模、对比学习和视觉语言预训练等多种模型。

Result: 现有模型性能下降显著（1%-20%），视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现更鲁棒。

Conclusion: REOBench揭示了当前模型的脆弱性，为开发更鲁棒的模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Earth observation foundation models have shown strong generalization across
multiple Earth observation tasks, but their robustness under real-world
perturbations remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce REOBench,
the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of Earth
observation foundation models across six tasks and twelve types of image
corruptions, including both appearance-based and geometric perturbations. To
ensure realistic and fine-grained evaluation, our benchmark focuses on
high-resolution optical remote sensing images, which are widely used in
critical applications such as urban planning and disaster response. We conduct
a systematic evaluation of a broad range of models trained using masked image
modeling, contrastive learning, and vision-language pre-training paradigms. Our
results reveal that (1) existing Earth observation foundation models experience
significant performance degradation when exposed to input corruptions. (2) The
severity of degradation varies across tasks, model architectures, backbone
sizes, and types of corruption, with performance drop varying from less than 1%
to over 20%. (3) Vision-language models show enhanced robustness, particularly
in multimodal tasks. REOBench underscores the vulnerability of current Earth
observation foundation models to real-world corruptions and provides actionable
insights for developing more robust and reliable models.

TLDR: 论文提出Video-to-Voxel (V2V)方法，将传统视频帧直接转换为事件体素网格表示，显著减少存储需求并提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件相机数据存储需求大、真实数据稀缺的问题，以提升事件视觉模型的开发和泛化能力。

Method: 通过V2V方法将视频帧转换为事件体素网格，避免存储密集型事件流生成，支持参数随机化。

Result: 存储需求减少150倍，在52小时视频数据上训练模型，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: V2V方法高效且可扩展，为事件视觉模型提供了大规模训练数据的解决方案。

Abstract: Event-based cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution,
high dynamic range, and low power consumption. However, the massive storage
requirements and I/O burdens of existing synthetic data generation pipelines
and the scarcity of real data prevent event-based training datasets from
scaling up, limiting the development and generalization capabilities of event
vision models. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-to-Voxel (V2V), an
approach that directly converts conventional video frames into event-based
voxel grid representations, bypassing the storage-intensive event stream
generation entirely. V2V enables a 150 times reduction in storage requirements
while supporting on-the-fly parameter randomization for enhanced model
robustness. Leveraging this efficiency, we train several video reconstruction
and optical flow estimation model architectures on 10,000 diverse videos
totaling 52 hours--an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,
yielding substantial improvements.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上验证，轨迹预测准确性显著提升。

Conclusion: SOLVE为更稳健可靠的自动驾驶系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The integration of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) into autonomous driving
systems has shown promise in addressing key challenges such as learning
complexity, interpretability, and common-sense reasoning. However, existing
approaches often struggle with efficient integration and realtime
decision-making due to computational demands. In this paper, we introduce
SOLVE, an innovative framework that synergizes VLMs with end-to-end (E2E)
models to enhance autonomous vehicle planning. Our approach emphasizes
knowledge sharing at the feature level through a shared visual encoder,
enabling comprehensive interaction between VLM and E2E components. We propose a
Trajectory Chain-of-Thought (T-CoT) paradigm, which progressively refines
trajectory predictions, reducing uncertainty and improving accuracy. By
employing a temporal decoupling strategy, SOLVE achieves efficient cooperation
by aligning high-quality VLM outputs with E2E real-time performance. Evaluated
on the nuScenes dataset, our method demonstrates significant improvements in
trajectory prediction accuracy, paving the way for more robust and reliable
autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中MRI模态可能缺失，现有方法假设训练时所有模态可用，导致性能下降。重新训练模型效率低且可能过拟合。

Method: 结合域增量学习（DIL）和超图网络（CHSNet），引入Tversky-Aware Contrastive（TAC）损失函数。

Result: 在BraTS2019数据集上，ReHyDIL优于现有方法，Dice系数提升超过2%。

Conclusion: ReHyDIL有效解决了模态缺失问题，提升了分割性能，且代码开源。

Abstract: Existing methods for multimodal MRI segmentation with missing modalities
typically assume that all MRI modalities are available during training.
However, in clinical practice, some modalities may be missing due to the
sequential nature of MRI acquisition, leading to performance degradation.
Furthermore, retraining models to accommodate newly available modalities can be
inefficient and may cause overfitting, potentially compromising previously
learned knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Replay-based
Hypergraph Domain Incremental Learning (ReHyDIL) for brain tumor segmentation
with missing modalities. ReHyDIL leverages Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) to
enable the segmentation model to learn from newly acquired MRI modalities
without forgetting previously learned information. To enhance segmentation
performance across diverse patient scenarios, we introduce the Cross-Patient
Hypergraph Segmentation Network (CHSNet), which utilizes hypergraphs to capture
high-order associations between patients. Additionally, we incorporate
Tversky-Aware Contrastive (TAC) loss to effectively mitigate information
imbalance both across and within different modalities. Extensive experiments on
the BraTS2019 dataset demonstrate that ReHyDIL outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving an improvement of over 2\% in the Dice Similarity
Coefficient across various tumor regions. Our code is available at ReHyDIL.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in video restoration under rainy
conditions over the past decade, largely propelled by advancements in deep
learning. Nevertheless, existing methods that depend on paired data struggle to
generalize effectively to real-world scenarios, primarily due to the disparity
between synthetic and authentic rain effects. To address these limitations, we
propose a dual-branch spatio-temporal state-space model to enhance rain streak
removal in video sequences. Specifically, we design spatial and temporal
state-space model layers to extract spatial features and incorporate temporal
dependencies across frames, respectively. To improve multi-frame feature
fusion, we derive a dynamic stacking filter, which adaptively approximates
statistical filters for superior pixel-wise feature refinement. Moreover, we
develop a median stacking loss to enable semi-supervised learning by generating
pseudo-clean patches based on the sparsity prior of rain. To further explore
the capacity of deraining models in supporting other vision-based tasks in
rainy environments, we introduce a novel real-world benchmark focused on object
detection and tracking in rainy conditions. Our method is extensively evaluated
across multiple benchmarks containing numerous synthetic and real-world rainy
videos, consistently demonstrating its superiority in quantitative metrics,
visual quality, efficiency, and its utility for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Embodied AI has developed rapidly in recent years, but it is still mainly
deployed in laboratories, with various distortions in the Real-world limiting
its application. Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are
applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no
IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the
perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality
indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for
Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and
meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution
pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2)
established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted
image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision
Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained
and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA,
demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied
AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application
of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world. Project page:

Conclusion: 无需额外训练即可实现角色驱动的叙事生成，扩展了视觉叙事的维度。

Abstract: Recent advances in scene-based video generation have enabled systems to
synthesize coherent visual narratives from structured prompts. However, a
crucial dimension of storytelling -- character-driven dialogue and speech --
remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a modular pipeline that
transforms action-level prompts into visually and auditorily grounded narrative
dialogue, enriching visual storytelling with natural voice and character
expression. Our method takes as input a pair of prompts per scene, where the
first defines the setting and the second specifies a character's behavior.
While a story generation model such as Text2Story generates the corresponding
visual scene, we focus on generating expressive character utterances from these
prompts and the scene image. We apply a pretrained vision-language encoder to
extract a high-level semantic feature from the representative frame, capturing
salient visual context. This feature is then combined with the structured
prompts and used to guide a large language model in synthesizing natural,
character-consistent dialogue. To ensure contextual consistency across scenes,
we introduce a Recursive Narrative Bank that conditions each dialogue
generation on the accumulated dialogue history from prior scenes. This approach
enables characters to speak in ways that reflect their evolving goals and
interactions throughout a story. Finally, we render each utterance as
expressive, character-consistent speech, resulting in fully-voiced video
narratives. Our framework requires no additional training and demonstrates
applicability across a variety of story settings, from fantasy adventures to
slice-of-life episodes.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised
growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains
limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods
often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive
content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale
benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained,
interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel
framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based
reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1)
misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference
alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This
enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those
observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more
complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm
for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding,
reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.

Motivation: 现有自回归视觉语言模型（如LLaVA）在推理速度和可控生成方面表现不佳，离散扩散模型（DMs）在多模态任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: LaViDa通过为DMs配备视觉编码器，并联合微调多模态指令跟随任务，同时引入互补掩码、前缀KV缓存和时间步偏移等新技术。

Result: LaViDa在多模态基准测试（如MMMU）中表现优于或与自回归模型相当，并在COCO字幕任务中超越Open-LLaVa-Next-8B（+4.1 CIDEr，1.92倍加速）。

Conclusion: LaViDa展示了离散扩散模型在多模态任务中的优势，是一种有潜力的替代方案。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve a wide range of tasks
requiring visual reasoning. In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for
VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining
outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR)
VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs)
offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference
and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling.
While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks
is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build
LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the
combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges
encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking
for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep
shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves
competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such
as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible
speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO
captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x
speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained
Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR

Conclusion: PAR框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了高质量的全景图像生成。

Abstract: Recent progress in panoramic image generation has underscored two critical
limitations in existing approaches. First, most methods are built upon
diffusion models, which are inherently ill-suited for equirectangular
projection (ERP) panoramas due to the violation of the identically and
independently distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise assumption caused by their
spherical mapping. Second, these methods often treat text-conditioned
generation (text-to-panorama) and image-conditioned generation (panorama
outpainting) as separate tasks, relying on distinct architectures and
task-specific data. In this work, we propose a unified framework, Panoramic
AutoRegressive model (PAR), which leverages masked autoregressive modeling to
address these challenges. PAR avoids the i.i.d. assumption constraint and
integrates text and image conditioning into a cohesive architecture, enabling
seamless generation across tasks. To address the inherent discontinuity in
existing generative models, we introduce circular padding to enhance spatial
coherence and propose a consistency alignment strategy to improve generation
quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive performance in
text-to-image generation and panorama outpainting tasks while showcasing
promising scalability and generalization capabilities.

TLDR: Jenga是一种新型推理管道，通过动态注意力雕刻和渐进分辨率生成，显著提升了视频扩散模型的推理速度，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散变换器（DiT）模型的计算需求过高，阻碍了其实际部署，主要原因是自注意力的二次复杂性和扩散模型的多步特性。

Method: Jenga结合了动态注意力雕刻（使用3D空间填充曲线动态选择相关令牌交互）和渐进分辨率生成（逐步增加潜在分辨率）。

Result: 实验表明，Jenga在多个先进视频扩散模型中实现了显著加速（8.83倍），且生成质量几乎不变（VBench上性能下降0.01%）。

Conclusion: Jenga是一种即插即用的解决方案，无需重新训练模型，即可将推理时间从分钟级缩短到秒级，实现高质量视频生成。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable generation quality of video Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) models, their practical deployment is severely hindered by extensive
computational requirements. This inefficiency stems from two key challenges:
the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to token length and the
multi-step nature of diffusion models. To address these limitations, we present
Jenga, a novel inference pipeline that combines dynamic attention carving with
progressive resolution generation. Our approach leverages two key insights: (1)
early denoising steps do not require high-resolution latents, and (2) later
steps do not require dense attention. Jenga introduces a block-wise attention
mechanism that dynamically selects relevant token interactions using 3D
space-filling curves, alongside a progressive resolution strategy that
gradually increases latent resolution during generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that Jenga achieves substantial speedups across multiple
state-of-the-art video diffusion models while maintaining comparable generation
quality (8.83$\times$ speedup with 0.01\% performance drop on VBench). As a
plug-and-play solution, Jenga enables practical, high-quality video generation
on modern hardware by reducing inference time from minutes to seconds --
without requiring model retraining. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续后训练可以避免单独模型的成本，但会导致预训练知识遗忘和零样本组合性下降，且缺乏标准化评估协议阻碍了相关研究。

Method: 引入T2I-ConBench，结合自动化指标、人类偏好建模和视觉语言QA，评估十种方法在三种任务序列中的表现。

Result: 发现没有方法在所有方面表现优异，甚至联合“oracle”训练也无法解决所有任务，跨任务泛化仍待解决。

Conclusion: 论文发布了所有数据集、代码和评估工具，以加速文本到图像模型持续后训练的研究。

Abstract: Continual post-training adapts a single text-to-image diffusion model to
learn new tasks without incurring the cost of separate models, but naive
post-training causes forgetting of pretrained knowledge and undermines
zero-shot compositionality. We observe that the absence of a standardized
evaluation protocol hampers related research for continual post-training. To
address this, we introduce T2I-ConBench, a unified benchmark for continual
post-training of text-to-image models. T2I-ConBench focuses on two practical
scenarios, item customization and domain enhancement, and analyzes four
dimensions: (1) retention of generality, (2) target-task performance, (3)
catastrophic forgetting, and (4) cross-task generalization. It combines
automated metrics, human-preference modeling, and vision-language QA for
comprehensive assessment. We benchmark ten representative methods across three
realistic task sequences and find that no approach excels on all fronts. Even
joint "oracle" training does not succeed for every task, and cross-task
generalization remains unsolved. We release all datasets, code, and evaluation
tools to accelerate research in continual post-training for text-to-image
models.

Abstract: Ethological research increasingly benefits from the growing affordability and
accessibility of drones, which enable the capture of high-resolution footage of
animal movement at fine spatial and temporal scales. However, analyzing such
footage presents the technical challenge of separating animal movement from
drone motion. While non-trivial, computer vision techniques such as image
registration and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) offer practical solutions. For
conservationists, open-source tools that are user-friendly, require minimal
setup, and deliver timely results are especially valuable for efficient data
interpretation. This study evaluates three approaches: a bioimaging-based
registration technique, an SfM pipeline, and a hybrid interpolation method. We
apply these to a recorded escape event involving 44 plains zebras, captured in
a single drone video. Using the best-performing method, we extract individual
trajectories and identify key behavioral patterns: increased alignment
(polarization) during escape, a brief widening of spacing just before stopping,
and tighter coordination near the group's center. These insights highlight the
method's effectiveness and its potential to scale to larger datasets,
contributing to broader investigations of collective animal behavior.

Abstract: Driving simulation plays a crucial role in developing reliable driving agents
by providing controlled, evaluative environments. To enable meaningful
assessments, a high-quality driving simulator must satisfy several key
requirements: multi-modal sensing capabilities (e.g., camera and LiDAR) with
realistic scene rendering to minimize observational discrepancies; closed-loop
evaluation to support free-form trajectory behaviors; highly diverse traffic
scenarios for thorough evaluation; multi-agent cooperation to capture
interaction dynamics; and high computational efficiency to ensure affordability
and scalability. However, existing simulators and benchmarks fail to
comprehensively meet these fundamental criteria. To bridge this gap, this paper
introduces RealEngine, a novel driving simulation framework that holistically
integrates 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis techniques to
achieve realistic and flexible closed-loop simulation in the driving context.
By leveraging real-world multi-modal sensor data, RealEngine reconstructs
background scenes and foreground traffic participants separately, allowing for
highly diverse and realistic traffic scenarios through flexible scene
composition. This synergistic fusion of scene reconstruction and view synthesis
enables photorealistic rendering across multiple sensor modalities, ensuring
both perceptual fidelity and geometric accuracy. Building upon this
environment, RealEngine supports three essential driving simulation categories:
non-reactive simulation, safety testing, and multi-agent interaction,
collectively forming a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the
real-world performance of driving agents.

Method: 提出DetailMaster基准，包含四个评估维度（如属性绑定和空间关系），并测试了12个T2I模型。

Result: 现有模型在关键维度上仅达50%准确率，且性能随提示长度增加而下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在结构理解和细节处理上的系统性缺陷，呼吁未来研究改进架构。

Abstract: While recent text-to-image (T2I) models show impressive capabilities in
synthesizing images from brief descriptions, their performance significantly
degrades when confronted with long, detail-intensive prompts required in
professional applications. We present DetailMaster, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate T2I models' systematical abilities
to handle extended textual inputs that contain complex compositional
requirements. Our benchmark introduces four critical evaluation dimensions:
Character Attributes, Structured Character Locations, Multi-Dimensional Scene
Attributes, and Explicit Spatial/Interactive Relationships. The benchmark
comprises long and detail-rich prompts averaging 284.89 tokens, with high
quality validated by expert annotators. Evaluation on 7 general-purpose and 5
long-prompt-optimized T2I models reveals critical performance limitations:
state-of-the-art models achieve merely ~50% accuracy in key dimensions like
attribute binding and spatial reasoning, while all models showing progressive
performance degradation as prompt length increases. Our analysis highlights
systemic failures in structural comprehension and detail overload handling,
motivating future research into architectures with enhanced compositional
reasoning. We open-source the dataset, data curation code, and evaluation tools
to advance detail-rich T2I generation and enable broad applications that would
otherwise be infeasible due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark.

TLDR: 提出了一种高效的光流估计方法，通过改进全对相关体积采样实现低内存和高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理高分辨率图像时存在计算和内存复杂度高的问题，导致细节丢失。

Method: 提出了一种更高效的全对相关体积采样实现，保持与RAFT相同的数学操作。

Result: 在内存使用降低95%的同时，性能与默认实现相当，推理时间节省50%。

Conclusion: 该方法在高分辨率下实现了最先进的精度和效率。

Abstract: Recent optical flow estimation methods often employ local cost sampling from
a dense all-pairs correlation volume. This results in quadratic computational
and memory complexity in the number of pixels. Although an alternative
memory-efficient implementation with on-demand cost computation exists, this is
slower in practice and therefore prior methods typically process images at
reduced resolutions, missing fine-grained details.
  To address this, we propose a more efficient implementation of the all-pairs
correlation volume sampling, still matching the exact mathematical operator as
defined by RAFT. Our approach outperforms on-demand sampling by up to 90% while
maintaining low memory usage, and performs on par with the default
implementation with up to 95% lower memory usage. As cost sampling makes up a
significant portion of the overall runtime, this can translate to up to 50%
savings for the total end-to-end model inference in memory-constrained
environments. Our evaluation of existing methods includes an 8K
ultra-high-resolution dataset and an additional inference-time modification of
the recent SEA-RAFT method. With this, we achieve state-of-the-art results at
high resolutions both in accuracy and efficiency.

TLDR: MedFrameQA是首个专注于医学视觉问答（VQA）中多图像推理的基准数据集，通过自动化流程和多阶段过滤策略构建，包含2,851个VQA对。对十种多模态大模型的评估显示其表现不佳，准确性低于50%，且存在忽略关键信息、错误聚合证据等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学VQA基准多关注单图像分析，而临床诊断通常需要比较多张图像。为模拟这一流程，研究者开发了MedFrameQA。

Method: 1) 自动化流程从医学视频中提取时间连贯的帧并构建逻辑连贯的VQA项；2) 多阶段过滤策略（模型和人工审核）确保数据质量。

Result: 数据集包含2,851个VQA对，覆盖9个人体系统和43个器官。评估显示所有模型表现差（准确性<50%），且错误模式多样。

Conclusion: MedFrameQA有望推动临床多图像推理研究，促进更强大的诊断AI系统发展。

Abstract: Existing medical VQA benchmarks mostly focus on single-image analysis, yet
clinicians almost always compare a series of images before reaching a
diagnosis. To better approximate this workflow, we introduce MedFrameQA -- the
first benchmark that explicitly evaluates multi-image reasoning in medical VQA.
To build MedFrameQA both at scale and in high-quality, we develop 1) an
automated pipeline that extracts temporally coherent frames from medical videos
and constructs VQA items whose content evolves logically across images, and 2)
a multiple-stage filtering strategy, including model-based and manual review,
to preserve data clarity, difficulty, and medical relevance. The resulting
dataset comprises 2,851 VQA pairs (gathered from 9,237 high-quality frames in
3,420 videos), covering nine human body systems and 43 organs; every question
is accompanied by two to five images. We comprehensively benchmark ten advanced
Multimodal LLMs -- both proprietary and open source, with and without explicit
reasoning modules -- on MedFrameQA. The evaluation challengingly reveals that
all models perform poorly, with most accuracies below 50%, and accuracy
fluctuates as the number of images per question increases. Error analysis
further shows that models frequently ignore salient findings, mis-aggregate
evidence across images, and propagate early mistakes through their reasoning
chains; results also vary substantially across body systems, organs, and
modalities. We hope this work can catalyze research on clinically grounded,
multi-image reasoning and accelerate progress toward more capable diagnostic AI
systems.

Result: UniPhy在多样材料和几何形状的模拟轨迹上训练，推断结果比现有方法更准确。

Conclusion: UniPhy在未知材料属性的推断和重新模拟中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose UniPhy, a common latent-conditioned neural constitutive model that
can encode the physical properties of diverse materials. At inference UniPhy
allows `inverse simulation' i.e. inferring material properties by optimizing
the scene-specific latent to match the available observations via
differentiable simulation. In contrast to existing methods that treat such
inference as system identification, UniPhy does not rely on user-specified
material type information. Compared to prior neural constitutive modeling
approaches which learn instance specific networks, the shared training across
materials improves both, robustness and accuracy of the estimates. We train
UniPhy using simulated trajectories across diverse geometries and materials --
elastic, plasticine, sand, and fluids (Newtonian & non-Newtonian). At
inference, given an object with unknown material properties, UniPhy can infer
the material properties via latent optimization to match the motion
observations, and can then allow re-simulating the object under diverse
scenarios. We compare UniPhy against prior inverse simulation methods, and show
that the inference from UniPhy enables more accurate replay and re-simulation
under novel conditions.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) has drawn increasing attention for its
capacity to generalize segmentation beyond predefined categories. However,
existing methods typically predict segmentation masks with simple forward
inference, lacking explicit reasoning and interpretability. This makes it
challenging for OVS model to distinguish similar categories in open-world
settings due to the lack of contextual understanding and discriminative visual
cues. To address this limitation, we propose a step-by-step visual reasoning
framework for open-vocabulary segmentation, named OpenSeg-R. The proposed
OpenSeg-R leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to perform hierarchical
visual reasoning before segmentation. Specifically, we generate both generic
and image-specific reasoning for each image, forming structured triplets that
explain the visual reason for objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on
these reasoning steps, we can compose detailed description prompts, and feed
them to the segmentor to produce more accurate segmentation masks. To the best
of our knowledge, OpenSeg-R is the first framework to introduce explicit
step-by-step visual reasoning into OVS. Experimental results demonstrate that
OpenSeg-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation across five benchmark datasets. Moreover, it achieves
consistent gains across all metrics on open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation.
Qualitative results further highlight the effectiveness of our reasoning-guided
framework in improving both segmentation precision and interpretability. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Hanzy1996/OpenSeg-R.

Conclusion: C-Upscale通过全局-区域先验的结合，解决了高分辨率图像生成中的语义一致性和细节创造性问题。

Abstract: Contemporary diffusion models show remarkable capability in text-to-image
generation, while still being limited to restricted resolutions (e.g., 1,024 X
1,024). Recent advances enable tuning-free higher-resolution image generation
by recycling pre-trained diffusion models and extending them via regional
denoising or dilated sampling/convolutions. However, these models struggle to
simultaneously preserve global semantic structure and produce creative regional
details in higher-resolution images. To address this, we present C-Upscale, a
new recipe of tuning-free image upscaling that pivots on global-regional priors
derived from given global prompt and estimated regional prompts via Multimodal
LLM. Technically, the low-frequency component of low-resolution image is
recognized as global structure prior to encourage global semantic consistency
in high-resolution generation. Next, we perform regional attention control to
screen cross-attention between global prompt and each region during regional
denoising, leading to regional attention prior that alleviates object
repetition issue. The estimated regional prompts containing rich descriptive
details further act as regional semantic prior to fuel the creativity of
regional detail generation. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our C-Upscale manages to generate ultra-high-resolution images
(e.g., 4,096 X 4,096 and 8,192 X 8,192) with higher visual fidelity and more
creative regional details.

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义点匹配和3D感知线索有效改进了扩散模型在虚拟试穿任务中的表现，为细节保留提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown preliminary success in virtual try-on (VTON)
task. The typical dual-branch architecture comprises two UNets for implicit
garment deformation and synthesized image generation respectively, and has
emerged as the recipe for VTON task. Nevertheless, the problem remains
challenging to preserve the shape and every detail of the given garment due to
the intrinsic stochasticity of diffusion model. To alleviate this issue, we
novelly propose to explicitly capitalize on visual correspondence as the prior
to tame diffusion process instead of simply feeding the whole garment into UNet
as the appearance reference. Specifically, we interpret the fine-grained
appearance and texture details as a set of structured semantic points, and
match the semantic points rooted in garment to the ones over target person
through local flow warping. Such 2D points are then augmented into 3D-aware
cues with depth/normal map of target person. The correspondence mimics the way
of putting clothing on human body and the 3D-aware cues act as semantic point
matching to supervise diffusion model training. A point-focused diffusion loss
is further devised to fully take the advantage of semantic point matching.
Extensive experiments demonstrate strong garment detail preservation of our
approach, evidenced by state-of-the-art VTON performances on both VITON-HD and
DressCode datasets. Code is publicly available at:

Result: 在VVT数据集上VFID得分为0.506，比现有方法GPD-VVTO提升了60.5%。

Conclusion: DPIDM通过动态姿态交互显著提升了视频虚拟试穿的效果和一致性。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly dress a subject in a video with a
specific garment. The primary challenge involves preserving the visual
authenticity of the garment while dynamically adapting to the pose and physique
of the subject. While existing methods have predominantly focused on
image-based virtual try-on, extending these techniques directly to videos often
results in temporal inconsistencies. Most current video virtual try-on
approaches alleviate this challenge by incorporating temporal modules, yet
still overlook the critical spatiotemporal pose interactions between human and
garment. Effective pose interactions in videos should not only consider spatial
alignment between human and garment poses in each frame but also account for
the temporal dynamics of human poses throughout the entire video. With such
motivation, we propose a new framework, namely Dynamic Pose Interaction
Diffusion Models (DPIDM), to leverage diffusion models to delve into dynamic
pose interactions for video virtual try-on. Technically, DPIDM introduces a
skeleton-based pose adapter to integrate synchronized human and garment poses
into the denoising network. A hierarchical attention module is then exquisitely
designed to model intra-frame human-garment pose interactions and long-term
human pose dynamics across frames through pose-aware spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms. Moreover, DPIDM capitalizes on a temporal regularized
attention loss between consecutive frames to enhance temporal consistency.
Extensive experiments conducted on VITON-HD, VVT and ViViD datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our DPIDM against the baseline methods. Notably, DPIDM
achieves VFID score of 0.506 on VVT dataset, leading to 60.5% improvement over
the state-of-the-art GPD-VVTO approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用多为多模态，但现有研究集中于单模态图像数据，缺乏对未知数据的监督信号，导致OOD样本预测过度自信。

Method: 提出Feature Mixing方法，通过多模态异常合成优化模型对ID和OOD数据的区分能力，方法简单快速且适用于多种模态组合。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，Feature Mixing性能达到SOTA，速度提升10至370倍。

Conclusion: Feature Mixing是一种高效的多模态OOD检测方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and segmentation are crucial for
deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as
autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery. While prior research has
primarily focused on unimodal image data, real-world applications are
inherently multimodal, requiring the integration of multiple modalities for
improved OOD detection. A key challenge is the lack of supervision signals from
unknown data, leading to overconfident predictions on OOD samples. To address
this challenge, we propose Feature Mixing, an extremely simple and fast method
for multimodal outlier synthesis with theoretical support, which can be further
optimized to help the model better distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD data. Feature Mixing is modality-agnostic and applicable to various
modality combinations. Additionally, we introduce CARLA-OOD, a novel multimodal
dataset for OOD segmentation, featuring synthetic OOD objects across diverse
scenes and weather conditions. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI,
nuScenes, CARLA-OOD datasets, and the MultiOOD benchmark demonstrate that
Feature Mixing achieves state-of-the-art performance with a $10 \times$ to $370

TLDR: Dimple是首个离散扩散多模态大语言模型（DMLLM），通过结合自回归和扩散训练范式，性能超越LLaVA-NEXT 3.9%，并提出自信解码策略提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纯离散扩散方法导致的训练不稳定、性能不佳和长度偏差问题。

Method: 设计结合自回归和扩散阶段的训练范式，提出自信解码策略和预填充技术。

Result: Dimple-7B性能超越LLaVA-NEXT 3.9%，推理效率提升，响应长度控制更灵活。

Conclusion: 验证了DMLLM的可行性及优势，提升了推理效率和可控性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose Dimple, the first Discrete Diffusion Multimodal
Large Language Model (DMLLM). We observe that training with a purely discrete
diffusion approach leads to significant training instability, suboptimal
performance, and severe length bias issues. To address these challenges, we
design a novel training paradigm that combines an initial autoregressive phase
with a subsequent diffusion phase. This approach yields the Dimple-7B model,
trained on the same dataset and using a similar training pipeline as
LLaVA-NEXT. Dimple-7B ultimately surpasses LLaVA-NEXT in performance by 3.9%,
demonstrating that DMLLM can achieve performance comparable to that of
autoregressive models. To improve inference efficiency, we propose a decoding
strategy termed confident decoding, which dynamically adjusts the number of
tokens generated at each step, significantly reducing the number of generation
iterations. In autoregressive models, the number of forward iterations during
generation equals the response length. With confident decoding, however, the
number of iterations needed by Dimple is even only $\frac{\text{response
length}}{3}$. We also re-implement the prefilling technique in autoregressive
models and demonstrate that it does not significantly impact performance on
most benchmark evaluations, while offering a speedup of 1.5x to 7x.
Additionally, we explore Dimple's capability to precisely control its response
using structure priors. These priors enable structured responses in a manner
distinct from instruction-based or chain-of-thought prompting, and allow
fine-grained control over response format and length, which is difficult to
achieve in autoregressive models. Overall, this work validates the feasibility
and advantages of DMLLM and enhances its inference efficiency and
controllability. Code and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型ASR模型在低资源设备上部署不切实际，现有方法（如剪枝、蒸馏等）要么性能下降明显，要么需要长时间训练小型模型。

Method: 采用两步表示学习方法，从单一大型模型中生成多个小型模型，确保在有限训练周期内获得更好性能。

Result: 在ASR基准测试中，实现了三倍训练速度提升和最高12.54%的词错误率改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型ASR模型部署问题，同时提升了性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Recent advancement in deep learning encouraged developing large automatic
speech recognition (ASR) models that achieve promising results while ignoring
computational and memory constraints. However, deploying such models on low
resource devices is impractical despite of their favorable performance.
Existing approaches (pruning, distillation, layer skip etc.) transform the
large models into smaller ones at the cost of significant performance
degradation or require prolonged training of smaller models for better
performance. To address these issues, we introduce an efficacious two-step
representation learning based approach capable of producing several small sized
models from a single large model ensuring considerably better performance in
limited number of epochs. Comprehensive experimentation on ASR benchmarks
reveals the efficacy of our approach, achieving three-fold training speed-up
and up to 12.54% word error rate improvement.

Conclusion: 为原生主干级分割提供了新范式，兼具高效性和零样本能力。

Abstract: Uniform downsampling remains the de facto standard for reducing spatial
resolution in vision backbones. In this work, we propose an alternative design
built around a content-aware spatial grouping layer, that dynamically assigns
tokens to a reduced set based on image boundaries and their semantic content.
Stacking our grouping layer across consecutive backbone stages results in
hierarchical segmentation that arises natively in the feature extraction
process, resulting in our coined Native Segmentation Vision Transformer. We
show that a careful design of our architecture enables the emergence of strong
segmentation masks solely from grouping layers, that is, without additional
segmentation-specific heads. This sets the foundation for a new paradigm of
native, backbone-level segmentation, which enables strong zero-shot results
without mask supervision, as well as a minimal and efficient standalone model
design for downstream segmentation tasks. Our project page is

Abstract: This paper studies the task of SatStreet-view synthesis, which aims to render
photorealistic street-view panorama images and videos given any satellite image
and specified camera positions or trajectories. We formulate to learn neural
radiance field from paired images captured from satellite and street
viewpoints, which comes to be a challenging learning problem due to the
sparse-view natural and the extremely-large viewpoint changes between satellite
and street-view images. We tackle the challenges based on a task-specific
observation that street-view specific elements, including the sky and
illumination effects are only visible in street-view panoramas, and present a
novel approach Sat2Density++ to accomplish the goal of photo-realistic
street-view panoramas rendering by modeling these street-view specific in
neural networks. In the experiments, our method is testified on both urban and
suburban scene datasets, demonstrating that Sat2Density++ is capable of
rendering photorealistic street-view panoramas that are consistent across
multiple views and faithful to the satellite image.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了人脸-声音关联的性能。

Abstract: We study the task of learning association between faces and voices, which is
gaining interest in the multimodal community lately. These methods suffer from
the deliberate crafting of negative mining procedures as well as the reliance
on the distant margin parameter. These issues are addressed by learning a joint
embedding space in which orthogonality constraints are applied to the fused
embeddings of faces and voices. However, embedding spaces of faces and voices
possess different characteristics and require spaces to be aligned before
fusing them. To this end, we propose a method that accurately aligns the
embedding spaces and fuses them with an enhanced gated fusion thereby improving
the performance of face-voice association. Extensive experiments on the
VoxCeleb dataset reveals the merits of the proposed approach.

TLDR: CoMo提出了一种从互联网视频中学习连续运动表示的方法，解决了现有离散方法的局限性，并通过新指标和零样本泛化能力提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散潜在动作方法存在信息丢失问题，难以处理复杂和细粒度的动态，因此需要更有效的连续运动表示学习方法。

Method: CoMo采用早期时间特征差异机制防止模型崩溃，抑制静态外观噪声，并通过信息瓶颈原则约束潜在运动嵌入维度。

Result: CoMo在零样本泛化中表现优异，能够为未见过的视频域生成连续伪动作，提升策略联合学习的性能。

Conclusion: CoMo通过连续运动表示和新评估指标，显著提升了运动学习的效果，适用于多种视频数据集和实际场景。

Abstract: Learning latent motion from Internet videos is crucial for building
generalist robots. However, existing discrete latent action methods suffer from
information loss and struggle with complex and fine-grained dynamics. We
propose CoMo, which aims to learn more informative continuous motion
representations from diverse, internet-scale videos. CoMo employs a early
temporal feature difference mechanism to prevent model collapse and suppress
static appearance noise, effectively discouraging shortcut learning problem.
Furthermore, guided by the information bottleneck principle, we constrain the
latent motion embedding dimensionality to achieve a better balance between
retaining sufficient action-relevant information and minimizing the inclusion
of action-irrelevant appearance noise. Additionally, we also introduce two new
metrics for more robustly and affordably evaluating motion and guiding motion
learning methods development: (i) the linear probing MSE of action prediction,
and (ii) the cosine similarity between past-to-current and future-to-current
motion embeddings. Critically, CoMo exhibits strong zero-shot generalization,
enabling it to generate continuous pseudo actions for previously unseen video
domains. This capability facilitates unified policy joint learning using pseudo
actions derived from various action-less video datasets (such as
cross-embodiment videos and, notably, human demonstration videos), potentially
augmented with limited labeled robot data. Extensive experiments show that
policies co-trained with CoMo pseudo actions achieve superior performance with
both diffusion and autoregressive architectures in simulated and real-world
settings.

Motivation: 人工分析岩石薄片的矿物学特征主观且耗时，现有技术如QEMSCAN成本高且耗时长，需一种更高效、低成本的自动化方法。

Method: 使用U-Net语义分割架构，基于平面和交叉偏振薄片图像训练，以QEMSCAN映射为目标，区分多种矿物类别。

Result: 模型在矿物边界划分和分布预测上表现良好，R²值在已知和未知岩相中分别超过0.97和0.88。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了高效且低成本的矿物分割潜力，但分割质量受图像分辨率和岩石纹理多样性影响。

Abstract: Interpreting the mineralogical aspects of rock thin sections is an important
task for oil and gas reservoirs evaluation. However, human analysis tend to be
subjective and laborious. Technologies like QEMSCAN(R) are designed to automate
the mineralogical mapping process, but also suffer from limitations like high
monetary costs and time-consuming analysis. This work proposes a Convolutional
Neural Network model for automatic mineralogical segmentation of thin section
images of carbonate rocks. The model is able to mimic the QEMSCAN mapping
itself in a low-cost, generalized and efficient manner. For this, the U-Net
semantic segmentation architecture is trained on plane and cross polarized thin
section images using the corresponding QEMSCAN maps as target, which is an
approach not widely explored. The model was instructed to differentiate
occurrences of Calcite, Dolomite, Mg-Clay Minerals, Quartz, Pores and the
remaining mineral phases as an unique class named "Others", while it was
validated on rock facies both seen and unseen during training, in order to
address its generalization capability. Since the images and maps are provided
in different resolutions, image registration was applied to align then
spatially. The study reveals that the quality of the segmentation is very much
dependent on these resolution differences and on the variety of learnable rock
textures. However, it shows promising results, especially with regard to the
proper delineation of minerals boundaries on solid textures and precise
estimation of the minerals distributions, describing a nearly linear
relationship between expected and predicted distributions, with coefficient of
determination (R^2) superior to 0.97 for seen facies and 0.88 for unseen.

Motivation: 解决视频建模中固定标记分配导致的效率低下问题，实现内容感知的动态标记分配。

Result: 在UCF-101和Kinetics-600上显著提升重建质量和生成性能。

Conclusion: AdapTok在可控预算下实现了高效、可扩展的视频生成建模。

Abstract: We propose AdapTok, an adaptive temporal causal video tokenizer that can
flexibly allocate tokens for different frames based on video content. AdapTok
is equipped with a block-wise masking strategy that randomly drops tail tokens
of each block during training, and a block causal scorer to predict the
reconstruction quality of video frames using different numbers of tokens.
During inference, an adaptive token allocation strategy based on integer linear
programming is further proposed to adjust token usage given predicted scores.
Such design allows for sample-wise, content-aware, and temporally dynamic token
allocation under a controllable overall budget. Extensive experiments for video
reconstruction and generation on UCF-101 and Kinetics-600 demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Without additional image data, AdapTok
consistently improves reconstruction quality and generation performance under
different token budgets, allowing for more scalable and token-efficient
generative video modeling.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive success in

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced in visual
tasks, yet their spatial understanding remains limited to single images,
leaving them ill-suited for robotics and other real-world applications that
require multi-frame reasoning. In this paper, we propose a framework to equip
MLLMs with robust multi-frame spatial understanding by integrating depth
perception, visual correspondence, and dynamic perception. Central to our
approach is the MultiSPA dataset, a novel, large-scale collection of more than
27 million samples spanning diverse 3D and 4D scenes. Alongside MultiSPA, we
introduce a comprehensive benchmark that tests a wide spectrum of spatial tasks
under uniform metrics. Our resulting model, Multi-SpatialMLLM, achieves
significant gains over baselines and proprietary systems, demonstrating
scalable, generalizable multi-frame reasoning. We further observe multi-task
benefits and early indications of emergent capabilities in challenging
scenarios, and showcase how our model can serve as a multi-frame reward
annotator for robotics.

Abstract: Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central
to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image
generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents
unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass
ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and
designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler
rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these
explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific
challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this
gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO
algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain
performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of
different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal
that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward
models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially
enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore,
we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both
their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into
efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a
new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms
to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image
generation. Code is released at

Result: SophiaVL-R1在多个基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越参数更多的模型。

Conclusion: 通过监督思考过程和优化奖励机制，显著提升了模型的推理和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown success in eliciting strong reasoning abilities in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through rule-based reinforcement
learning (RL) with outcome rewards. However, this paradigm typically lacks
supervision over the thinking process leading to the final outcome.As a result,
the model may learn sub-optimal reasoning strategies, which can hinder its
generalization ability. In light of this, we propose SophiaVL-R1, as an attempt
to add reward signals for the thinking process in this paradigm. To achieve
this, we first train a thinking reward model that evaluates the quality of the
entire thinking process. Given that the thinking reward may be unreliable for
certain samples due to reward hacking, we propose the Trust-GRPO method, which
assigns a trustworthiness weight to the thinking reward during training. This
weight is computed based on the thinking reward comparison of responses leading
to correct answers versus incorrect answers, helping to mitigate the impact of
potentially unreliable thinking rewards. Moreover, we design an annealing
training strategy that gradually reduces the thinking reward over time,
allowing the model to rely more on the accurate rule-based outcome reward in
later training stages. Experiments show that our SophiaVL-R1 surpasses a series
of reasoning MLLMs on various benchmarks (e.g., MathVisita, MMMU),
demonstrating strong reasoning and generalization capabilities. Notably, our
SophiaVL-R1-7B even outperforms LLaVA-OneVision-72B on most benchmarks, despite
the latter having 10 times more parameters. All code, models, and datasets are

Result: LAD在英文和中文图像隐喻基准测试中表现优异，性能接近GPT-4o并在某些任务上超越。

Conclusion: LAD为AI图像隐喻理解提供了新思路，推动了视觉语言推理和人机交互的发展。

Abstract: Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for AI
systems, as existing models struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional,
and contextual implications embedded in visual content. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) excel in basic Visual Question Answer (VQA) tasks, they
struggle with a fundamental limitation on image implication tasks: contextual
gaps that obscure the relationships between different visual elements and their
abstract meanings. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Let
Androids Dream (LAD), a novel framework for image implication understanding and
reasoning. LAD addresses contextual missing through the three-stage framework:
(1) Perception: converting visual information into rich and multi-level textual
representations, (2) Search: iteratively searching and integrating cross-domain
knowledge to resolve ambiguity, and (3) Reasoning: generating context-alignment
image implication via explicit reasoning. Our framework with the lightweight
GPT-4o-mini model achieves SOTA performance compared to 15+ MLLMs on English
image implication benchmark and a huge improvement on Chinese benchmark,
performing comparable with the GPT-4o model on Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ)
and outperforms 36.7% on Open-Style Question (OSQ). Additionally, our work
provides new insights into how AI can more effectively interpret image
implications, advancing the field of vision-language reasoning and human-AI

Result: 在多种视频LMM基准测试中，尽管使用更少计算资源，性能仍达到或超过现有方法。

Conclusion: CrossLMM通过高效令牌压缩和双交叉注意力机制，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了性能。

Abstract: The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has significantly enhanced Large
Language Models (LLMs) to process and interpret diverse data modalities (e.g.,
image and video). However, as input complexity increases, particularly with
long video sequences, the number of required tokens has grown significantly,
leading to quadratically computational costs. This has made the efficient
compression of video tokens in LMMs, while maintaining performance integrity, a
pressing research challenge. In this paper, we introduce CrossLMM, decoupling
long video sequences from LMMs via a dual cross-attention mechanism, which
substantially reduces visual token quantity with minimal performance
degradation. Specifically, we first implement a significant token reduction
from pretrained visual encoders through a pooling methodology. Then, within LLM
layers, we employ a visual-to-visual cross-attention mechanism, wherein the
pooled visual tokens function as queries against the original visual token set.
This module enables more efficient token utilization while retaining
fine-grained informational fidelity. In addition, we introduce a text-to-visual
cross-attention mechanism, for which the text tokens are enhanced through
interaction with the original visual tokens, enriching the visual comprehension
of the text tokens. Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that our
approach achieves comparable or superior performance across diverse video-based
LMM benchmarks, despite utilizing substantially fewer computational resources.

TLDR: GoT-R1是一个通过强化学习增强视觉生成中语义-空间推理的框架，显著提升了复杂文本提示下的图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉生成模型在处理复杂提示（涉及多对象精确空间关系和属性）时表现不佳，需要更有效的语义-空间推理能力。

Method: GoT-R1基于强化学习，采用双阶段多维奖励框架，利用MLLMs评估推理过程和最终输出，统一监督语义对齐、空间准确性和视觉质量。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench基准测试中表现显著提升，尤其在涉及精确空间关系和属性绑定的组合任务中。

Conclusion: GoT-R1通过将复杂推理能力引入视觉生成领域，推动了图像生成技术的进步，并公开了代码和预训练模型以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Visual generation models have made remarkable progress in creating realistic
images from text prompts, yet struggle with complex prompts that specify
multiple objects with precise spatial relationships and attributes. Effective
handling of such prompts requires explicit reasoning about the semantic content
and spatial layout. We present GoT-R1, a framework that applies reinforcement
learning to enhance semantic-spatial reasoning in visual generation. Building
upon the Generation Chain-of-Thought approach, GoT-R1 enables models to
autonomously discover effective reasoning strategies beyond predefined
templates through carefully designed reinforcement learning. To achieve this,
we propose a dual-stage multi-dimensional reward framework that leverages MLLMs
to evaluate both the reasoning process and final output, enabling effective
supervision across the entire generation pipeline. The reward system assesses
semantic alignment, spatial accuracy, and visual quality in a unified approach.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements on T2I-CompBench
benchmark, particularly in compositional tasks involving precise spatial
relationships and attribute binding. GoT-R1 advances the state-of-the-art in
image generation by successfully transferring sophisticated reasoning
capabilities to the visual generation domain. To facilitate future research, we
make our code and pretrained models publicly available at

Motivation: 利用Gaia DR3首次发布的丰富数据（如低分辨率光谱、光变曲线等），探索多源数据结合在变异性研究中的潜力。

Method: 使用三个VAE分别处理低分辨率光谱、G波段光度差分布和折叠光变曲线，生成15维潜在空间表示。

Result: 潜在空间能有效区分主要变异性类别，并揭示与天体物理性质相关的密集区域。

Conclusion: 该方法在分类、聚类和异常检测任务中表现出色，展示了多源数据结合的强大协同效应。

Abstract: Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) published for the first time epoch photometry,
BP/RP (XP) low-resolution mean spectra, and supervised classification results
for millions of variable sources. This extensive dataset offers a unique
opportunity to study their variability by combining multiple Gaia data
products. In preparation for DR4, we propose and evaluate a machine learning
methodology capable of ingesting multiple Gaia data products to achieve an
unsupervised classification of stellar and quasar variability. A dataset of 4
million Gaia DR3 sources is used to train three variational autoencoders (VAE),
which are artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed for data compression and
generation. One VAE is trained on Gaia XP low-resolution spectra, another on a
novel approach based on the distribution of magnitude differences in the Gaia G
band, and the third on folded Gaia G band light curves. Each Gaia source is
compressed into 15 numbers, representing the coordinates in a 15-dimensional
latent space generated by combining the outputs of these three models. The
learned latent representation produced by the ANN effectively distinguishes
between the main variability classes present in Gaia DR3, as demonstrated
through both supervised and unsupervised classification analysis of the latent
space. The results highlight a strong synergy between light curves and
low-resolution spectral data, emphasising the benefits of combining the
different Gaia data products. A two-dimensional projection of the latent
variables reveals numerous overdensities, most of which strongly correlate with
astrophysical properties, showing the potential of this latent space for
astrophysical discovery. We show that the properties of our novel latent
representation make it highly valuable for variability analysis tasks,
including classification, clustering and outlier detection.

Abstract: Foundation models leveraging vision-language pretraining have shown promise
in chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation, yet their real-world performance across
diverse populations and diagnostic tasks remains insufficiently evaluated. This
study benchmarks the diagnostic performance and generalizability of foundation
models versus traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on multinational
CXR datasets. We evaluated eight CXR diagnostic models - five vision-language
foundation models and three CNN-based architectures - across 37 standardized
classification tasks using six public datasets from the USA, Spain, India, and
Vietnam, and three private datasets from hospitals in China. Performance was
assessed using AUROC, AUPRC, and other metrics across both shared and
dataset-specific tasks. Foundation models outperformed CNNs in both accuracy
and task coverage. MAVL, a model incorporating knowledge-enhanced prompts and
structured supervision, achieved the highest performance on public (mean AUROC:
0.82; AUPRC: 0.32) and private (mean AUROC: 0.95; AUPRC: 0.89) datasets,
ranking first in 14 of 37 public and 3 of 4 private tasks. All models showed
reduced performance on pediatric cases, with average AUROC dropping from 0.88
+/- 0.18 in adults to 0.57 +/- 0.29 in children (p = 0.0202). These findings
highlight the value of structured supervision and prompt design in radiologic

Abstract: The task of inverting real images into StyleGAN's latent space to manipulate
their attributes has been extensively studied. However, existing GAN inversion
methods struggle to balance high reconstruction quality, effective editability,

efficient single-stage encoder-based approach for GAN inversion and editing

Specifically, our approach integrates VSSMs within the proposed architecture,
enabling high-quality image inversion and flexible editing with significantly
fewer parameters and reduced computational complexity compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments show that MambaStyle achieves a
superior balance among inversion accuracy, editing quality, and computational

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NICU中的永久磁体扫描仪因低信噪比和有限接收线圈导致扫描时间长，影响对患病婴儿的早期脑部异常评估。

Method: 通过修改网络架构支持不同分辨率、使用类别嵌入向量训练单一模型、自监督去噪预处理以及后验样本平均重建，提出了一种新的训练流程。

Result: 结合所有数据、去噪预训练和后验样本平均，显著改善了重建质量，临床研究表明1.5倍欠采样数据的重建图像可用于临床。

Conclusion: 扩散概率生成模型结合提出的训练流程，可有效减少NICU中新生儿MRI的扫描时间。

Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive assessment of
brain abnormalities during early life development. Permanent magnet scanners
operating in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) facilitate MRI of sick
infants, but have long scan times due to lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and
limited receive coils. This work accelerates in-NICU MRI with diffusion
probabilistic generative models by developing a training pipeline accounting
for these challenges.
  Methods: We establish a novel training dataset of clinical, 1 Tesla neonatal
MR images in collaboration with Aspect Imaging and Sha'are Zedek Medical
Center. We propose a pipeline to handle the low quantity and SNR of our
real-world dataset (1) modifying existing network architectures to support
varying resolutions; (2) training a single model on all data with learned class
embedding vectors; (3) applying self-supervised denoising before training; and
(4) reconstructing by averaging posterior samples. Retrospective under-sampling
experiments, accounting for signal decay, evaluated each item of our proposed
methodology. A clinical reader study with practicing pediatric
neuroradiologists evaluated our proposed images reconstructed from 1.5x
under-sampled data.
  Results: Combining all data, denoising pre-training, and averaging posterior
samples yields quantitative improvements in reconstruction. The generative
model decouples the learned prior from the measurement model and functions at
two acceleration rates without re-training. The reader study suggests that
proposed images reconstructed from approximately 1.5x under-sampled data are
adequate for clinical use.
  Conclusion: Diffusion probabilistic generative models applied with the
proposed pipeline to handle challenging real-world datasets could reduce scan
time of in-NICU neonatal MRI.

Motivation: 现有扰动技术缺乏深入理解，过度或不适当扰动可能带来负面影响，需解决如何通过标记数据引导未标记数据学习及边界区域预测准确性问题。

Method: 提出P3M机制动态调整扰动，结合边界聚焦损失提升模型对边界区域的敏感性。

Result: 在两个2D和3D数据集上达到最优性能，P3M可扩展至其他方法，边界损失可作为通用工具提升现有方法。

Conclusion: P3M和边界损失方法具有可扩展性和适用性，为半监督医学图像分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Perturbation with diverse unlabeled data has proven beneficial for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS). While many works have
successfully used various perturbation techniques, a deeper understanding of
learning perturbations is needed. Excessive or inappropriate perturbation can
have negative effects, so we aim to address two challenges: how to use
perturbation mechanisms to guide the learning of unlabeled data through labeled
data, and how to ensure accurate predictions in boundary regions. Inspired by
human progressive and periodic learning, we propose a progressive and periodic
perturbation mechanism (P3M) and a boundary-focused loss. P3M enables dynamic
adjustment of perturbations, allowing the model to gradually learn them. Our
boundary-focused loss encourages the model to concentrate on boundary regions,
enhancing sensitivity to intricate details and ensuring accurate predictions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two 2D and 3D datasets. Moreover, P3M is extendable to other
methods, and the proposed loss serves as a universal tool for improving
existing methods, highlighting the scalability and applicability of our
approach.

individual and hybrid datasets. The results showed superior performance on the
hybrid dataset, with VGG16, Xception, ResNet50V2, and DenseNet121 each
achieving an accuracy of 99%. This consistent performance across the hybrid
dataset highlights the robustness of these models in handling diverse data

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像压缩中需要多步采样和针对不同比特率训练多个模型，计算和存储成本高。

Method: 将压缩潜在表示视为原始潜在表示的噪声变体，并通过伪扩散时间步映射比特率，使用单一生成模型支持多比特率重建。

Result: OSCAR在定量和视觉质量指标上表现优异，且推理效率显著提升。

Conclusion: OSCAR是一种高效且性能优越的扩散图像压缩方法。

Abstract: Pretrained latent diffusion models have shown strong potential for lossy
image compression, owing to their powerful generative priors. Most existing
diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random
noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have
achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs
substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training
separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant
training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step
diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our
method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents,
where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows
them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By
establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion
timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at
multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich
structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR
replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly
improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR
achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics.

Result: 在超低码率下优于VVC标准和生成式压缩方案，且无需额外处理即可实现交互式编码。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来元宇宙中的数字人交互通信提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose to compress human body video with interactive
semantics, which can facilitate video coding to be interactive and controllable
by manipulating semantic-level representations embedded in the coded bitstream.
In particular, the proposed encoder employs a 3D human model to disentangle
nonlinear dynamics and complex motion of human body signal into a series of
configurable embeddings, which are controllably edited, compactly compressed,
and efficiently transmitted. Moreover, the proposed decoder can evolve the
mesh-based motion fields from these decoded semantics to realize the
high-quality human body video reconstruction. Experimental results illustrate
that the proposed framework can achieve promising compression performance for
human body videos at ultra-low bitrate ranges compared with the
state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and the
latest generative compression schemes. Furthermore, the proposed framework
enables interactive human body video coding without any additional
pre-/post-manipulation processes, which is expected to shed light on
metaverse-related digital human communication in the future.

Method: GLC在生成式向量量化变分自编码器（VQ-VAE）的潜在空间中进行变换编码，并引入空间分类超模块和时空分类超模块以提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，GLC在超低比特率下表现出色：GLC-image在CLIC 2020测试集上比特率低于0.04 bpp，且比MS-ILLM节省45%比特率；GLC-video在DISTS指标上比PLVC节省65.3%比特率。

Conclusion: GLC通过潜在空间编码和优化模块，显著提升了图像和视频压缩的性能，尤其在超低比特率下表现优异。

Abstract: Most existing approaches for image and video compression perform transform
coding in the pixel space to reduce redundancy. However, due to the
misalignment between the pixel-space distortion and human perception, such
schemes often face the difficulties in achieving both high-realism and
high-fidelity at ultra-low bitrate. To solve this problem, we propose
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{L}atent \textbf{C}oding (\textbf{GLC}) models for
image and video compression, termed GLC-image and GLC-Video. The transform
coding of GLC is conducted in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized
variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE). Compared to the pixel-space, such a latent
space offers greater sparsity, richer semantics and better alignment with human
perception, and show its advantages in achieving high-realism and high-fidelity
compression. To further enhance performance, we improve the hyper prior by
introducing a spatial categorical hyper module in GLC-image and a
spatio-temporal categorical hyper module in GLC-video. Additionally, the
code-prediction-based loss function is proposed to enhance the semantic
consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our scheme shows high visual quality
at ultra-low bitrate for both image and video compression. For image
compression, GLC-image achieves an impressive bitrate of less than $0.04$ bpp,
achieving the same FID as previous SOTA model MS-ILLM while using $45\%$ fewer
bitrate on the CLIC 2020 test set. For video compression, GLC-video achieves
65.3\% bitrate saving over PLVC in terms of DISTS.

Conclusion: PCMamba通过结合物理成像过程和Mamba的线性复杂度，实现了高效且高质量的高光谱重建，为DCCHI提供了新的理论和技术支持。

Abstract: Panchromatic (PAN) -assisted Dual-Camera Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging
(DCCHI) is a key technology in snapshot hyperspectral imaging. Existing
research primarily focuses on exploring spectral information from 2D
compressive measurements and spatial information from PAN images in an explicit
manner, leading to a bottleneck in HSI reconstruction. Various physical
factors, such as temperature, emissivity, and multiple reflections between
objects, play a critical role in the process of a sensor acquiring
hyperspectral thermal signals. Inspired by this, we attempt to investigate the
interrelationships between physical properties to provide deeper theoretical
insights for HSI reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a Physics-Informed
Cross-Modal State Space Model Network (PCMamba) for DCCHI, which incorporates
the forward physical imaging process of HSI into the linear complexity of Mamba
to facilitate lightweight and high-quality HSI reconstruction. Specifically, we
analyze the imaging process of hyperspectral thermal signals to enable the
network to disentangle the three key physical properties-temperature,
emissivity, and texture. By fully exploiting the potential information embedded
in 2D measurements and PAN images, the HSIs are reconstructed through a
physics-driven synthesis process. Furthermore, we design a Cross-Modal Scanning
Mamba Block (CSMB) that introduces inter-modal pixel-wise interaction with
positional inductive bias by cross-scanning the backbone features and PAN
features. Extensive experiments conducted on both real and simulated datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both
quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Conclusion: 提出计算语义分析可作为跨学科研究的桥梁，为其他争议性定义问题提供新方法。

Abstract: The question of "what is life?" has challenged scientists and philosophers
for centuries, producing an array of definitions that reflect both the mystery
of its emergence and the diversity of disciplinary perspectives brought to bear
on the question. Despite significant progress in our understanding of
biological systems, psychology, computation, and information theory, no single
definition for life has yet achieved universal acceptance. This challenge
becomes increasingly urgent as advances in synthetic biology, artificial
intelligence, and astrobiology challenge our traditional conceptions of what it
means to be alive. We undertook a methodological approach that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to analyze a set of definitions of life provided by a
curated set of cross-disciplinary experts. We used a novel pairwise correlation
analysis to map the definitions into distinct feature vectors, followed by
agglomerative clustering, intra-cluster semantic analysis, and t-SNE projection
to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. This methodology revealed a
continuous landscape of the themes relating to the definition of life,
suggesting that what has historically been approached as a binary taxonomic
problem should be instead conceived as differentiated perspectives within a
unified conceptual latent space. We offer a new methodological bridge between
reductionist and holistic approaches to fundamental questions in science and
philosophy, demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal
conceptual patterns across disciplinary boundaries, and opening similar
pathways for addressing other contested definitional territories across the
sciences.

Abstract: This paper elaborates on the concept of moral exercises as a means to help AI
actors cultivate virtues that enable effective human oversight of AI systems.
We explore the conceptual framework and significance of moral exercises,
situating them within the contexts of philosophical discourse, ancient
practices, and contemporary AI ethics scholarship. We outline the core pillars
of the moral exercises methodology - eliciting an engaged personal disposition,
fostering relational understanding, and cultivating technomoral wisdom - and
emphasize their relevance to key activities and competencies essential for
human oversight of AI systems. Our argument is supported by findings from three
pilot studies involving a company, a multidisciplinary team of AI researchers,

TLDR: 研究分析了纽约州和纽约市房地产所有权模式的种族差异，发现白人持有不成比例的财产，而少数族裔在财产所有权中代表性不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示房地产所有权中的种族不平等，反映历史和社会经济因素。

Method: 使用LSTM+Geo与XGBoost过滤的种族/族裔估算模型，对比预测的财产所有者种族构成与人口普查数据。

Result: 白人持有财产比例过高，少数族裔社区所有权不足，企业所有权加剧了这种差距。

Conclusion: 研究强调了财产所有权中的种族不平等，需数据驱动方法解决。

Abstract: This study analyzes tract-level real estate ownership patterns in New York
State (NYS) and New York City (NYC) to uncover racial disparities. We use an
advanced race/ethnicity imputation model (LSTM+Geo with XGBoost filtering,
validated at 89.2% accuracy) to compare the predicted racial composition of
property owners to the resident population from census data. We examine both a
Full Model (statewide) and a Name-Only LSTM Model (NYC) to assess how
incorporating geospatial context affects our predictions and disparity
estimates. The results reveal significant inequities: White individuals hold a
disproportionate share of properties and property value relative to their
population, while Black, Hispanic, and Asian communities are underrepresented
as property owners. These disparities are most pronounced in minority-majority
neighborhoods, where ownership is predominantly White despite a predominantly
non-White population. Corporate ownership (LLCs, trusts, etc.) exacerbates
these gaps by reducing owner-occupied opportunities in urban minority
communities. We provide a breakdown of ownership vs. population by race for
majority-White, -Black, -Hispanic, and -Asian tracts, identify those with
extreme ownership disparities, and compare patterns in urban, suburban, and
rural contexts. The findings underscore persistent racial inequity in property
ownership, reflecting broader historical and socio-economic forces, and
highlight the importance of data-driven approaches to address these issues.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于联邦学习的跨股票趋势整合方法（CSTI），通过整合多股票模式提升股价预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单股票学习方法无法利用股票间的相关性，限制了预测性能。

Method: 结合联邦学习，训练单股票模型后迭代整合为全局模型，再微调保留本地相关性。

Result: 实验表明CSTI优于基准模型，提升了预测能力。

Conclusion: CSTI为股价预测提供了更优的替代方案。

Abstract: Stock price prediction is a critical area of financial forecasting,
traditionally approached by training models using the historical price data of
individual stocks. While these models effectively capture single-stock
patterns, they fail to leverage potential correlations among stock trends,
which could improve predictive performance. Current single-stock learning
methods are thus limited in their ability to provide a broader understanding of
price dynamics across multiple stocks. To address this, we propose a novel
method that merges local patterns into a global understanding through
cross-stock pattern integration. Our strategy is inspired by Federated Learning
(FL), a paradigm designed for decentralized model training. FL enables
collaborative learning across distributed datasets without sharing raw data,
facilitating the aggregation of global insights while preserving data privacy.
In our adaptation, we train models on individual stock data and iteratively
merge them to create a unified global model. This global model is subsequently
fine-tuned on specific stock data to retain local relevance. The proposed
strategy enables parallel training of individual stock models, facilitating
efficient utilization of computational resources and reducing overall training
time. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method,
demonstrating that it outperforms benchmark models and enhances the predictive
capabilities of state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight the efficacy
of Cross-Stock Trend Integration (CSTI) in advancing stock price prediction,
offering a robust alternative to traditional single-stock learning
methodologies.

Abstract: We present a novel implicit neural shape optimization framework for 3D
high-contrast Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), addressing scenarios where
conductivity exhibits sharp discontinuities across material interfaces. These
high-contrast cases, prevalent in metallic implant monitoring and industrial

ill-posedness. Our approach synergizes shape optimization with implicit neural
representations, introducing key innovations including a shape derivative-based
optimization scheme that explicitly incorporates high-contrast interface
conditions and an efficient latent space representation that reduces variable
dimensionality. Through rigorous theoretical analysis of algorithm convergence
and extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate substantial performance
improvements, establishing our framework as promising for practical
applications in medical imaging with metallic implants and industrial
non-destructive testing.

TLDR: VERDI框架通过将视觉语言模型的推理能力蒸馏到自动驾驶堆栈中，解决了现有方法的高计算成本和安全性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的轨迹规划方法计算成本高且难以分解安全性，需要一种更高效的方法来模拟人类驾驶的常识推理。

Method: VERDI通过训练时将VLM的推理过程和常识知识蒸馏到模块化自动驾驶堆栈中，对齐感知、预测和规划阶段的中间输出与VLM生成的文本特征。

Result: 在NuScenes数据集上，VERDI在保持高推理速度的同时，性能优于未嵌入推理的端到端方法10%（ℓ2距离）。

Conclusion: VERDI成功地将VLM的推理能力高效集成到自动驾驶堆栈中，显著提升了性能且避免了高计算成本。

Abstract: While autonomous driving (AD) stacks struggle with decision making under
partial observability and real-world complexity, human drivers are capable of
commonsense reasoning to make near-optimal decisions with limited information.
Recent work has attempted to leverage finetuned Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
for trajectory planning at inference time to emulate human behavior. Despite
their success in benchmark evaluations, these methods are often impractical to
deploy (a 70B parameter VLM inference at merely 8 tokens per second requires
more than 160G of memory), and their monolithic network structure prohibits
safety decomposition. To bridge this gap, we propose VLM-Embedded Reasoning for
autonomous Driving (VERDI), a training-time framework that distills the
reasoning process and commonsense knowledge of VLMs into the AD stack. VERDI
augments modular differentiable end-to-end (e2e) AD models by aligning
intermediate module outputs at the perception, prediction, and planning stages
with text features explaining the driving reasoning process produced by VLMs.
By encouraging alignment in latent space, \textsc{VERDI} enables the modular AD
stack to internalize structured reasoning, without incurring the inference-time
costs of large VLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the
NuScenes dataset and find that VERDI outperforms existing e2e methods that do
not embed reasoning by 10% in $\ell_{2}$ distance, while maintaining high
inference speed.

TLDR: EasyInsert框架通过预测插头与插座之间的相对位姿，实现了在杂乱环境中的高精度插入任务，具有强零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂环境中泛化能力差，依赖CAD模型或仿真数据，难以处理新物体或大位姿偏差。

Method: 利用人类直觉（相对位姿足够），通过高效自动化数据收集训练模型，采用粗到细的执行策略。

Result: 仅5小时训练数据，EasyInsert在15种新物体中13种零样本插入成功率超90%；微调后所有物体成功率均超90%。

Conclusion: EasyInsert在零样本泛化、样本效率和人工成本方面表现优异，适用于复杂环境中的插入任务。

Abstract: Insertion task is highly challenging that requires robots to operate with
exceptional precision in cluttered environments. Existing methods often have
poor generalization capabilities. They typically function in restricted and
structured environments, and frequently fail when the plug and socket are far
apart, when the scene is densely cluttered, or when handling novel objects.
They also rely on strong assumptions such as access to CAD models or a digital
twin in simulation. To address this, we propose EasyInsert, a framework which
leverages the human intuition that relative pose (delta pose) between plug and
socket is sufficient for successful insertion, and employs efficient and
automated real-world data collection with minimal human labor to train a
generalizable model for relative pose prediction. During execution, EasyInsert
follows a coarse-to-fine execution procedure based on predicted delta pose, and
successfully performs various insertion tasks. EasyInsert demonstrates strong
zero-shot generalization capability for unseen objects in cluttered
environments, handling cases with significant initial pose deviations while
maintaining high sample efficiency and requiring little human effort. In
real-world experiments, with just 5 hours of training data, EasyInsert achieves
over 90% success in zero-shot insertion for 13 out of 15 unseen novel objects,
including challenging objects like Type-C cables, HDMI cables, and Ethernet
cables. Furthermore, with only one human demonstration and 4 minutes of
automatically collected data for fine-tuning, it reaches over 90% success rate
for all 15 objects.

Result: SEM在多样任务中表现出色，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SEM通过增强空间理解和机器人状态建模，实现了更鲁棒和通用的机器人操作。

Abstract: A key challenge in robot manipulation lies in developing policy models with
strong spatial understanding, the ability to reason about 3D geometry, object
relations, and robot embodiment. Existing methods often fall short: 3D point
cloud models lack semantic abstraction, while 2D image encoders struggle with
spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose SEM (Spatial Enhanced
Manipulation model), a novel diffusion-based policy framework that explicitly
enhances spatial understanding from two complementary perspectives. A spatial
enhancer augments visual representations with 3D geometric context, while a
robot state encoder captures embodiment-aware structure through graphbased
modeling of joint dependencies. By integrating these modules, SEM significantly
improves spatial understanding, leading to robust and generalizable
manipulation across diverse tasks that outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: Manipulating elasto-plastic objects remains a significant challenge due to
severe self-occlusion, difficulties of representation, and complicated
dynamics. This work proposes a novel framework for elasto-plastic object
manipulation with a quasi-static assumption for motions, leveraging 3D
occupancy to represent such objects, a learned dynamics model trained with 3D
occupancy, and a learning-based predictive control algorithm to address these
challenges effectively. We build a novel data collection platform to collect
full spatial information and propose a pipeline for generating a 3D occupancy
dataset. To infer the 3D occupancy during manipulation, an occupancy prediction
network is trained with multiple RGB images supervised by the generated
dataset. We design a deep neural network empowered by a 3D convolution neural
network (CNN) and a graph neural network (GNN) to predict the complex
deformation with the inferred 3D occupancy results. A learning-based predictive
control algorithm is introduced to plan the robot actions, incorporating a
novel shape-based action initialization module specifically designed to improve
the planner efficiency. The proposed framework in this paper can successfully
shape the elasto-plastic objects into a given goal shape and has been verified
in various experiments both in simulation and the real world.

Conclusion: VL-SAFE首次将VLM引导的世界模型方法引入自动驾驶安全策略学习，效果显著。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based autonomous driving policy learning faces
critical limitations such as low sample efficiency and poor generalization; its
reliance on online interactions and trial-and-error learning is especially
unacceptable in safety-critical scenarios. Existing methods including safe RL
often fail to capture the true semantic meaning of "safety" in complex driving
contexts, leading to either overly conservative driving behavior or constraint
violations. To address these challenges, we propose VL-SAFE, a world
model-based safe RL framework with Vision-Language model
(VLM)-as-safety-guidance paradigm, designed for offline safe policy learning.
Specifically, we construct offline datasets containing data collected by expert
agents and labeled with safety scores derived from VLMs. A world model is
trained to generate imagined rollouts together with safety estimations,
allowing the agent to perform safe planning without interacting with the real
environment. Based on these imagined trajectories and safety evaluations,
actor-critic learning is conducted under VLM-based safety guidance to optimize
the driving policy more safely and efficiently. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that VL-SAFE achieves superior sample efficiency, generalization,
safety, and overall performance compared to existing baselines. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces a VLM-guided world
model-based approach for safe autonomous driving. The demo video and code can

Result: 在CARLA Leaderboard 2.0上取得领先性能，是目前唯一的基于强化学习的端到端方法。

Conclusion: Raw2Drive为端到端自动驾驶提供了一种有效的强化学习解决方案，填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) can mitigate the causal confusion and
distribution shift inherent to imitation learning (IL). However, applying RL to
end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) remains an open problem for its training
difficulty, and IL is still the mainstream paradigm in both academia and
industry. Recently Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) have demonstrated
promising results in neural planning; however, these methods typically require
privileged information as input rather than raw sensor data. We fill this gap
by designing Raw2Drive, a dual-stream MBRL approach. Initially, we efficiently
train an auxiliary privileged world model paired with a neural planner that
uses privileged information as input. Subsequently, we introduce a raw sensor
world model trained via our proposed Guidance Mechanism, which ensures
consistency between the raw sensor world model and the privileged world model
during rollouts. Finally, the raw sensor world model combines the prior
knowledge embedded in the heads of the privileged world model to effectively
guide the training of the raw sensor policy. Raw2Drive is so far the only RL
based end-to-end method on CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, and Bench2Drive and it
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are evolving into language-interactive
platforms, enabling more intuitive forms of human-drone interaction. While
prior works have primarily focused on high-level planning and long-horizon
navigation, we shift attention to language-guided fine-grained trajectory
control, where UAVs execute short-range, reactive flight behaviors in response
to language instructions. We formalize this problem as the Flying-on-a-Word
(Flow) task and introduce UAV imitation learning as an effective approach. In
this framework, UAVs learn fine-grained control policies by mimicking expert
pilot trajectories paired with atomic language instructions. To support this
paradigm, we present UAV-Flow, the first real-world benchmark for
language-conditioned, fine-grained UAV control. It includes a task formulation,
a large-scale dataset collected in diverse environments, a deployable control
framework, and a simulation suite for systematic evaluation. Our design enables
UAVs to closely imitate the precise, expert-level flight trajectories of human
pilots and supports direct deployment without sim-to-real gap. We conduct
extensive experiments on UAV-Flow, benchmarking VLN and VLA paradigms. Results
show that VLA models are superior to VLN baselines and highlight the critical
role of spatial grounding in the fine-grained Flow setting.

Abstract: Achieving full automation in self-driving vehicles remains a challenge,
especially in dynamic urban environments where navigation requires real-time
adaptability. Existing systems struggle to handle navigation plans when faced
with unpredictable changes in road layouts, spontaneous detours, or missing map
data, due to their heavy reliance on predefined cartographic information. In
this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models to generate Answer Set
Programming rules by translating informal navigation instructions into
structured, logic-based reasoning. ASP provides non-monotonic reasoning,
allowing autonomous vehicles to adapt to evolving scenarios without relying on
predefined maps. We present an experimental evaluation in which LLMs generate
ASP constraints that encode real-world urban driving logic into a formal
knowledge representation. By automating the translation of informal navigation
instructions into logical rules, our method improves adaptability and
explainability in autonomous navigation. Results show that LLM-driven ASP rule
generation supports semantic-based decision-making, offering an explainable
framework for dynamic navigation planning that aligns closely with how humans
communicate navigational intent.

Abstract: Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery is currently fully manually
controlled by a trained surgeon. Automating this has great potential for
alleviating issues, e.g., physical strain, highly repetitive tasks, and
shortages of trained surgeons. For these reasons, recent works have utilized
Artificial Intelligence methods, which show promising adaptability. Despite
these advances, there is skepticism of these methods because they lack
explainability and robust safety guarantees. This paper presents a framework
for a safe, uncertainty-aware learning method. We train an Ensemble Model of
Diffusion Policies using expert demonstrations of needle insertion. Using an
Ensemble model, we can quantify the policy's epistemic uncertainty, which is
used to determine Out-Of-Distribution scenarios. This allows the system to
release control back to the surgeon in the event of an unsafe scenario.
Additionally, we implement a model-free Control Barrier Function to place
formal safety guarantees on the predicted action. We experimentally evaluate
our proposed framework using a state-of-the-art robotic suturing simulator. We
evaluate multiple scenarios, such as dropping the needle, moving the camera,
and moving the phantom. The learned policy is robust to these perturbations,
showing corrective behaviors and generalization, and it is possible to detect
Out-Of-Distribution scenarios. We further demonstrate that the Control Barrier
Function successfully limits the action to remain within our specified safety
set in the case of unsafe predictions.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently advanced robotic
manipulation by leveraging vision for scene perception and language for
instruction following. However, existing methods rely heavily on costly
human-annotated training datasets, which limits their generalization and causes
them to struggle in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios, reducing real-world
adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose ManipLVM-R1, a novel
reinforcement learning framework that replaces traditional supervision with
Reinforcement Learning using Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). By directly optimizing
for task-aligned outcomes, our method enhances generalization and physical
reasoning while removing the dependence on costly annotations. Specifically, we
design two rule-based reward functions targeting key robotic manipulation
subtasks: an Affordance Perception Reward to enhance localization of
interaction regions, and a Trajectory Match Reward to ensure the physical
plausibility of action paths. These rewards provide immediate feedback and
impose spatial-logical constraints, encouraging the model to go beyond shallow
pattern matching and instead learn deeper, more systematic reasoning about
physical interactions.

Conclusion: AQC为深度学习模型优化提供了高效且可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum optimization is the most mature quantum computing technology to date,
providing a promising approach towards efficiently solving complex
combinatorial problems. Methods such as adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) have
been employed in recent years on important optimization problems across various
domains. In deep learning, deep neural networks (DNN) have reached immense
sizes to support new predictive capabilities. Optimization of large-scale
models is critical for sustainable deployment, but becomes increasingly
challenging with ever-growing model sizes and complexity. While quantum
optimization is suitable for solving complex problems, its application to DNN
optimization is not straightforward, requiring thorough reformulation for
compatibility with commercially available quantum devices. In this work, we
explore the potential of adopting AQC for fine-grained pruning-quantization of
convolutional neural networks. We rework established heuristics to formulate
model compression as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)
problem, and assess the solution space offered by commercial quantum annealing
devices. Through our exploratory efforts of reformulation, we demonstrate that
AQC can achieve effective compression of practical DNN models. Experiments
demonstrate that adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) not only outperforms
classical algorithms like genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning in
terms of time efficiency but also excels at identifying global optima.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models, like their classical counterparts, are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, hindering their secure deployment. Here, we
report the first systematic experimental robustness benchmark for 20-qubit
quantum neural network (QNN) classifiers executed on a superconducting
processor. Our benchmarking framework features an efficient adversarial attack
algorithm designed for QNNs, enabling quantitative characterization of
adversarial robustness and robustness bounds. From our analysis, we verify that
adversarial training reduces sensitivity to targeted perturbations by
regularizing input gradients, significantly enhancing QNN's robustness.
Additionally, our analysis reveals that QNNs exhibit superior adversarial
robustness compared to classical neural networks, an advantage attributed to
inherent quantum noise. Furthermore, the empirical upper bound extracted from
our attack experiments shows a minimal deviation ($3 \times 10^{-3}$) from the
theoretical lower bound, providing strong experimental confirmation of the
attack's effectiveness and the tightness of fidelity-based robustness bounds.
This work establishes a critical experimental framework for assessing and
improving quantum adversarial robustness, paving the way for secure and
reliable QML applications.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful tool for exploring the behavior of
atomistic systems, but its reliance on sequential numerical integration limits
simulation efficiency. We present MDtrajNet-1, a foundational AI model that
directly generates MD trajectories across chemical space, bypassing force
calculations and integration. This approach accelerates simulations by up to
two orders of magnitude compared to traditional MD, even those enhanced by
machine-learning interatomic potentials. MDtrajNet-1 combines equivariant
neural networks with a Transformer-based architecture to achieve strong
accuracy and transferability in predicting long-time trajectories for both
known and unseen systems. Remarkably, the errors of the trajectories generated
by MDtrajNet-1 for various molecular systems are close to those of the
conventional ab initio MD. The model's flexible design supports diverse
application scenarios, including different statistical ensembles, boundary
conditions, and interaction types. By overcoming the intrinsic speed barrier of
conventional MD, MDtrajNet-1 opens new frontiers in efficient and scalable
atomistic simulations.

Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) with physical systems requires an understanding of
the underlying structure and internal dynamics of the specific physical
reservoir. In this study, physical nano-electronic networks with neuromorphic
dynamics are investigated for their use as physical reservoirs in an RC
framework. These neuromorphic networks operate as dynamic reservoirs, with node
activities in general coupled to the edge dynamics through nonlinear
nano-electronic circuit elements, and the reservoir outputs influenced by the
underlying network connectivity structure. This study finds that networks with
varying degrees of sparsity generate more useful nonlinear temporal outputs for
dynamic RC compared to dense networks. Dynamic RC is also tested on an
autonomous multivariate chaotic time series prediction task with networks of
varying densities, which revealed the importance of network sparsity in
maintaining network activity and overall dynamics, that in turn enabled the
learning of the chaotic Lorenz63 system's attractor behavior.

Motivation: 染色体分析对遗传病诊断和癌症治疗至关重要，但现有AI模型因染色体异常的复杂性和多样性而受限，且缺乏通用性和全面数据集支持。

Method: CHROMA通过自监督学习在84,000个样本（约400万张染色体图像）上预训练，学习染色体异常的通用表示。

Result: CHROMA在所有异常类型上表现优于其他方法，即使使用较少标注数据或更不平衡的数据集。

Conclusion: CHROMA为临床分析提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案，推动了精准肿瘤学的发展，并使高级基因组分析更易普及。

Abstract: Chromosome analysis is vital for diagnosing genetic disorders and guiding
cancer therapy decisions through the identification of somatic clonal
aberrations. However, developing an AI model are hindered by the overwhelming
complexity and diversity of chromosomal abnormalities, requiring extensive
annotation efforts, while automated methods remain task-specific and lack
generalizability due to the scarcity of comprehensive datasets spanning diverse
resource conditions. Here, we introduce CHROMA, a foundation model for
cytogenomics, designed to overcome these challenges by learning generalizable
representations of chromosomal abnormalities. Pre-trained on over 84,000
specimens (~4 million chromosomal images) via self-supervised learning, CHROMA
outperforms other methods across all types of abnormalities, even when trained
on fewer labelled data and more imbalanced datasets. By facilitating
comprehensive mapping of instability and clonal leisons across various
aberration types, CHROMA offers a scalable and generalizable solution for
reliable and automated clinical analysis, reducing the annotation workload for
experts and advancing precision oncology through the early detection of rare
genomic abnormalities, enabling broad clinical AI applications and making
advanced genomic analysis more accessible.

Abstract: Brain stroke remains one of the principal causes of death and disability
worldwide, yet most tabular-data prediction models still hover below the 95%
accuracy threshold, limiting real-world utility. Addressing this gap, the
present work develops and validates a completely data-driven and interpretable
machine-learning framework designed to predict strokes using ten routinely
gathered demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables sourced from a public
cohort of 4,981 records. We employ a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
to understand the dataset's structure and distribution, followed by rigorous
data preprocessing, including handling missing values, outlier removal, and
class imbalance correction using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique
(SMOTE). To streamline feature selection, point-biserial correlation and
random-forest Gini importance were utilized, and ten varied
algorithms-encompassing tree ensembles, boosting, kernel methods, and a
multilayer neural network-were optimized using stratified five-fold
cross-validation. Their predictions based on probabilities helped us build the
proposed model, which included Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a
support-vector classifier, with logistic regression acting as a meta-learner.
The proposed model achieved an accuracy rate of 97.2% and an F1-score of
97.15%, indicating a significant enhancement compared to the leading individual
model, LightGBM, which had an accuracy of 91.4%. Our study's findings indicate
that rigorous preprocessing, coupled with a diverse hybrid model, can convert
low-cost tabular data into a nearly clinical-grade stroke-risk assessment tool.

Conclusion: 模块化架构解决了6G网络的独特挑战，但需权衡模型与系统性能。

Abstract: The 3D continuum presents a complex environment that spans the terrestrial,
aerial and space domains, with 6Gnetworks serving as a key enabling technology.
Current AI approaches for network management rely on monolithic models that
fail to capture cross-domain interactions, lack adaptability,and demand
prohibitive computational resources. This paper presents a formal model of
Compound AI systems, introducing a novel tripartite framework that decomposes
complex tasks into specialized, interoperable modules. The proposed modular
architecture provides essential capabilities to address the unique challenges
of 6G networks in the 3D continuum, where heterogeneous components require
coordinated, yet distributed, intelligence. This approach introduces a
fundamental trade-off between model and system performance, which must be
carefully addressed. Furthermore, we identify key challenges faced by Compound
AI systems within 6G networks operating in the 3D continuum, including
cross-domain resource orchestration, adaptation to dynamic topologies, and the
maintenance of consistent AI service quality across heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: PG-ZFO有效解决了DT交互中的资源分配问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a quality of experience (QoE)-aware resource
allocation problem for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted
digital twin (DT) interaction with uncertain evolution. In the considered
system, mobile users are expected to interact with a DT model maintained on a
DT server that is deployed on a base station, via effective uplink and downlink
channels assisted by an RIS. Our goal is to maximize the sum of all mobile
users' joint subjective and objective QoE in DT interactions across various DT
scenes, by jointly optimizing phase shift matrix, receive/transmit beamforming
matrix, rendering resolution configuration and computing resource allocation.
While solving this problem is challenging mainly due to the uncertain evolution
of the DT model, which leads to multiple scene-specific problems, and require
us to constantly re-solve each of them whenever DT model evolves.
  To this end, leveraging the dynamic optimization capabilities of decision
transformers and the generalization strengths of generative artificial
intelligence (GAI), we propose a novel GAI-aided approach, called the
prompt-guided decision transformer integrated with zero-forcing optimization
(PG-ZFO). Simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed PG-ZFO,
demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority over counterparts.

Result: 实验显示WiFiGPT在RSSI和FTM上达到亚米级精度，CSI上达到厘米级精度。

Conclusion: LLM为基础的定位方法无需手工信号处理即可超越传统技术。

Abstract: Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) based indoor positioning is a widely researched area
for determining the position of devices within a wireless network. Accurate
indoor location has numerous applications, such as asset tracking and indoor
navigation. Despite advances in WiFi localization techniques -- in particular
approaches that leverage WiFi telemetry -- their adoption in practice remains
limited due to several factors including environmental changes that cause
signal fading, multipath effects, interference, which, in turn, impact
positioning accuracy. In addition, telemetry data differs depending on the WiFi
device vendor, offering distinct features and formats; use case requirements
can also vary widely. Currently, there is no unified model to handle all these
variations effectively. In this paper, we present WiFiGPT, a Generative
Pretrained Transformer (GPT) based system that is able to handle these
variations while achieving high localization accuracy. Our experiments with
WiFiGPT demonstrate that GPTs, in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), can
effectively capture subtle spatial patterns in noisy wireless telemetry, making
them reliable regressors. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, our
method matches and often surpasses conventional approaches for multiple types
of telemetry. Achieving sub-meter accuracy for RSSI and FTM and
centimeter-level precision for CSI demonstrates the potential of LLM-based
localisation to outperform specialized techniques, all without handcrafted
signal processing or calibration.

to support extensive IoT services and ML-generated content applications.
Consequently, the integration of TinyML and LargeML is projected as a promising
approach for future seamless connectivity and efficient resource management.
  Although the integration of TinyML and LargeML shows abundant potential,
several challenges persist, including performance optimization, practical
deployment strategies, effective resource management, and security
considerations. In this survey, we review and analyze the latest research aimed
at enabling the integration of TinyML and LargeML models for the realization of

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合RAN特定推理的LAMs可直接协调控制平面流程，为AI原生无线标准奠定基础。

Abstract: Integrating large AI models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks promises to
redefine protocol design and control-plane intelligence by enabling autonomous,
cognitive network operations. While industry concepts, such as ETSI's
Experiential Networked Intelligence (ENI), envision LAM-driven agents for
adaptive network slicing and intent-based management, practical implementations
still face challenges in protocol literacy and real-world deployment. This
paper presents an end-to-end demonstration of a LAM that generates
standards-compliant, ASN.1-encoded Radio Resource Control (RRC) messages as
part of control-plane procedures inside a gNB. We treat RRC messaging as a
domain-specific language and fine-tune a decoder-only transformer model (LLaMA
class) using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on RRC messages
linearized to retain their ASN.1 syntactic structure before standard byte-pair
encoding tokenization. This enables combinatorial generalization over RRC
protocol states while minimizing training overhead. On 30k field-test
request-response pairs, our 8 B model achieves a median cosine similarity of
0.97 with ground-truth messages on an edge GPU -- a 61 % relative gain over a
zero-shot LLaMA-3 8B baseline -- indicating substantially improved structural
and semantic RRC fidelity. Overall, our results show that LAMs, when augmented
with Radio Access Network (RAN)-specific reasoning, can directly orchestrate
control-plane procedures, representing a stepping stone toward the AI-native
air-interface paradigm. Beyond RRC emulation, this work lays the groundwork for
future AI-native wireless standards.

Abstract: Current movie dubbing technology can produce the desired speech using a
reference voice and input video, maintaining perfect synchronization with the
visuals while effectively conveying the intended emotions. However, crucial
aspects of movie dubbing, including adaptation to various dubbing styles,
effective handling of dialogue, narration, and monologues, as well as
consideration of subtle details such as speaker age and gender, remain
insufficiently explored. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a multi-modal
generative framework. First, it utilizes a multi-modal large vision-language
model (VLM) to analyze visual inputs, enabling the recognition of dubbing types
and fine-grained attributes. Second, it produces high-quality dubbing using
large speech generation models, guided by multi-modal inputs. Additionally, a
movie dubbing dataset with annotations for dubbing types and subtle details is
constructed to enhance movie understanding and improve dubbing quality for the
proposed multi-modal framework. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
In details, the LSE-D, SPK-SIM, EMO-SIM, and MCD exhibit improvements of up to
1.09%, 8.80%, 19.08%, and 18.74%, respectively.

Motivation: 研究旨在理解任务优化的神经网络在静息状态下如何重现与任务相关的网络活动。

Abstract: During periods of quiescence, such as sleep, neural activity in many brain
circuits resembles that observed during periods of task engagement. However,
the precise conditions under which task-optimized networks can autonomously
reactivate the same network states responsible for online behavior is poorly
understood. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework that outlines
sufficient conditions for the emergence of neural reactivation in circuits that
encode features of smoothly varying stimuli. We demonstrate mathematically that
noisy recurrent networks optimized to track environmental state variables using
change-based sensory information naturally develop denoising dynamics, which,
in the absence of input, cause the network to revisit state configurations
observed during periods of online activity. We validate our findings using
numerical experiments on two canonical neuroscience tasks: spatial position
estimation based on self-motion cues, and head direction estimation based on
angular velocity cues. Overall, our work provides theoretical support for
modeling offline reactivation as an emergent consequence of task optimization
in noisy neural circuits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI（尤其是大语言模型）在云端部署中存在延迟、成本和隐私问题，而小语言模型在边缘环境中能力有限。

Method: 提出协作推理系统，结合边缘与云计算资源，并提供合作策略、设计原则和实验验证。

Result: 为跨计算连续体部署生成式AI提供了可行的指导。

Conclusion: 协作推理系统能有效解决云端部署的局限性，同时利用边缘计算的优势。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI (GenAI), particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), has exposed critical limitations of cloud-centric deployments,
including latency, cost, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, Small Language Models
(SLMs) are emerging as viable alternatives for resource-constrained edge
environments, though they often lack the capabilities of their larger
counterparts. This article explores the potential of collaborative inference
systems that leverage both edge and cloud resources to address these
challenges. By presenting distinct cooperation strategies alongside practical
design principles and experimental insights, we offer actionable guidance for
deploying GenAI across the computing continuum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在各行业的广泛应用，部署到从云到边缘的计算连续体上可以降低成本、减少延迟并提升可靠性和隐私性。

Method: 通过详细基准测试SLM在单一边缘设备和分布式边缘集群上的能力，分析边缘与云部署的交互。

Conclusion: 论文提出了平台级比较和设计见解，以构建适应异构环境的高效LM推理系统，而非一刀切的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Language Models (LMs) across industries is driving
interest in deploying these services across the computing continuum, from the
cloud to the network edge. This shift aims to reduce costs, lower latency, and
improve reliability and privacy. Small Language Models (SLMs), enabled by
advances in model compression, are central to this shift, offering a path to
on-device inference on resource-constrained edge platforms. This work examines
the interplay between edge and cloud deployments, starting from detailed
benchmarking of SLM capabilities on single edge devices, and extending to
distributed edge clusters. We identify scenarios where edge inference offers
comparable performance with lower costs, and others where cloud fallback
becomes essential due to limits in scalability or model capacity. Rather than
proposing a one-size-fits-all solution, we present platform-level comparisons
and design insights for building efficient, adaptive LM inference systems
across heterogeneous environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索机器学习在复杂物理模型（如6维超重力理论）中的应用潜力，特别是对弦景观和沼泽地的分类与特征提取。

Method: 使用自动编码器进行无监督学习，将Gram矩阵数据压缩至2维；同时利用监督学习构建两个分类器，预测模型的一致性和异常流入不一致性。

Result: 自动编码器成功聚类相似模型并识别异常模型；分类器在预测模型一致性和不一致性方面表现良好（精度分别为0.78和0.91）。

Conclusion: 机器学习算法能有效提取复杂模型特征，为6维超重力理论的景观和沼泽地研究提供新方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning
algorithms to the study of the string landscape and swampland in 6-dimensions.
Our data are the (almost) anomaly-free 6-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = (1,0)$
supergravity models, characterised by the Gram matrix of anomaly coefficients.
Our work demonstrates the ability of machine learning algorithms to efficiently
learn highly complex features of the landscape and swampland. Employing an
autoencoder for unsupervised learning, we provide an auto-classification of
these models by compressing the Gram matrix data to 2-dimensions. Through
compression, similar models cluster together, and we identify prominent
features of these clusters. The autoencoder also identifies outlier models
which are difficult to reconstruct. One of these outliers proves to be
incredibly difficult to combine with other models such that the
$\text{tr}R^{4}$ anomaly vanishes, making its presence in the landscape
extremely rare. Further, we utilise supervised learning to build two
classifiers predicting (1) model consistency under probe string insertion
(precision: 0.78, predicting consistency for 214,837 models with reasonable
certainty) and (2) inconsistency under anomaly inflow (precision: 0.91,
predicting inconsistency for 1,909,359 models). Notably, projecting these
predictions onto the autoencoder's 2-dimensional latent layer shows consistent
models clustering together, further indicating that the autoencoder has learnt
interesting and complex features of the set of models and potentially offers a
novel approach to mapping the landscape and swampland of 6-dimensional
supergravity theories.

Motivation: 随着5G部署的增加，网络密集化导致能耗显著上升，运营商迫切需要提升网络节能能力。

Method: 利用图形抽象方法优化用户关联策略，确定何时激活节能功能（如小区关闭）。

Result: 与传统方法相比，所提出的方法在节能方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 图形抽象优化方法能有效提升蜂窝网络的节能效果。

Abstract: With increased 5G deployments, network densification is higher than ever to
support the exponentially high throughput requirements. However, this has meant
a significant increase in energy consumption, leading to higher operational
expenditure (OpEx) for network operators creating an acute need for
improvements in network energy savings (NES). A key determinant of operational
efficacy in cellular networks is the user association (UA) policy, as it
affects critical aspects like spectral efficiency, load balancing etc. and
therefore impacts the overall energy consumption of the network directly.
Furthermore, with cellular network topologies lending themselves well to
graphical abstractions, use of graphs in network optimization has gained
significant prominence. In this work, we propose and analyze a graphical
abstraction based optimization for UA in cellular networks to improve NES by
determining when energy saving features like cell switch off can be activated.
A comparison with legacy approaches establishes the superiority of the proposed
approach.

Motivation: 研究ReLU神经网络中线性区域的不同定义及其计算复杂性，以评估其表达能力和实际应用中的可行性。

Method: 系统评估不同定义的关系，分析计算复杂性，证明NP和#P难度，并提出多项式空间算法。

Result: 计算线性区域数量通常是难解问题，单隐层网络已具NP和#P难度，多隐层网络更难近似。

Conclusion: 线性区域的计算复杂性高，但某些常见定义下可用多项式空间算法解决。

Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network
is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There
exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region
actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and
discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational
complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions.
Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and
#P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong
hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on
the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least
be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多组学数据中的因果发现对理解基因调控机制至关重要，但高维性、直接与间接关系的区分以及隐藏混杂因素使其具有挑战性。

Method: GENESIS通过初始化空祖先矩阵，逐步填充直接、间接或非因果关系，利用基因型作为固定因果锚点，结合独立性测试。

Result: 在合成和真实基因组数据集上测试，GENESIS能够有效揭示复杂性状中的因果路径。

Conclusion: GENESIS为功能基因组学、药物发现和精准医学提供了强大的因果发现工具。

Abstract: Causal discovery in multi-omic datasets is crucial for understanding the
bigger picture of gene regulatory mechanisms, but remains challenging due to
high dimensionality, differentiation of direct from indirect relationships, and
hidden confounders. We introduce GENESIS (GEne Network inference from
Expression SIgnals and SNPs), a constraint-based algorithm that leverages the
natural causal precedence of genotypes to infer ancestral relationships in
transcriptomic data. Unlike traditional causal discovery methods that start
with a fully connected graph, GENESIS initialises an empty ancestrality matrix
and iteratively populates it with direct, indirect or non-causal relationships
using a series of provably sound marginal and conditional independence tests.
By integrating genotypes as fixed causal anchors, GENESIS provides a principled
``head start'' to classical causal discovery algorithms, restricting the search
space to biologically plausible edges. We test GENESIS on synthetic and
real-world genomic datasets. This framework offers a powerful avenue for
uncovering causal pathways in complex traits, with promising applications to
functional genomics, drug discovery, and precision medicine.

Result: 实验证明，考虑跨平台传播差异能显著提升假新闻检测性能。

Conclusion: 跨平台传播特征的提取对假新闻检测至关重要，APSL模型为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fake news spreads widely on social media, leading to numerous negative
effects. Most existing detection algorithms focus on analyzing news content and
social context to detect fake news. However, these approaches typically detect
fake news based on specific platforms, ignoring differences in propagation
characteristics across platforms. In this paper, we introduce the MPPFND
dataset, which captures propagation structures across multiple platforms. We
also describe the commenting and propagation characteristics of different
platforms to show that their social contexts have distinct features. We propose
a multi-platform fake news detection model (APSL) that uses graph neural
networks to extract social context features from various platforms. Experiments
show that accounting for cross-platform propagation differences improves fake
news detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图粗化方法每次只能生成一个粗化图，且需为不同粗化比例重新计算，效率低；同时，多数方法仅适用于同构图，无法处理异构图。

Method: 结合LSH和一致性哈希实现自适应图粗化；针对异构图提出类型隔离粗化策略，确保语义一致性。

Result: 在23个真实数据集上验证了方法的优越性，兼顾了效率和结构语义完整性。

Conclusion: 该框架首次统一支持自适应和异构粗化，为大规模图学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: $\textbf{Graph Coarsening (GC)}$ is a prominent graph reduction technique
that compresses large graphs to enable efficient learning and inference.
However, existing GC methods generate only one coarsened graph per run and must
recompute from scratch for each new coarsening ratio, resulting in unnecessary
overhead. Moreover, most prior approaches are tailored to
$\textit{homogeneous}$ graphs and fail to accommodate the semantic constraints
of $\textit{heterogeneous}$ graphs, which comprise multiple node and edge
types. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
combines Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with Consistent Hashing to enable
$\textit{adaptive graph coarsening}$. Leveraging hashing techniques, our method
is inherently fast and scalable. For heterogeneous graphs, we propose a
$\textit{type isolated coarsening}$ strategy that ensures semantic consistency
by restricting merges to nodes of the same type. Our approach is the first
unified framework to support both adaptive and heterogeneous coarsening.
Extensive evaluations on 23 real-world datasets including homophilic,
heterophilic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous graphs demonstrate that our method
achieves superior scalability while preserving the structural and semantic
integrity of the original graph.

Conclusion: 研究证实，结合领域特定的NLP和可解释的机器学习方法，能够提供一种强大且可解释的宏观经济alpha来源。

Abstract: This study introduces an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework to
extract macroeconomic alpha from global news sentiment. We process the Global
Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) Project's worldwide news feed
using FinBERT -- a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
(BERT) based model pretrained on finance-specific language -- to construct
daily sentiment indices incorporating mean tone, dispersion, and event impact.
These indices drive an XGBoost classifier, benchmarked against logistic
regression, to predict next-day returns for EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and 10-year U.S.
Treasury futures (ZN). Rigorous out-of-sample (OOS) backtesting (5-fold
expanding-window cross-validation, OOS period: c. 2017-April 2025) demonstrates
exceptional, cost-adjusted performance for the XGBoost strategy: Sharpe ratios
achieve 5.87 (EUR/USD), 4.65 (USD/JPY), and 4.65 (Treasuries), with respective
compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) exceeding 50% in Foreign Exchange (FX) and
22% in bonds. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) affirm that sentiment
dispersion and article impact are key predictive features. Our findings
establish that integrating domain-specific Natural Language Processing (NLP)
with interpretable ML offers a potent and explainable source of macro alpha.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Learning complex functions that involve multi-step reasoning poses a
significant challenge for standard supervised learning from input-output
examples. Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, which provides intermediate
reasoning steps together with the final output, has emerged as a powerful
empirical technique, underpinning much of the recent progress in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. This paper develops a statistical theory
of learning under CoT supervision. A key characteristic of the CoT setting, in
contrast to standard supervision, is the mismatch between the training
objective (CoT risk) and the test objective (end-to-end risk). A central part
of our analysis, distinguished from prior work, is explicitly linking those two
types of risk to achieve sharper sample complexity bounds. This is achieved via
the *CoT information measure* $\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{D},
h_\star}^{\mathrm{CoT}}(\epsilon; \calH)$, which quantifies the additional
discriminative power gained from observing the reasoning process. The main
theoretical results demonstrate how CoT supervision can yield significantly
faster learning rates compared to standard E2E supervision. Specifically, it is
shown that the sample complexity required to achieve a target E2E error
$\epsilon$ scales as $d/\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{D},
h_\star}^{\mathrm{CoT}}(\epsilon; \calH)$, where $d$ is a measure of hypothesis
class complexity, which can be much faster than standard $d/\epsilon$ rates.
Information-theoretic lower bounds in terms of the CoT information are also
obtained. Together, these results suggest that CoT information is a fundamental
measure of statistical complexity for learning under chain-of-thought
supervision.

Conclusion: PO-Flow在因果推断任务中具有广泛适用性和优越性能。

Abstract: We propose PO-Flow, a novel continuous normalizing flow (CNF) framework for
causal inference that jointly models potential outcomes and counterfactuals.
Trained via flow matching, PO-Flow provides a unified framework for
individualized potential outcome prediction, counterfactual predictions, and
uncertainty-aware density learning. Among generative models, it is the first to
enable density learning of potential outcomes without requiring explicit
distributional assumptions (e.g., Gaussian mixtures), while also supporting
counterfactual prediction conditioned on factual outcomes in general
observational datasets. On benchmarks such as ACIC, IHDP, and IBM, it
consistently outperforms prior methods across a range of causal inference
tasks. Beyond that, PO-Flow succeeds in high-dimensional settings, including
counterfactual image generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Motivation: 科学家需要从时间点数据（如单细胞mRNA测序）中预测未来状态，但现有方法（如Schrödinger-bridge）在预测方面表现不佳。

Method: SnapMMD通过最大均值差异（MMD）损失直接拟合状态测量和观测时间的联合分布，推断未知且状态依赖的波动性。

Result: 实验表明，SnapMMD在预测和插值任务中表现优异，且能处理不完整的状态测量。

Conclusion: SnapMMD是一种有效的预测框架，优于现有方法，并能提供诊断拟合质量的统计量。

Abstract: Scientists often want to make predictions beyond the observed time horizon of
"snapshot" data following latent stochastic dynamics. For example, in time
course single-cell mRNA profiling, scientists have access to cellular
transcriptional state measurements (snapshots) from different biological
replicates at different time points, but they cannot access the trajectory of
any one cell because measurement destroys the cell. Researchers want to
forecast (e.g.) differentiation outcomes from early state measurements of stem
cells. Recent Schr\"odinger-bridge (SB) methods are natural for interpolating
between snapshots. But past SB papers have not addressed forecasting -- likely
since existing methods either (1) reduce to following pre-set reference
dynamics (chosen before seeing data) or (2) require the user to choose a fixed,
state-independent volatility since they minimize a Kullback-Leibler divergence.
Either case can lead to poor forecasting quality. In the present work, we
propose a new framework, SnapMMD, that learns dynamics by directly fitting the
joint distribution of both state measurements and observation time with a
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss. Unlike past work, our method allows us to
infer unknown and state-dependent volatilities from the observed data. We show
in a variety of real and synthetic experiments that our method delivers
accurate forecasts. Moreover, our approach allows us to learn in the presence
of incomplete state measurements and yields an $R^2$-style statistic that
diagnoses fit. We also find that our method's performance at interpolation (and
general velocity-field reconstruction) is at least as good as (and often better
than) state-of-the-art in almost all of our experiments.

Result: DANA通过调整动量超参数显著优于传统方法，实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: DANA在广泛的数据-目标复杂度范围内表现优异，优于传统方法。

Abstract: We investigate scaling laws for stochastic momentum algorithms with small
batch on the power law random features model, parameterized by data complexity,
target complexity, and model size. When trained with a stochastic momentum
algorithm, our analysis reveals four distinct loss curve shapes determined by
varying data-target complexities. While traditional stochastic gradient descent
with momentum (SGD-M) yields identical scaling law exponents to SGD,
dimension-adapted Nesterov acceleration (DANA) improves these exponents by
scaling momentum hyperparameters based on model size and data complexity. This
outscaling phenomenon, which also improves compute-optimal scaling behavior, is
achieved by DANA across a broad range of data and target complexities, while
traditional methods fall short. Extensive experiments on high-dimensional
synthetic quadratics validate our theoretical predictions and large-scale text
experiments with LSTMs show DANA's improved loss exponents over SGD hold in a
practical setting.

Result: 单主成分模型收敛结果与传统PCA一致；多主成分模型收敛性通过新下界证明。

Conclusion: 论文填补了BPCA中CAVI收敛速度的研究空白，并提出了信息论中独立有用的新下界。

Abstract: Probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA) and its Bayesian variant
(BPCA) are widely used for dimension reduction in machine learning and
statistics. The main advantage of probabilistic PCA over the traditional
formulation is allowing uncertainty quantification. The parameters of BPCA are
typically learned using mean-field variational inference, and in particular,
the coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI) algorithm. So far, the
convergence speed of CAVI for BPCA has not been characterized. In our paper, we
fill this gap in the literature. Firstly, we prove a precise exponential
convergence result in the case where the model uses a single principal
component (PC). Interestingly, this result is established through a connection
with the classical $\textit{power iteration algorithm}$ and it indicates that
traditional PCA is retrieved as points estimates of the BPCA parameters.
Secondly, we leverage recent tools to prove exponential convergence of CAVI for
the model with any number of PCs, thus leading to a more general result, but
one that is of a slightly different flavor. To prove the latter result, we
additionally needed to introduce a novel lower bound for the symmetric
Kullback--Leibler divergence between two multivariate normal distributions,
which, we believe, is of independent interest in information theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概率模型无法充分捕捉认知不确定性（EU），而不精确概率（IP）理论提供了更丰富的表示方法。因此，需要一种新的度量框架来支持IP模型中的比较和EU量化。

Method: 通过推广经典的积分概率度量（IPM），提出了IIPM框架，适用于容量（包括下概率、概率区间、信念函数等）的度量。

Result: IIPM不仅支持不同IP模型的比较，还能量化单一模型中的EU，并提出了新的EU度量——最大平均不精确度（MMI）。实验验证了MMI的优越性能。

Conclusion: IIPM为不精确概率机器学习（IPML）提供了理论和实践上的新工具，推动了EU量化和比较的研究。

Abstract: Quantifying differences between probability distributions is fundamental to
statistics and machine learning, primarily for comparing statistical
uncertainty. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty (EU) -- due to incomplete
knowledge -- requires richer representations than those offered by classical
probability. Imprecise probability (IP) theory offers such models, capturing
ambiguity and partial belief. This has driven growing interest in imprecise
probabilistic machine learning (IPML), where inference and decision-making rely
on broader uncertainty models -- highlighting the need for metrics beyond
classical probability. This work introduces the Integral Imprecise Probability
Metric (IIPM) framework, a Choquet integral-based generalisation of classical
Integral Probability Metric (IPM) to the setting of capacities -- a broad class
of IP models encompassing many existing ones, including lower probabilities,
probability intervals, belief functions, and more. Theoretically, we establish
conditions under which IIPM serves as a valid metric and metrises a form of
weak convergence of capacities. Practically, IIPM not only enables comparison
across different IP models but also supports the quantification of epistemic
uncertainty within a single IP model. In particular, by comparing an IP model
with its conjugate, IIPM gives rise to a new class of EU measures -- Maximum
Mean Imprecision -- which satisfy key axiomatic properties proposed in the
Uncertainty Quantification literature. We validate MMI through selective
classification experiments, demonstrating strong empirical performance against
established EU measures, and outperforming them when classical methods struggle
to scale to a large number of classes. Our work advances both theory and
practice in IPML, offering a principled framework for comparing and quantifying
epistemic uncertainty under imprecision.

*Masanari Kimura,Howard Bondell*

Main category: stat.ML

TLDR: 论文扩展了功率先验框架，通过引入Amari的α-散度最小化后验分布，提升了性能并提供了几何解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在贝叶斯框架中结合历史数据和当前数据时，功率先验的灵活性不足，需要更通用的方法。

Method: 将功率后验推广为Amari的α-散度的线性组合最小化，并分析其理论性质。

Result: 广义功率后验在性能上有所提升，并揭示了其在概率分布黎曼流形上的几何行为。

Conclusion: 通过α-散度推广功率先验，提供了更灵活的数据适应性和几何见解。

Abstract: The power prior is a class of informative priors designed to incorporate
historical data alongside current data in a Bayesian framework. It includes a
power parameter that controls the influence of historical data, providing
flexibility and adaptability. A key property of the power prior is that the
resulting posterior minimizes a linear combination of KL divergences between
two pseudo-posterior distributions: one ignoring historical data and the other
fully incorporating it. We extend this framework by identifying the posterior
distribution as the minimizer of a linear combination of Amari's
$\alpha$-divergence, a generalization of KL divergence. We show that this
generalization can lead to improved performance by allowing for the data to
adapt to appropriate choices of the $\alpha$ parameter. Theoretical properties
of this generalized power posterior are established, including behavior as a
generalized geodesic on the Riemannian manifold of probability distributions,
offering novel insights into its geometric interpretation.

TLDR: GS-B$^3$SE是一种概率化的标签偏移适应方法，通过图平滑贝叶斯框架改进传统黑盒偏移估计器的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒偏移估计器对采样噪声和类别相似性不敏感，导致估计结果脆弱。

Method: 引入Laplacian-Gaussian先验，结合标签相似性图，构建可处理的概率后验。

Result: 证明了可识别性、收缩性、方差界限缩小及对Laplacian误设的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GS-B$^3$SE通过信息几何视角泛化了现有偏移估计器。

Abstract: Label shift adaptation aims to recover target class priors when the labelled
source distribution $P$ and the unlabelled target distribution $Q$ share $P(X
\mid Y) = Q(X \mid Y)$ but $P(Y) \neq Q(Y)$. Classical black-box shift
estimators invert an empirical confusion matrix of a frozen classifier,
producing a brittle point estimate that ignores sampling noise and similarity
among classes. We present Graph-Smoothed Bayesian BBSE (GS-B$^3$SE), a fully
probabilistic alternative that places Laplacian-Gaussian priors on both target
log-priors and confusion-matrix columns, tying them together on a
label-similarity graph. The resulting posterior is tractable with HMC or a fast
block Newton-CG scheme. We prove identifiability, $N^{-1/2}$ contraction,
variance bounds that shrink with the graph's algebraic connectivity, and
robustness to Laplacian misspecification. We also reinterpret GS-B$^3$SE
through information geometry, showing that it generalizes existing shift
estimators.

Motivation: 研究动机在于分析训练和测试分布之间的统计差异，并通过高阶修正提升BN层在适应变化数据分布时的可靠性和性能。

Method: 方法包括使用Edgeworth展开分析BN均值差异，推导最优权重参数，并将BN TTA重新解释为一步M估计器，以纳入高阶矩信息。

Result: 结果包括量化了适应过程中的偏差、方差和偏度之间的权衡，并建立了模型风险的泛化边界，同时提供了BN TTA统计量的精确密度和尾概率估计。

Conclusion: 结论表明，高阶修正和稳健的一步更新可以显著提升BN层在适应变化数据分布时的性能，为相关领域提供了理论支持。

Abstract: This study develops a higher-order asymptotic framework for test-time
adaptation (TTA) of Batch Normalization (BN) statistics under distribution
shift by integrating classical Edgeworth expansion and saddlepoint
approximation techniques with a novel one-step M-estimation perspective. By
analyzing the statistical discrepancy between training and test distributions,
we derive an Edgeworth expansion for the normalized difference in BN means and
obtain an optimal weighting parameter that minimizes the mean-squared error of
the adapted statistic. Reinterpreting BN TTA as a one-step M-estimator allows
us to derive higher-order local asymptotic normality results, which incorporate
skewness and other higher moments into the estimator's behavior. Moreover, we
quantify the trade-offs among bias, variance, and skewness in the adaptation
process and establish a corresponding generalization bound on the model risk.
The refined saddlepoint approximations further deliver uniformly accurate
density and tail probability estimates for the BN TTA statistic. These
theoretical insights provide a comprehensive understanding of how higher-order
corrections and robust one-step updating can enhance the reliability and
performance of BN layers in adapting to changing data distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型在个性化内容生成中的广泛应用，使得传统bandit方法无法有效处理其独特的行动/处理结构，需要新的方法。

Method: 提出GAMBITTS方法，显式建模处理和奖励生成过程，利用观察到的处理信息加速策略学习。

Result: 理论分析表明GAMBITTS在特定条件下比传统方法有更强的性能保证，仿真研究中表现优于传统算法。

Conclusion: GAMBITTS通过有效利用生成式AI的结构，显著提升了序列学习问题的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have
enabled the generation of personalized content that adapts to up-to-date user
context. While personalized decision systems are often modeled using bandit
formulations, the integration of GenAI introduces new structure into otherwise
classical sequential learning problems. In GenAI-powered interventions, the
agent selects a query, but the environment experiences a stochastic response
drawn from the generative model. Standard bandit methods do not explicitly
account for this structure, where actions influence rewards only through
stochastic, observed treatments. We introduce generator-mediated
bandit-Thompson sampling (GAMBITTS), a bandit approach designed for this
action/treatment split, using mobile health interventions with large language
model-generated text as a motivating case study. GAMBITTS explicitly models
both the treatment and reward generation processes, using information in the
delivered treatment to accelerate policy learning relative to standard methods.
We establish regret bounds for GAMBITTS by decomposing sources of uncertainty
in treatment and reward, identifying conditions where it achieves stronger
guarantees than standard bandit approaches. In simulation studies, GAMBITTS
consistently outperforms conventional algorithms by leveraging observed
treatments to more accurately estimate expected rewards.

Main category: stat.ML

TLDR: 论文研究了差分隐私（DP）线性回归中DP-SGD的优化问题，通过频繁剪裁和ODE方法，证明了激进剪裁的优越性，并揭示了学习率衰减和噪声调度的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理论研究中常将剪裁常数设得远大于梯度范数，但实际优化性能与此不符。本文旨在弥合理论与实践的差距。

Method: 在多元高斯数据下，通过建立DP-SGD轨迹的确定性等效ODE模型，分析其风险上下界。

Result: 证明了频繁剪裁的最优性，并发现学习率衰减和噪声调度对性能的积极影响。

Conclusion: 本文通过ODE方法为DP-SGD提供了更精确的理论支持，优化了实际应用中的性能。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) linear regression has received significant
attention in the recent theoretical literature, with several works aimed at
obtaining improved error rates. A common approach is to set the clipping
constant much larger than the expected norm of the per-sample gradients. While
simplifying the analysis, this is however in sharp contrast with what empirical
evidence suggests to optimize performance. Our work bridges this gap between
theory and practice: we provide sharper rates for DP stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD) by crucially operating in a regime where clipping happens
frequently. Specifically, we consider the setting where the data is
multivariate Gaussian, the number of training samples $n$ is proportional to
the input dimension $d$, and the algorithm guarantees constant-order zero
concentrated DP. Our method relies on establishing a deterministic equivalent
for the trajectory of DP-SGD in terms of a family of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). As a consequence, the risk of DP-SGD is bounded between two
ODEs, with upper and lower bounds matching for isotropic data. By studying
these ODEs when $n / d$ is large enough, we demonstrate the optimality of
aggressive clipping, and we uncover the benefits of decaying learning rate and
private noise scheduling.

Motivation: 现有文献多假设布朗运动作为参考动力学，局限于势能驱动的系统。本文旨在解决非平衡系统中的Schrödinger桥问题，尤其是生物系统中的应用。

Method: 采用多元Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程作为参考过程，针对高斯边际推导了解析解，并提出基于流和分数匹配的算法mvOU-OTFM。

Result: 在合成和真实单细胞数据实验中，mvOU-OTFM比现有方法更准确且训练速度更快。

Conclusion: 本文为非平衡系统中的Schrödinger桥问题提供了高效解决方案，特别适用于生物系统。

Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger bridge problem which, given ensemble
measurements of the initial and final configurations of a stochastic dynamical
system and some prior knowledge on the dynamics, aims to reconstruct the "most
likely" evolution of the system compatible with the data. Most existing
literature assume Brownian reference dynamics and are implicitly limited to
potential-driven dynamics. We depart from this regime and consider reference
processes described by a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with generic
drift matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$. When $\mathbf{A}$ is
asymmetric, this corresponds to a non-equilibrium system with non-conservative
forces at play: this is important for applications to biological systems, which
are naturally exist out-of-equilibrium. In the case of Gaussian marginals, we
derive explicit expressions that characterise the solution of both the static
and dynamic Schr\"odinger bridge. For general marginals, we propose mvOU-OTFM,
a simulation-free algorithm based on flow and score matching for learning the
Schr\"odinger bridge. In application to a range of problems based on synthetic
and real single cell data, we demonstrate that mvOU-OTFM achieves higher
accuracy compared to competing methods, whilst being significantly faster to
train.

Method: 使用等周论证，建立Poincaré和对数Sobolev不等式，推导集中界，并进行渐近分析。

Result: 集中界在标签平衡时是尖锐的，均匀泛化误差几乎必然收敛于期望，适用于高维比例场景。

Conclusion: 研究为二元线性分类问题提供了理论支持，证明了均匀泛化误差的集中性和收敛性，适用于广泛的高维设置。

Abstract: We examine the concentration of uniform generalization errors around their
expectation in binary linear classification problems via an isoperimetric
argument. In particular, we establish Poincar\'{e} and log-Sobolev inequalities
for the joint distribution of the output labels and the label-weighted input
vectors, which we apply to derive concentration bounds. The derived
concentration bounds are sharp up to moderate multiplicative constants by those
under well-balanced labels. In asymptotic analysis, we also show that almost
sure convergence of uniform generalization errors to their expectation occurs
in very broad settings, such as proportionally high-dimensional regimes. Using
this convergence, we establish uniform laws of large numbers under
dimension-free conditions.

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了理论支持，还首次揭示了网格细胞活动与物理空间的几何对应关系。

Abstract: We present a generalised Hanson-Wright inequality and use it to establish new
statistical insights into the geometry of data point-clouds. In the setting of
a general random function model of data, we clarify the roles played by three
notions of dimensionality: ambient intrinsic dimension $p_{\mathrm{int}}$,
which measures total variability across orthogonal feature directions;
correlation rank, which measures functional complexity across samples; and
latent intrinsic dimension, which is the dimension of manifold structure hidden
in data. Our analysis shows that in order for persistence diagrams to reveal
latent homology and for manifold structure to emerge it is sufficient that
$p_{\mathrm{int}}\gg \log n$, where $n$ is the sample size. Informed by these
theoretical perspectives, we revisit the ground-breaking neuroscience discovery
of toroidal structure in grid-cell activity made by Gardner et al. (Nature,
2022): our findings reveal, for the first time, evidence that this structure is
in fact isometric to physical space, meaning that grid cell activity conveys a
geometrically faithful representation of the real world.

Conclusion: 该方法为GNN解释的可靠性提供了统计保障。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to
process graph-structured data across various domains. However, interpreting GNN
decisions remains a significant challenge, leading to the adoption of saliency
maps for identifying influential nodes and edges. Despite their utility, the
reliability of GNN saliency maps has been questioned, particularly in terms of
their robustness to noise. In this study, we propose a statistical testing
framework to rigorously evaluate the significance of saliency maps. Our main
contribution lies in addressing the inflation of the Type I error rate caused
by double-dipping of data, leveraging the framework of Selective Inference. Our
method provides statistically valid $p$-values while controlling the Type I
error rate, ensuring that identified salient subgraphs contain meaningful
information rather than random artifacts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
showing its effectiveness in assessing the reliability of GNN interpretations.

Result: 在合成回归和分类数据集上可视化边界，并在大规模OOD检测基准测试中表现出色，尤其是对近分布样本。

Conclusion: TULiP在OOD检测中表现出最先进的性能，特别是在近分布样本上。

Abstract: A reliable uncertainty estimation method is the foundation of many modern
out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors, which are critical for safe deployments of
deep learning models in the open world. In this work, we propose TULiP, a
theoretically-driven post-hoc uncertainty estimator for OOD detection. Our
approach considers a hypothetical perturbation applied to the network before
convergence. Based on linearized training dynamics, we bound the effect of such
perturbation, resulting in an uncertainty score computable by perturbing model
parameters. Ultimately, our approach computes uncertainty from a set of sampled
predictions. We visualize our bound on synthetic regression and classification
datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TULiP using
large-scale OOD detection benchmarks for image classification. Our method
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, particularly for near-distribution
samples.

Result: 发现临界点数量可能收敛、多项式增长或指数增长，取决于激活函数的性质。

Conclusion: 理论预测与实验一致，ReLU等不满足正则条件的激活函数可能导致临界点数量发散。

Abstract: This work investigates the expected number of critical points of random
neural networks with different activation functions as the depth increases in
the infinite-width limit. Under suitable regularity conditions, we derive
precise asymptotic formulas for the expected number of critical points of fixed
index and those exceeding a given threshold. Our analysis reveals three
distinct regimes depending on the value of the first derivative of the
covariance evaluated at 1: the expected number of critical points may converge,
grow polynomially, or grow exponentially with depth. The theoretical
predictions are supported by numerical experiments. Moreover, we provide
numerical evidence suggesting that, when the regularity condition is not
satisfied (e.g. for neural networks with ReLU as activation function), the
number of critical points increases as the map resolution increases, indicating
a potential divergence in the number of critical points.

Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的普及，平台依赖视觉标识可能导致用户（尤其是BLV）难以识别AIG内容，亟需解决这一问题。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈（N=28，包括15名视力正常者和13名BLV用户），研究用户对AIG标识的交互体验。

Result: 发现用户常忽略菜单辅助标识，依赖内容标识（如标题、评论），且BLV用户因界面无障碍性不足面临更大挑战。

Conclusion: 需改进AIG标识的设计，包括一致性、清晰性和无障碍性，以提升所有用户的识别能力。

Abstract: AI-Generated (AIG) content has become increasingly widespread by recent
advances in generative models and the easy-to-use tools that have significantly
lowered the technical barriers for producing highly realistic audio, images,
and videos through simple natural language prompts. In response, platforms are
adopting provable provenance with platforms recommending AIG to be
self-disclosed and signaled to users. However, these indicators may be often
missed, especially when they rely solely on visual cues and make them
ineffective to users with different sensory abilities. To address the gap, we
conducted semi-structured interviews (N=28) with 15 sighted and 13 BLV
participants to examine their interaction with AIG content through
self-disclosed AI indicators. Our findings reveal diverse mental models and
practices, highlighting different strengths and weaknesses of content-based
(e.g., title, description) and menu-aided (e.g., AI labels) indicators. While
sighted participants leveraged visual and audio cues, BLV participants
primarily relied on audio and existing assistive tools, limiting their ability
to identify AIG. Across both groups, they frequently overlooked menu-aided
indicators deployed by platforms and rather interacted with content-based
indicators such as title and comments. We uncovered usability challenges
stemming from inconsistent indicator placement, unclear metadata, and cognitive
overload. These issues were especially critical for BLV individuals due to the
insufficient accessibility of interface elements. We provide practical
recommendations and design implications for future AIG indicators across
several dimensions.

Abstract: College students are increasingly affected by stress, anxiety, and
depression, yet face barriers to traditional mental health care. This study
evaluated the efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention, Mental Health
Evaluation and Lookout Program (mHELP), which integrates a smartwatch sensor
and machine learning (ML) algorithms for real-time stress detection and
self-management. In a 12-week randomized controlled trial (n = 117),
participants were assigned to a treatment group using mHELP's full suite of
interventions or a control group using the app solely for real-time stress
logging and weekly psychological assessments. The primary outcome, "Moments of
Stress" (MS), was assessed via physiological and self-reported indicators and
analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) approaches. Similarly,
secondary outcomes of psychological assessments, including the Generalized
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety, the Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-8) for depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), were also
analyzed via GLMM. The finding of the objective measure, MS, indicates a
substantial decrease in MS among the treatment group compared to the control
group, while no notable between-group differences were observed in subjective
scores of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-8), or stress (PSS). However, the
treatment group exhibited a clinically meaningful decline in GAD-7 and PSS
scores. These findings underscore the potential of wearable-enabled mHealth
tools to reduce acute stress in college populations and highlight the need for
extended interventions and tailored features to address chronic symptoms like
depression.

Abstract: Deployment of deep neural networks in resource-constrained embedded systems
requires innovative algorithmic solutions to facilitate their energy and memory
efficiency. To further ensure the reliability of these systems against
malicious actors, recent works have extensively studied adversarial robustness
of existing architectures. Our work focuses on the intersection of adversarial
robustness, memory- and energy-efficiency in neural networks. We introduce a
neural network conversion algorithm designed to produce sparse and
adversarially robust spiking neural networks (SNNs) by leveraging the sparse
connectivity and weights from a robustly pretrained artificial neural network
(ANN). Our approach combines the energy-efficient architecture of SNNs with a
novel conversion algorithm, leading to state-of-the-art performance with
enhanced energy and memory efficiency through sparse connectivity and
activations. Our models are shown to achieve up to 100x reduction in the number
of weights to be stored in memory, with an estimated 8.6x increase in energy
efficiency compared to dense SNNs, while maintaining high performance and
robustness against adversarial threats.

a notable limitation of most ZC proxies is their inconsistency, as reflected by
the substantial variation in their performance across different problems.
Furthermore, the design of existing ZC metrics is manual, involving a
time-consuming trial-and-error process that requires substantial domain
expertise. These challenges raise two critical questions: (1) Can we automate
the design of ZC metrics? and (2) Can we utilize the existing hand-crafted ZC
metrics to synthesize a more generalizable one? In this study, we propose a
framework based on Symbolic Regression via Genetic Programming to automate the
design of ZC metrics. Our framework is not only highly extensible but also
capable of quickly producing a ZC metric with a strong positive rank
correlation to true network performance across diverse NAS search spaces and
tasks. Extensive experiments on 13 problems from NAS-Bench-Suite-Zero
demonstrate that our automatically generated proxies consistently outperform
hand-crafted alternatives. Using our evolved proxy metric as the search
objective in an evolutionary algorithm, we could identify network architectures
with competitive performance within 15 minutes using a single consumer GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能在复杂、去中心化环境中的应用，亟需可扩展、自适应且保护隐私的决策系统。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to drive innovation in complex,
decentralized environments, the need for scalable, adaptive, and
privacy-preserving decision-making systems has become critical. This paper
introduces a novel framework combining quantum-inspired neural networks with
evolutionary algorithms to optimize real-time decision-making in multi-agent
systems (MAS). The proposed Quantum-Evolutionary Neural Network (QE-NN)
leverages quantum computing principles -- such as quantum superposition and
entanglement -- to enhance learning speed and decision accuracy, while
integrating evolutionary optimization to continually refine agent behaviors in
dynamic, uncertain environments. By utilizing federated learning, QE-NN ensures
privacy preservation, enabling decentralized agents to collaborate without
sharing sensitive data. The framework is designed to allow agents to adapt in
real-time to their environments, optimizing decision-making processes for
applications in areas such as autonomous systems, smart cities, and healthcare.
This research represents a breakthrough in merging quantum computing,
evolutionary optimization, and privacy-preserving techniques to solve complex
problems in multi-agent decision-making systems, pushing the boundaries of AI
in real-world, privacy-sensitive applications.

Main category: cs.NE

TLDR: TDFormer引入了一种具有自上而下反馈结构的SNN模型，通过利用高阶信息调制低阶信息处理，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SNN的膜电位隐含性限制了其有效表示时间信息的能力，导致模型性能受限。

Method: 提出TDFormer模型，采用分层自上而下反馈结构，增加时间步间的互信息并缓解梯度消失问题。

Result: 模型在多个数据集上表现显著提升，ImageNet准确率达86.83%。

Conclusion: TDFormer通过反馈结构有效提升了SNN的时间信息处理能力，实现了性能突破。

Abstract: Traditional spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be viewed as a combination of
multiple subnetworks with each running for one time step, where the parameters
are shared, and the membrane potential serves as the only information link
between them. However, the implicit nature of the membrane potential limits its
ability to effectively represent temporal information. As a result, each time
step cannot fully leverage information from previous time steps, seriously
limiting the model's performance. Inspired by the top-down mechanism in the
brain, we introduce TDFormer, a novel model with a top-down feedback structure
that functions hierarchically and leverages high-order representations from
earlier time steps to modulate the processing of low-order information at later
stages. The feedback structure plays a role from two perspectives: 1) During
forward propagation, our model increases the mutual information across time
steps, indicating that richer temporal information is being transmitted and
integrated in different time steps. 2) During backward propagation, we
theoretically prove that the feedback structure alleviates the problem of
vanishing gradients along the time dimension. We find that these mechanisms
together significantly and consistently improve the model performance on
multiple datasets. In particular, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on ImageNet with an accuracy of 86.83%.

TLDR: CL-GPGLS结合课程学习与遗传编程，通过渐进式训练实例选择优化大规模车辆路径问题（VRP）的求解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计VRP的启发式方法需要专业知识，数据驱动方法虽能自动学习但训练实例选择仍依赖随机，影响性能。

Method: 提出CL-GPGLS，将课程学习融入GPGLS，按难度渐进引入训练实例，优化学习过程。

Result: 实验表明CL-GPGLS显著优于三种基线方法。

Conclusion: CL-GPGLS通过课程学习有效提升大规模VRP求解性能。

Abstract: Manually designing (meta-)heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is
a challenging task that requires significant domain expertise. Recently,
data-driven approaches have emerged as a promising solution, automatically
learning heuristics that perform well on training instances and generalize to
unseen test cases. Such an approach learns (meta-)heuristics that can perform
well on the training instances, expecting it to generalize well on the unseen
test instances. A recent method, named GPGLS, uses Genetic Programming (GP) to
learn the utility function in Guided Local Search (GLS) and solved large scale
VRP effectively. However, the selection of appropriate training instances
during the learning process remains an open question, with most existing
studies including GPGLS relying on random instance selection. To address this,
we propose a novel method, CL-GPGLS, which integrates Curriculum Learning (CL)
into GPGLS. Our approach leverages a predefined curriculum to introduce
training instances progressively, starting with simpler tasks and gradually
increasing complexity, enabling the model to better adapt and optimize for
large-scale VRP (LSVRP). Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of
CL-GPGLS, demonstrating significant performance improvements over three
baseline methods.

Conclusion: 论文总结了Nheuristics的发展方向，强调需要进一步研究以扩展其开发和应用范围。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NC) introduces a novel algorithmic paradigm
representing a major shift from traditional digital computing of Von Neumann
architectures. NC emulates or simulates the neural dynamics of brains in the
form of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Much of the research in NC has
concentrated on machine learning applications and neuroscience simulations.
This paper investigates the modelling and implementation of optimization
algorithms and particularly metaheuristics using the NC paradigm as an
alternative to Von Neumann architectures, leading to breakthroughs in solving
optimization problems.
  Neuromorphic-based metaheuristics (Nheuristics) are supposed to be
characterized by low power, low latency and small footprint. Since NC systems
are fundamentally different from conventional Von Neumann computers, several
challenges are posed to the design and implementation of Nheuristics. A
guideline based on a classification and critical analysis is conducted on the
different families of metaheuristics and optimization problems they address. We
also discuss future directions that need to be addressed to expand both the
development and application of Nheuristics.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely used for dynamic algorithm
configuration, particularly in evolutionary computation, which benefits from
the adaptive update of parameters during the algorithmic execution. However,
applying DRL to algorithm configuration for multi-objective combinatorial
optimization (MOCO) problems remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents
a novel graph neural network (GNN) based DRL to configure multi-objective
evolutionary algorithms. We model the dynamic algorithm configuration as a
Markov decision process, representing the convergence of solutions in the
objective space by a graph, with their embeddings learned by a GNN to enhance
the state representation. Experiments on diverse MOCO challenges indicate that
our method outperforms traditional and DRL-based algorithm configuration
methods in terms of efficacy and adaptability. It also exhibits advantageous
generalizability across objective types and problem sizes, and applicability to
different evolutionary computation methods.

Result: 提供了详细的分类概述，并指出了该领域的挑战与未来方向。

Conclusion: 本文首次针对LALMs评估进行系统化总结，为社区提供了明确的指南，并将持续更新调研数据。

Abstract: With advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs), which enhance large
language models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities, these models are expected to
demonstrate universal proficiency across various auditory tasks. While numerous
benchmarks have emerged to assess LALMs' performance, they remain fragmented
and lack a structured taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive
survey and propose a systematic taxonomy for LALM evaluations, categorizing
them into four dimensions based on their objectives: (1) General Auditory
Awareness and Processing, (2) Knowledge and Reasoning, (3) Dialogue-oriented
Ability, and (4) Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness. We provide detailed
overviews within each category and highlight challenges in this field, offering
insights into promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first survey specifically focused on the evaluations of LALMs, providing
clear guidelines for the community. We will release the collection of the
surveyed papers and actively maintain it to support ongoing advancements in the
field.

TLDR: Dysfluent-WFST是一种零样本解码器，可同时转录音素和检测言语不流畅，无需额外训练，性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在临床诊断中提供的信息有限，且独立于文本的模型在上下文相关案例中容易误分类。

Method: 采用Dysfluent-WFST解码器，结合上游编码器（如WavLM），无需额外训练。

Result: 在模拟和真实语音数据上，实现了音素错误率和言语不流畅检测的最优性能。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模发音行为而非复杂架构，可有效提升言语不流畅处理系统的性能。

Abstract: Automatic detection of speech dysfluency aids speech-language pathologists in
efficient transcription of disordered speech, enhancing diagnostics and
treatment planning. Traditional methods, often limited to classification,
provide insufficient clinical insight, and text-independent models misclassify
dysfluency, especially in context-dependent cases. This work introduces
Dysfluent-WFST, a zero-shot decoder that simultaneously transcribes phonemes
and detects dysfluency. Unlike previous models, Dysfluent-WFST operates with
upstream encoders like WavLM and requires no additional training. It achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both phonetic error rate and dysfluency
detection on simulated and real speech data. Our approach is lightweight,
interpretable, and effective, demonstrating that explicit modeling of
pronunciation behavior in decoding, rather than complex architectures, is key
to improving dysfluency processing systems.

Method: 开发了单模态模型（语音、视频、文本）和多模态框架，以提高症状严重程度估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Result: 该方法能够更详细地捕捉症状特征，为精神健康评估提供了可扩展且客观的工具。

Conclusion: 通过多模态方法估计症状严重程度，可以增强诊断精度并支持个性化治疗，具有较高的临床价值。

Abstract: Studies on schizophrenia assessments using deep learning typically treat it
as a classification task to detect the presence or absence of the disorder,
oversimplifying the condition and reducing its clinical applicability. This
traditional approach overlooks the complexity of schizophrenia, limiting its
practical value in healthcare settings. This study shifts the focus to
individual symptom severity estimation using a multimodal approach that
integrates speech, video, and text inputs. We develop unimodal models for each
modality and a multimodal framework to improve accuracy and robustness. By
capturing a more detailed symptom profile, this approach can help in enhancing
diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment, offering a scalable
and objective tool for mental health assessment.

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，Meta-PerSER在已知和未知数据场景中均显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Meta-PerSER展示了在个性化情感识别中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces Meta-PerSER, a novel meta-learning framework that
personalizes Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) by adapting to each listener's
unique way of interpreting emotion. Conventional SER systems rely on aggregated
annotations, which often overlook individual subtleties and lead to
inconsistent predictions. In contrast, Meta-PerSER leverages a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning (MAML) approach enhanced with Combined-Set Meta-Training,
Derivative Annealing, and per-layer per-step learning rates, enabling rapid
adaptation with only a few labeled examples. By integrating robust
representations from pre-trained self-supervised models, our framework first
captures general emotional cues and then fine-tunes itself to personal
annotation styles. Experiments on the IEMOCAP corpus demonstrate that
Meta-PerSER significantly outperforms baseline methods in both seen and unseen
data scenarios, highlighting its promise for personalized emotion recognition.

Result: 在WSJ和LibriPhrase数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的MAL和DML结合方法能够有效减少模态差异并提升性能。

Abstract: For text enrollment-based open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS), acoustic
and text embeddings are typically compared at either the phoneme or utterance
level. To facilitate this, we optimize acoustic and text encoders using deep
metric learning (DML), enabling direct comparison of multi-modal embeddings in
a shared embedding space. However, the inherent heterogeneity between audio and
text modalities presents a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Modality Adversarial Learning (MAL), which reduces the domain gap in
heterogeneous modality representations. Specifically, we train a modality
classifier adversarially to encourage both encoders to generate
modality-invariant embeddings. Additionally, we apply DML to achieve
phoneme-level alignment between audio and text, and conduct comprehensive
comparisons across various DML objectives. Experiments on the Wall Street
Journal (WSJ) and LibriPhrase datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升环境不匹配下的识别性能，且无需额外标签或修改现有系统。

Abstract: A primary challenge when deploying speaker recognition systems in real-world
applications is performance degradation caused by environmental mismatch. We
propose a diffusion-based method that takes speaker embeddings extracted from a
pre-trained speaker recognition model and generates refined embeddings. For
training, our approach progressively adds Gaussian noise to both clean and
noisy speaker embeddings extracted from clean and noisy speech, respectively,
via forward process of a diffusion model, and then reconstructs them to clean
embeddings in the reverse process. While inferencing, all embeddings are
regenerated via diffusion process. Our method needs neither speaker label nor
any modification to the existing speaker recognition pipeline. Experiments on
evaluation sets simulating environment mismatch scenarios show that our method
can improve recognition accuracy by up to 19.6% over baseline models while
retaining performance on conventional scenarios. We publish our code here

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经语音编解码器采用恒定帧率（CFR），但语音段的信息密度随时间变化，CFR在比特率和效率上不理想。

Method: 提出TFC技术，通过动态调整帧率基于时间熵，实现灵活的平均帧率。

Result: 实验表明，TFC在保持高质量重建的同时，具有高灵活性，并在低帧率下仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: TFC为开发低帧率神经语音编解码器提供了有前景的方向，适用于高效下游任务。

Abstract: Most neural speech codecs achieve bitrate adjustment through intra-frame
mechanisms, such as codebook dropout, at a Constant Frame Rate (CFR). However,
speech segments inherently have time-varying information density (e.g., silent
intervals versus voiced regions). This property makes CFR not optimal in terms
of bitrate and token sequence length, hindering efficiency in real-time
applications. In this work, we propose a Temporally Flexible Coding (TFC)
technique, introducing variable frame rate (VFR) into neural speech codecs for
the first time. TFC enables seamlessly tunable average frame rates and
dynamically allocates frame rates based on temporal entropy. Experimental
results show that a codec with TFC achieves optimal reconstruction quality with
high flexibility, and maintains competitive performance even at lower frame
rates. Our approach is promising for the integration with other efforts to
develop low-frame-rate neural speech codecs for more efficient downstream
tasks.

Conclusion: ASE在复杂声学环境中通过主动调制表现出高效性。

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for active sound modification: Active Speech
Enhancement (ASE). While Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) algorithms focus on
suppressing external interference, ASE goes further by actively shaping the
speech signal -- both attenuating unwanted noise components and amplifying
speech-relevant frequencies -- to improve intelligibility and perceptual
quality. To enable this, we propose a novel Transformer-Mamba-based
architecture, along with a task-specific loss function designed to jointly
optimize interference suppression and signal enrichment. Our method outperforms
existing baselines across multiple speech processing tasks -- including
denoising, dereverberation, and declipping -- demonstrating the effectiveness
of active, targeted modulation in challenging acoustic environments.

Conclusion: AutoMCQ为代码理解评估提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，适用于现代编程教育环境。

Abstract: Students often do not fully understand the code they have written. This
sometimes does not become evident until later in their education, which can
mean it is harder to fix their incorrect knowledge or misunderstandings. In
addition, being able to fully understand code is increasingly important in a
world where students have access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)
tools, such as GitHub Copilot. One effective solution is to utilise code
comprehension questions, where a marker asks questions about a submission to
gauge understanding, this can also have the side effect of helping to detect
plagiarism. However, this approach is time consuming and can be difficult
and/or expensive to scale. This paper introduces AutoMCQ, which uses GenAI for
the automatic generation of multiple-choice code comprehension questions. This
is integrated with the CodeRunner automated assessment platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征驱动开发（FDD）在现实世界中普遍存在，但大型语言模型（LLMs）在此任务上的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了SWE-Dev数据集，包含14,000个训练样本和500个测试样本，提供可运行环境和单元测试，支持监督微调和强化学习。

Result: 评估显示FDD对当前AI极具挑战性（如Claude-3.7-Sonnet仅22.45%通过率），但微调后7B模型表现接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: SWE-Dev是提升模型性能的有效平台，其高质量数据对AI在FDD任务中的进步至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capability in diverse software
engineering tasks, e.g. code completion, bug fixing, and document generation.
However, feature-driven development (FDD), a highly prevalent real-world task
that involves developing new functionalities for large, existing codebases,
remains underexplored. We therefore introduce SWE-Dev, the first large-scale
dataset (with 14,000 training and 500 test samples) designed to evaluate and
train autonomous coding systems on real-world feature development tasks. To
ensure verifiable and diverse training, SWE-Dev uniquely provides all instances
with a runnable environment and its developer-authored executable unit tests.
This collection not only provides high-quality data for Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), but also enables Reinforcement Learning (RL) by delivering accurate
reward signals from executable unit tests. Our extensive evaluations on
SWE-Dev, covering 17 chatbot LLMs, 10 reasoning models, and 10 Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS), reveal that FDD is a profoundly challenging frontier for current
AI (e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves only 22.45\% Pass@3 on the hard test
split). Crucially, we demonstrate that SWE-Dev serves as an effective platform
for model improvement: fine-tuning on training set enabled a 7B model
comparable to GPT-4o on \textit{hard} split, underscoring the value of its
high-quality training data. Code is available here

TLDR: 开源LLMs通过代码图模型（CGMs）和代理无关的图RAG框架，成功解决仓库级任务，性能超越现有开源方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于专有LLM代理的仓库级任务解决方案的不确定性、可访问性差及隐私问题。

Method: 提出代码图模型（CGMs），通过语义信息和结构依赖整合代码图结构到LLM注意力机制中，并使用适配器映射节点属性。

Result: 在SWE-bench Lite基准测试中达到43.00%解决率，开源模型中排名第一，整体第八。

Conclusion: 开源LLMs结合CGMs和代理无关框架，能够高效处理仓库级任务，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
function-level code generation, yet repository-level software engineering tasks
remain challenging. Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM
agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising
concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates
whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without
requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling
LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic
information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph
Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's
attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a
specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our
approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark
using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among
open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth
overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于物理的机器学习方法，用于预测地幔对流模拟中的流速，显著提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地幔对流模拟的计算挑战包括输入参数不确定性、非线性传输特性依赖及长时间积分需求，传统数值求解器效率低。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络预测流速，结合有限体积求解器推进温度场，实现自回归推演。

Result: 模型比数值求解器快89倍，验证了网络架构中质量守恒等组件的重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法在地幔对流模拟中表现出高效性，但在未见场景中仍需进一步测试和改进。

Abstract: Mantle convection simulations are an essential tool for understanding how
rocky planets evolve. However, the poorly known input parameters to these
simulations, the non-linear dependence of transport properties on pressure and
temperature, and the long integration times in excess of several billion years
all pose a computational challenge for numerical solvers. We propose a
physics-based machine learning approach that predicts creeping flow velocities
as a function of temperature while conserving mass, thereby bypassing the
numerical solution of the Stokes problem. A finite-volume solver then uses the
predicted velocities to advect and diffuse the temperature field to the next
time-step, enabling autoregressive rollout at inference. For training, our
model requires temperature-velocity snapshots from a handful of simulations
(94). We consider mantle convection in a two-dimensional rectangular box with
basal and internal heating, pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity.
Overall, our model is up to 89 times faster than the numerical solver. We also
show the importance of different components in our convolutional neural network
architecture such as mass conservation, learned paddings on the boundaries, and
loss scaling for the overall rollout performance. Finally, we test our approach
on unseen scenarios to demonstrate some of its strengths and weaknesses.

TLDR: SpecMaskFoley通过ControlNet改进预训练的SpecMaskGIT模型，用于视频同步的Foley合成，性能优于从头训练的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ControlNet方法在Foley合成中表现不佳，而从头训练模型虽成功但复杂。研究旨在缩小两者差距。

Method: 提出SpecMaskFoley，利用频率感知时间特征对齐器解决视频特征与SpecMaskGIT时间频率特性的不匹配问题。

Result: 在Foley合成基准测试中，SpecMaskFoley性能优于从头训练的基线模型。

Conclusion: SpecMaskFoley显著推进了基于ControlNet的Foley合成模型发展。

Abstract: Foley synthesis aims to synthesize high-quality audio that is both
semantically and temporally aligned with video frames. Given its broad
application in creative industries, the task has gained increasing attention in
the research community. To avoid the non-trivial task of training audio
generative models from scratch, adapting pretrained audio generative models for
video-synchronized foley synthesis presents an attractive direction.
ControlNet, a method for adding fine-grained controls to pretrained generative
models, has been applied to foley synthesis, but its use has been limited to
handcrafted human-readable temporal conditions. In contrast, from-scratch
models achieved success by leveraging high-dimensional deep features extracted
using pretrained video encoders. We have observed a performance gap between
ControlNet-based and from-scratch foley models. To narrow this gap, we propose
SpecMaskFoley, a method that steers the pretrained SpecMaskGIT model toward
video-synchronized foley synthesis via ControlNet. To unlock the potential of a
single ControlNet branch, we resolve the discrepancy between the temporal video
features and the time-frequency nature of the pretrained SpecMaskGIT via a
frequency-aware temporal feature aligner, eliminating the need for complicated
conditioning mechanisms widely used in prior arts. Evaluations on a common
foley synthesis benchmark demonstrate that SpecMaskFoley could even outperform
strong from-scratch baselines, substantially advancing the development of
ControlNet-based foley synthesis models. Demo page:

Motivation: 现有评估框架主要关注文本模态或有限的安全维度，未能充分应对音频模态的独特特性和应用场景，因此需要系统性的研究来填补这一空白。

Method: AudioTrust围绕18种实验设置构建，核心是一个包含4,420个音频/文本样本的数据集，并设计了9种音频专用评估指标，采用自动化流程进行客观评分。

Result: 实验揭示了当前开源和闭源ALLMs在高风险音频场景中的可信度边界和局限性。

Conclusion: AudioTrust为未来音频模型的安全和可信部署提供了宝贵见解，平台和基准已开源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement and expanding applications of Audio Large Language
Models (ALLMs) demand a rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness.
However, systematic research on evaluating these models, particularly
concerning risks unique to the audio modality, remains largely unexplored.
Existing evaluation frameworks primarily focus on the text modality or address
only a restricted set of safety dimensions, failing to adequately account for
the unique characteristics and application scenarios inherent to the audio
modality. We introduce AudioTrust-the first multifaceted trustworthiness
evaluation framework and benchmark specifically designed for ALLMs. AudioTrust
facilitates assessments across six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination,
safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. To comprehensively evaluate
these dimensions, AudioTrust is structured around 18 distinct experimental
setups. Its core is a meticulously constructed dataset of over 4,420 audio/text
samples, drawn from real-world scenarios (e.g., daily conversations, emergency
calls, voice assistant interactions), specifically designed to probe the
multifaceted trustworthiness of ALLMs. For assessment, the benchmark carefully
designs 9 audio-specific evaluation metrics, and we employ a large-scale
automated pipeline for objective and scalable scoring of model outputs.
Experimental results reveal the trustworthiness boundaries and limitations of
current state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs when confronted
with various high-risk audio scenarios, offering valuable insights for the
secure and trustworthy deployment of future audio models. Our platform and
benchmark are available at https://github.com/JusperLee/AudioTrust.

the computer interprets and responds to the human performer's input in real
time, creating a musical dialogue that balances compositional intent with live
interaction while incorporating elements of unpredictability. In this paper, we
present the development process from composition to premiere performance,
including technical implementation, rehearsal process, and performance
considerations.

analysis, we reveal insights into the structure and potential applications of
SSL models in music information retrieval.

Abstract: Voice Conversion research in recent times has increasingly focused on
improving the zero-shot capabilities of existing methods. Despite remarkable
advancements, current architectures still tend to struggle in zero-shot
cross-lingual settings. They are also often unable to generalize for speakers
of unseen languages and accents. In this paper, we adopt a simple yet effective
approach that combines discrete speech representations from self-supervised
models with a non-autoregressive Diffusion-Transformer based conditional flow
matching speech decoder. We show that this architecture allows us to train a
voice-conversion model in a purely textless, self-supervised fashion. Our
technique works without requiring multiple encoders to disentangle speech
features. Our model also manages to excel in zero-shot cross-lingual settings
even for unseen languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言环境中表现不佳，可能导致Agentic AI系统在全球范围内的可访问性和安全性问题，因此需要填补多语言评估的空白。

Method: 基于四个广泛使用的Agentic基准测试（GAIA、SWE-bench、MATH和Agent Security Benchmark），将其翻译为十种语言，构建了包含805个任务和8,855个实例的MAPS基准套件。

Result: 实验表明，从英语切换到其他语言时，性能和安全性均出现下降，严重程度因任务和翻译输入量而异。

Conclusion: MAPS为多语言环境下的Agentic AI系统开发和评估提供了标准化框架，并提出了改进建议，以促进全球可访问性和可靠性。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which build on Large Language Models (LLMs) and interact
with tools and memory, have rapidly advanced in capability and scope. Yet,
since LLMs have been shown to struggle in multilingual settings, typically
resulting in lower performance and reduced safety, agentic systems risk
inheriting these limitations. This raises concerns about the global
accessibility of such systems, as users interacting in languages other than
English may encounter unreliable or security-critical agent behavior. Despite
growing interest in evaluating agentic AI, existing benchmarks focus
exclusively on English, leaving multilingual settings unexplored. To address
this gap, we propose MAPS, a multilingual benchmark suite designed to evaluate
agentic AI systems across diverse languages and tasks. MAPS builds on four
widely used agentic benchmarks - GAIA (real-world tasks), SWE-bench (code
generation), MATH (mathematical reasoning), and the Agent Security Benchmark
(security). We translate each dataset into ten diverse languages, resulting in
805 unique tasks and 8,855 total language-specific instances. Our benchmark
suite enables a systematic analysis of how multilingual contexts affect agent
performance and robustness. Empirically, we observe consistent degradation in
both performance and security when transitioning from English to other
languages, with severity varying by task and correlating with the amount of
translated input. Building on these findings, we provide actionable
recommendations to guide agentic AI systems development and assessment under
multilingual settings. This work establishes a standardized evaluation
framework, encouraging future research towards equitable, reliable, and
globally accessible agentic AI. MAPS benchmark suite is publicly available at

Motivation: 足球比赛中，不同数据提供商收集的数据存在差异，导致分析和利用困难，需要统一标准。

Method: 提出CDF格式，定义五种比赛数据的最小模式，并详细说明技术规范和交付方法。

Result: CDF格式确保数据清晰、完整且易于分析，支持下游任务。

Conclusion: CDF为足球数据提供了一种标准化解决方案，简化了数据整合和分析过程。

Abstract: During football matches, a variety of different parties (e.g., companies)
each collect (possibly overlapping) data about the match ranging from basic
information (e.g., starting players) to detailed positional data. This data is
provided to clubs, federations, and other organizations who are increasingly
interested in leveraging this data to inform their decision making.
Unfortunately, analyzing such data pose significant barriers because each
provider may (1) collect different data, (2) use different specifications even
within the same category of data, (3) represent the data differently, and (4)
delivers the data in a different manner (e.g., file format, protocol).
Consequently, working with these data requires a significant investment of time
and money. The goal of this work is to propose a uniform and standardized
format for football data called the Common Data Format (CDF). The CDF specifies
a minimal schema for five types of match data: match sheet data, video footage,
event data, tracking data, and match meta data. It aims to ensure that the
provided data is clear, sufficiently contextualized (e.g., its provenance is
clear), and complete such that it enables common downstream analysis tasks.
Concretely, this paper will detail the technical specifications of the CDF, the
representational choices that were made to help ensure the clarity of the
provided data, and a concrete approach for delivering data in the CDF.

Result: 实验证明协作学习在新识别的数据库上表现更优，为结构化基础模型训练提供了潜力。

Conclusion: WikiDBGraph为互联表格数据学习提供了新资源，同时揭示了关键挑战和未来方向。

Abstract: Tabular data, ubiquitous and rich in informational value, is an increasing
focus for deep representation learning, yet progress is hindered by studies
centered on single tables or isolated databases, which limits model
capabilities due to data scale. While collaborative learning approaches such as
federated learning, transfer learning, split learning, and tabular foundation
models aim to learn from multiple correlated databases, they are challenged by
a scarcity of real-world interconnected tabular resources. Current data lakes
and corpora largely consist of isolated databases lacking defined
inter-database correlations. To overcome this, we introduce WikiDBGraph, a
large-scale graph of 100,000 real-world tabular databases from WikiData,
interconnected by 17 million edges and characterized by 13 node and 12 edge
properties derived from its database schema and data distribution.
WikiDBGraph's weighted edges identify both instance- and feature-overlapped
databases. Experiments on these newly identified databases confirm that
collaborative learning yields superior performance, thereby offering
considerable promise for structured foundation model training while also
exposing key challenges and future directions for learning from interconnected
tabular data.

Abstract: Effective disaster management requires timely access to accurate and
contextually relevant information. Existing Information Retrieval (IR)
benchmarks, however, focus primarily on general or specialized domains, such as
medicine or finance, neglecting the unique linguistic complexity and diverse
information needs encountered in disaster management scenarios. To bridge this

specifically tailored for disaster management. DisastIR comprises 9,600 diverse
user queries and more than 1.3 million labeled query-passage pairs, covering 48
distinct retrieval tasks derived from six search intents and eight general
disaster categories that include 301 specific event types. Our evaluations of
30 state-of-the-art retrieval models demonstrate significant performance
variances across tasks, with no single model excelling universally.
Furthermore, comparative analyses reveal significant performance gaps between
general-domain and disaster management-specific tasks, highlighting the
necessity of disaster management-specific benchmarks for guiding IR model

Conclusion: AutoData为自动化数据收集提供了高效、低成本的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The exponential growth of data-driven systems and AI technologies has
intensified the demand for high-quality web-sourced datasets. While existing
datasets have proven valuable, conventional web data collection approaches face
significant limitations in terms of human effort and scalability. Current
data-collecting solutions fall into two categories: wrapper-based methods that
struggle with adaptability and reproducibility, and large language model
(LLM)-based approaches that incur substantial computational and financial
costs. To address these challenges, we propose AutoData, a novel multi-agent
system for Automated web Data collection, that requires minimal human
intervention, i.e., only necessitating a natural language instruction
specifying the desired dataset. In addition, AutoData is designed with a robust
multi-agent architecture, featuring a novel oriented message hypergraph
coordinated by a central task manager, to efficiently organize agents across
research and development squads. Besides, we introduce a novel hypergraph cache
system to advance the multi-agent collaboration process that enables efficient
automated data collection and mitigates the token cost issues prevalent in
existing LLM-based systems. Moreover, we introduce Instruct2DS, a new benchmark
dataset supporting live data collection from web sources across three domains:
academic, finance, and sports. Comprehensive evaluations over Instruct2DS and
three existing benchmark datasets demonstrate AutoData's superior performance
compared to baseline methods. Case studies on challenging tasks such as picture
book collection and paper extraction from surveys further validate its
applicability. Our source code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: InfoDeepSeek为动态代理信息检索提供了有效的评估工具，推动了相关研究的进展。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
grounding responses with retrieved information. As an emerging paradigm,
Agentic RAG further enhances this process by introducing autonomous LLM agents
into the information seeking process. However, existing benchmarks fall short
in evaluating such systems, as they are confined to a static retrieval
environment with a fixed, limited corpus} and simple queries that fail to
elicit agentic behavior. Moreover, their evaluation protocols assess
information seeking effectiveness by pre-defined gold sets of documents, making
them unsuitable for the open-ended and dynamic nature of real-world web
environments. To bridge this gap, we present InfoDeepSeek, a new benchmark with
challenging questions designed for assessing agentic information seeking in
real-world, dynamic web environments. We propose a systematic methodology for
constructing challenging queries satisfying the criteria of determinacy,
difficulty, and diversity. Based on this, we develop the first evaluation
framework tailored to dynamic agentic information seeking, including
fine-grained metrics about the accuracy, utility, and compactness of
information seeking outcomes. Through extensive experiments across LLMs, search
engines, and question types, InfoDeepSeek reveals nuanced agent behaviors and
offers actionable insights for future research.

Abstract: Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) is an important technique in modern search
engines, enabling semantic match between search queries and relevant results.
However, search logging data on platforms like Facebook Marketplace lacks the
diversity and details needed for effective EBR model training, limiting the
models' ability to capture nuanced search patterns. To address this challenge,
we propose Aug2Search, an EBR-based framework leveraging synthetic data
generated by Generative AI (GenAI) models, in a multimodal and multitask
approach to optimize query-product relevance. This paper investigates the
capabilities of GenAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in generating
high-quality synthetic data, and analyzing its impact on enhancing EBR models.
We conducted experiments using eight Llama models and 100 million data points
from Facebook Marketplace logs. Our synthetic data generation follows three
strategies: (1) generate queries, (2) enhance product listings, and (3)
generate queries from enhanced listings. We train EBR models on three different
datasets: sampled engagement data or original data ((e.g., "Click" and "Listing
Interactions")), synthetic data, and a mixture of both engagement and synthetic
data to assess their performance across various training sets. Our findings
underscore the robustness of Llama models in producing synthetic queries and
listings with high coherence, relevance, and diversity, while maintaining low
levels of hallucination. Aug2Search achieves an improvement of up to 4% in
ROC_AUC with 100 million synthetic data samples, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, our experiments reveal that with the
same volume of training data, models trained exclusively on synthetic data
often outperform those trained on original data only or a mixture of original
and synthetic data.

Conclusion: Conf-GNNRec能有效解决噪声和过自信问题，提升推荐系统的可信度和性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems based on graph neural networks perform well in tasks such
as rating and ranking. However, in real-world recommendation scenarios, noise
such as user misuse and malicious advertisement gradually accumulates through
the message propagation mechanism. Even if existing studies mitigate their
effects by reducing the noise propagation weights, the severe sparsity of the
recommender system still leads to the low-weighted noisy neighbors being
mistaken as meaningful information, and the prediction result obtained based on
the polluted nodes is not entirely trustworthy. Therefore, it is crucial to
measure the confidence of the prediction results in this highly noisy
framework. Furthermore, our evaluation of the existing representative GNN-based
recommendation shows that it suffers from overconfidence. Based on the above
considerations, we propose a new method to quantify and calibrate the
prediction confidence of GNN-based recommendations (Conf-GNNRec). Specifically,
we propose a rating calibration method that dynamically adjusts excessive
ratings to mitigate overconfidence based on user personalization. We also
design a confidence loss function to reduce the overconfidence of negative
samples and effectively improve recommendation performance. Experiments on
public datasets demonstrate the validity of Conf-GNNRec in prediction
confidence and recommendation performance.

Motivation: 当前DocRAG方法以文本为中心，常忽略关键视觉信息，且缺乏评估多模态证据选择与整合的基准。

Method: 提出MMDocRAG基准，包含4055个QA对和多模态证据链，引入新指标评估多模态引用选择，支持文本与视觉元素结合的答案。

Result: 专有LVMs表现优于开源模型，多模态输入对性能有提升，微调LLMs使用详细图像描述时效果显著提升。

Conclusion: MMDocRAG为开发更鲁棒的多模态DocVQA系统提供了严格测试基准和实用见解。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) faces dual challenges in
processing lengthy multimodal documents (text, images, tables) and performing
cross-modal reasoning. Current document retrieval-augmented generation (DocRAG)
methods remain limited by their text-centric approaches, frequently missing
critical visual information. The field also lacks robust benchmarks for
assessing multimodal evidence selection and integration. We introduce MMDocRAG,
a comprehensive benchmark featuring 4,055 expert-annotated QA pairs with
multi-page, cross-modal evidence chains. Our framework introduces innovative
metrics for evaluating multimodal quote selection and enables answers that
interleave text with relevant visual elements. Through large-scale experiments
with 60 VLM/LLM models and 14 retrieval systems, we identify persistent
challenges in multimodal evidence retrieval, selection, and integration.Key
findings reveal advanced proprietary LVMs show superior performance than
open-sourced alternatives. Also, they show moderate advantages using multimodal
inputs over text-only inputs, while open-source alternatives show significant
performance degradation. Notably, fine-tuned LLMs achieve substantial
improvements when using detailed image descriptions. MMDocRAG establishes a
rigorous testing ground and provides actionable insights for developing more
robust multimodal DocVQA systems. Our benchmark and code are available at

Method: 引入MiLQ测试集，评估多语言IR模型在混合语言查询上的表现，并分析代码切换训练数据的作用。

Result: 多语言IR模型在MiLQ上表现中等且不稳定，混合语言查询在搜索英文文档时表现更优。

Conclusion: 混合语言查询对双语用户搜索英文文档有效，代码切换训练数据有助于提升IR模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite bilingual speakers frequently using mixed-language queries in web
searches, Information Retrieval (IR) research on them remains scarce. To
address this, we introduce MiLQ,Mixed-Language Query test set, the first public
benchmark of mixed-language queries, confirmed as realistic and highly
preferred. Experiments show that multilingual IR models perform moderately on
MiLQ and inconsistently across native, English, and mixed-language queries,
also suggesting code-switched training data's potential for robust IR models
handling such queries. Meanwhile, intentional English mixing in queries proves
an effective strategy for bilinguals searching English documents, which our
analysis attributes to enhanced token matching compared to native queries.

Abstract: With the growing success of reasoning models across complex natural language
tasks, researchers in the Information Retrieval (IR) community have begun
exploring how similar reasoning capabilities can be integrated into passage
rerankers built on Large Language Models (LLMs). These methods typically employ
an LLM to produce an explicit, step-by-step reasoning process before arriving
at a final relevance prediction. But, does reasoning actually improve reranking
accuracy? In this paper, we dive deeper into this question, studying the impact
of the reasoning process by comparing reasoning-based pointwise rerankers
(ReasonRR) to standard, non-reasoning pointwise rerankers (StandardRR) under
identical training conditions, and observe that StandardRR generally
outperforms ReasonRR. Building on this observation, we then study the
importance of reasoning to ReasonRR by disabling its reasoning process
(ReasonRR-NoReason), and find that ReasonRR-NoReason is surprisingly more
effective than ReasonRR. Examining the cause of this result, our findings
reveal that reasoning-based rerankers are limited by the LLM's reasoning
process, which pushes it toward polarized relevance scores and thus fails to
consider the partial relevance of passages, a key factor for the accuracy of
pointwise rerankers.

TLDR: 通过剔除低质量数据集和重新标记假阴性样本，提升了检索和重排序模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现某些训练数据集对模型效果有负面影响，假阴性问题显著，需改进数据质量。

Method: 提出级联LLM提示方法，识别并重新标记假阴性样本为真阳性。

Result: 重新标记后，E5和Qwen2.5-7B模型在BEIR和AIR-Bench上性能提升0.7-1.8 nDCG@10。

Conclusion: 级联设计可靠，GPT-4o标注与人类一致性高，数据质量优化显著提升模型效果。

Abstract: Training robust retrieval and reranker models typically relies on large-scale
retrieval datasets; for example, the BGE collection contains 1.6 million
query-passage pairs sourced from various data sources. However, we find that
certain datasets can negatively impact model effectiveness -- pruning 8 out of
15 datasets from the BGE collection reduces the training set size by
2.35$\times$ and increases nDCG@10 on BEIR by 1.0 point. This motivates a
deeper examination of training data quality, with a particular focus on "false
negatives", where relevant passages are incorrectly labeled as irrelevant. We
propose a simple, cost-effective approach using cascading LLM prompts to
identify and relabel hard negatives. Experimental results show that relabeling
false negatives with true positives improves both E5 (base) and Qwen2.5-7B
retrieval models by 0.7-1.4 nDCG@10 on BEIR and by 1.7-1.8 nDCG@10 on zero-shot
AIR-Bench evaluation. Similar gains are observed for rerankers fine-tuned on
the relabeled data, such as Qwen2.5-3B on BEIR. The reliability of the
cascading design is further supported by human annotation results, where we
find judgment by GPT-4o shows much higher agreement with humans than
GPT-4o-mini.

Conclusion: \name通过统一架构和RecPO框架，显著提升了推荐系统的性能，无需依赖专门推理标注。

Abstract: Large recommender models have extended LLMs as powerful recommenders via
encoding or item generation, and recent breakthroughs in LLM reasoning
synchronously motivate the exploration of reasoning in recommendation. Current
studies usually position LLMs as external reasoning modules to yield auxiliary
thought for augmenting conventional recommendation pipelines. However, such
decoupled designs are limited in significant resource cost and suboptimal joint
optimization. To address these issues, we propose \name, a unified large
recommender model with intrinsic reasoning capabilities. Initially, we
reconceptualize the model architecture to facilitate interleaved reasoning and
recommendation in the autoregressive process. Subsequently, we propose RecPO, a
corresponding reinforcement learning framework that optimizes \name\ both the
reasoning and recommendation capabilities simultaneously in a single policy
update; RecPO introduces a fused reward scheme that solely leverages
recommendation labels to simulate the reasoning capability, eliminating
dependency on specialized reasoning annotations. Experiments on three datasets
with various baselines verify the effectiveness of \name, showing relative
improvements of 68.67\% in Hit@5 and 45.21\% in NDCG@20. Code available at

Motivation: 解决Meta的HSTU方法中因异构信息映射到相同向量空间导致的训练不稳定问题。

Method: 采用双流架构，结合用户历史行为序列和少量属性信息，避免复杂特征工程。

Result: 在开源和工业数据集上表现优于DIN、DCN、DIEN和DeepFM等基线模型。

Conclusion: DFGR是一种高效且有效的下一代生成排序范式。

Abstract: We introduce the Dual-Flow Generative Ranking Network (DFGR), a two-stream
architecture designed for recommendation systems. DFGR integrates innovative
interaction patterns between real and fake flows within the QKV modules of the
self-attention mechanism, enhancing both training and inference efficiency.
This approach effectively addresses a key limitation observed in Meta's
proposed HSTU generative recommendation approach, where heterogeneous
information volumes are mapped into identical vector spaces, leading to
training instability. Unlike traditional recommendation models, DFGR only
relies on user history behavior sequences and minimal attribute information,
eliminating the need for extensive manual feature engineering. Comprehensive
evaluations on open-source and industrial datasets reveal DFGR's superior
performance compared to established baselines such as DIN, DCN, DIEN, and
DeepFM. We also investigate optimal parameter allocation strategies under
computational constraints, establishing DFGR as an efficient and effective
next-generation generate ranking paradigm.
