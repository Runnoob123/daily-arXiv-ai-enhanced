### [1] [Guardian Positioning System (GPS) for Location Based Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09743)
*Wenjie Liu,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文揭示了智能手机即使拥有多种定位信息来源，仍易受GNSS欺骗攻击，且Wi-Fi欺骗与GNSS干扰结合的攻击效果显著。作者提出了一种扩展的RAIM框架，利用冗余定位信息提升抗欺骗能力，检测准确率提高24-58%，5秒内检测攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代移动平台依赖多种定位技术，但易受欺骗攻击，威胁LBS功能。现有防御措施假设仅GNSS受攻击，效果有限，且智能手机难以部署专用硬件。

Method: 提出扩展的RAIM框架，结合GNSS、地面基础设施和传感器数据，利用冗余定位信息检测欺骗攻击。

Result: 扩展RAIM框架显著提升抗欺骗能力，检测准确率提高24-58%，5秒内检测攻击，误报率低。

Conclusion: 扩展RAIM框架有效填补智能手机抗欺骗防御的空白，为LBS安全提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Location-based service (LBS) applications proliferate and support
transportation, entertainment, and more. Modern mobile platforms, with
smartphones being a prominent example, rely on terrestrial and satellite
infrastructures (e.g., global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and
crowdsourced Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, and IP databases) for correct
positioning. However, they are vulnerable to attacks that manipulate positions
to control and undermine LBS functionality -- thus enabling the scamming of
users or services. Our work reveals that GNSS spoofing attacks succeed even
though smartphones have multiple sources of positioning information. Moreover,
that Wi-Fi spoofing attacks with GNSS jamming are surprisingly effective. More
concerning is the evidence that sophisticated, coordinated spoofing attacks are
highly effective. Attacks can target GNSS in combination with other positioning
methods, thus defenses that assume that only GNSS is under attack cannot be
effective. More so, resilient GNSS receivers and special-purpose antennas are
not feasible on smartphones. To address this gap, we propose an extended
receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) framework that leverages the
readily available, redundant, often so-called opportunistic positioning
information on off-the-shelf platforms. We jointly use onboard sensors,
terrestrial infrastructures, and GNSS. We show that our extended RAIM framework
improves resilience against location spoofing, e.g., achieving a detection
accuracy improvement of up to 24-58% compared to the state-of-the-art
algorithms and location providers; detecting attacks within 5 seconds, with a
low false positive rate.

### [2] [Automated Alert Classification and Triage (AACT): An Intelligent System for the Prioritisation of Cybersecurity Alerts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09843)
*Melissa Turcotte,François Labrèche,Serge-Olivier Paquette*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: AACT系统通过学习SOC分析师对网络安全警报的分类行为，自动预测并处理良性警报，减少分析师工作负担，提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业网络攻击面扩大导致安全警报数量激增，SOC分析师因处理大量良性警报而疲劳，需自动化解决方案。

Method: AACT系统通过学习分析师的分类行为，实时预测警报分类，自动关闭良性警报并优先处理关键警报。

Result: 系统在真实SOC环境中表现优异，减少61%的警报量，假阴性率仅为1.36%。

Conclusion: AACT系统能有效减轻SOC分析师负担，提升安全运营效率。

Abstract: Enterprise networks are growing ever larger with a rapidly expanding attack
surface, increasing the volume of security alerts generated from security
controls. Security Operations Centre (SOC) analysts triage these alerts to
identify malicious activity, but they struggle with alert fatigue due to the
overwhelming number of benign alerts. Organisations are turning to managed SOC
providers, where the problem is amplified by context switching and limited
visibility into business processes.
  A novel system, named AACT, is introduced that automates SOC workflows by
learning from analysts' triage actions on cybersecurity alerts. It accurately
predicts triage decisions in real time, allowing benign alerts to be closed
automatically and critical ones prioritised. This reduces the SOC queue
allowing analysts to focus on the most severe, relevant or ambiguous threats.
The system has been trained and evaluated on both real SOC data and an open
dataset, obtaining high performance in identifying malicious alerts from benign
alerts.
  Additionally, the system has demonstrated high accuracy in a real SOC
environment, reducing alerts shown to analysts by 61% over six months, with a
low false negative rate of 1.36% over millions of alerts.

### [3] [Correlating Account on Ethereum Mixing Service via Domain-Invariant feature learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09892)
*Zheng Che,Taoyu Li,Meng Shen,Hanbiao Du,Liehuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出StealthLink框架，通过跨任务域不变特征学习解决以太坊混币服务交易追踪中的数据稀缺和噪声问题，实现高性能的混币交易追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以太坊混币服务（如Tornado Cash）的交易不可追踪性对区块链安全和金融监管构成挑战，现有方法因标注数据有限和噪声问题难以实用。

Method: 提出StealthLink框架，包含MixFusion模块捕获局部交易模式，并通过对抗性差异最小化实现跨领域知识迁移。

Result: 在真实混币交易数据集上，StealthLink在10-shot学习场景中达到96.98%的F1分数，优于传统监督方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为区块链取证中的跨领域知识迁移提供了首个系统性方法，为打击去中心化生态系统中的隐私增强金融犯罪提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The untraceability of transactions facilitated by Ethereum mixing services
like Tornado Cash poses significant challenges to blockchain security and
financial regulation. Existing methods for correlating mixing accounts suffer
from limited labeled data and vulnerability to noisy annotations, which
restrict their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose StealthLink,
a novel framework that addresses these limitations through cross-task
domain-invariant feature learning. Our key innovation lies in transferring
knowledge from the well-studied domain of blockchain anomaly detection to the
data-scarce task of mixing transaction tracing. Specifically, we design a
MixFusion module that constructs and encodes mixing subgraphs to capture local
transactional patterns, while introducing a knowledge transfer mechanism that
aligns discriminative features across domains through adversarial discrepancy
minimization. This dual approach enables robust feature learning under label
scarcity and distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on real-world mixing
transaction datasets demonstrate that StealthLink achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with 96.98\% F1-score in 10-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our
framework shows superior generalization capability in imbalanced data
conditions than conventional supervised methods. This work establishes the
first systematic approach for cross-domain knowledge transfer in blockchain
forensics, providing a practical solution for combating privacy-enhanced
financial crimes in decentralized ecosystems.

### [4] [PIG: Privacy Jailbreak Attack on LLMs via Gradient-based Iterative In-Context Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09921)
*Yidan Wang,Yanan Cao,Yubing Ren,Fang Fang,Zheng Lin,Binxing Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的隐私泄露问题，提出了一种名为PIG的新框架，通过结合越狱攻击和隐私查询，显著提升了敏感信息提取的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估LLMs隐私泄露时存在局限性，且越狱攻击在隐私场景中的作用尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出PIG框架，通过识别PII实体、构建隐私上下文，并利用梯度策略迭代更新，以提取目标PII。

Result: 在多个LLMs上测试表明，PIG优于基线方法，达到SoTA效果，揭示了LLMs的重大隐私风险。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLMs的隐私风险，呼吁更强的保护措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various domains but pose inherent
privacy risks. Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use
memorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which
well-alignment models can easily block. Meanwhile, Jailbreak attacks bypass LLM
safety mechanisms to generate harmful content, but their role in privacy
scenarios remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of
jailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage
and jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework
targeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the
limitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII
entities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build
a privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based
strategies to elicit target PII. We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods
using two privacy-related datasets. Experiments on four white-box and two
black-box LLMs show that PIG outperforms baseline methods and achieves
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. The results underscore significant privacy
risks in LLMs, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards. Our code is

### [5] [DeFeed: Secure Decentralized Cross-Contract Data Feed in Web 3.0 for Connected Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09928)
*Xingchen Sun,Runhua Xu,Wei Ni,Li Duan,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出DeFeed协议，优化智能合约间通信，提升CAVs在Web 3.0中的协作效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约在跨合约通信和信息共享方面存在挑战，阻碍了CAVs在Web 3.0中的无缝协作。

Method: 提出DeFeed协议，包含多种功能（如池功能、缓存功能、订阅功能等），优化gas消耗并简化操作。

Result: 在以太坊测试网上验证，显著提升合约交互效率，降低计算复杂性和gas成本。

Conclusion: DeFeed为Web 3.0生态系统中的去中心化通信提供了关键解决方案。

Abstract: Smart contracts have been a topic of interest in blockchain research and are
a key enabling technology for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in the era
of Web 3.0. These contracts enable trustless interactions without the need for
intermediaries, as they operate based on predefined rules encoded on the
blockchain. However, smart contacts face significant challenges in
cross-contract communication and information sharing, making it difficult to
establish seamless connectivity and collaboration among CAVs with Web 3.0. In
this paper, we propose DeFeed, a novel secure protocol that incorporates
various gas-saving functions for CAVs, originated from in-depth research into
the interaction among smart contracts for decentralized cross-contract data
feed in Web 3.0. DeFeed allows smart contracts to obtain information from other
contracts efficiently in a single click, without complicated operations. We
judiciously design and complete various functions with DeFeed, including a pool
function and a cache function for gas optimization, a subscribe function for
facilitating data access, and an update function for the future iteration of
our protocol. Tailored for CAVs with Web 3.0 use cases, DeFeed enables
efficient data feed between smart contracts underpinning decentralized
applications and vehicle coordination. Implemented and tested on the Ethereum
official test network, DeFeed demonstrates significant improvements in contract
interaction efficiency, reducing computational complexity and gas costs. Our
solution represents a critical step towards seamless, decentralized
communication in Web 3.0 ecosystems.

### [6] [Security and Privacy Measurement on Chinese Consumer IoT Traffic based on Device Lifecycle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09929)
*Chenghua Jin,Yan Jia,Yuxin Song,Qingyin Tan,Rui Yang,Zheli Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 研究构建了中国首个大规模消费级物联网设备流量数据集，分析了流量目的地和加密实践，发现中国设备更依赖国内服务且加密表现较好，但仍存在证书验证和加密协议问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消费级物联网设备广泛使用但安全隐私风险增加，中国相关研究较少，填补这一空白。

Method: 提出细粒度流量收集指南，收集70个设备的数据，分析流量目的地和加密实践。

Result: 中国设备更依赖国内服务，加密表现较好，但部分设备存在证书验证和加密协议问题。

Conclusion: 研究填补了中国消费级物联网流量研究空白，数据集和指南开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: In recent years, consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become widely
used in daily life. With the popularity of devices, related security and
privacy risks arise at the same time as they collect user-related data and
transmit it to various service providers. Although China accounts for a larger
share of the consumer IoT industry, current analyses on consumer IoT device
traffic primarily focus on regions such as Europe, the United States, and
Australia. Research on China, however, is currently rather rare. This study
constructs the first large-scale dataset about consumer IoT device traffic in
China. Specifically, we propose a fine-grained traffic collection guidance
covering the entire lifecycle of consumer IoT devices, gathering traffic from
70 devices spanning 36 brands and 8 device categories. Based on this dataset,
we analyze traffic destinations and encryption practices across different
device types during the entire lifecycle and compare the findings with the
results of other regions. Compared to other regions, our results show that
consumer IoT devices in China rely more on domestic services and overally
perform better in terms of encryption practices. However, there are still 20/35
devices improperly conduct certificate validation, and 5/70 devices use
insecure encryption protocols. To facilitate future research, we open-source
our traffic collection guidance and make our dataset publicly available.

### [7] [Analysing Safety Risks in LLMs Fine-Tuned with Pseudo-Malicious Cyber Security Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09974)
*Adel ElZemity,Budi Arief,Shujun Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文系统评估了微调大语言模型（LLMs）在网络安全应用中的安全风险，提出了一种安全对齐方法，能够在保持技术效用的同时提升模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在网络安全应用中的潜力与风险，如威胁分析和恶意软件检测，同时关注数据泄露和新恶意软件生成等安全问题。

Method: 基于OWASP Top 10框架评估七种开源LLMs，提出并测试了一种通过重写指令-响应对以包含安全预防措施和伦理考量的安全对齐方法。

Result: 微调降低了所有测试LLMs的安全韧性（如Llama 3.1 8B的提示注入安全分数从0.95降至0.15），但安全对齐方法能有效提升安全性。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs的安全风险提供了系统评估，支持生成式AI在敏感领域的更安全应用，推动了安全、可信和伦理对齐LLMs的发展。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into cyber security
applications presents significant opportunities, such as enhancing threat
analysis and malware detection, but can also introduce critical risks and
safety concerns, including personal data leakage and automated generation of
new malware. We present a systematic evaluation of safety risks in fine-tuned
LLMs for cyber security applications. Using the OWASP Top 10 for LLM
Applications framework, we assessed seven open-source LLMs: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B,
Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B.
Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all
tested LLMs (e.g., the safety score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection
drops from 0.95 to 0.15). We propose and evaluate a safety alignment approach
that carefully rewords instruction-response pairs to include explicit safety
precautions and ethical considerations. This approach demonstrates that it is
possible to maintain or even improve model safety while preserving technical
utility, offering a practical path forward for developing safer fine-tuning
methodologies. This work offers a systematic evaluation for safety risks in
LLMs, enabling safer adoption of generative AI in sensitive domains, and
contributing towards the development of secure, trustworthy, and ethically
aligned LLMs.

### [8] [When Mitigations Backfire: Timing Channel Attacks and Defense for PRAC-Based RowHammer Mitigations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10111)
*Jeonghyun Woo,Joyce Qu,Gururaj Saileshwar,Prashant J. Nair*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: PRACLeak攻击利用PRAC框架中的时序漏洞泄露敏感信息，如AES密钥。TPRAC防御方案通过定时刷新消除时序漏洞，性能开销仅3.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRAC框架虽能缓解RowHammer漏洞，但引入了时序漏洞，可能泄露敏感信息。

Method: 提出TPRAC防御方案，采用定时刷新机制，独立于内存活动，消除时序漏洞。

Result: TPRAC成功关闭时序漏洞，性能开销低至3.4%。

Conclusion: TPRAC是一种高效且兼容现有标准的防御方案，解决了PRAC的时序漏洞问题。

Abstract: Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC) has emerged as a robust framework for
mitigating RowHammer (RH) vulnerabilities in modern DRAM systems. However, we
uncover a critical vulnerability: a timing channel introduced by the Alert
Back-Off (ABO) protocol and Refresh Management (RFM) commands. We present
PRACLeak, a novel attack that exploits these timing differences to leak
sensitive information, such as secret keys from vulnerable AES implementations,
by monitoring memory access latencies.
  To counter this, we propose Timing-Safe PRAC (TPRAC), a defense that
eliminates PRAC-induced timing channels without compromising RH mitigation
efficacy. TPRAC uses Timing-Based RFMs, issued periodically and independent of
memory activity. It requires only a single-entry in-DRAM mitigation queue per
DRAM bank and is compatible with existing DRAM standards. Our evaluations
demonstrate that TPRAC closes timing channels while incurring only 3.4%
performance overhead at the RH threshold of 1024.

### [9] [AttentionGuard: Transformer-based Misbehavior Detection for Secure Vehicular Platoons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10273)
*Hexu Li,Konstantinos Kalogiannis,Ahmed Mohamed Hussain,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出AttentionGuard，一种基于Transformer的框架，用于检测车辆编队系统中的异常行为，通过自注意力机制识别攻击，实验显示其高效且适用于实时应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车辆编队系统易受内部攻击，可能导致严重事故，因此需要高效的行为检测方法。

Method: 使用多头Transformer编码器处理运动数据，区分正常行为与攻击，适用于多种编队场景。

Result: 实验表明，AttentionGuard在攻击检测中F1-score达0.95，延迟低至100ms，性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Transformer编码器是保护智能交通系统免受内部威胁的有效方法，AttentionGuard具备实时应用潜力。

Abstract: Vehicle platooning, with vehicles traveling in close formation coordinated
through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, offers significant benefits
in fuel efficiency and road utilization. However, it is vulnerable to
sophisticated falsification attacks by authenticated insiders that can
destabilize the formation and potentially cause catastrophic collisions. This
paper addresses this challenge: misbehavior detection in vehicle platooning
systems. We present AttentionGuard, a transformer-based framework for
misbehavior detection that leverages the self-attention mechanism to identify
anomalous patterns in mobility data. Our proposal employs a multi-head
transformer-encoder to process sequential kinematic information, enabling
effective differentiation between normal mobility patterns and falsification
attacks across diverse platooning scenarios, including steady-state
(no-maneuver) operation, join, and exit maneuvers. Our evaluation uses an
extensive simulation dataset featuring various attack vectors (constant,
gradual, and combined falsifications) and operational parameters (controller
types, vehicle speeds, and attacker positions). Experimental results
demonstrate that AttentionGuard achieves up to 0.95 F1-score in attack
detection, with robust performance maintained during complex maneuvers.
Notably, our system performs effectively with minimal latency (100ms decision
intervals), making it suitable for real-time transportation safety
applications. Comparative analysis reveals superior detection capabilities and
establishes the transformer-encoder as a promising approach for securing
Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) against sophisticated insider
threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在MLaaS中因集中处理敏感数据而引发的隐私问题。

Method: 利用安全多方计算和同态加密等密码学技术实现隐私保护的推理（PTI）。

Result: 总结了PTI的最新进展和挑战，提出了分类和评估框架，平衡资源效率与隐私。

Conclusion: PTI为高隐私需求的AI应用提供了可行方案，但仍需进一步优化性能与隐私的平衡。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized AI, powering applications like content
generation and sentiment analysis. However, their deployment in Machine
Learning as a Service (MLaaS) raises significant privacy concerns, primarily
due to the centralized processing of sensitive user data. Private Transformer
Inference (PTI) offers a solution by utilizing cryptographic techniques such as
secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption, enabling inference
while preserving both user data and model privacy. This paper reviews recent
PTI advancements, highlighting state-of-the-art solutions and challenges. We
also introduce a structured taxonomy and evaluation framework for PTI, focusing
on balancing resource efficiency with privacy and bridging the gap between
high-performance inference and data privacy.

### [11] [One For All: Formally Verifying Protocols which use Aggregate Signatures (extended version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10316)
*Xenia Hofmeier,Andrea Raguso,Ralf Sasse,Dennis Jackson,David Basin*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出了首个可用于形式化验证工具的聚合签名模型，并展示了其在实际协议（如SANA）中的应用，发现了未记录的假设可能导致攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BLS聚合签名虽被广泛使用，但其正确使用要求复杂，开发者需谨慎处理。本文旨在通过形式化验证工具解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了基于通用聚合签名的模型，并特别针对BLS聚合签名建模，使用Tamarin工具验证协议安全性。

Result: 在Tamarin中建模并分析了SANA协议，发现了未记录的假设可能导致攻击。

Conclusion: 本文的模型为聚合签名的安全验证提供了新方法，揭示了实际协议中潜在的安全隐患。

Abstract: Aggregate signatures are digital signatures that compress multiple signatures
from different parties into a single signature, thereby reducing storage and
bandwidth requirements. BLS aggregate signatures are a popular kind of
aggregate signature, deployed by Ethereum, Dfinity, and Cloudflare amongst
others, currently undergoing standardization at the IETF. However, BLS
aggregate signatures are difficult to use correctly, with nuanced requirements
that must be carefully handled by protocol developers.
  In this work, we design the first models of aggregate signatures that enable
formal verification tools, such as Tamarin and ProVerif, to be applied to
protocols using these signatures. We introduce general models that are based on
the cryptographic security definition of generic aggregate signatures, allowing
the attacker to exploit protocols where the security requirements are not
satisfied. We also introduce a second family of models formalizing BLS
aggregate signatures in particular. We demonstrate our approach's practical
relevance by modelling and analyzing in Tamarin a device attestation protocol
called SANA. Despite SANA's claimed correctness proof, with Tamarin we uncover
undocumented assumptions that, when omitted, lead to attacks.

### [12] [AutoPentest: Enhancing Vulnerability Management With Autonomous LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10321)
*Julius Henke*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）进行渗透测试的潜力，提出了基于GPT-4o和LangChain的AutoPentest工具，并在实验中表现略优于ChatGPT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过LLM降低渗透测试成本并提高频率。

Method: 基于GPT-4o和LangChain开发AutoPentest工具，支持多步骤任务和外部工具集成，并与ChatGPT-4o手动操作进行对比实验。

Result: AutoPentest和ChatGPT均能完成15-25%的子任务，前者略优；AutoPentest总成本为96.20美元，ChatGPT Plus月费20美元。

Conclusion: 未来通过改进实现和使用更强大的LLM，AutoPentest有望成为漏洞管理的可行方案。

Abstract: A recent area of increasing research is the use of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in penetration testing, which promises to reduce costs and thus allow
for higher frequency. We conduct a review of related work, identifying best
practices and common evaluation issues. We then present AutoPentest, an
application for performing black-box penetration tests with a high degree of
autonomy. AutoPentest is based on the LLM GPT-4o from OpenAI and the LLM agent
framework LangChain. It can perform complex multi-step tasks, augmented by
external tools and knowledge bases. We conduct a study on three
capture-the-flag style Hack The Box (HTB) machines, comparing our
implementation AutoPentest with the baseline approach of manually using the
ChatGPT-4o user interface. Both approaches are able to complete 15-25 % of the
subtasks on the HTB machines, with AutoPentest slightly outperforming ChatGPT.
We measure a total cost of \$96.20 US when using AutoPentest across all
experiments, while a one-month subscription to ChatGPT Plus costs \$20. The
results show that further implementation efforts and the use of more powerful
LLMs released in the future are likely to make this a viable part of
vulnerability management.

### [13] [Locally Differentially Private Frequency Estimation via Joint Randomized Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10349)
*Ye Zheng,Shafizur Rahman Seeam,Yidan Hu,Rui Zhang,Yanchao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种基于联合随机响应（JRR）的新机制，通过相关数据扰动实现本地差分隐私频率估计，显著提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本地差分隐私（LDP）机制在隐私保护与数据效用之间存在权衡，强隐私常以降低数据效用为代价。JRR旨在改善这一权衡。

Method: JRR将数据贡献者分为两人组，组内成员联合扰动二进制数据，隐藏组信息以保持隐私，同时提高频率估计准确性。

Result: 理论分析和仿真表明，JRR在保持与经典随机响应相同隐私水平的同时，频率估计准确性在大多数情况下提高了两个数量级。

Conclusion: JRR是一种有效的LDP频率估计方法，显著提升了数据效用而不牺牲隐私保护。

Abstract: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) has been widely recognized as a powerful
tool for providing a strong theoretical guarantee of data privacy to data
contributors against an untrusted data collector. Under a typical LDP scheme,
each data contributor independently randomly perturbs their data before
submitting them to the data collector, which in turn infers valuable statistics
about the original data from received perturbed data. Common to existing LDP
mechanisms is an inherent trade-off between the level of privacy protection and
data utility in the sense that strong data privacy often comes at the cost of
reduced data utility. Frequency estimation based on Randomized Response (RR) is
a fundamental building block of many LDP mechanisms. In this paper, we propose
a novel Joint Randomized Response (JRR) mechanism based on correlated data
perturbations to achieve locally differentially private frequency estimation.
JRR divides data contributors into disjoint groups of two members and lets
those in the same group jointly perturb their binary data to improve
frequency-estimation accuracy and achieve the same level of data privacy by
hiding the group membership information in contrast to the classical RR
mechanism. Theoretical analysis and detailed simulation studies using both real
and synthetic datasets show that JRR achieves the same level of data privacy as
the classical RR mechanism while improving the frequency-estimation accuracy in
the overwhelming majority of the cases by up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: We study the security of stock price forecasting using Deep Learning (DL) in
computational finance. Despite abundant prior research on the vulnerability of
DL to adversarial perturbations, such work has hitherto hardly addressed
practical adversarial threat models in the context of DL-powered algorithmic
trading systems (ATS). Specifically, we investigate the vulnerability of ATS to
adversarial perturbations launched by a realistically constrained attacker. We
first show that existing literature has paid limited attention to DL security
in the financial domain, which is naturally attractive for adversaries. Then,
we formalize the concept of ephemeral perturbations (EP), which can be used to
stage a novel type of attack tailored for DL-based ATS. Finally, we carry out
an end-to-end evaluation of our EP against a profitable ATS. Our results reveal
that the introduction of small changes to the input stock prices not only (i)
induces the DL model to behave incorrectly but also (ii) leads the whole ATS to
make suboptimal buy/sell decisions, resulting in a worse financial performance
of the targeted ATS.

Abstract: While providing economic and software development value, software supply
chains are only as strong as their weakest link. Over the past several years,
there has been an exponential increase in cyberattacks, specifically targeting
vulnerable links in critical software supply chains. These attacks disrupt the
day-to-day functioning and threaten the security of nearly everyone on the
internet, from billion-dollar companies and government agencies to hobbyist
open-source developers. The ever-evolving threat of software supply chain
attacks has garnered interest from the software industry and the US government
in improving software supply chain security.
  On September 20, 2024, three researchers from the NSF-backed Secure Software
Supply Chain Center (S3C2) conducted a Secure Software Supply Chain Summit with
a diverse set of 12 practitioners from 9 companies. The goals of the Summit
were to: (1) to enable sharing between individuals from different companies
regarding practical experiences and challenges with software supply chain
security, (2) to help form new collaborations, (3) to share our observations
from our previous summits with industry, and (4) to learn about practitioners'
challenges to inform our future research direction. The summit consisted of
discussions of six topics relevant to the companies represented, including
updating vulnerable dependencies, component and container choice, malicious
commits, building infrastructure, large language models, and reducing entire
classes of vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning attacks by malicious
adversaries. Existing methods often involve high costs to achieve effective
attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a sybil-based virtual data
poisoning attack, where a malicious client generates sybil nodes to amplify the
poisoning model's impact. To reduce neural network computational complexity, we
develop a virtual data generation method based on gradient matching. We also
design three schemes for target model acquisition, applicable to online local,
online global, and offline scenarios. In simulation, our method outperforms
other attack algorithms since our method can obtain a global target model under
non-independent uniformly distributed data.

*Long Chen,Xiaotian Song,Yanan Sun*

TLDR: LAS是一种无损的ANN-SNN转换方法，解决了现有方法在极端激活异常和非线性操作上的问题，实现了完全脉冲驱动的LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ANN-to-SNN转换方法在处理极端激活异常和ANN非线性操作时表现不佳，需要一种无损的转换方法。

Method: LAS引入两种新型神经元，用于转换ANN的激活异常和非线性操作，并定制了脉冲等效的Transformer组件。

Result: 在六种语言模型和两种视觉语言模型上验证了LAS的无损转换能力，OPT-66B在WSC任务上准确率提升2%。

Conclusion: LAS实现了无损的ANN-SNN转换，并通过实验和消融研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Spiking Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an energy-efficient
alternative to conventional LLMs through their event-driven computation. To
effectively obtain spiking LLMs, researchers develop different ANN-to-SNN
conversion methods by leveraging pre-trained ANN parameters while inheriting
the energy efficiency of SNN. However, existing conversion methods struggle
with extreme activation outliers and incompatible nonlinear operations of
ANN-based LLMs. To address this, we propose a loss-less ANN-SNN conversion for
fully spike-driven LLMs, termed LAS. Specifically, LAS introduces two novel
neurons to convert the activation outlier and nonlinear operation of ANN-based
LLMs. Moreover, LAS tailors the spike-equivalent Transformer components for
spiking LLMs, which can ensure full spiking conversion without any loss of
performance. Experimental results on six language models and two
vision-language models demonstrate that LAS achieves loss-less conversion.
Notably, on OPT-66B, LAS even improves the accuracy of 2\% on the WSC task. In
addition, the parameter and ablation studies further verify the effectiveness
of LAS. The source code is available at https://github.com/lc783/LAS

TLDR: 本文提出了一种通用且可扩展的方法，使大型语言模型（LLM）能够在低精度模拟硬件上高效运行，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟内存计算（AIMC）在提升神经网络推理速度和能效方面具有潜力，但其噪声和量化约束限制了LLM的性能。现有方法难以适用于大规模预训练模型。

Method: 作者提出了一种通用方法，通过训练适应噪声和低精度约束，使LLM在模拟硬件上保持性能。该方法还支持低精度数字硬件的量化推理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法使Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct和Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct等模型在模拟硬件上性能接近4位权重、8位激活的基准。此外，模型在测试时计算扩展中表现更优。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了高容量LLM与高效模拟硬件之间的鸿沟，为能效优化的基础模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) is a promising compute paradigm to improve
speed and power efficiency of neural network inference beyond the limits of
conventional von Neumann-based architectures. However, AIMC introduces
fundamental challenges such as noisy computations and strict constraints on
input and output quantization. Because of these constraints and imprecisions,
off-the-shelf LLMs are not able to achieve 4-bit-level performance when
deployed on AIMC-based hardware. While researchers previously investigated
recovering this accuracy gap on small, mostly vision-based models, a generic
method applicable to LLMs pre-trained on trillions of tokens does not yet
exist. In this work, we introduce a general and scalable method to robustly
adapt LLMs for execution on noisy, low-precision analog hardware. Our approach
enables state-of-the-art models $\unicode{x2013}$ including
Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct $\unicode{x2013}$ to retain
performance comparable to 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation baselines, despite the
presence of analog noise and quantization constraints. Additionally, we show
that as a byproduct of our training methodology, analog foundation models can
be quantized for inference on low-precision digital hardware. Finally, we show
that our models also benefit from test-time compute scaling, showing better
scaling behavior than models trained with 4-bit weight and 8-bit static input
quantization. Our work bridges the gap between high-capacity LLMs and efficient
analog hardware, offering a path toward energy-efficient foundation models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现图遗忘会导致预测分布与敏感属性高度相关，从而引入偏见，因此需要一种兼顾隐私和公平的方法。

Conclusion: FGU是一种有效的公平图遗忘方法，解决了偏见问题并保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Graph unlearning is a crucial approach for protecting user privacy by erasing
the influence of user data on trained graph models. Recent developments in
graph unlearning methods have primarily focused on maintaining model prediction
performance while removing user information. However, we have observed that
when user information is deleted from the model, the prediction distribution
across different sensitive groups often changes. Furthermore, graph models are
shown to be prone to amplifying biases, making the study of fairness in graph
unlearning particularly important. This raises the question: Does graph
unlearning actually introduce bias? Our findings indicate that the predictions
of post-unlearning models become highly correlated with sensitive attributes,
confirming the introduction of bias in the graph unlearning process. To address
this issue, we propose a fair graph unlearning method, FGU. To guarantee
privacy, FGU trains shard models on partitioned subgraphs, unlearns the
requested data from the corresponding subgraphs, and retrains the shard models
on the modified subgraphs. To ensure fairness, FGU employs a bi-level debiasing
process: it first enables shard-level fairness by incorporating a fairness
regularizer in the shard model retraining, and then achieves global-level
fairness by aligning all shard models to minimize global disparity. Our
experiments demonstrate that FGU achieves superior fairness while maintaining
privacy and accuracy. Additionally, FGU is robust to diverse unlearning
requests, ensuring fairness and utility performance across various data
distributions.

Conclusion: 聚类策略能有效解决FL在AIoT中的异构性和能源问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: While substantial research has been devoted to optimizing model performance,
convergence rates, and communication efficiency, the energy implications of
federated learning (FL) within Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)
scenarios are often overlooked in the existing literature. This study examines
the energy consumed during the FL process, focusing on three main
energy-intensive processes: pre-processing, communication, and local learning,
all contributing to the overall energy footprint. We rely on the observation
that device/client selection is crucial for speeding up the convergence of
model training in a distributed AIoT setting and propose two
clustering-informed methods. These clustering solutions are designed to group
AIoT devices with similar label distributions, resulting in clusters composed
of nearly heterogeneous devices. Hence, our methods alleviate the heterogeneity
often encountered in real-world distributed learning applications. Throughout
extensive numerical experimentation, we demonstrate that our clustering
strategies typically achieve high convergence rates while maintaining low
energy consumption when compared to other recent approaches available in the
literature.

Motivation: 探索DMNNs的非线性特性及其层间激活的重要性，同时尝试在参数约束下设计新架构。

Method: 提出多种DMNNs架构，分别对参数或可学习参数施加形态学操作约束，并设计混合线性与形态学层的网络。

Result: 成功训练了约束下的DMNNs，证明其可剪枝性优于线性网络，混合架构显著加速大批次梯度下降收敛。

Conclusion: DMNNs在特定约束下可训练且高效，但泛化能力有限，混合架构为优化训练提供了新方向。

Abstract: We investigate deep morphological neural networks (DMNNs). We demonstrate
that despite their inherent non-linearity, activations between layers are
essential for DMNNs. We then propose several new architectures for DMNNs, each
with a different constraint on their parameters. For the first (resp. second)
architecture, we work under the constraint that the majority of parameters
(resp. learnable parameters) should be part of morphological operations. We
empirically show that our proposed networks can be successfully trained, and
are more prunable than linear networks. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to successfully train DMNNs under such constraints, although the
generalization capabilities of our networks remain limited. Finally, we propose
a hybrid network architecture combining linear and morphological layers,
showing empirically that the inclusion of morphological layers significantly
accelerates the convergence of gradient descent with large batches.

TLDR: 论文探讨了如何通过组合实现分布外泛化（OOD），并强调仅测试OOD性能不足以证明算法学习了组合结构，还需验证特征的组合性。通过实验展示了常见神经网络在OOD任务中的局限性，并提出两种新架构，但发现即使性能优异，仍可能无法正确学习组合特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分布外泛化（OOD）作为智能的标志，强调组合性在实现OOD中的重要性，并指出仅依赖OOD测试不足以验证算法的组合学习能力。

Method: 通过对比三种常见神经网络（MLP、CNN、Transformer）在明确OOD指标任务中的表现，开发两种具有偏置的新架构，验证其OOD性能及组合特征学习能力。

Result: 实验表明，常见神经网络无法解决OOD任务，而新架构虽在OOD性能上表现优异，但仍可能无法正确学习组合特征。

Conclusion: 仅依赖OOD性能测试不足以验证算法的组合学习能力，需进一步验证特征的组合性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation is considered a hallmark of human
and animal intelligence. To achieve OOD through composition, a system must
discover the environment-invariant properties of experienced input-output
mappings and transfer them to novel inputs. This can be realised if an
intelligent system can identify appropriate, task-invariant, and composable
input features, as well as the composition methods, thus allowing it to act
based not on the interpolation between learnt data points but on the
task-invariant composition of those features. We propose that in order to
confirm that an algorithm does indeed learn compositional structures from data,
it is not enough to just test on an OOD setup, but one also needs to confirm
that the features identified are indeed compositional. We showcase this by
exploring two tasks with clearly defined OOD metrics that are not OOD solvable
by three commonly used neural networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Transformer. In addition, we develop
two novel network architectures imbued with biases that allow them to be
successful in OOD scenarios. We show that even with correct biases and almost
perfect OOD performance, an algorithm can still fail to learn the correct
features for compositional generalisation.

Result: 在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上实验表明，模型性能（如macro-F1 Score）显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据质量问题，提供了鲁棒、可扩展且隐私合规的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) presents an effective solution for collaborative
model training while maintaining data privacy across decentralized client
datasets. However, data quality issues such as noisy labels, missing classes,
and imbalanced distributions significantly challenge its effectiveness. This
study proposes a federated learning methodology that systematically addresses
data quality issues, including noise, class imbalance, and missing labels. The
proposed approach systematically enhances data integrity through adaptive noise
cleaning, collaborative conditional GAN-based synthetic data generation, and
robust federated model training. Experimental evaluations conducted on
benchmark datasets (MNIST and Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate significant
improvements in federated model performance, particularly macro-F1 Score, under
varying noise and class imbalance conditions. Additionally, the proposed
framework carefully balances computational feasibility and substantial
performance gains, ensuring practicality for resource constrained edge devices
while rigorously maintaining data privacy. Our results indicate that this
method effectively mitigates common data quality challenges, providing a
robust, scalable, and privacy compliant solution suitable for diverse
real-world federated learning scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法通过学习能量分布结构，提升了全局优化能力，适用于不同查询成本场景。

Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial
optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP
problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the
black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model
the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the
network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high
temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low
temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and
facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the
temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and
improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard,
the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the
black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under
both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance
against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.

Result: 框架支持迁移学习和主动学习，理论证明了在线性函数逼近下的收敛性。

Conclusion: 首个结合社区结构、可迁移性和主动学习的MARL框架，具有理论保证。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
where the agents cooperate in a time-evolving network with latent community
structures and mixed memberships. Unlike traditional neighbor-based or fixed
interaction graphs, our community-based framework captures flexible and
abstract coordination patterns by allowing each agent to belong to multiple
overlapping communities. Each community maintains shared policy and value
functions, which are aggregated by individual agents according to personalized
membership weights. We also design actor-critic algorithms that exploit this
structure: agents inherit community-level estimates for policy updates and
value learning, enabling structured information sharing without requiring
access to other agents' policies. Importantly, our approach supports both
transfer learning by adapting to new agents or tasks via membership estimation,
and active learning by prioritizing uncertain communities during exploration.
Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees under linear function
approximation for both actor and critic updates. To our knowledge, this is the
first MARL framework that integrates community structure, transferability, and
active learning with provable guarantees.

Result: 实验证明攻击算法能有效使对手模型偏离用户偏好。

Conclusion: 噪声和对抗性数据筛选对生成模型有显著影响，需进一步研究防御机制。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have made it increasingly difficult to
distinguish real data from model-generated synthetic data. Using synthetic data
for successive training of future model generations creates "self-consuming
loops", which may lead to model collapse or training instability. Furthermore,
synthetic data is often subject to human feedback and curated by users based on
their preferences. Ferbach et al. (2024) recently showed that when data is
curated according to user preferences, the self-consuming retraining loop
drives the model to converge toward a distribution that optimizes those
preferences. However, in practice, data curation is often noisy or
adversarially manipulated. For example, competing platforms may recruit
malicious users to adversarially curate data and disrupt rival models. In this
paper, we study how generative models evolve under self-consuming retraining
loops with noisy and adversarially curated data. We theoretically analyze the
impact of such noisy data curation on generative models and identify conditions
for the robustness of the retraining process. Building on this analysis, we
design attack algorithms for competitive adversarial scenarios, where a
platform with a limited budget employs malicious users to misalign a rival's
model from actual user preferences. Experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Conclusion: LMC显著提升了检查点数据的压缩效率，为更高频率的检查点提供了可能。

Abstract: During the training of Large Language Models (LLMs), tensor data is
periodically "checkpointed" to persistent storage to allow recovery of work
done in the event of failure. The volume of data that must be copied during
each checkpoint, even when using reduced-precision representations such as
bfloat16, often reaches hundreds of gigabytes. Furthermore, the data must be
moved across a network and written to a storage system before the next epoch
occurs. With a view to ultimately building an optimized checkpointing solution,
this paper presents experimental analysis of checkpoint data used to derive a
design that maximizes the use of lossless compression to reduce the volume of
data. We examine how tensor data and its compressibility evolve during model
training and evaluate the efficacy of existing common off-the-shelf general
purpose compression engines combined with known data optimization techniques
such as byte-grouping and incremental delta compression.
  Leveraging our analysis we have built an effective compression solution,
known as Language Model Compressor (LMC), which is based on byte-grouping and
Huffman encoding. LMC offers more compression performance than the best
alternative (BZ2) but with an order-of-magnitude reduction in the time needed
to perform the compression. We show that a 16-core parallel implementation of
LMC can attain compression and decompression throughput of 2.78 GiB/s and 3.76
GiB/s respectively. This increase in performance ultimately reduces the CPU
resources needed and provides more time to copy the data to the storage system
before the next epoch thus allowing for higher-frequency checkpoints.

Abstract: Stroke remains one of the most critical global health challenges, ranking as
the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability
worldwide. This study explores the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms
in predicting stroke risk using demographic, clinical, and lifestyle data from
the Stroke Prediction Dataset. By addressing key methodological challenges such

the development of more reliable and interpretable models for the early

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used, understanding them
systematically is key to improving their safety and realizing their full
potential. Although many models are aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), they are still vulnerable to
jailbreaking attacks. Some of the existing adversarial attack methods search
for discrete tokens that may jailbreak a target model while others try to
optimize the continuous space represented by the tokens of the model's
vocabulary. While techniques based on the discrete space may prove to be
inefficient, optimization of continuous token embeddings requires projections
to produce discrete tokens, which might render them ineffective. To fully
utilize the constraints and the structures of the space, we develop an
intrinsic optimization technique using exponentiated gradient descent with the
Bregman projection method to ensure that the optimized one-hot encoding always
stays within the probability simplex. We prove the convergence of the technique
and implement an efficient algorithm that is effective in jailbreaking several
widely used LLMs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique using
five open-source LLMs on four openly available datasets. The results show that
the technique achieves a higher success rate with great efficiency compared to
three other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques. The source code for our
implementation is available at:

Abstract: Graph learning, or network inference, is a prominent problem in graph signal
processing (GSP). GSP generalizes the Fourier transform to non-Euclidean
domains, and graph learning is pivotal to applying GSP when these domains are
unknown. With the recent prevalence of multi-way data, there has been growing
interest in product graphs that naturally factorize dependencies across
different ways. However, the types of graph products that can be learned are
still limited for modeling diverse dependency structures. In this paper, we
study the problem of learning a Kronecker-structured product graph from smooth
signals. Unlike the more commonly used Cartesian product, the Kronecker product
models dependencies in a more intricate, non-separable way, but posits harder
constraints on the graph learning problem. To tackle this non-convex problem,
we propose an alternating scheme to optimize each factor graph and provide
theoretical guarantees for its asymptotic convergence. The proposed algorithm
is also modified to learn factor graphs of the strong product. We conduct
experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs and demonstrate our approach's
efficacy and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，能够完美恢复比现有技术大两个数量级的数据批次。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了联邦学习中的新安全漏洞，强调了隐私保护的挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of machine learning
models across distributed clients without sharing raw data, ostensibly
preserving data privacy. Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed critical
vulnerabilities in FL, showing that a malicious central server can manipulate
model updates to reconstruct clients' private training data. Existing data
reconstruction attacks have important limitations: they often rely on
assumptions about the clients' data distribution or their efficiency
significantly degrades when batch sizes exceed just a few tens of samples.
  In this work, we introduce a novel data reconstruction attack that overcomes
these limitations. Our method leverages a new geometric perspective on fully
connected layers to craft malicious model parameters, enabling the perfect
recovery of arbitrarily large data batches in classification tasks without any
prior knowledge of clients' data. Through extensive experiments on both image
and tabular datasets, we demonstrate that our attack outperforms existing
methods and achieves perfect reconstruction of data batches two orders of
magnitude larger than the state of the art.

Conclusion: FeRA是一种模型无关、攻击无关且无需标记数据的防御方法，适合资源受限的边缘部署。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enhances privacy and reduces communication cost for
resource-constrained edge clients by supporting distributed model training at
the edge. However, the heterogeneous nature of such devices produces diverse,
non-independent, and identically distributed (non-IID) data, making the
detection of backdoor attacks more challenging. In this paper, we propose a
novel federated representative-attention-based defense mechanism, named FeRA,
that leverages cross-client attention over internal feature representations to
distinguish benign from malicious clients. FeRA computes an anomaly score based
on representation reconstruction errors, effectively identifying clients whose
internal activations significantly deviate from the group consensus. Our
evaluation demonstrates FeRA's robustness across various FL scenarios,
including challenging non-IID data distributions typical of edge devices.
Experimental results show that it effectively reduces backdoor attack success
rates while maintaining high accuracy on the main task. The method is
model-agnostic, attack-agnostic, and does not require labeled reference data,
making it well suited to heterogeneous and resource-limited edge deployments.

representation learning featuring two distinct node types: genes and images.
The network can effectively classify Alzheimer's disease (AD) into three
distinct stages:AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitive Normal (CN)
classes, utilizing a small dataset. Additionally, it identified which genes
play a significant role in each of these classification groups. We evaluate the
performance of our approach using metrics including classification accuracy,
recall, precision, and F1 score. The proposed technique holds potential for
extending to radiogenomic-based classification to other diseases.

Abstract: Traditional entropy-based methods - such as cross-entropy loss in
classification problems - have long been essential tools for quantifying
uncertainty and disorder in data and developing artificial intelligence
algorithms. However, the rapid growth of data across various domains has
introduced new challenges, particularly the integration of heterogeneous
datasets with intrinsic disparities. In this paper, we extend zentropy theory
into the data science domain by introducing intrinsic entropy, enabling more
effective learning from heterogeneous data sources. We propose a
zentropy-enhanced neural network (ZENN) that simultaneously learns both energy
and intrinsic entropy components, capturing the underlying structure of
multi-source data. To support this, we redesign the neural network architecture
to better reflect the intrinsic properties and variability inherent in diverse
datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ZENN on classification tasks and
energy landscape reconstructions, showing its superior generalization
capabilities and robustness-particularly in predicting high-order derivatives.
As a practical application, we employ ZENN to reconstruct the Helmholtz energy
landscape of Fe3Pt using data generated from DFT and capture key material
behaviors, including negative thermal expansion and the critical point in the
temperature-pressure space. Overall, our study introduces a novel approach for
data-driven machine learning grounded in zentropy theory, highlighting ZENN as
a versatile and robust deep learning framework for scientific problems
involving complex, heterogeneous datasets.

Abstract: As demand for intelligent services rises and edge devices become more
capable, distributed learning at the network edge has emerged as a key enabling
technology. While existing paradigms like federated learning (FL) and
decentralized FL (DFL) enable privacy-preserving distributed learning in many
scenarios, they face potential challenges in connectivity and synchronization
imposed by resource-constrained and infrastructure-less environments. While
more robust, gossip learning (GL) algorithms have generally been designed for
homogeneous data distributions and may not suit all contexts. This paper
introduces Chisme, a novel suite of protocols designed to address the
challenges of implementing robust intelligence in the network edge,
characterized by heterogeneous data distributions, episodic connectivity, and
lack of infrastructure. Chisme includes both synchronous DFL (Chisme-DFL) and
asynchronous GL (Chisme-GL) variants that enable collaborative yet
decentralized model training that considers underlying data heterogeneity. We
introduce a data similarity heuristic that allows agents to opportunistically
infer affinity with each other using the existing communication of model
updates in decentralized FL and GL. We leverage the heuristic to extend DFL's
model aggregation and GL's model merge mechanisms for better personalized
training while maintaining collaboration. While Chisme-DFL is a synchronous
decentralized approach whose resource utilization scales linearly with network
size, Chisme-GL is fully asynchronous and has a lower, constant resource
requirement independent of network size. We demonstrate that Chisme methods
outperform their standard counterparts in model training over distributed and
heterogeneous data in network scenarios ranging from less connected and
reliable networks to fully connected and lossless networks.

Motivation: 理解Transformer模型中IWL和ICL的相互作用及其平衡机制，借鉴进化生物学的类比策略。

Method: 通过回归和分类任务实验，操作环境稳定性和线索可靠性，系统研究其对IWL/ICL平衡的影响。

Result: 高环境稳定性显著偏好IWL，而高线索可靠性增强ICL效果；学习动态显示任务依赖的时序演变。

Conclusion: 可预测性是Transformer中学习模式平衡的关键因素，为理解ICL和优化训练方法提供新视角。

Abstract: Transformer models learn in two distinct modes: in-weights learning (IWL),
encoding knowledge into model weights, and in-context learning (ICL), adapting
flexibly to context without weight modification. To better understand the
interplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary
biology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,
adapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and
phenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to
environmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability
dictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic
encoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We
experimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and
systematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in
Transformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high
environmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp
transition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL
efficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics
reveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift
occurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we
demonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL
acquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding
to ICL dominance. These findings support a relative-cost hypothesis for
explaining these learning mode transitions, establishing predictability as a
critical factor governing adaptive strategies in Transformers, and offering
novel insights for understanding ICL and guiding training methodologies.

Motivation: 大型模型训练成本高昂，阻碍了非富裕个体参与AI发展，且增加了消费者成本。现有剪枝方法计算量大且环境负担重。

Result: BINGO提供了一种计算量更小、精度保持的剪枝技术。

Conclusion: BINGO实现了AI发展无需依赖模型规模增长的目标。

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning has increased
exponentially. Models are far more complex than ever before, growing to
gargantuan sizes and housing millions of weights. Unfortunately, the fact that
large models have become the state of the art means that it often costs
millions of dollars to train and operate them. These expenses not only hurt
companies but also bar non-wealthy individuals from contributing to new
developments and force consumers to pay greater prices for AI. Current methods
used to prune models, such as iterative magnitude pruning, have shown great
accuracy but require an iterative training sequence that is incredibly
computationally and environmentally taxing. To solve this problem, BINGO is
introduced. BINGO, during the training pass, studies specific subsets of a
neural network one at a time to gauge how significant of a role each weight
plays in contributing to a network's accuracy. By the time training is done,
BINGO generates a significance score for each weight, allowing for
insignificant weights to be pruned in one shot. BINGO provides an
accuracy-preserving pruning technique that is less computationally intensive
than current methods, allowing for a world where AI growth does not have to
mean model growth, as well.

Conclusion: KQT-EWMA是一种高效且灵活的非参数化变化检测方法。

Abstract: We present Kernel-QuantTree Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (KQT-EWMA),
a non-parametric change-detection algorithm that combines the Kernel-QuantTree
(KQT) histogram and the EWMA statistic to monitor multivariate data streams
online. The resulting monitoring scheme is very flexible, since histograms can
be used to model any stationary distribution, and practical, since the
distribution of test statistics does not depend on the distribution of
datastream in stationary conditions (non-parametric monitoring). KQT-EWMA
enables controlling false alarms by operating at a pre-determined Average Run
Length ($ARL_0$), which measures the expected number of stationary samples to
be monitored before triggering a false alarm. The latter peculiarity is in
contrast with most non-parametric change-detection tests, which rarely can
control the $ARL_0$ a priori. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that KQT-EWMA can control $ARL_0$ while achieving
detection delays comparable to or lower than state-of-the-art methods designed
to work in the same conditions.

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟人类行为和自动化决策方面具有潜力，但在复杂环境中的适应性仍需改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate or automate
human behavior in complex sequential decision-making tasks. A natural question
is then whether LLMs exhibit similar decision-making behavior to humans, and
can achieve comparable (or superior) performance. In this work, we focus on the
exploration-exploitation (E&E) tradeoff, a fundamental aspect of dynamic
decision-making under uncertainty. We employ canonical multi-armed bandit (MAB)
tasks introduced in the cognitive science and psychiatry literature to conduct
a comparative study of the E&E strategies of LLMs, humans, and MAB algorithms.
We use interpretable choice models to capture the E&E strategies of the agents
and investigate how explicit reasoning, through both prompting strategies and
reasoning-enhanced models, shapes LLM decision-making. We find that reasoning
shifts LLMs toward more human-like behavior, characterized by a mix of random
and directed exploration. In simple stationary tasks, reasoning-enabled LLMs
exhibit similar levels of random and directed exploration compared to humans.
However, in more complex, non-stationary environments, LLMs struggle to match
human adaptability, particularly in effective directed exploration, despite
achieving similar regret in certain scenarios. Our findings highlight both the
promise and limits of LLMs as simulators of human behavior and tools for
automated decision-making and point to potential areas of improvements.

Abstract: The introduction of multimodal models is a huge step forward in Artificial
Intelligence. A single model is trained to understand multiple modalities:
text, image, video, and audio. Open-source multimodal models have made these
breakthroughs more accessible. However, considering the vast landscape of
adversarial attacks across these modalities, these models also inherit
vulnerabilities of all the modalities, and ultimately, the adversarial threat
amplifies. While broad research is available on possible attacks within or
across these modalities, a practitioner-focused view that outlines attack types
remains absent in the multimodal world. As more Machine Learning Practitioners
adopt, fine-tune, and deploy open-source models in real-world applications,
it's crucial that they can view the threat landscape and take the preventive
actions necessary. This paper addresses the gap by surveying adversarial
attacks targeting all four modalities: text, image, video, and audio. This
survey provides a view of the adversarial attack landscape and presents how
multimodal adversarial threats have evolved. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first comprehensive summarization of the threat landscape in the
multimodal world.

Abstract: With the growing demand for healthy foods, agricultural product price
forecasting has become increasingly important. Hass avocados, as a high-value
crop, exhibit complex price fluctuations influenced by factors such as
seasonality, region, and weather. Traditional prediction models often struggle
with highly nonlinear and dynamic data. To address this, we propose a hybrid
deep learning model, TCN-MLP-Attention Architecture, combining Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCN) for sequential feature extraction, Multi-Layer
Perceptrons (MLP) for nonlinear interactions, and an Attention mechanism for
dynamic feature weighting. The dataset used covers over 50,000 records of Hass
avocado sales across the U.S. from 2015 to 2018, including variables such as
sales volume, average price, time, region, weather, and variety type, collected
from point-of-sale systems and the Hass Avocado Board. After systematic
preprocessing, including missing value imputation and feature normalization,
the proposed model was trained and evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate
that the TCN-MLP-Attention model achieves excellent predictive performance,
with an RMSE of 1.23 and an MSE of 1.51, outperforming traditional methods.
This research provides a scalable and effective approach for time series
forecasting in agricultural markets and offers valuable insights for
intelligent supply chain management and price strategy optimization.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了得分函数奇异性问题，提高了流形约束数据的采样精度。

Abstract: Euclidean diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative
modeling across diverse domains, and they have been extended to manifold case
in recent advances. Instead of explicitly utilizing the structure of special
manifolds as studied in previous works, we investigate direct sampling of the
Euclidean diffusion models for general manifold-constrained data in this paper.
We reveal the multiscale singularity of the score function in the embedded
space of manifold, which hinders the accuracy of diffusion-generated samples.
We then present an elaborate theoretical analysis of the singularity structure
of the score function by separating it along the tangential and normal
directions of the manifold. To mitigate the singularity and improve the
sampling accuracy, we propose two novel methods: (1) Niso-DM, which introduces
non-isotropic noise along the normal direction to reduce scale discrepancies,
and (2) Tango-DM, which trains only the tangential component of the score
function using a tangential-only loss function. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our methods achieve superior performance on distributions over
various manifolds with complex geometries.

require repeated access to data in memory, and impose impractical assumptions
when applied to a streaming context. Existing online anomaly detection methods
also generally fail to address these constraints, resorting to periodic
retraining to adapt to the online context. We propose Online-iForest, a novel
method explicitly designed for streaming conditions that seamlessly tracks the
data generating process as it evolves over time. Experimental validation on
real-world datasets demonstrated that Online-iForest is on par with online
alternatives and closely rivals state-of-the-art offline anomaly detection
techniques that undergo periodic retraining. Notably, Online-iForest
consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency, making it a
promising solution in applications where fast identification of anomalies is of
primary importance such as cybersecurity, fraud and fault detection.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种交互式持续学习范式RiCL，通过实时人类反馈动态学习新技能，同时保留旧知识，解决了传统持续学习的静态数据和干净标签假设问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习方法依赖静态数据集和干净标签，而现实交互中数据是动态且标签可能噪声较大。

Method: 提出RiCL框架，包含时间一致性净化器、交互感知偏好优化策略和抗噪声对比学习模块。

Result: 在FewRel和TACRED数据集上，RiCL显著优于现有在线持续学习和噪声标签学习方法。

Conclusion: RiCL通过动态处理和噪声鲁棒性，为交互式持续学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces an interactive continual learning paradigm where AI
models dynamically learn new skills from real-time human feedback while
retaining prior knowledge. This paradigm distinctively addresses two major
limitations of traditional continual learning: (1) dynamic model updates using
streaming, real-time human-annotated data, rather than static datasets with
fixed labels, and (2) the assumption of clean labels, by explicitly handling
the noisy feedback common in real-world interactions. To tackle these problems,
we propose RiCL, a Reinforced interactive Continual Learning framework
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn new skills effectively from
dynamic feedback. RiCL incorporates three key components: a temporal
consistency-aware purifier to automatically discern clean from noisy samples in
data streams; an interaction-aware direct preference optimization strategy to
align model behavior with human intent by reconciling AI-generated and
human-provided feedback; and a noise-resistant contrastive learning module that
captures robust representations by exploiting inherent data relationships, thus
avoiding reliance on potentially unreliable labels. Extensive experiments on
two benchmark datasets (FewRel and TACRED), contaminated with realistic noise
patterns, demonstrate that our RiCL approach substantially outperforms existing
combinations of state-of-the-art online continual learning and noisy-label
learning methods.

TLDR: 该研究利用大型语言模型（LLM）分析高速公路事故数据，识别事故原因，并通过零样本分类提供解释，验证了模型在交通安全领域的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计方法和机器学习模型难以捕捉事故中复杂的因素交互作用，因此研究探索了LLM在事故原因分析中的应用。

Method: 通过微调Llama3 8B模型（使用QLoRA技术）分析226项高速公路事故相关研究的数据，进行零样本分类识别事故原因。

Result: 模型有效识别了酒驾、超速、攻击性驾驶和驾驶员分心等主要原因，并与交通安全领域研究者的问卷结果高度一致（88.89%）。

Conclusion: LLM可用于全面分析事故原因，为规划者和政策制定者提供有价值的见解和潜在对策。

Abstract: Understanding the factors contributing to traffic crashes and developing
strategies to mitigate their severity is essential. Traditional statistical
methods and machine learning models often struggle to capture the complex
interactions between various factors and the unique characteristics of each
crash. This research leverages large language model (LLM) to analyze freeway
crash data and provide crash causation analysis accordingly. By compiling 226
traffic safety studies related to freeway crashes, a training dataset
encompassing environmental, driver, traffic, and geometric design factors was
created. The Llama3 8B model was fine-tuned using QLoRA to enhance its
understanding of freeway crashes and their contributing factors, as covered in
these studies. The fine-tuned Llama3 8B model was then used to identify crash
causation without pre-labeled data through zero-shot classification, providing
comprehensive explanations to ensure that the identified causes were reasonable
and aligned with existing research. Results demonstrate that LLMs effectively
identify primary crash causes such as alcohol-impaired driving, speeding,
aggressive driving, and driver inattention. Incorporating event data, such as
road maintenance, offers more profound insights. The model's practical
applicability and potential to improve traffic safety measures were validated
by a high level of agreement among researchers in the field of traffic safety,
as reflected in questionnaire results with 88.89%. This research highlights the
complex nature of traffic crashes and how LLMs can be used for comprehensive
analysis of crash causation and other contributing factors. Moreover, it
provides valuable insights and potential countermeasures to aid planners and
policymakers in developing more effective and efficient traffic safety
practices.

Method: 提出任务核心记忆管理策略和长期记忆巩固机制，构建多模态和文本基准测试。

Result: Long-CL在两个基准测试中分别比现有最优方法提升7.4%和6.5% AP。

Conclusion: Long-CL框架有效缓解长期CL中的灾难性遗忘问题，为未来研究提供了新基准和方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a long-term continual learning (CL) task, where a
model learns sequentially from a stream of vast tasks over time, acquiring new
knowledge while retaining previously learned information in a manner akin to
human learning. Unlike traditional CL settings, long-term CL involves handling
a significantly larger number of tasks, which exacerbates the issue of
catastrophic forgetting. Our work seeks to address two critical questions: 1)
How do existing CL methods perform in the context of long-term CL? and 2) How
can we mitigate the catastrophic forgetting that arises from prolonged
sequential updates? To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework
inspired by human memory mechanisms for long-term continual learning (Long-CL).
Specifically, we introduce a task-core memory management strategy to
efficiently index crucial memories and adaptively update them as learning
progresses. Additionally, we develop a long-term memory consolidation mechanism
that selectively retains hard and discriminative samples, ensuring robust
knowledge retention. To facilitate research in this area, we construct and
release two multi-modal and textual benchmarks, MMLongCL-Bench and
TextLongCL-Bench, providing a valuable resource for evaluating long-term CL
approaches. Experimental results show that Long-CL outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art by 7.4\% and 6.5\% AP on the two benchmarks, respectively,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

TLDR: TransPL是一种新的无监督领域自适应方法，通过建模源域的联合分布和通道转移矩阵，解决了时间序列数据中伪标签生成的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统伪标签策略无法捕捉时间序列数据中的时间模式和通道转移，导致伪标签质量不佳。

Method: TransPL利用向量量化（VQ）生成时间序列块的代码，构建类和通道转移矩阵，并使用贝叶斯规则进行目标域自适应。

Result: 在四个时间序列UDA基准测试中，TransPL显著优于现有方法（准确率提升6.1%，F1分数提升4.9%）。

Conclusion: TransPL不仅性能优越，还提供了可解释的伪标签生成和领域自适应过程。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for time series data remains a critical
challenge in deep learning, with traditional pseudo-labeling strategies failing
to capture temporal patterns and channel-wise shifts between domains, producing
sub-optimal pseudo-labels. As such, we introduce TransPL, a novel approach that
addresses these limitations by modeling the joint distribution $P(\mathbf{X},
y)$ of the source domain through code transition matrices, where the codes are
derived from vector quantization (VQ) of time series patches. Our method
constructs class- and channel-wise code transition matrices from the source
domain and employs Bayes' rule for target domain adaptation, generating
pseudo-labels based on channel-wise weighted class-conditional likelihoods.
TransPL offers three key advantages: explicit modeling of temporal transitions
and channel-wise shifts between different domains, versatility towards
different UDA scenarios (e.g., weakly-supervised UDA), and explainable
pseudo-label generation. We validate TransPL's effectiveness through extensive
analysis on four time series UDA benchmarks and confirm that it consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art pseudo-labeling methods by a strong margin (6.1%
accuracy improvement, 4.9% F1 improvement), while providing interpretable
insights into the domain adaptation process through its learned code transition
matrices.

Conclusion: FedRAG为联邦强化学习提供了一种高效且隐私安全的性能提升方法。

Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) methods usually share the encrypted
local state or policy information and help each client to learn from others
while preserving everyone's privacy. In this work, we propose that sharing the
approximated behavior metric-based state projection function is a promising way
to enhance the performance of FRL and concurrently provides an effective
protection of sensitive information. We introduce FedRAG, a FRL framework to
learn a computationally practical projection function of states for each client
and aggregating the parameters of projection functions at a central server. The
FedRAG approach shares no sensitive task-specific information, yet provides
information gain for each client. We conduct extensive experiments on the
DeepMind Control Suite to demonstrate insightful results.

Abstract: Designing a 6G-oriented universal model capable of processing multi-modal

future wireless systems. Building on our prior work in communication
multi-modal alignment and telecom large language model (LLM), we propose a
scalable, task-aware artificial intelligence-air interface multi-modal
universal model (AI2MMUM), which flexibility and effectively perform various
physical layer tasks according to subtle task instructions. The LLM backbone
provides robust contextual comprehension and generalization capabilities, while
a fine-tuning approach is adopted to incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To
enhance task adaptability, task instructions consist of fixed task keywords and
learnable, implicit prefix prompts. Frozen radio modality encoders extract
universal representations and adapter layers subsequently bridge radio and
language modalities. Moreover, lightweight task-specific heads are designed to
directly output task objectives. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that
AI2MMUM achieves SOTA performance across five representative physical
environment/wireless channel-based downstream tasks using the WAIR-D and
DeepMIMO datasets.

TLDR: N/A


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Motivated by practical applications where stable long-term performance is
critical-such as robotics, operations research, and healthcare-we study the
problem of distributionally robust (DR) average-reward reinforcement learning.
We propose two algorithms that achieve near-optimal sample complexity. The
first reduces the problem to a DR discounted Markov decision process (MDP),
while the second, Anchored DR Average-Reward MDP, introduces an anchoring state
to stabilize the controlled transition kernels within the uncertainty set.
Assuming the nominal MDP is uniformly ergodic, we prove that both algorithms
attain a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(|\mathbf{S}||\mathbf{A}|
t_{\mathrm{mix}}^2\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ for estimating the optimal policy as
well as the robust average reward under KL and $f_k$-divergence-based
uncertainty sets, provided the uncertainty radius is sufficiently small. Here,
$\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathbf{S}|$ and $|\mathbf{A}|$ denote
the sizes of the state and action spaces, and $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is the mixing
time of the nominal MDP. This represents the first finite-sample convergence
guarantee for DR average-reward reinforcement learning. We further validate the
convergence rates of our algorithms through numerical experiments.

Motivation: 解决强化学习依赖大量真实交互数据的限制，并推动利用LLM生成虚拟经验的研究。

Result: 现有离线RL算法在未见任务上表现不佳（35.44%成功率），远低于真实经验训练（64.37%）。

Conclusion: 需改进算法以更好利用LLM虚拟经验，未来研究方向包括快速在线适应和多模态任务扩展。

Abstract: A central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is its dependence on
extensive real-world interaction data to learn task-specific policies. While
recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can mitigate this
limitation by generating synthetic experience (noted as imaginary rollouts) for
mastering novel tasks, progress in this emerging field is hindered due to the
lack of a standard benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce ImagineBench,
the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms that
leverage both real rollouts and LLM-imaginary rollouts. The key features of
ImagineBench include: (1) datasets comprising environment-collected and
LLM-imaginary rollouts; (2) diverse domains of environments covering
locomotion, robotic manipulation, and navigation tasks; and (3) natural
language task instructions with varying complexity levels to facilitate
language-conditioned policy learning. Through systematic evaluation of
state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, we observe that simply applying
existing offline RL algorithms leads to suboptimal performance on unseen tasks,
achieving 35.44% success rate in hard tasks in contrast to 64.37% of method
training on real rollouts for hard tasks. This result highlights the need for
algorithm advancements to better leverage LLM-imaginary rollouts. Additionally,
we identify key opportunities for future research: including better utilization
of imaginary rollouts, fast online adaptation and continual learning, and
extension to multi-modal tasks. Our code is publicly available at

Result: 实验表明，优化归一化后，QHML性能优于经典深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 研究为量子计算机在生物医学数据分析中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantum-classical Hybrid Machine Learning (QHML) models are recognized for
their robust performance and high generalization ability even for relatively
small datasets. These qualities offer unique advantages for anti-cancer drug
response prediction, where the number of available samples is typically small.
However, such hybrid models appear to be very sensitive to the data encoding
used at the interface of a neural network and a quantum circuit, with
suboptimal choices leading to stability issues. To address this problem, we
propose a novel strategy that uses a normalization function based on a
moderated gradient version of the $\tanh$. This method transforms the outputs
of the neural networks without concentrating them at the extreme value ranges.
Our idea was evaluated on a dataset of gene expression and drug response
measurements for various cancer cell lines, where we compared the prediction
performance of a classical deep learning model and several QHML models. These
results confirmed that QHML performed better than the classical models when
data was optimally normalized. This study opens up new possibilities for
biomedical data analysis using quantum computers.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效解决电路完整性问题，同时揭示了逻辑门在语言模型中的基本特性。

Abstract: Circuit discovery has gradually become one of the prominent methods for
mechanistic interpretability, and research on circuit completeness has also
garnered increasing attention. Methods of circuit discovery that do not
guarantee completeness not only result in circuits that are not fixed across
different runs but also cause key mechanisms to be omitted. The nature of
incompleteness arises from the presence of OR gates within the circuit, which
are often only partially detected in standard circuit discovery methods. To
this end, we systematically introduce three types of logic gates: AND, OR, and
ADDER gates, and decompose the circuit into combinations of these logical
gates. Through the concept of these gates, we derive the minimum requirements
necessary to achieve faithfulness and completeness. Furthermore, we propose a
framework that combines noising-based and denoising-based interventions, which
can be easily integrated into existing circuit discovery methods without
significantly increasing computational complexity. This framework is capable of
fully identifying the logic gates and distinguishing them within the circuit.
In addition to the extensive experimental validation of the framework's ability
to restore the faithfulness, completeness, and sparsity of circuits, using this
framework, we uncover fundamental properties of the three logic gates, such as
their proportions and contributions to the output, and explore how they behave
among the functionalities of language models.

Result: 在四个节点分类基准数据集上，IPAL优于现有方法，实现了更好的可塑性与稳定性平衡。

Conclusion: IPAL通过结合结构信息和原型对比学习，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题，为持续图学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) endure catastrophic forgetting, undermining their
capacity to preserve previously acquired knowledge amid the assimilation of
novel information. Rehearsal-based techniques revisit historical examples,
adopted as a principal strategy to alleviate this phenomenon. However, memory
explosion and privacy infringements impose significant constraints on their
utility. Non-Exemplar methods circumvent the prior issues through Prototype
Replay (PR), yet feature drift presents new challenges. In this paper, our
empirical findings reveal that Prototype Contrastive Learning (PCL) exhibits
less pronounced drift than conventional PR. Drawing upon PCL, we propose
Instance-Prototype Affinity Learning (IPAL), a novel paradigm for Non-Exemplar
Continual Graph Learning (NECGL). Exploiting graph structural information, we
formulate Topology-Integrated Gaussian Prototypes (TIGP), guiding feature
distributions towards high-impact nodes to augment the model's capacity for
assimilating new knowledge. Instance-Prototype Affinity Distillation (IPAD)
safeguards task memory by regularizing discontinuities in class relationships.
Moreover, we embed a Decision Boundary Perception (DBP) mechanism within PCL,
fostering greater inter-class discriminability. Evaluations on four node
classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a better trade-off between
plasticity and stability.

Conclusion: 高准确性与透明可解释性的结合是可行的，可为金融欺诈检测提供更道德和可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models often prioritize predictive accuracy,
often at the expense of model transparency and interpretability. The lack of
transparency makes it difficult for organizations to comply with regulatory
requirements and gain stakeholders trust. In this research, we propose a fraud
detection framework that combines a stacking ensemble of well-known gradient
boosting models: XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. In addition, explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques are used to enhance the transparency
and interpretability of the model's decisions. We used SHAP (SHapley Additive
Explanations) for feature selection to identify the most important features.
Further efforts were made to explain the model's predictions using Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME), Partial Dependence Plots
(PDP), and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI). The IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection
dataset, which includes more than 590,000 real transaction records, was used to
evaluate the proposed model. The model achieved a high performance with an
accuracy of 99% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.99, outperforming several recent
related approaches. These results indicate that combining high prediction
accuracy with transparent interpretability is possible and could lead to a more
ethical and trustworthy solution in financial fraud detection.

Abstract: Depth estimation and scene segmentation are two important tasks in
intelligent transportation systems. A joint modeling of these two tasks will
reduce the requirement for both the storage and training efforts. This work
explores how the multi-task distillation could be used to improve such unified
modeling. While existing solutions transfer multiple teachers' knowledge in a
static way, we propose a self-adaptive distillation method that can dynamically
adjust the knowledge amount from each teacher according to the student's
current learning ability. Furthermore, as multiple teachers exist, the
student's gradient update direction in the distillation is more prone to be
erroneous where knowledge forgetting may occur. To avoid this, we propose a
knowledge trajectory to record the most essential information that a model has
learnt in the past, based on which a trajectory-based distillation loss is
designed to guide the student to follow the learning curve similarly in a
cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmarking datasets
including Cityscapes and NYU-v2. Compared to the state-of-the-art solutions,
our method achieves a clearly improvement. The code is provided in the
supplementary materials.

Result: ChronoSteer在合成数据上训练后，预测精度比单模态基线提升25.7%，比现有最佳多模态方法提升22.5%。

Conclusion: ChronoSteer有效结合了LLM和TSFM的优势，通过文本指令指导预测，显著提升了多模态时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Conventional forecasting methods rely on unimodal time series data, limiting
their ability to exploit rich textual information. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated
powerful capability in textual reasoning and temporal modeling, respectively.
Integrating the strengths of both to construct a multimodal model that
concurrently leverages both temporal and textual information for future
inference has emerged as a critical research challenge. To address the scarcity
of event-series paired data, we propose a decoupled framework: an LLM is
employed to transform textual events into revision instructions, which are then
used to steer the output of TSFM. To implement this framework, we introduce
ChronoSteer, a multimodal TSFM that can be steered through textual revision
instructions, effectively bridging LLM and TSFM. Moreover, to mitigate the
shortage of cross-modal instruction-series paired data, we devise a two-stage
training strategy based on synthetic data. In addition, we also construct a
high-quality multimodal time series forecasting benchmark to address the
information leakage concerns during evaluation. After integrating with an LLM,
ChronoSteer, which is trained exclusively on synthetic data, achieves a 25.7%
improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the unimodal backbone and a
22.5% gain over the previous state-of-the-art multimodal method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法难以适应实时变化，启发式方法策略僵化，现有学习方法缺乏通用性和可解释性。

Method: 将ODMBP建模为半马尔可夫决策过程（SMDP-Option），采用两阶段架构（Option Miner和Option Composer），利用LLM生成策略。

Result: 在涉及10,000多台虚拟机的真实企业数据集上，MiCo实现了96.9%的竞争比，并在非平稳请求流和多样化配置下保持高性能。

Conclusion: MiCo在复杂和大规模云环境中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In cloud services, virtual machine (VM) scheduling is a typical Online
Dynamic Multidimensional Bin Packing (ODMBP) problem, characterized by
large-scale complexity and fluctuating demands. Traditional optimization
methods struggle to adapt to real-time changes, domain-expert-designed
heuristic approaches suffer from rigid strategies, and existing learning-based
methods often lack generalizability and interpretability. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes a hierarchical language agent framework named
MiCo, which provides a large language model (LLM)-driven heuristic design
paradigm for solving ODMBP. Specifically, ODMBP is formulated as a Semi-Markov
Decision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling
through a two-stage architecture, i.e., Option Miner and Option Composer.
Option Miner utilizes LLMs to discover diverse and useful non-context-aware
strategies by interacting with constructed environments. Option Composer
employs LLMs to discover a composing strategy that integrates the
non-context-aware strategies with the contextual ones. Extensive experiments on
real-world enterprise datasets demonstrate that MiCo achieves a 96.9\%
competitive ratio in large-scale scenarios involving more than 10,000 virtual
machines. It maintains high performance even under nonstationary request flows
and diverse configurations, thus validating its effectiveness in complex and
large-scale cloud environments.

Abstract: Injecting rule-based models like Random Forests into differentiable neural
network frameworks remains an open challenge in machine learning. Recent
advancements have demonstrated that pretrained models can generate efficient
molecular embeddings. However, these approaches often require extensive
pretraining and additional techniques, such as incorporating posterior
probabilities, to boost performance. In our study, we propose a novel strategy
that jointly trains a single Graph Transformer neural network on both sparse
multitask molecular property experimental targets and synthetic targets derived
from XGBoost models trained on Osmordred molecular descriptors. These synthetic
tasks serve as independent auxiliary tasks. Our results show consistent and
significant performance improvement across all 19 molecular property prediction
tasks. For 16 out of 19 targets, the multitask Graph Transformer outperforms
the XGBoost single-task learner. This demonstrates that synthetic task
augmentation is an effective method for enhancing neural model performance in
multitask molecular property prediction without the need for feature injection
or pretraining.

Conclusion: 通过优化本地模型的适应性，可以有效提升联邦学习中全局模型的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning enables the clients to collaboratively train a global
model, which is aggregated from local models. Due to the heterogeneous data
distributions over clients and data privacy in federated learning, it is
difficult to train local models to achieve a well-performed global model. In
this paper, we introduce the adaptability of local models, i.e., the average
performance of local models on data distributions over clients, and enhance the
performance of the global model by improving the adaptability of local models.
Since each client does not know the data distributions over other clients, the
adaptability of the local model cannot be directly optimized. First, we provide
the property of an appropriate local model which has good adaptability on the
data distributions over clients. Then, we formalize the property into the local
training objective with a constraint and propose a feasible solution to train
the local model. Extensive experiments on federated learning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the adaptability of local
models and achieves a well-performed global model that consistently outperforms
the baseline methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training while ensuring data
privacy across distributed edge devices, making it a popular solution for
privacy-sensitive applications. However, FL faces significant challenges due to
statistical heterogeneity, particularly domain heterogeneity, which impedes the
global mode's convergence. In this study, we introduce a new framework to
address this challenge by improving the generalization ability of the FL global
model under domain heterogeneity, using prototype augmentation. Specifically,
we introduce FedAPC (Federated Augmented Prototype Contrastive Learning), a
prototype-based FL framework designed to enhance feature diversity and model
robustness. FedAPC leverages prototypes derived from the mean features of
augmented data to capture richer representations. By aligning local features
with global prototypes, we enable the model to learn meaningful semantic
features while reducing overfitting to any specific domain. Experimental
results on the Office-10 and Digits datasets illustrate that our framework
outperforms SOTA baselines, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: Cl-BAI和BAI-Cl在多智能体多臂老虎机问题中表现优异，尤其在M远小于N时效果显著。

Abstract: This work investigates the problem of best arm identification for multi-agent
multi-armed bandits. We consider $N$ agents grouped into $M$ clusters, where
each cluster solves a stochastic bandit problem. The mapping between agents and
bandits is a priori unknown. Each bandit is associated with $K$ arms, and the
goal is to identify the best arm for each agent under a $\delta$-probably
correct ($\delta$-PC) framework, while minimizing sample complexity and
communication overhead.
  We propose two novel algorithms: Clustering then Best Arm Identification
(Cl-BAI) and Best Arm Identification then Clustering (BAI-Cl). Cl-BAI uses a
two-phase approach that first clusters agents based on the bandit problems they
are learning, followed by identifying the best arm for each cluster. BAI-Cl
reverses the sequence by identifying the best arms first and then clustering
agents accordingly. Both algorithms leverage the successive elimination
framework to ensure computational efficiency and high accuracy.
  We establish $\delta$-PC guarantees for both methods, derive bounds on their
sample complexity, and provide a lower bound for this problem class. Moreover,
when $M$ is small (a constant), we show that the sample complexity of a variant
of BAI-Cl is minimax optimal in an order-wise sense. Experiments on synthetic
and real-world datasets (MovieLens, Yelp) demonstrate the superior performance
of the proposed algorithms in terms of sample and communication efficiency,
particularly in settings where $M \ll N$.

Abstract: The emergence of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (HQML) models
opens new horizons of computational intelligence but their fundamental
complexity frequently leads to black box behavior that undermines transparency
and reliability in their application. Although XAI for quantum systems still in
its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local
explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ
quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus
of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an
explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model
entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use
of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum
transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result
shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as
well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI
techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more
significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY.
The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route
to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting
greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use
of quantum-enhanced AI technology.

Result: 在七个基准数据集上，Alinear性能优于大规模模型，参数使用量不足1%。

Conclusion: 挑战了‘模型越大越好’的普遍观念，提出了更高效的时间序列建模范式。

Abstract: Rapid expansion of model size has emerged as a key challenge in time series
forecasting. From early Transformer with tens of megabytes to recent
architectures like TimesNet with thousands of megabytes, performance gains have
often come at the cost of exponentially increasing parameter counts. But is
this scaling truly necessary? To question the applicability of the scaling law
in time series forecasting, we propose Alinear, an ultra-lightweight
forecasting model that achieves competitive performance using only k-level
parameters. We introduce a horizon-aware adaptive decomposition mechanism that
dynamically rebalances component emphasis across different forecast lengths,
alongside a progressive frequency attenuation strategy that achieves stable
prediction in various forecasting horizons without incurring the computational
overhead of attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
datasets demonstrate that Alinear consistently outperforms large-scale models
while using less than 1% of their parameters, maintaining strong accuracy
across both short and ultra-long forecasting horizons. Moreover, to more fairly
evaluate model efficiency, we propose a new parameter-aware evaluation metric
that highlights the superiority of ALinear under constrained model budgets. Our
analysis reveals that the relative importance of trend and seasonal components
varies depending on data characteristics rather than following a fixed pattern,
validating the necessity of our adaptive design. This work challenges the
prevailing belief that larger models are inherently better and suggests a
paradigm shift toward more efficient time series modeling.

Result: YOLOv8表现最佳（mAP 96%），能检测小于间距的缺陷，并在真实数据中检测到84.6%的桥接缺陷和78.3%的断裂缺陷。

Conclusion: 合成数据可替代真实数据，用于开发鲁棒的机器学习模型。

Abstract: In the photolithographic process vital to semiconductor manufacturing,
various types of defects appear during EUV pattering. Due to ever-shrinking
pattern size, these defects are extremely small and cause false or missed
detection during inspection. Specifically, the lack of defect-annotated quality
data with good representation of smaller defects has prohibited deployment of
deep learning based defect detection models in fabrication lines. To resolve
the problem of data unavailability, we artificially generate scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of line patterns with known distribution of defects and
autonomously annotate them. We then employ state-of-the-art object detection
models to investigate defect detection performance as a function of defect
size, much smaller than the pitch width. We find that the real-time object
detector YOLOv8 has the best mean average precision of 96% as compared to
EfficientNet, 83%, and SSD, 77%, with the ability to detect smaller defects. We
report the smallest defect size that can be detected reliably. When tested on
real SEM data, the YOLOv8 model correctly detected 84.6% of Bridge defects and
78.3% of Break defects across all relevant instances. These promising results
suggest that synthetic data can be used as an alternative to real-world data in
order to develop robust machine-learning models.

Abstract: Monitoring feeding behaviour is a relevant task for efficient herd management
and the effective use of available resources in grazing cattle. The ability to
automatically recognise animals' feeding activities through the identification
of specific jaw movements allows for the improvement of diet formulation, as
well as early detection of metabolic problems and symptoms of animal
discomfort, among other benefits. The use of sensors to obtain signals for such
monitoring has become popular in the last two decades. The most frequently
employed sensors include accelerometers, microphones, and cameras, each with
its own set of advantages and drawbacks. An unexplored aspect is the
simultaneous use of multiple sensors with the aim of combining signals in order
to enhance the precision of the estimations. In this direction, this work
introduces a deep neural network based on the fusion of acoustic and inertial
signals, composed of convolutional, recurrent, and dense layers. The main
advantage of this model is the combination of signals through the automatic
extraction of features independently from each of them. The model has emerged
from an exploration and comparison of different neural network architectures
proposed in this work, which carry out information fusion at different levels.
Feature-level fusion has outperformed data and decision-level fusion by at
least a 0.14 based on the F1-score metric. Moreover, a comparison with
state-of-the-art machine learning methods is presented, including traditional
and deep learning approaches. The proposed model yielded an F1-score value of
0.802, representing a 14% increase compared to previous methods. Finally,
results from an ablation study and post-training quantization evaluation are
also reported.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a
growing need to establish best practices for leveraging their capabilities
beyond traditional natural language tasks. In this paper, a novel cross-domain
knowledge transfer framework is proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs in
time series forecasting -- a task of increasing relevance in fields such as
energy systems, finance, and healthcare. The approach systematically infuses
LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting
accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series
dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary
information. Results show that knowledge-informed forecasting significantly
outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and
generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer
strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting
tasks.

Conclusion: ComplexFormer提供了一种更灵活、高效的注意力机制，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Transformer models rely on self-attention to capture token dependencies but
face challenges in effectively integrating positional information while
allowing multi-head attention (MHA) flexibility. Prior methods often model
semantic and positional differences disparately or apply uniform positional
adjustments across heads, potentially limiting representational capacity. This
paper introduces ComplexFormer, featuring Complex Multi-Head Attention-CMHA.
CMHA empowers each head to independently model semantic and positional
differences unified within the complex plane, representing interactions as
rotations and scaling. ComplexFormer incorporates two key improvements: (1) a
per-head Euler transformation, converting real-valued query/key projections
into polar-form complex vectors for head-specific complex subspace operation;
and (2) a per-head adaptive differential rotation mechanism,
exp[i(Adapt(ASmn,i) + Delta(Pmn),i)], allowing each head to learn distinct
strategies for integrating semantic angle differences (ASmn,i) with relative
positional encodings (Delta(Pmn),i). Extensive experiments on language
modeling, text generation, code generation, and mathematical reasoning show
ComplexFormer achieves superior performance, significantly lower generation
perplexity , and improved long-context coherence compared to strong baselines
like RoPE-Transformers. ComplexFormer demonstrates strong parameter efficiency,
offering a more expressive, adaptable attention mechanism.

Conclusion: SpecOffload通过推测解码和卸载的结合，以近乎零额外成本显著加速推理，为资源受限设备提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices presents significant
challenges in compute and memory utilization. Due to limited GPU memory,
existing systems offload model weights to CPU memory, incurring substantial I/O
overhead between the CPU and GPU. This leads to two major inefficiencies: (1)
GPU cores are underutilized, often remaining idle while waiting for data to be
loaded; and (2) GPU memory has low impact on performance, as reducing its
capacity has minimal effect on overall throughput.In this paper, we propose
SpecOffload, a high-throughput inference engine that embeds speculative
decoding into offloading. Our key idea is to unlock latent GPU resources for
storing and executing a draft model used for speculative decoding, thus
accelerating inference at near-zero additional cost. To support this, we
carefully orchestrate the interleaved execution of target and draft models in
speculative decoding within the offloading pipeline, and propose a planner to
manage tensor placement and select optimal parameters. Compared to the best
baseline, SpecOffload improves GPU core utilization by 4.49x and boosts
inference throughput by 2.54x. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的HDRL方法有效优化了电动公交车的充电调度，降低了成本并满足了充电需求。

Abstract: The charging scheduling problem of Electric Buses (EBs) is investigated based
on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is
conceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating
periods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time
steps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse
reward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP
into a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical
Double Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is
proposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different
temporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective
policy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while
the low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of
every time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the
charging costs while meeting the charging target. It is proved that the flat
policy constructed by superimposing the optimal high-level policy and the
optimal low-level policy performs as well as the optimal policy of the original
MDP. Since jointly learning both levels of policies is challenging due to the
non-stationarity of the high-level agent and the sampling inefficiency of the
low-level agent, we divide the joint learning process into two phases and
exploit our new HER algorithm to manipulate the experience replay buffers for
both levels of agents. Numerical experiments are performed with the aid of
real-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the
observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this
neural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model
size -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs
represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,
representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur
with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss
scaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only
the most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of
loss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature
frequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong
superposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,
the loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide
range of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is
explained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower
dimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales
inversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced
LLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match
the predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also
agree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an
important mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate
that these insights will inspire new training strategies and model
architectures to achieve better performance with less computation and fewer
parameters.

Abstract: We present a deep learning model for high-resolution probabilistic
precipitation forecasting over an 8-hour horizon in Europe, overcoming the
limitations of radar-only deep learning models with short forecast lead times.
Our model efficiently integrates multiple data sources - including radar,
satellite, and physics-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) - while
capturing long-range interactions, resulting in accurate forecasts with robust
uncertainty quantification through consistent probabilistic maps. Featuring a
compact architecture, it enables more efficient training and faster inference
than existing models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
surpasses current operational NWP systems, extrapolation-based methods, and
deep-learning nowcasting models, setting a new standard for high-resolution
precipitation forecasting in Europe, ensuring a balance between accuracy,
interpretability, and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的并行计算扩展方法（ParScale），通过并行处理输入和动态聚合输出，显著提高了推理效率，同时减少了内存和延迟开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩展语言模型的方法（参数扩展或推理时扩展）通常需要较高的空间或时间成本，作者希望找到一种更高效的扩展方式。

Method: 引入并行扩展（ParScale），通过并行执行多个输入变换和模型前向传播，动态聚合输出，无需增加参数或输出标记。

Result: 实验表明，ParScale在相同性能提升下，内存和延迟开销分别减少22倍和6倍，且可通过少量标记的后训练实现模型扩展。

Conclusion: ParScale为低资源场景下部署强大模型提供了新思路，并重新定义了计算在机器学习中的作用。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that scaling language models should commit a
significant space or time cost, by increasing the parameters (parameter
scaling) or output tokens (inference-time scaling). We introduce the third and
more inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel
computation during both training and inference time. We apply $P$ diverse and
learnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in
parallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely
parallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing
parameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure,
data, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it
through large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with $P$ parallel
streams is similar to scaling the parameters by $O(\log P)$ while showing
superior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\times$
less memory increase and 6$\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter
scaling that achieves the same performance improvement. It can also recycle an
off-the-shelf pre-trained model into a parallelly scaled one by post-training
on a small amount of tokens, further reducing the training budget. The new
scaling law we discovered potentially facilitates the deployment of more
powerful models in low-resource scenarios, and provides an alternative
perspective for the role of computation in machine learning.

Motivation: 探索基于精确尖峰时序的Hebbian学习规则，填补了现有研究中对神经元活动时序依赖性的知识空白。

Method: 将Hebbian的尖峰时序依赖可塑性规则与自然损失函数的噪声梯度下降相关联，并分析其与噪声镜像下降的关系。

Result: 证明了该学习规则能最终识别出活动最高的突触前神经元。

Conclusion: 揭示了Hebbian学习规则与噪声梯度下降及镜像下降的内在联系，为理解生物神经网络的学习机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a key principle underlying learning in biological neural
networks. It postulates that synaptic changes occur locally, depending on the
activities of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. While Hebbian learning based on
neuronal firing rates is well explored, much less is known about learning rules
that account for precise spike-timing. We relate a Hebbian
spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule to noisy gradient descent with respect
to a natural loss function on the probability simplex. This connection allows
us to prove that the learning rule eventually identifies the presynaptic neuron
with the highest activity. We also discover an intrinsic connection to noisy
mirror descent.

<details>

Motivation: 在缺乏真实用户交互数据和隐私限制的情况下，传统合成数据生成方法无法复现真实数据分布，导致微调后LLMs性能不佳。

Result: 在真实用户查询上的评估显示，功能分类和API参数选择的准确性显著提升，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了传统合成数据生成的局限性，为功能调用任务设定了新的基准。

Abstract: This paper addresses fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for function
calling tasks when real user interaction data is unavailable. In digital
content creation tools, where users express their needs through natural
language queries that must be mapped to API calls, the lack of real-world
task-specific data and privacy constraints for training on it necessitate
synthetic data generation. Existing approaches to synthetic data generation
fall short in diversity and complexity, failing to replicate real-world data
distributions and leading to suboptimal performance after LLM fine-tuning. We
present a novel router-based architecture that leverages domain resources like
content metadata and structured knowledge graphs, along with text-to-text and
vision-to-text language models to generate high-quality synthetic training
data. Our architecture's flexible routing mechanism enables synthetic data
generation that matches observed real-world distributions, addressing a
fundamental limitation of traditional approaches. Evaluation on a comprehensive
set of real user queries demonstrates significant improvements in both function
classification accuracy and API parameter selection. Models fine-tuned with our
synthetic data consistently outperform traditional approaches, establishing new
benchmarks for function calling tasks.

Motivation: 电动公交车的普及对可持续发展至关重要，但充电调度优化面临不确定性（如行驶时间、能耗和电价波动）和复杂性（多时间尺度决策和大规模车队）。

Method: 将原始马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）重构为两个增强MDP，并设计DAC-MAPPO-E算法。高层通过注意力机制优化全局状态信息，低层结合MAPPO实现分散协调决策。

Result: 实验表明，DAC-MAPPO-E在优化EB车队充电调度方面表现出优越性能和可扩展性。

Conclusion: DAC-MAPPO-E有效解决了EB充电调度的复杂性和可扩展性问题，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Electric Buses (EBs) represents a significant step
toward sustainable development. By utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) systems,
charging stations can autonomously determine charging schedules based on
real-time data. However, optimizing EB charging schedules remains a critical
challenge due to uncertainties in travel time, energy consumption, and
fluctuating electricity prices. Moreover, to address real-world complexities,
charging policies must make decisions efficiently across multiple time scales
and remain scalable for large EB fleets. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) approach that reformulates the
original Markov Decision Process (MDP) into two augmented MDPs. To solve these
MDPs and enable multi-timescale decision-making, we introduce a novel HDRL
algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization
Enhancement (DAC-MAPPO-E). Scalability challenges of the Double Actor-Critic
(DAC) algorithm for large-scale EB fleets are addressed through enhancements at
both decision levels. At the high level, we redesign the decentralized actor
network and integrate an attention mechanism to extract relevant global state
information for each EB, decreasing the size of neural networks. At the low
level, the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is
incorporated into the DAC framework, enabling decentralized and coordinated
charging power decisions, reducing computational complexity and enhancing
convergence speed. Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate the
superior performance and scalability of DAC-MAPPO-E in optimizing EB fleet
charging schedules.

TLDR: MASSV通过两阶段方法将小型语言模型转化为高效的多模态草稿模型，显著加速视觉语言模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码技术难以直接应用于视觉语言模型（VLMs），因为小型语言模型缺乏处理视觉输入的能力，且其预测与考虑视觉上下文的VLMs不匹配。

Method: MASSV分两阶段：1）通过轻量级可训练投影器将目标VLM的视觉编码器连接到草稿模型；2）利用目标VLM生成的响应进行自蒸馏视觉指令调优以对齐预测。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL和Gemma3模型上，MASSV将接受长度提升30%，推理速度提升1.46倍。

Conclusion: MASSV为加速当前及未来VLMs提供了一种可扩展且架构兼容的方法。

Abstract: Speculative decoding significantly accelerates language model inference by
enabling a lightweight draft model to propose multiple tokens that a larger
target model verifies simultaneously. However, applying this technique to
vision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small
language models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural
components to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match
those of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce
Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of
Vision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models
into effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first
connects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight
trainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning
using responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions.
Comprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families
demonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers
end-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV
provides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both
current and future VLMs.

Result: 理论分析和广泛实验验证了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: NML-GCL有效解决了假负样本问题，提升了图对比学习的性能。

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) often suffers from false negatives, which
degrades the performance on downstream tasks. The existing methods addressing
the false negative issue usually rely on human prior knowledge, still leading
GCL to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel Negative Metric
Learning (NML) enhanced GCL (NML-GCL). NML-GCL employs a learnable Negative
Metric Network (NMN) to build a negative metric space, in which false negatives
can be distinguished better from true negatives based on their distance to
anchor node. To overcome the lack of explicit supervision signals for NML, we
propose a joint training scheme with bi-level optimization objective, which
implicitly utilizes the self-supervision signals to iteratively optimize the
encoder and the negative metric network. The solid theoretical analysis and the
extensive experiments conducted on widely used benchmarks verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: ADSGD因其简单性、高效性和对延迟的鲁棒性，适用于实际去中心化学习任务。

Abstract: Decentralized optimization has become vital for leveraging distributed data
without central control, enhancing scalability and privacy. However, practical
deployments face fundamental challenges due to heterogeneous computation speeds
and unpredictable communication delays. This paper introduces a refined model
of Asynchronous Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (ADSGD) under
practical assumptions of bounded computation and communication times. To
understand the convergence of ADSGD, we first analyze Asynchronous Stochastic
Block Coordinate Descent (ASBCD) as a tool, and then show that ADSGD converges
under computation-delay-independent step sizes. The convergence result is
established without assuming bounded data heterogeneity. Empirical experiments
reveal that ADSGD outperforms existing methods in wall-clock convergence time
across various scenarios. With its simplicity, efficiency in memory and
communication, and resilience to communication and computation delays, ADSGD is
well-suited for real-world decentralized learning tasks.

Abstract: AI is foreseen to be a centerpiece in next generation wireless networks

real deployment, feature distribution changes may degrade the performance of AI
models and lead to undesired behaviors. To counter for undetected model
degradation, we propose ALERT; a method that can detect feature distribution
changes and trigger model re-training that works well on two wireless network
use cases: wireless fingerprinting and link anomaly detection. ALERT includes
three components: representation learning, statistical testing and utility
assessment. We rely on MLP for designing the representation learning component,
on Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Population Stability Index tests for designing the
statistical testing and a new function for utility assessment. We show the
superiority of the proposed method against ten standard drift detection methods
available in the literature on two wireless network use cases.

Method: 提出了两种能力：优先探索和采样策略以识别相关经验，以及通过结构化表示选择性保留先验知识。

Result: 研究表明，这两种能力能够帮助RL代理在部署时高效适应新环境变化，同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 高效在线适应需要结合优先探索和选择性知识保留，以提升RL在动态环境中的表现。

Abstract: Real-world autonomous decision-making systems, from robots to recommendation
engines, must operate in environments that change over time. While deep
reinforcement learning (RL) has shown an impressive ability to learn optimal
policies in stationary environments, most methods are data intensive and assume
a world that does not change between training and test time. As a result,
conventional RL methods struggle to adapt when conditions change. This poses a
fundamental challenge: how can RL agents efficiently adapt their behavior when
encountering novel environmental changes during deployment without
catastrophically forgetting useful prior knowledge? This dissertation
demonstrates that efficient online adaptation requires two key capabilities:
(1) prioritized exploration and sampling strategies that help identify and
learn from relevant experiences, and (2) selective preservation of prior
knowledge through structured representations that can be updated without
disruption to reusable components.

Abstract: Randomness is ubiquitous in many applications across data science and machine
learning. Remarkably, systems composed of random components often display
emergent global behaviors that appear deterministic, manifesting a transition
from microscopic disorder to macroscopic organization. In this work, we
introduce a theoretical model for studying the emergence of collective
behaviors in ensembles of random classifiers. We argue that, if the ensemble is
weighted through the Gibbs measure defined by adopting the classification loss
as an energy, then there exists a finite temperature parameter for the
distribution such that the classification is optimal, with respect to the loss
(or the energy). Interestingly, for the case in which samples are generated by
a Gaussian distribution and labels are constructed by employing a teacher
perceptron, we analytically prove and numerically confirm that such optimal
temperature does not depend neither on the teacher classifier (which is, by
construction of the learning problem, unknown), nor on the number of random
classifiers, highlighting the universal nature of the observed behavior.
Experiments on the MNIST dataset underline the relevance of this phenomenon in
high-quality, noiseless, datasets. Finally, a physical analogy allows us to
shed light on the self-organizing nature of the studied phenomenon.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are well-established as a principled approach
to probabilistic unsupervised learning with neural networks. Typically, an
encoder network defines the parameters of a Gaussian distributed latent space
from which we can sample and pass realizations to a decoder network. This model
is trained to reconstruct its inputs and is optimized through the evidence
lower bound. In recent years, discrete latent spaces have grown in popularity,
suggesting that they may be a natural choice for many data modalities (e.g.
text). In this tutorial, we provide a rigorous, yet practical, introduction to
discrete variational autoencoders -- specifically, VAEs in which the latent
space is made up of latent variables that follow a categorical distribution. We
assume only a basic mathematical background with which we carefully derive each
step from first principles. From there, we develop a concrete training recipe
and provide an example implementation, hosted at

Conclusion: SMTOs在某些情况下与均匀损失表现相似，研究结果有助于理解其适用性。

Abstract: Specialized Multi-Task Optimizers (SMTOs) balance task learning in Multi-Task
Learning by addressing issues like conflicting gradients and differing gradient
norms, which hinder equal-weighted task training. However, recent critiques
suggest that equally weighted tasks can achieve competitive results compared to
SMTOs, arguing that previous SMTO results were influenced by poor
hyperparameter optimization and lack of regularization. In this work, we
evaluate these claims through an extensive empirical evaluation of SMTOs,
including some of the latest methods, on more complex multi-task problems to
clarify this behavior. Our findings indicate that SMTOs perform well compared
to uniform loss and that fixed weights can achieve competitive performance
compared to SMTOs. Furthermore, we demonstrate why uniform loss perform
similarly to SMTOs in some instances. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: There are now a multitude of AI-scribing solutions for healthcare promising
the utilization of large language models for ambient documentation. However,
these AI scribes still rely on one-shot, or few-shot prompts for generating
notes after the consultation has ended, employing little to no reasoning. This
risks long notes with an increase in hallucinations, misrepresentation of the
intent of the clinician, and reliance on the proofreading of the clinician to
catch errors. A dangerous combination for patient safety if vigilance is
compromised by workload and fatigue. In this paper, we introduce a method for
extracting salient clinical information in real-time alongside the healthcare
consultation, denoted Facts, and use that information recursively to generate
the final note. The FactsR method results in more accurate and concise notes by
placing the clinician-in-the-loop of note generation, while opening up new use
cases within real-time decision support.

techniques, and confirm that PI-Forest is better at measuring arbitrary

Conclusion: SCGP提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于实时和资源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework for learning over
graph-structured data, yet their expressive capacity is often hindered by
over-squashing, wherein information from distant nodes is compressed into
fixed-size vectors. Existing solutions, including graph rewiring and
bottleneck-resistant architectures such as Cayley and expander graphs, avoid
this problem but introduce scalability bottlenecks. In particular, the Cayley
graphs constructed over $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ exhibit strong theoretical
properties, yet suffer from cubic node growth $O(n^3)$, leading to high memory
usage. To address this, this work introduces Schrier-Coset Graph Propagation
(SCGP), a group-theoretic augmentation method that enriches node features
through Schreier-coset embeddings without altering the input graph topology.
SCGP embeds bottleneck-free connectivity patterns into a compact feature space,
improving long-range message passing while maintaining computational
efficiency. Empirical evaluations across standard node and graph classification
benchmarks demonstrate that SCGP achieves performance comparable to, or
exceeding, expander graph and rewired GNN baselines. Furthermore, SCGP exhibits
particular advantages in processing hierarchical and modular graph structures,
offering reduced inference latency, improved scalability, and a low memory
footprint, making it suitable for real-time and resource-constrained
applications.

TLDR: SEAL是一个基于NAS的增量学习框架，通过动态调整模型结构和选择性扩展，平衡新任务学习和旧知识保留，减少遗忘并提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增量学习中，模型需平衡新任务学习（可塑性）和旧知识保留（稳定性），现有NAS方法通常依赖模型扩展，资源消耗大。

Method: SEAL通过动态调整模型结构（仅在必要时扩展）和交叉蒸馏训练保持稳定性，NAS组件联合搜索架构和扩展策略。

Result: 实验表明，SEAL减少遗忘、提高准确性，同时保持较小模型规模。

Conclusion: SEAL结合NAS和选择性扩展，为增量学习提供高效自适应解决方案。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model learns from
a sequential stream of tasks. This setting poses a key challenge: balancing
plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (preserving past knowledge).
Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a branch of AutoML, automates the design of
the architecture of Deep Neural Networks and has shown success in static
settings. However, existing NAS-based approaches to incremental learning often
rely on expanding the model at every task, making them impractical in
resource-constrained environments. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a NAS-based
framework tailored for data-incremental learning, a scenario where disjoint
data samples arrive sequentially and are not stored for future access. SEAL
adapts the model structure dynamically by expanding it only when necessary,
based on a capacity estimation metric. Stability is preserved through
cross-distillation training after each expansion step. The NAS component
jointly searches for both the architecture and the optimal expansion policy.
Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SEAL effectively
reduces forgetting and enhances accuracy while maintaining a lower model size
compared to prior methods. These results highlight the promise of combining NAS
and selective expansion for efficient, adaptive learning in incremental
scenarios.

*Wenhao Ding,Choon Hwai Yap,Kangjun Ji,Simão Castro*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: AneuG是一种基于变分自编码器（VAE）的两阶段颅内动脉瘤（IA）网格生成器，能够生成具有特定形态学特征的IA形状，解决了现有方法在生理真实性和可控性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大型IA图像数据集，现有形状生成方法难以捕捉真实的IA特征，且忽略了IA囊与母血管的关系，限制了生理真实性和可控性。

Method: AneuG采用两阶段方法：第一阶段生成低维图谐波变形（GHD）令牌以编码和重建动脉瘤囊形状；第二阶段基于GHD令牌生成母血管。

Result: AneuG能够生成具有特定临床相关形态学测量的IA形状，适用于研究形状变化及其对流体动力学的影响。

Conclusion: AneuG为IA形状生成提供了一种更真实且可控的方法，有助于临床研究和血流模拟。

Abstract: A generative model for the mesh geometry of intracranial aneurysms (IA) is
crucial for training networks to predict blood flow forces in real time, which
is a key factor affecting disease progression. This need is necessitated by the
absence of a large IA image datasets. Existing shape generation methods
struggle to capture realistic IA features and ignore the relationship between
IA pouches and parent vessels, limiting physiological realism and their
generation cannot be controlled to have specific morphological measurements. We
propose AneuG, a two-stage Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based IA mesh
generator. In the first stage, AneuG generates low-dimensional Graph Harmonic
Deformation (GHD) tokens to encode and reconstruct aneurysm pouch shapes,
constrained to morphing energy statistics truths. GHD enables more accurate
shape encoding than alternatives. In the second stage, AneuG generates parent
vessels conditioned on GHD tokens, by generating vascular centreline and
propagating the cross-section. AneuG's IA shape generation can further be
conditioned to have specific clinically relevant morphological measurements.
This is useful for studies to understand shape variations represented by
clinical measurements, and for flow simulation studies to understand effects of
specific clinical shape parameters on fluid dynamics. Source code and
implementation details are available at

TLDR: 论文探讨了人类学习与神经网络学习的效率差异，提出多机制学习可能是提升数据效率的关键。


<details>

Motivation: 人类学习依赖多种认知机制协同工作，而现代神经网络主要依赖梯度下降，导致学习效率差异显著。

Method: 通过在线辅导环境中的模拟实验，比较强化学习与三机制符号规则归纳方法的数据效率。

Result: 分解学习为多个机制显著提升数据效率，接近人类学习水平，且比符号与子符号学习的区分影响更大。

Conclusion: 整合多种专门学习机制可能是缩小机器学习与人类学习效率差距的关键。

Abstract: Human learning relies on specialization -- distinct cognitive mechanisms
working together to enable rapid learning. In contrast, most modern neural
networks rely on a single mechanism: gradient descent over an objective
function. This raises the question: might human learners' relatively rapid
learning from just tens of examples instead of tens of thousands in data-driven
deep learning arise from our ability to use multiple specialized mechanisms of
learning in combination? We investigate this question through an ablation
analysis of inductive human learning simulations in online tutoring
environments. Comparing reinforcement learning to a more data-efficient
3-mechanism symbolic rule induction approach, we find that decomposing learning
into multiple distinct mechanisms significantly improves data efficiency,
bringing it in line with human learning. Furthermore, we show that this
decomposition has a greater impact on efficiency than the distinction between
symbolic and subsymbolic learning alone. Efforts to align data-driven machine
learning with human learning often overlook the stark difference in learning
efficiency. Our findings suggest that integrating multiple specialized learning
mechanisms may be key to bridging this gap.

Motivation: 探讨神经网络中梯度下降训练的无分布学习能力及其局限性。

Method: 通过分析小批量随机梯度下降（bSGD）和随机特征组合，提出平均概率维度复杂性（adc）理论框架。

Result: 证明了目标函数可通过多项式大小的随机特征组合近似，且adc与统计查询维度存在多项式关系。

Conclusion: 揭示了无分布学习的局限性，强调了数据分布假设的重要性。

Abstract: We study the relationship between gradient-based optimization of parametric
models (e.g., neural networks) and optimization of linear combinations of
random features. Our main result shows that if a parametric model can be
learned using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (bSGD) without making
assumptions about the data distribution, then with high probability, the target
function can also be approximated using a polynomial-sized combination of
random features. The size of this combination depends on the number of gradient
steps and numerical precision used in the bSGD process. This finding reveals
fundamental limitations of distribution-free learning in neural networks
trained by gradient descent, highlighting why making assumptions about data
distributions is often crucial in practice. Along the way, we also introduce a
new theoretical framework called average probabilistic dimension complexity
(adc), which extends the probabilistic dimension complexity developed by Kamath
et al. (2020). We prove that adc has a polynomial relationship with statistical
query dimension, and use this relationship to demonstrate an infinite
separation between adc and standard dimension complexity.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视推理效果与计算效率的权衡，导致冗余计算和资源浪费。

Conclusion: L2T通过强化学习优化推理过程，实现高效更新和资源利用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks thanks to advances in
reasoning abilities. However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between
reasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging
unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we
propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement
fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning
with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as
a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense
process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in
parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We
propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and
the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly
reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately
rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T
optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each
episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning
benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different
tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.

Motivation: 传统数值天气预报在模拟云和降水时因次网格参数化而面临挑战，早期机器学习方法预报模糊。本文探索新方法以改进预报质量。

Method: 采用三种扩散模型（Diff、CorrDiff、LDM）进行临近预报，仅使用过去20分钟的红外卫星图像作为输入。

Result: 扩散模型不仅能平流现有云层，还能生成和衰减云层（包括对流启动）。CorrDiff在均方根误差上优于其他模型和传统U-Net。

Conclusion: 基于分数的扩散模型（尤其是CorrDiff）在临近预报中表现优异，且支持开箱即用的集合生成，具有校准能力。

Abstract: Clouds and precipitation are important for understanding weather and climate.
Simulating clouds and precipitation with traditional numerical weather
prediction is challenging because of the sub-grid parameterizations required.
Machine learning has been explored for forecasting clouds and precipitation,
but early machine learning methods often created blurry forecasts. In this
paper we explore a newer method, named score-based diffusion, to nowcast (zero
to three hour forecast) clouds and precipitation. We discuss the background and
intuition of score-based diffusion models - thus providing a starting point for
the community - while exploring the methodology's use for nowcasting
geostationary infrared imagery. We experiment with three main types of
diffusion models: a standard score-based diffusion model (Diff); a residual
correction diffusion model (CorrDiff); and a latent diffusion model (LDM). Our
results show that the diffusion models are able to not only advect existing
clouds, but also generate and decay clouds, including convective initiation.
These results are surprising because the forecasts are initiated with only the
past 20 mins of infrared satellite imagery. A case study qualitatively shows
the preservation of high resolution features longer into the forecast than a
conventional mean-squared error trained U-Net. The best of the three diffusion
models tested was the CorrDiff approach, outperforming all other diffusion
models, the traditional U-Net, and a persistence forecast by one to two kelvin
on root mean squared error. The diffusion models also enable out-of-the-box
ensemble generation, which shows skillful calibration, with the spread of the
ensemble correlating well to the error.

Abstract: Gas turbine engines represent complex highly nonlinear dynamical systems.
Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging as it requires
performance characteristics, that are not always available, and one often has
to make many simplifying assumptions. In this paper, the limitations of
conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally
linear parameter-varying models are discussed and addressed by employing
identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine
operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics were estimated using
the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous
part of the dynamics was mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman
eigenfunction space. The process included eigenvalue optimization using
metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based
eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model was validated against
an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear
feedback controller and a Kalman estimator were then designed in the
eigenfunction space and compared to the classical and gain-scheduled
proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control
approach. The eigenmode structure allowed targeting individual modes during the
optimization process, resulting in a better performance tuning. The results
showed that the Koopman-based controller outperformed the other benchmark
controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection, under
sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.

Result: NCDPO在样本效率和最终性能上优于现有方法，适用于机器人控制和多智能体游戏场景。

Conclusion: NCDPO有效解决了扩散策略在强化学习中的优化难题，具有鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as
robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills
from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the
sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion
policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures.
While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising
solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to
effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This
challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood
estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated
optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized
policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much
lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies
(MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework
that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy.
By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned
on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and
gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments
demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when
training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency
and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot
control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results
show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the
Diffusion Policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有价值函数分解方法（如VDN、QMIX）在满足个体-全局最大（IGM）属性时表示能力有限，而QPLEX虽无此限制但过于复杂。因此，需要一种既能满足IGM属性又简单高效的方法。

Method: 提出QFIX方法，通过简单的‘修复层’扩展表示能力，并推导了多种变体，在两种多智能体框架中实现。

Result: 在SMACv2和Overcooked环境中，QFIX提升了现有方法的性能，比QPLEX更稳定且表现更好，同时使用最简单和最小的混合模型。

Conclusion: QFIX是一种简单高效的价值函数分解方法，能够满足IGM属性并显著提升多智能体强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Value function decomposition methods for cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning compose joint values from individual per-agent
utilities, and train them using a joint objective. To ensure that the action
selection process between individual utilities and joint values remains
consistent, it is imperative for the composition to satisfy the
individual-global max (IGM) property. Although satisfying IGM itself is
straightforward, most existing methods (e.g., VDN, QMIX) have limited
representation capabilities and are unable to represent the full class of IGM
values, and the one exception that has no such limitation (QPLEX) is
unnecessarily complex. In this work, we present a simple formulation of the
full class of IGM values that naturally leads to the derivation of QFIX, a
novel family of value function decomposition models that expand the
representation capabilities of prior models by means of a thin "fixing" layer.
We derive multiple variants of QFIX, and implement three variants in two
well-known multi-agent frameworks. We perform an empirical evaluation on
multiple SMACv2 and Overcooked environments, which confirms that QFIX (i)
succeeds in enhancing the performance of prior methods, (ii) learns more stably
and performs better than its main competitor QPLEX, and (iii) achieves this
while employing the simplest and smallest mixing models.

Conclusion: PnPXAI解决了现有XAI的局限性，为实践者提供了更灵活和优化的解释方法选择。

Abstract: Recently, post hoc explanation methods have emerged to enhance model
transparency by attributing model outputs to input features. However, these
methods face challenges due to their specificity to certain neural network
architectures and data modalities. Existing explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) frameworks have attempted to address these challenges but suffer from
several limitations. These include limited flexibility to diverse model
architectures and data modalities due to hard-coded implementations, a
restricted number of supported XAI methods because of the requirements for
layer-specific operations of attribution methods, and sub-optimal
recommendations of explanations due to the lack of evaluation and optimization
phases. Consequently, these limitations impede the adoption of XAI technology
in real-world applications, making it difficult for practitioners to select the
optimal explanation method for their domain. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{PnPXAI}, a universal XAI framework that supports diverse data
modalities and neural network models in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) manner. PnPXAI
automatically detects model architectures, recommends applicable explanation
methods, and optimizes hyperparameters for optimal explanations. We validate
the framework's effectiveness through user surveys and showcase its versatility
across various domains, including medicine and finance.

Abstract: Developing bioactive molecules remains a central, time- and cost-heavy
challenge in drug discovery, particularly for novel targets lacking structural
or functional data. Pharmacophore modeling presents an alternative for
capturing the key features required for molecular bioactivity against a
biological target. In this work, we present PharmaDiff, a
pharmacophore-conditioned diffusion model for 3D molecular generation.
PharmaDiff employs a transformer-based architecture to integrate an atom-based
representation of the 3D pharmacophore into the generative process, enabling
the precise generation of 3D molecular graphs that align with predefined
pharmacophore hypotheses. Through comprehensive testing, PharmaDiff
demonstrates superior performance in matching 3D pharmacophore constraints
compared to ligand-based drug design methods. Additionally, it achieves higher
docking scores across a range of proteins in structure-based drug design,
without the need for target protein structures. By integrating pharmacophore
modeling with 3D generative techniques, PharmaDiff offers a powerful and
flexible framework for rational drug design.

Abstract: Air pollution poses a significant threat to public health, causing or
exacerbating many respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, climate
change is bringing about more extreme weather events such as wildfires and
heatwaves, which can increase levels of pollution and worsen the effects of
pollution exposure. Recent advances in personal sensing have transformed the
collection of behavioural and physiological data, leading to the potential for
new improvements in healthcare. We wish to capitalise on this data, alongside
new capabilities in AI for making time series predictions, in order to monitor
and predict health outcomes for an individual. Thus, we present a novel
workflow for predicting personalised health responses to pollution by
integrating physiological data from wearable fitness devices with real-time
environmental exposures. The data is collected from various sources in a secure
and ethical manner, and is used to train an AI model to predict individual
health responses to pollution exposure within a cloud-based, modular framework.
We demonstrate that the AI model -- an Adversarial Autoencoder neural network
in this case -- accurately reconstructs time-dependent health signals and
captures nonlinear responses to pollution. Transfer learning is applied using
data from a personal smartwatch, which increases the generalisation abilities
of the AI model and illustrates the adaptability of the approach to real-world,
user-generated data.

sub-task in language modeling, i.e., context embedding. We propose an approach
to exploit the Graph Convolution operation in GNNs to encode the context and
use it in coalition with LSTMs to predict the next word given a local context
of preceding words. We test this on the custom Wikipedia text corpus using a
very limited amount of resources and show that this approach works fairly well
to predict the next word.

Motivation: GRPO在低资源设置中表现良好，但其奖励信号未能捕捉语义多样性，导致多样性-质量不一致。

Method: 提出DRA方法，利用Submodular Mutual Information（SMI）调整奖励，减少冗余补全的权重，增加多样性补全的奖励。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，DRA-GRPO和DGA-DR.GRPO表现优于基线，平均准确率达58.2%，仅需7,000个微调样本和约55美元的训练成本。

Conclusion: DRA方法有效提升了GRPO的性能，同时保持了高稳定性，适用于低资源设置。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for language model post-training,
such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have shown promise in
low-resource settings. However, GRPO typically relies on solution-level and
scalar reward signals that fail to capture the semantic diversity among sampled
completions. This leads to what we identify as a diversity-quality
inconsistency, where distinct reasoning paths may receive indistinguishable
rewards. To address this limitation, we propose $\textit{Diversity-aware Reward
Adjustment}$ (DRA), a method that explicitly incorporates semantic diversity
into the reward computation. DRA uses Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) to
downweight redundant completions and amplify rewards for diverse ones. This
encourages better exploration during learning, while maintaining stable
exploitation of high-quality samples. Our method integrates seamlessly with
both GRPO and its variant DR.~GRPO, resulting in $\textit{DRA-GRPO}$ and
$\textit{DGA-DR.~GRPO}$. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and find that it outperforms recent strong baselines. It achieves
state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 58.2%, using only
7,000 fine-tuning samples and a total training cost of approximately $55. The

TLDR: 前沿大型语言模型（Claude Sonnet 3.5）在实时对话测试中表现出比激励人类更强的说服能力，无论是引导正确还是错误答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较AI与人类在说服能力上的差异，尤其是在激励环境下。

Method: 通过预注册的大规模激励实验，让参与者完成在线测试，人类或LLM试图说服他们选择正确或错误答案。

Result: LLM在说服效果上显著优于人类，既能提高测试准确性（正确引导），也能降低准确性（错误引导）。

Conclusion: AI的说服能力已超越激励人类，凸显了对齐和治理框架的紧迫性。

Abstract: We directly compare the persuasion capabilities of a frontier large language
model (LLM; Claude Sonnet 3.5) against incentivized human persuaders in an
interactive, real-time conversational quiz setting. In this preregistered,
large-scale incentivized experiment, participants (quiz takers) completed an
online quiz where persuaders (either humans or LLMs) attempted to persuade quiz
takers toward correct or incorrect answers. We find that LLM persuaders
achieved significantly higher compliance with their directional persuasion
attempts than incentivized human persuaders, demonstrating superior persuasive
capabilities in both truthful (toward correct answers) and deceptive (toward
incorrect answers) contexts. We also find that LLM persuaders significantly
increased quiz takers' accuracy, leading to higher earnings, when steering quiz
takers toward correct answers, and significantly decreased their accuracy,
leading to lower earnings, when steering them toward incorrect answers.
Overall, our findings suggest that AI's persuasion capabilities already exceed
those of humans that have real-money bonuses tied to performance. Our findings
of increasingly capable AI persuaders thus underscore the urgency of emerging
alignment and governance frameworks.

*Yumin Choi,Jinheon Baek,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种双层系统提示优化方法，通过元学习框架优化系统提示，使其适应多样化的用户提示和未见任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注任务特定的用户提示优化，而忽略了跨任务通用的系统提示优化。

Method: 采用元学习框架，通过迭代优化系统提示和用户提示，确保二者协同。

Result: 在14个未见数据集上验证，优化的系统提示能有效泛化并快速适应新任务。

Conclusion: 优化的系统提示具有跨任务和领域的泛化能力，提升性能并减少优化步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, with
optimizing their input prompts playing a pivotal role in maximizing their
performance. However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic
system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt
optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or
tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized,
applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce
the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to
design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable
to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning
framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various
user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user
prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct
experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we
show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to
diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system
prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer
optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved
performance.

*Xin Liu,Lechen Zhang,Sheza Munir,Yiyang Gu,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: VeriFact是一个新的事实性评估框架，旨在通过识别和解决不完整或缺失的事实来提高长文本生成模型的事实性评估准确性。同时，FactRBench基准测试提供了对精确率和召回率的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估长文本生成模型的事实性时，难以捕捉关键上下文和关系事实，导致评估不准确。

Method: 提出VeriFact框架，通过增强事实提取和解决缺失事实来提高评估准确性；引入FactRBench基准测试，评估精确率和召回率。

Result: VeriFact显著提高了事实的完整性和关系信息的保留，FactRBench测试显示大模型在精确率和召回率上表现更好，但两者不一定相关。

Conclusion: VeriFact和FactRBench为长文本生成模型的事实性评估提供了更全面的工具，强调了综合评估的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating long-form responses, but
evaluating their factuality remains challenging due to complex inter-sentence
dependencies within the generated facts. Prior solutions predominantly follow a
decompose-decontextualize-verify pipeline but often fail to capture essential
context and miss key relational facts. In this paper, we introduce VeriFact, a
factuality evaluation framework designed to enhance fact extraction by
identifying and resolving incomplete and missing facts to support more accurate
verification results. Moreover, we introduce FactRBench , a benchmark that
evaluates both precision and recall in long-form model responses, whereas prior
work primarily focuses on precision. FactRBench provides reference fact sets
from advanced LLMs and human-written answers, enabling recall assessment.
Empirical evaluations show that VeriFact significantly enhances fact
completeness and preserves complex facts with critical relational information,
resulting in more accurate factuality evaluation. Benchmarking various open-
and close-weight LLMs on FactRBench indicate that larger models within same
model family improve precision and recall, but high precision does not always
correlate with high recall, underscoring the importance of comprehensive
factuality assessment.

TLDR: 论文介绍了如何利用LLMs高效开发、测试和应用分类法来分析非结构化数据，并通过迭代和协作过程展示了具体步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析开放式文本（如社交媒体帖子）耗时且易受偏见影响，LLMs为解决这一问题提供了潜力。

Method: 通过迭代和协作过程，使用LLMs生成、评估和优化分类法，并以参与者个人目标为例进行演示。

Result: 展示了如何通过提示生成分类法，并通过修改和测试实现高编码一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs在文本分析中具有潜力，但也存在局限性。

Abstract: Analyzing texts such as open-ended responses, headlines, or social media
posts is a time- and labor-intensive process highly susceptible to bias. LLMs
are promising tools for text analysis, using either a predefined (top-down) or
a data-driven (bottom-up) taxonomy, without sacrificing quality. Here we
present a step-by-step tutorial to efficiently develop, test, and apply
taxonomies for analyzing unstructured data through an iterative and
collaborative process between researchers and LLMs. Using personal goals
provided by participants as an example, we demonstrate how to write prompts to
review datasets and generate a taxonomy of life domains, evaluate and refine
the taxonomy through prompt and direct modifications, test the taxonomy and
assess intercoder agreements, and apply the taxonomy to categorize an entire
dataset with high intercoder reliability. We discuss the possibilities and
limitations of using LLMs for text analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出TokenAdapt框架，通过模型无关的tokenizer移植方法和多词Supertokens预分词学习，解决固定tokenization方案的限制，显著提升效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定tokenization方案导致多语言或专业应用中的效率低下和性能限制，现有方法计算资源需求高且语义保留不足。

Method: 引入TokenAdapt（混合启发式初始化新token嵌入）和Supertokens预分词学习，结合局部子词分解和全局语义相似性估计。

Result: TokenAdapt在零样本困惑度测试中显著优于基线方法（如ReTok和TransTokenizer），困惑度比降低至少2倍。

Conclusion: TokenAdapt框架有效解决了tokenizer锁定的问题，显著减少重训练需求并提升性能。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LLMs) are often constrained by their fixed
tokenization schemes, leading to inefficiencies and performance limitations,
particularly for multilingual or specialized applications. This tokenizer
lock-in presents significant challenges. standard methods to overcome this
often require prohibitive computational resources. Although tokenizer
replacement with heuristic initialization aims to reduce this burden, existing
methods often require exhaustive residual fine-tuning and still may not fully
preserve semantic nuances or adequately address the underlying compression
inefficiencies. Our framework introduces two innovations: first, Tokenadapt, a
model-agnostic tokenizer transplantation method, and second, novel
pre-tokenization learning for multi-word Supertokens to enhance compression and
reduce fragmentation. Tokenadapt initializes new unique token embeddings via a
hybrid heuristic that combines two methods: a local estimate based on subword
decomposition using the old tokenizer, and a global estimate utilizing the
top-k semantically similar tokens from the original vocabulary. This
methodology aims to preserve semantics while significantly minimizing
retraining requirements. Empirical investigations validate both contributions:
the transplantation heuristic successfully initializes unique tokens, markedly
outperforming conventional baselines and sophisticated methods including
Transtokenizer and ReTok, while our Supertokens achieve notable compression
gains. Our zero-shot perplexity results demonstrate that the TokenAdapt hybrid
initialization consistently yields lower perplexity ratios compared to both
ReTok and TransTokenizer baselines across different base models and newly
trained target tokenizers. TokenAdapt typically reduced the overall perplexity
ratio significantly compared to ReTok, yielding at least a 2-fold improvement
in these aggregate scores.

TLDR: 利用NLP技术（特别是NER）自动从电子健康记录中提取肺癌和乳腺癌的关键临床信息，使用uQuery工具和RoBERTa模型，取得了较高的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取临床报告信息耗时且易错，限制了医疗数据驱动方法的效率，NLP提供了自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用uQuery工具和基于RoBERTa的bsc-bio-ehr-en3模型进行NER，数据集为200份乳腺癌和400份肺癌报告。

Result: 整体性能良好，尤其在识别MET和PAT实体上表现优异，但较少见的EVOL实体仍有挑战。

Conclusion: NLP技术可有效提升临床数据提取的准确性和效率，尤其在肺癌和乳腺癌领域。

Abstract: Research projects, including those focused on cancer, rely on the manual
extraction of information from clinical reports. This process is time-consuming
and prone to errors, limiting the efficiency of data-driven approaches in
healthcare. To address these challenges, Natural Language Processing (NLP)
offers an alternative for automating the extraction of relevant data from
electronic health records (EHRs). In this study, we focus on lung and breast
cancer due to their high incidence and the significant impact they have on
public health. Early detection and effective data management in both types of
cancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes. To enhance the accuracy and
efficiency of data extraction, we utilized GMV's NLP tool uQuery, which excels
at identifying relevant entities in clinical texts and converting them into
standardized formats such as SNOMED and OMOP. uQuery not only detects and
classifies entities but also associates them with contextual information,
including negated entities, temporal aspects, and patient-related details. In
this work, we explore the use of NLP techniques, specifically Named Entity
Recognition (NER), to automatically identify and extract key clinical
information from EHRs related to these two cancers. A dataset from Health
Research Institute Hospital La Fe (IIS La Fe), comprising 200 annotated breast
cancer and 400 lung cancer reports, was used, with eight clinical entities
manually labeled using the Doccano platform. To perform NER, we fine-tuned the
bsc-bio-ehr-en3 model, a RoBERTa-based biomedical linguistic model pre-trained
in Spanish. Fine-tuning was performed using the Transformers architecture,
enabling accurate recognition of clinical entities in these cancer types. Our
results demonstrate strong overall performance, particularly in identifying
entities like MET and PAT, although challenges remain with less frequent
entities like EVOL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM中真理方向在不同对话格式中的泛化能力，以提升LLM谎言检测的可靠性。

Method: 使用线性探针分析LLM隐藏状态中的真理方向，测试其在短对话和长对话中的泛化能力，并提出添加固定关键词短语的解决方案。

Result: 短对话中真理方向泛化良好，但长对话中表现较差；添加固定关键词短语显著改善了长对话中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLM谎言检测在新场景中的泛化仍具挑战性，但通过特定方法（如添加关键词）可部分解决。

Abstract: Several recent works argue that LLMs have a universal truth direction where
true and false statements are linearly separable in the activation space of the
model. It has been demonstrated that linear probes trained on a single hidden
state of the model already generalize across a range of topics and might even
be used for lie detection in LLM conversations. In this work we explore how
this truth direction generalizes between various conversational formats. We
find good generalization between short conversations that end on a lie, but
poor generalization to longer formats where the lie appears earlier in the
input prompt. We propose a solution that significantly improves this type of
generalization by adding a fixed key phrase at the end of each conversation.
Our results highlight the challenges towards reliable LLM lie detectors that
generalize to new settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: KRISTEVA是首个用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在文学细读任务中表现的多选题基准，包含1331个问题。测试发现，LLMs在部分任务中表现尚可，但仍显著落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补现有基准在文学细读任务上的空白，评估LLMs在文学理解和推理方面的能力。

Method: 设计三个逐步增加难度的任务集，分别测试LLMs在提取风格特征、检索上下文信息及多跳推理中的表现。

Result: 当前最先进的LLMs在部分任务中表现尚可（准确率49.7% - 69.7%），但在11项任务中有10项落后于人类。

Conclusion: LLMs在文学细读任务中具备一定能力，但仍需进一步提升以接近人类水平。

Abstract: Each year, tens of millions of essays are written and graded in college-level
English courses. Students are asked to analyze literary and cultural texts
through a process known as close reading, in which they gather textual details
to formulate evidence-based arguments. Despite being viewed as a basis for
critical thinking and widely adopted as a required element of university
coursework, close reading has never been evaluated on large language models
(LLMs), and multi-discipline benchmarks like MMLU do not include literature as
a subject. To fill this gap, we present KRISTEVA, the first close reading
benchmark for evaluating interpretive reasoning, consisting of 1331
multiple-choice questions adapted from classroom data. With KRISTEVA, we
propose three progressively more difficult sets of tasks to approximate
different elements of the close reading process, which we use to test how well
LLMs may seem to understand and reason about literary works: 1) extracting
stylistic features, 2) retrieving relevant contextual information from
parametric knowledge, and 3) multi-hop reasoning between style and external
contexts. Our baseline results find that, while state-of-the-art LLMs possess
some college-level close reading competency (accuracy 49.7% - 69.7%), their
performances still trail those of experienced human evaluators on 10 out of our
11 tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在自然语言任务中表现出色，但其在冲突预测方面的能力尚未充分探索，这对早期预警系统和人道主义规划至关重要。

Method: 通过两部分评估框架，比较LLMs在仅依赖预训练知识（参数方法）和结合外部冲突数据（非参数方法）下的预测能力。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在冲突预测方面具有一定潜力，但结合外部结构化知识能显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: LLMs在冲突预测中具有应用价值，但需结合外部知识以弥补预训练数据的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across natural
language tasks, but their ability to forecast violent conflict remains
underexplored. We investigate whether LLMs possess meaningful parametric
knowledge-encoded in their pretrained weights-to predict conflict escalation
and fatalities without external data. This is critical for early warning
systems, humanitarian planning, and policy-making. We compare this parametric
knowledge with non-parametric capabilities, where LLMs access structured and
unstructured context from conflict datasets (e.g., ACLED, GDELT) and recent
news reports via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Incorporating external
information could enhance model performance by providing up-to-date context
otherwise missing from pretrained weights. Our two-part evaluation framework
spans 2020-2024 across conflict-prone regions in the Horn of Africa and the
Middle East. In the parametric setting, LLMs predict conflict trends and
fatalities relying only on pretrained knowledge. In the non-parametric setting,
models receive summaries of recent conflict events, indicators, and
geopolitical developments. We compare predicted conflict trend labels (e.g.,
Escalate, Stable Conflict, De-escalate, Peace) and fatalities against
historical data. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs
for conflict forecasting and the benefits of augmenting them with structured
external knowledge.

Conclusion: 分阶段超参数优化和元学习器调优方法显著提升了模型性能，为类似任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This case study applies a phased hyperparameter optimization process to
compare multitask natural language model variants that utilize multiphase
learning rate scheduling and optimizer parameter grouping. We employ short,
Bayesian optimization sessions that leverage multi-fidelity, hyperparameter
space pruning, progressive halving, and a degree of human guidance. We utilize
the Optuna TPE sampler and Hyperband pruner, as well as the Scikit-Learn
Gaussian process minimization. Initially, we use efficient low-fidelity sprints
to prune the hyperparameter space. Subsequent sprints progressively increase
their model fidelity and employ hyperband pruning for efficiency. A second
aspect of our approach is using a meta-learner to tune threshold values to
resolve classification probabilities during inference. We demonstrate our
method on a collection of variants of the 2021 Joint Entity and Relation
Extraction model proposed by Eberts and Ulges.

Conclusion: 实施本地化语言模型不仅能提升用户体验和信任，还能展示文化和社会语言意识，对国际化战略有积极影响。

Abstract: Large language models are, by definition, based on language. In an effort to
underscore the critical need for regional localized models, this paper examines
primary differences between variants of written Spanish across Latin America
and Spain, with an in-depth sociocultural and linguistic contextualization
therein. We argue that these differences effectively constitute significant
gaps in the quotidian use of Spanish among dialectal groups by creating
sociolinguistic dissonances, to the extent that locale-sensitive AI models
would play a pivotal role in bridging these divides. In doing so, this approach
informs better and more efficient localization strategies that also serve to
more adequately meet inclusivity goals, while securing sustainable active daily
user growth in a major low-risk investment geographic area. Therefore,
implementing at least the proposed five sub variants of Spanish addresses two
lines of action: to foment user trust and reliance on AI language models while
also demonstrating a level of cultural, historical, and sociolinguistic
awareness that reflects positively on any internationalization strategy.

Conclusion: 该框架为水印技术提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about the
misuse of AI-generated text, making watermarking a promising solution.
Mainstream watermarking schemes for LLMs fall into two categories: logits-based
and sampling-based. However, current schemes entail trade-offs among
robustness, text quality, and security. To mitigate this, we integrate
logits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths
to achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic
watermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid. The
hybrid framework adaptively embeds watermarks using token entropy and semantic
entropy, optimizing the balance between detectability, robustness, text
quality, and security. Furthermore, we validate our approach through
comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We believe this framework provides novel
insights into diverse watermarking paradigms. Our code is available at

Method: 通过识别训练数据中的问题内容，设计了一种通用越狱攻击方法，测试了多个先进模型的漏洞。

Result: 研究发现多个LLMs仍易受攻击，且行业对安全漏洞的响应不足。

Conclusion: 结论指出，若不采取果断措施，LLMs可能被广泛滥用，带来比预期更大的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly reshape modern life, advancing fields
from healthcare to education and beyond. However, alongside their remarkable
capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to
jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems
from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes
unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn
undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their
intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by
dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified
through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal
jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models,
enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon
request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months
ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack.
Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers
were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices
regarding AI safety. As model training becomes more accessible and cheaper, and
as open-source LLMs proliferate, the risk of widespread misuse escalates.
Without decisive intervention, LLMs may continue democratizing access to
dangerous knowledge, posing greater risks than anticipated.

Motivation: 现有提示优化方法依赖大型LLM生成提示，但可能因兼容性问题导致轻量级模型响应质量下降。

Method: 提出模型无关的提示质量指标，并基于这些指标训练MePO，使用轻量级LLM生成对齐的提示数据集。

Result: MePO在多样化任务和模型类型中表现优异，降低了成本和隐私风险。

Conclusion: MePO为实际部署提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt optimization (PO) offers a practical alternative to fine-tuning large
language models (LLMs), enabling performance improvements without altering
model weights. Existing methods typically rely on advanced, large-scale LLMs
like GPT-4 to generate optimized prompts. However, due to limited downward
compatibility, verbose, instruction-heavy prompts from advanced LLMs can
overwhelm lightweight inference models and degrade response quality. In this
work, we rethink prompt optimization through the lens of interpretable design.
We first identify a set of model-agnostic prompt quality merits and empirically
validate their effectiveness in enhancing prompt and response quality. We then
introduce MePO, a merit-guided, lightweight, and locally deployable prompt
optimizer trained on our preference dataset built from merit-aligned prompts
generated by a lightweight LLM. Unlike prior work, MePO avoids online
optimization reliance, reduces cost and privacy concerns, and, by learning
clear, interpretable merits, generalizes effectively to both large-scale and
lightweight inference models. Experiments demonstrate that MePO achieves better
results across diverse tasks and model types, offering a scalable and robust
solution for real-world deployment. Our model and dataset are available at:

Result: 实验显示，该方法在理解个人信息和生成准确响应方面显著优于基线LLMs，且响应时间略有减少。

Conclusion: 结合知识图谱的检索增强生成方法能有效提升LLMs在个性化响应生成中的准确性和效率。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has allowed numerous applications,
including the generation of queried responses, to be leveraged in chatbots and
other conversational assistants. Being trained on a plethora of data, LLMs
often undergo high levels of over-fitting, resulting in the generation of extra
and incorrect data, thus causing hallucinations in output generation. One of
the root causes of such problems is the lack of timely, factual, and
personalized information fed to the LLM. In this paper, we propose an approach
to address these problems by introducing retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
using knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist the LLM in personalized response
generation tailored to the users. KGs have the advantage of storing
continuously updated factual information in a structured way. While our KGs can
be used for a variety of frequently updated personal data, such as calendar,
contact, and location data, we focus on calendar data in this paper. Our
experimental results show that our approach works significantly better in
understanding personal information and generating accurate responses compared
to the baseline LLMs using personal data as text inputs, with a moderate
reduction in response time.

### [121] [DIF: A Framework for Benchmarking and Verifying Implicit Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10013)
*Lake Yin,Fan Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种衡量大语言模型（LLM）隐性偏见的方法DIF，通过结合社会人口角色评估现有数据集，验证了隐性偏见的存在及其与回答准确性的负相关关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决LLM中隐性偏见的伦理和技术问题，缺乏标准化的评估方法。

Method: 开发了DIF（Demographic Implicit Fairness）方法，通过结合社会人口角色评估LLM的逻辑和数学问题数据集。

Result: 统计验证了LLM行为中的隐性偏见，并发现回答准确性与隐性偏见呈负相关。

Conclusion: DIF方法为LLM隐性偏见的评估提供了标准化工具，支持隐性偏见既是伦理问题也是技术问题的观点。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen in prominence over the past few
years, there has been concern over the potential biases in LLMs inherited from
the training data. Previous studies have examined how LLMs exhibit implicit
bias, such as when response generation changes when different social contexts
are introduced. We argue that this implicit bias is not only an ethical, but
also a technical issue, as it reveals an inability of LLMs to accommodate
extraneous information. However, unlike other measures of LLM intelligence,
there are no standard methods to benchmark this specific subset of LLM bias. To
bridge this gap, we developed a method for calculating an easily interpretable
benchmark, DIF (Demographic Implicit Fairness), by evaluating preexisting LLM
logic and math problem datasets with sociodemographic personas. We demonstrate
that this method can statistically validate the presence of implicit bias in
LLM behavior and find an inverse trend between question answering accuracy and
implicit bias, supporting our argument.

*Han Peng,Jinhao Jiang,Zican Dong,Wayne Xin Zhao,Lei Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: CAFE是一种两阶段粗到细的方法，用于提升多文档问答能力，通过逐步消除背景和干扰文档的负面影响，使回答更依赖证据文档。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型的输入上下文长度有所扩展，但在长上下文输入中的检索和推理仍存在问题，现有方法在平衡检索精度和召回率方面面临挑战。

Method: CAFE采用两阶段方法：粗粒度过滤利用检索头识别和排序相关文档，细粒度引导将注意力集中在最相关内容上。

Result: 实验表明，CAFE在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，在Mistral模型上分别比SFT和RAG方法提高了22.1%和13.7%的SubEM分数。

Conclusion: CAFE通过两阶段方法有效提升了多文档问答能力，解决了现有方法在检索和推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their input
context length, yet they still struggle with retrieval and reasoning in
long-context inputs. Existing methods propose to utilize the prompt strategy
and retrieval head to alleviate this limitation. However, they still face
challenges in balancing retrieval precision and recall, impacting their
efficacy in answering questions. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{CAFE}$,
a two-stage coarse-to-fine method to enhance multi-document question-answering
capacities. By gradually eliminating the negative impacts of background and
distracting documents, CAFE makes the responses more reliant on the evidence
documents. Initially, a coarse-grained filtering method leverages retrieval
heads to identify and rank relevant documents. Then, a fine-grained steering
method guides attention to the most relevant content. Experiments across
benchmarks show CAFE outperforms baselines, achieving up to 22.1% and 13.7%
SubEM improvement over SFT and RAG methods on the Mistral model, respectively.

TLDR: 本文系统研究了预训练语言模型（PLM）对非洲语言的语言学知识编码能力，发现针对非洲语言优化的PLM比多语言PLM表现更好，并揭示了语言学信息在模型中的分布规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练语言模型在非洲语言中的语言学知识编码能力及其改进原因。

Method: 训练分层探针分析六种非洲语言的语言学特征分布，并设计控制任务验证探针性能。

Result: 优化的PLM比多语言PLM编码更多目标语言信息；句法信息集中于中后层，语义信息分布全层；性能反映模型内部知识而非探针记忆。

Conclusion: 研究为非洲语言PLM的成功策略（如主动学习和多语言适应）提供了内部机制解释。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (PLMs) for African languages are continually
improving, but the reasons behind these advances remain unclear. This paper
presents the first systematic investigation into probing PLMs for linguistic
knowledge about African languages. We train layer-wise probes for six
typologically diverse African languages to analyse how linguistic features are
distributed. We also design control tasks, a way to interpret probe
performance, for the MasakhaPOS dataset. We find PLMs adapted for African
languages to encode more linguistic information about target languages than
massively multilingual PLMs. Our results reaffirm previous findings that
token-level syntactic information concentrates in middle-to-last layers, while
sentence-level semantic information is distributed across all layers. Through
control tasks and probing baselines, we confirm that performance reflects the
internal knowledge of PLMs rather than probe memorisation. Our study applies
established interpretability techniques to African-language PLMs. In doing so,
we highlight the internal mechanisms underlying the success of strategies like
active learning and multilingual adaptation.

TLDR: XRAG是一个新的基准测试，用于评估LLM在跨语言检索增强生成（RAG）中的生成能力，特别是在用户语言与检索结果不匹配的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在跨语言RAG中的表现，特别是在复杂推理和语言正确性方面的挑战。

Method: 构建XRAG数据集，基于新闻文章生成需要外部知识的问题，涵盖单语和多语检索场景，并提供相关性标注。

Result: 实验发现LLM在单语检索中语言正确性不足，在多语检索中跨语言推理是主要挑战。

Conclusion: XRAG是研究LLM推理能力的有效工具，揭示了跨语言RAG中的新挑战。

Abstract: We propose XRAG, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the generation
abilities of LLMs in cross-lingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
settings where the user language does not match the retrieval results. XRAG is
constructed from recent news articles to ensure that its questions require
external knowledge to be answered. It covers the real-world scenarios of
monolingual and multilingual retrieval, and provides relevancy annotations for
each retrieved document. Our novel dataset construction pipeline results in
questions that require complex reasoning, as evidenced by the significant gap
between human and LLM performance. Consequently, XRAG serves as a valuable
benchmark for studying LLM reasoning abilities, even before considering the
additional cross-lingual complexity. Experimental results on five LLMs uncover
two previously unreported challenges in cross-lingual RAG: 1) in the
monolingual retrieval setting, all evaluated models struggle with response
language correctness; 2) in the multilingual retrieval setting, the main
challenge lies in reasoning over retrieved information across languages rather
than generation of non-English text.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: S-MedQA是一个英语医学问答数据集，用于评估大型语言模型在细粒度临床专业中的表现。研究发现，专业数据的训练不一定带来最佳性能，且临床相关术语的概率普遍提升，表明改进主要来自领域转换而非知识注入。

Motivation: 研究旨在验证知识注入假设在医学问答中的适用性，并探索微调数据对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用S-MedQA数据集，分析不同临床专业数据的训练效果，观察模型在专业领域的表现及术语概率变化。

Result: 1) 专业数据训练未必带来最佳性能；2) 所有专业的临床相关术语概率一致提升。

Conclusion: 改进主要源于领域转换而非知识注入，建议重新思考医学领域微调数据的作用。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce S-MedQA, an English medical question-answering
(QA) dataset for benchmarking large language models in fine-grained clinical
specialties. We use S-MedQA to check the applicability of a popular hypothesis
related to knowledge injection in the knowledge-intense scenario of medical QA,
and show that: 1) training on data from a speciality does not necessarily lead
to best performance on that specialty and 2) regardless of the specialty
fine-tuned on, token probabilities of clinically relevant terms for all
specialties increase consistently. Thus, we believe improvement gains come
mostly from domain shifting (e.g., general to medical) rather than knowledge
injection and suggest rethinking the role of fine-tuning data in the medical
domain. We release S-MedQA and all code needed to reproduce all our experiments
to the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM输出不可靠和幻觉问题，增强用户信任。

Method: 结合知识图谱、检索增强生成、CoT逻辑、n跳子图搜索和蕴含句子生成。

Result: 提升模型在自由上下文中识别证据的能力，增强结论可信度。

Conclusion: GE-Chat为LLM结论提供可靠资源检查方法，提升可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models are now key assistants in human decision-making
processes. However, a common note always seems to follow: "LLMs can make
mistakes. Be careful with important info." This points to the reality that not
all outputs from LLMs are dependable, and users must evaluate them manually.
The challenge deepens as hallucinated responses, often presented with seemingly
plausible explanations, create complications and raise trust issues among
users. To tackle such issue, this paper proposes GE-Chat, a knowledge Graph
enhanced retrieval-augmented generation framework to provide Evidence-based
response generation. Specifically, when the user uploads a material document, a
knowledge graph will be created, which helps construct a retrieval-augmented
agent, enhancing the agent's responses with additional knowledge beyond its
training corpus. Then we leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic generation,
n-hop sub-graph searching, and entailment-based sentence generation to realize
accurate evidence retrieval. We demonstrate that our method improves the
existing models' performance in terms of identifying the exact evidence in a
free-form context, providing a reliable way to examine the resources of LLM's
conclusion and help with the judgment of the trustworthiness.

TLDR: 论文研究了通过合成数据改进大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力，提出了一种称为Reasoning CPT的持续预训练方法，并在多个领域验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如监督微调和强化学习）在训练推理模型时局限于特定领域，而持续预训练（CPT）虽无需任务特定信号，但如何有效合成推理数据及其跨领域影响尚不明确。

Method: 提出Reasoning CPT，利用合成数据重建文本背后的隐藏思维过程，并在Gemma2-9B模型上应用，数据来源于STEM和法律语料库。

Result: Reasoning CPT在所有评估领域均提升性能，推理能力可跨领域迁移，且在难题上表现更优（最高提升8分）。模型还能根据问题难度调整推理深度。

Conclusion: Reasoning CPT是一种有效的跨领域推理能力提升方法，尤其在复杂问题上表现突出，为LLMs的通用推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning. However, when training reasoning models, these approaches are
primarily applicable to specific domains such as mathematics and programming,
which imposes fundamental constraints on the breadth and scalability of
training data. In contrast, continual pretraining (CPT) offers the advantage of
not requiring task-specific signals. Nevertheless, how to effectively
synthesize training data for reasoning and how such data affect a wide range of
domains remain largely unexplored. This study provides a detailed evaluation of
Reasoning CPT, a form of CPT that uses synthetic data to reconstruct the hidden
thought processes underlying texts, based on the premise that texts are the
result of the author's thinking process. Specifically, we apply Reasoning CPT
to Gemma2-9B using synthetic data with hidden thoughts derived from STEM and
Law corpora, and compare it to standard CPT on the MMLU benchmark. Our analysis
reveals that Reasoning CPT consistently improves performance across all
evaluated domains. Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer
effectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as
problem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most
challenging problems. Furthermore, models trained with hidden thoughts learn to
adjust the depth of their reasoning according to problem difficulty.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型中的长链思维（CoT）推理策略的多样性，并超越基于人类直觉的分类方法。

Method: 自动提取模型生成的CoT中的推理标准，嵌入语义空间，聚类为代表性类别，并生成对比性准则来解释推理行为。

Result: 框架生成的分析比现有方法更具可解释性和全面性，并能预测和优化模型推理策略。

Conclusion: CoT Encyclopedia框架能有效分析和引导模型推理，同时揭示了训练数据格式对推理行为的重要影响。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) is an essential ingredient in effective usage of
modern large language models, but our understanding of the reasoning strategies
underlying these capabilities remains limited. While some prior works have
attempted to categorize CoTs using predefined strategy types, such approaches
are constrained by human intuition and fail to capture the full diversity of
model behaviors. In this work, we introduce the CoT Encyclopedia, a bottom-up
framework for analyzing and steering model reasoning. Our method automatically
extracts diverse reasoning criteria from model-generated CoTs, embeds them into
a semantic space, clusters them into representative categories, and derives
contrastive rubrics to interpret reasoning behavior. Human evaluations show
that this framework produces more interpretable and comprehensive analyses than
existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that this understanding enables
performance gains: we can predict which strategy a model is likely to use and
guide it toward more effective alternatives. Finally, we provide practical
insights, such as that training data format (e.g., free-form vs.
multiple-choice) has a far greater impact on reasoning behavior than data
domain, underscoring the importance of format-aware model design.

TLDR: VQ-Logits利用向量量化技术显著减少LLM输出层的参数和计算成本，仅略微增加困惑度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM输出层因大词汇量导致的高计算和内存开销问题。

Method: 用小型共享码本替代大输出嵌入矩阵，预测码本上的logits并映射到完整词汇空间。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，参数减少99%，计算速度提升6倍，困惑度仅增加4%。

Conclusion: VQ-Logits是一种高效且稳健的LLM输出层优化方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but face
significant computational and memory challenges, particularly due to their
extensive output vocabularies. The final linear projection layer, mapping
hidden states to vocabulary-sized logits, often constitutes a substantial
portion of the model's parameters and computational cost during inference.
Existing methods like adaptive softmax or hierarchical softmax introduce
structural complexities. In this paper, we propose VQ-Logits, a novel approach
that leverages Vector Quantization (VQ) to drastically reduce the parameter
count and computational load of the LLM output layer. VQ-Logits replaces the
large V * dmodel output embedding matrix with a small, shared codebook of K
embedding vectors (K << V ). Each token in the vocabulary is mapped to one of
these K codebook vectors. The LLM predicts logits over this compact codebook,
which are then efficiently "scattered" to the full vocabulary space using the
learned or preassigned mapping. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on
standard language modeling benchmarks (e.g., WikiText-103, C4) that VQ-Logits
can achieve up to 99% parameter reduction in the output layer and 6x speedup in
logit computation, with only a marginal 4% increase in perplexity compared to
full softmax baselines. We further provide detailed ablation studies on
codebook size, initialization, and learning strategies, showcasing the
robustness and effectiveness of our approach.

Method: 提出RAIDEN-R1框架，整合VRAR奖励机制，采用单术语和多术语挖掘策略生成量化奖励，并构建高质量角色感知数据集。

Result: 14B-GRPO模型在Script-Based Knowledge和Conversation Memory指标上分别达到88.04%和88.65%的准确率，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: RAIDEN-R1填补了RPCA训练中的量化空白，推动了角色感知推理模式的发展。

Abstract: Role-playing conversational agents (RPCAs) face persistent challenges in
maintaining role consistency. To address this, we propose RAIDEN-R1, a novel
reinforcement learning framework that integrates Verifiable Role-Awareness
Reward (VRAR). The method introduces both singular and multi-term mining
strategies to generate quantifiable rewards by assessing role-specific keys.
Additionally, we construct a high-quality, role-aware Chain-of-Thought dataset
through multi-LLM collaboration, and implement experiments to enhance reasoning
coherence. Experiments on the RAIDEN benchmark demonstrate RAIDEN-R1's
superiority: our 14B-GRPO model achieves 88.04% and 88.65% accuracy on
Script-Based Knowledge and Conversation Memory metrics, respectively,
outperforming baseline models while maintaining robustness. Case analyses
further reveal the model's enhanced ability to resolve conflicting contextual
cues and sustain first-person narrative consistency. This work bridges the
non-quantifiability gap in RPCA training and provides insights into role-aware
reasoning patterns, advancing the development of RPCAs.

Abstract: In the era of increasingly sophisticated natural language processing (NLP)
systems, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential
for diverse applications, including tasks requiring nuanced textual
understanding and contextual reasoning. This study investigates the
capabilities of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLAMA3,
Mistral 7B, and Claude-2 - for zero-shot and few-shot annotation of a complex
textual dataset comprising social media posts in Russian and Ukrainian.
Specifically, the focus is on the binary classification task of identifying
references to human rights violations within the dataset.
  To evaluate the effectiveness of these models, their annotations are compared
against a gold standard set of human double-annotated labels across 1000
samples. The analysis includes assessing annotation performance under different
prompting conditions, with prompts provided in both English and Russian.
Additionally, the study explores the unique patterns of errors and
disagreements exhibited by each model, offering insights into their strengths,
limitations, and cross-linguistic adaptability.
  By juxtaposing LLM outputs with human annotations, this research contributes
to understanding the reliability and applicability of LLMs for sensitive,
domain-specific tasks in multilingual contexts. It also sheds light on how
language models handle inherently subjective and context-dependent judgments, a
critical consideration for their deployment in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 临床实践中整合科学证据面临巨大工作量和时间限制，需要自动化工具支持高效决策。

Method: Quicker通过全自动流程（从问题分解到生成建议）和交互式界面，结合Q2CRBench-3基准数据集评估性能。

Result: Quicker在问题分解、文献筛选和推荐逻辑上表现优异，与人类专家合作可将建议开发时间缩短至20-40分钟。

Conclusion: Quicker能帮助医生更快、更可靠地做出基于证据的临床决策。

Abstract: Clinical evidence, derived from rigorous research and data analysis, provides
healthcare professionals with reliable scientific foundations for informed
decision-making. Integrating clinical evidence into real-time practice is
challenging due to the enormous workload, complex professional processes, and
time constraints. This highlights the need for tools that automate evidence
synthesis to support more efficient and accurate decision making in clinical
settings. This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision
support system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate
evidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard
clinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated
chain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and
further enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and
interactive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed
the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development
records for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted
Quicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored
to user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and
literature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of
relevant studies. In addition, Quicker-assisted evidence assessment effectively
supported human reviewers, while Quicker's recommendations were more
comprehensive and logically coherent than those of clinicians. In system-level
testing, collaboration between a single reviewer and Quicker reduced the time
required for recommendation development to 20-40 minutes. In general, our
findings affirm the potential of Quicker to help physicians make quicker and
more reliable evidence-based clinical decisions.

Motivation: AI评估质量限制了其发展，LLM-as-a-Judge模型通过更强的思维链推理能力提升判断能力。

Method: 采用强化学习训练J1模型，将可验证和不可验证提示转化为带奖励的判断任务，减少偏见。

Result: J1在8B和70B规模下表现优于其他模型，甚至在某些基准上超越更大模型。

Conclusion: J1通过优化训练方法提升判断能力，为AI评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The progress of AI is bottlenecked by the quality of evaluation, and powerful
LLM-as-a-Judge models have proved to be a core solution. Improved judgment
ability is enabled by stronger chain-of-thought reasoning, motivating the need
to find the best recipes for training such models to think. In this work we
introduce J1, a reinforcement learning approach to training such models. Our
method converts both verifiable and non-verifiable prompts to judgment tasks
with verifiable rewards that incentivize thinking and mitigate judgment bias.
In particular, our approach outperforms all other existing 8B or 70B models
when trained at those sizes, including models distilled from DeepSeek-R1. J1
also outperforms o1-mini, and even R1 on some benchmarks, despite training a
smaller model. We provide analysis and ablations comparing Pairwise-J1 vs
Pointwise-J1 models, offline vs online training recipes, reward strategies,
seed prompts, and variations in thought length and content. We find that our
models make better judgments by learning to outline evaluation criteria,
comparing against self-generated reference answers, and re-evaluating the
correctness of model responses.

Abstract: Semantic text representation is a fundamental task in the field of natural
language processing. Existing text embedding (e.g., SimCSE and LLM2Vec) have
demonstrated excellent performance, but the values of each dimension are
difficult to trace and interpret. Bag-of-words, as classic sparse interpretable
embeddings, suffers from poor performance. Recently, Benara et al. (2024)
propose interpretable text embeddings using large language models, which forms
"0/1" embeddings based on responses to a series of questions. These
interpretable text embeddings are typically high-dimensional (larger than
10,000). In this work, we propose Low-dimensional (lower than 500) Dense and
Interpretable text embeddings with Relative representations (LDIR). The
numerical values of its dimensions indicate semantic relatedness to different
anchor texts through farthest point sampling, offering both semantic
representation as well as a certain level of traceability and interpretability.
We validate LDIR on multiple semantic textual similarity, retrieval, and
clustering tasks. Extensive experimental results show that LDIR performs close
to the black-box baseline models and outperforms the interpretable embeddings
baselines with much fewer dimensions. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类思维本质是多模态的，但现有研究多限于单模态输入，限制了语言重建的生态效度和泛化性。

Method: 采用多模态专家联合解释视觉、听觉和文本输入的统一框架，基于视觉语言模型（VLMs）。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了更具生态效度和泛化性的思维解码技术发展。

Abstract: Decoding thoughts from brain activity offers valuable insights into human
cognition and enables promising applications in brain-computer interaction.
While prior studies have explored language reconstruction from fMRI data, they
are typically limited to single-modality inputs such as images or audio. In
contrast, human thought is inherently multimodal. To bridge this gap, we
propose a unified and flexible framework for reconstructing coherent language
from brain recordings elicited by diverse input modalities-visual, auditory,
and textual. Our approach leverages visual-language models (VLMs), using
modality-specific experts to jointly interpret information across modalities.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art systems while remaining adaptable and extensible. This work
advances toward more ecologically valid and generalizable mind decoding.

Abstract: This paper explores the design of an aspect-based sentiment analysis system
using large language models (LLMs) for real-world use. We focus on quadruple
opinion extraction -- identifying aspect categories, sentiment polarity,
targets, and opinion expressions from text data across different domains and
languages. Using internal datasets, we investigate whether a single fine-tuned
model can effectively handle multiple domain-specific taxonomies
simultaneously. We demonstrate that a combined multi-domain model achieves
performance comparable to specialized single-domain models while reducing
operational complexity. We also share lessons learned for handling
non-extractive predictions and evaluating various failure modes when developing
LLM-based systems for structured prediction tasks.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于语法的解码方法RPG，用于解决代码生成中的结构重复问题，显著提升了生成代码的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经语言模型虽然提升了代码生成性能，但重复问题仍然存在，尤其是结构重复问题，尚未得到充分解决。

Method: RPG利用语法规则识别重复问题，并通过衰减关键令牌的似然来减少重复。

Result: RPG在CodeRepetEval、HumanEval和MBPP基准测试中显著优于基线方法，有效减少了重复。

Conclusion: RPG方法能有效缓解代码生成中的结构重复问题，提升生成代码的质量。

Abstract: With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation
has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the
generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on
content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition
problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is
structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in
various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently
reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition
and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for
Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems
in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to
identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically
decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,
thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we
construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches
for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the
best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and
MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of
generated code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在生成PLS时理解效果不明确的问题，填补现有评估方法的不足。

Method: 通过大规模众包评估（150名参与者），结合主观评分和客观理解测试，比较LLM与人工PLS的效果，并检验自动化指标的可靠性。

Result: LLM生成的PLS在主观评价中表现良好，但人工编写的PLS在理解效果上更优；自动化指标与人类判断不一致。

Conclusion: 需要开发超越表面质量的评估框架，并优化生成方法以提升普通人理解效果。

Abstract: Plain language summaries (PLSs) are essential for facilitating effective
communication between clinicians and patients by making complex medical
information easier for laypeople to understand and act upon. Large language
models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in automating PLS generation, but
their effectiveness in supporting health information comprehension remains
unclear. Prior evaluations have generally relied on automated scores that do
not measure understandability directly, or subjective Likert-scale ratings from
convenience samples with limited generalizability. To address these gaps, we
conducted a large-scale crowdsourced evaluation of LLM-generated PLSs using
Amazon Mechanical Turk with 150 participants. We assessed PLS quality through
subjective Likert-scale ratings focusing on simplicity, informativeness,
coherence, and faithfulness; and objective multiple-choice comprehension and
recall measures of reader understanding. Additionally, we examined the
alignment between 10 automated evaluation metrics and human judgments. Our
findings indicate that while LLMs can generate PLSs that appear
indistinguishable from human-written ones in subjective evaluations,
human-written PLSs lead to significantly better comprehension. Furthermore,
automated evaluation metrics fail to reflect human judgment, calling into
question their suitability for evaluating PLSs. This is the first study to
systematically evaluate LLM-generated PLSs based on both reader preferences and
comprehension outcomes. Our findings highlight the need for evaluation
frameworks that move beyond surface-level quality and for generation methods
that explicitly optimize for layperson comprehension.

Abstract: Real-world RAG applications often encounter long-context input scenarios,
where redundant information and noise results in higher inference costs and
reduced performance. To address these challenges, we propose LongRefiner, an
efficient plug-and-play refiner that leverages the inherent structural
characteristics of long documents. LongRefiner employs dual-level query

multi-task learning on a single foundation model. Experiments on seven QA
datasets demonstrate that LongRefiner achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while using 10x fewer computational costs and latency
compared to the best baseline. Further analysis validates that LongRefiner is
scalable, efficient, and effective, providing practical insights for real-world
long-text RAG applications. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统链式思维方法（CoT）是线性、因果的，限制了推理灵活性。DCoLT旨在通过扩散模型的中间步骤实现更自由的推理。

Method: DCoLT利用反向扩散过程的中间步骤作为潜在“思考”动作，通过基于结果的强化学习优化推理轨迹。在SEDD和LLaDA两种扩散语言模型上实现。

Result: 实验表明，DCoLT在数学和代码生成任务中表现优异，显著提升推理准确率（如LLaDA在GSM8K等任务上提升9.8%-19.5%）。

Conclusion: DCoLT为扩散语言模型提供了一种高效的推理框架，突破了传统线性思维的局限，显著提升了任务性能。

Abstract: We introduce the \emph{Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought (DCoLT)}, a
reasoning framework for diffusion language models. DCoLT treats each
intermediate step in the reverse diffusion process as a latent "thinking"
action and optimizes the entire reasoning trajectory to maximize the reward on
the correctness of the final answer with outcome-based Reinforcement Learning
(RL). Unlike traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods that follow a causal,
linear thinking process, DCoLT allows bidirectional, non-linear reasoning with
no strict rule on grammatical correctness amid its intermediate steps of
thought. We implement DCoLT on two representative Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs). First, we choose SEDD as a representative continuous-time discrete
diffusion model, where its concrete score derives a probabilistic policy to
maximize the RL reward over the entire sequence of intermediate diffusion
steps. We further consider the discrete-time masked diffusion language model --
LLaDA, and find that the order to predict and unmask tokens plays an essential
role to optimize its RL action resulting from the ranking-based Unmasking
Policy Module (UPM) defined by the Plackett-Luce model. Experiments on both
math and code generation tasks show that using only public data and 16 H800
GPUs, DCoLT-reinforced DLMs outperform other DLMs trained by SFT or RL or even
both. Notably, DCoLT-reinforced LLaDA boosts its reasoning accuracy by +9.8%,
+5.7%, +11.4%, +19.5% on GSM8K, MATH, MBPP, and HumanEval.

Conclusion: CL-RAG框架通过课程学习有效提升了RAG系统的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an effective method to enhance the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods focus on
optimizing the retriever or generator in the RAG system by directly utilizing
the top-k retrieved documents. However, the documents effectiveness are various
significantly across user queries, i.e. some documents provide valuable
knowledge while others totally lack critical information. It hinders the
retriever and generator's adaptation during training. Inspired by human
cognitive learning, curriculum learning trains models using samples progressing
from easy to difficult, thus enhancing their generalization ability, and we
integrate this effective paradigm to the training of the RAG system. In this
paper, we propose a multi-stage Curriculum Learning based RAG system training
framework, named CL-RAG. We first construct training data with multiple
difficulty levels for the retriever and generator separately through sample
evolution. Then, we train the model in stages based on the curriculum learning
approach, thereby optimizing the overall performance and generalization of the
RAG system more effectively. Our CL-RAG framework demonstrates consistent
effectiveness across four open-domain QA datasets, achieving performance gains
of 2% to 4% over multiple advanced methods.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM代码安全的关键挑战和优化方向，为未来研究提供参考。

Abstract: Code security and usability are both essential for various coding assistant
applications driven by large language models (LLMs). Current code security
benchmarks focus solely on single evaluation task and paradigm, such as code
completion and generation, lacking comprehensive assessment across dimensions
like secure code generation, vulnerability repair and discrimination. In this
paper, we first propose CoV-Eval, a multi-task benchmark covering various tasks
such as code completion, vulnerability repair, vulnerability detection and
classification, for comprehensive evaluation of LLM code security. Besides, we
developed VC-Judge, an improved judgment model that aligns closely with human
experts and can review LLM-generated programs for vulnerabilities in a more
efficient and reliable way. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
proprietary and open-source LLMs. Overall, while most LLMs identify vulnerable
codes well, they still tend to generate insecure codes and struggle with
recognizing specific vulnerability types and performing repairs. Extensive
experiments and qualitative analyses reveal key challenges and optimization
directions, offering insights for future research in LLM code security.

Abstract: Translation-based strategies for cross-lingual transfer XLT such as
translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the
source language -- and translate-test -- evaluating on noisy source language
data translated from the target language -- are competitive XLT baselines. In
XLT for token classification tasks, however, these strategies include label
projection, the challenging step of mapping the labels from each token in the
original sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. Although word
aligners (WAs) are commonly used for label projection, the low-level design
decisions for applying them to translation-based XLT have not been
systematically investigated. Moreover, recent marker-based methods, which
project labeled spans by inserting tags around them before (or after)
translation, claim to outperform WAs in label projection for XLT. In this work,
we revisit WAs for label projection, systematically investigating the effects
of low-level design decisions on token-level XLT: (i) the algorithm for
projecting labels between (multi-)token spans, (ii) filtering strategies to
reduce the number of noisily mapped labels, and (iii) the pre-tokenization of
the translated sentences. We find that all of these substantially impact
translation-based XLT performance and show that, with optimized choices, XLT
with WA offers performance at least comparable to that of marker-based methods.
We then introduce a new projection strategy that ensembles translate-train and
translate-test predictions and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms
the marker-based projection. Crucially, we show that our proposed ensembling
also reduces sensitivity to low-level WA design choices, resulting in more
robust XLT for token classification tasks.

Abstract: Multi-token prediction has emerged as a promising objective for improving
language model pretraining, but its benefits have not consistently generalized
to other settings such as fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose MuToR, a
simple and effective approach to multi-token prediction that interleaves
learnable register tokens into the input sequence, each tasked with predicting
future targets. Compared to existing methods, MuToR offers several key
advantages: it introduces only a negligible number of additional parameters,
requires no architectural changes--ensuring compatibility with off-the-shelf
pretrained language models--and remains aligned with the next-token pretraining
objective, making it especially well-suited for supervised fine-tuning.
Moreover, it naturally supports scalable prediction horizons. We demonstrate
the effectiveness and versatility of MuToR across a range of use cases,
including supervised fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and
pretraining, on challenging generative tasks in both language and vision
domains. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/nasosger/MuToR.

Abstract: Motivated by scaling laws in language modeling that demonstrate how test loss
scales as a power law with model and dataset sizes, we find that similar laws
exist in preference modeling. We propose World Preference Modeling$ (WorldPM)
to emphasize this scaling potential, where World Preference embodies a unified
representation of human preferences. In this paper, we collect preference data
from public forums covering diverse user communities, and conduct extensive
training using 15M-scale data across models ranging from 1.5B to 72B
parameters. We observe distinct patterns across different evaluation metrics:
(1) Adversarial metrics (ability to identify deceptive features) consistently
scale up with increased training data and base model size; (2) Objective
metrics (objective knowledge with well-defined answers) show emergent behavior
in larger language models, highlighting WorldPM's scalability potential; (3)
Subjective metrics (subjective preferences from a limited number of humans or
AI) do not demonstrate scaling trends. Further experiments validate the
effectiveness of WorldPM as a foundation for preference fine-tuning. Through
evaluations on 7 benchmarks with 20 subtasks, we find that WorldPM broadly
improves the generalization performance across human preference datasets of
varying sizes (7K, 100K and 800K samples), with performance gains exceeding 5%
on many key subtasks. Integrating WorldPM into our internal RLHF pipeline, we
observe significant improvements on both in-house and public evaluation sets,
with notable gains of 4% to 8% in our in-house evaluations.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) already possess a latent capacity for long
chain-of-thought reasoning. Prior work has shown that outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) can incidentally elicit advanced reasoning
behaviors such as self-correction, backtracking, and verification phenomena
often referred to as the model's "aha moment". However, the timing and
consistency of these emergent behaviors remain unpredictable and
uncontrollable, limiting the scalability and reliability of LRMs' reasoning
capabilities. To address these limitations, we move beyond reliance on prompts
and coincidental "aha moments". Instead, we explicitly align models with three
meta-abilities: deduction, induction, and abduction, using automatically
generated, self-verifiable tasks. Our three stage-pipeline individual
alignment, parameter-space merging, and domain-specific reinforcement learning,
boosting performance by over 10\% relative to instruction-tuned baselines.
Furthermore, domain-specific RL from the aligned checkpoint yields an
additional 2\% average gain in the performance ceiling across math, coding, and
science benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit meta-ability alignment offers a
scalable and dependable foundation for reasoning. Code is available at:

Abstract: Effective communication about breast and cervical cancers remains a
persistent health challenge, with significant gaps in public understanding of
cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, potentially leading to delayed
diagnoses and inadequate treatments. This study evaluates the capabilities and
limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate, safe, and
accessible cancer-related information to support patient understanding. We
evaluated five general-purpose and three medical LLMs using a mixed-methods
evaluation framework across linguistic quality, safety and trustworthiness, and
communication accessibility and affectiveness. Our approach utilized
quantitative metrics, qualitative expert ratings, and statistical analysis
using Welch's ANOVA, Games-Howell, and Hedges' g. Our results show that
general-purpose LLMs produced outputs of higher linguistic quality and
affectiveness, while medical LLMs demonstrate greater communication
accessibility. However, medical LLMs tend to exhibit higher levels of potential
harm, toxicity, and bias, reducing their performance in safety and
trustworthiness. Our findings indicate a duality between domain-specific
knowledge and safety in health communications. The results highlight the need
for intentional model design with targeted improvements, particularly in
mitigating harm and bias, and improving safety and affectiveness. This study
provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for cancer communication, offering
critical insights for improving AI-generated health content and informing
future development of accurate, safe, and accessible digital health tools.

Abstract: Given a classification model and a prediction for some input, there are
heuristic strategies for ranking features according to their importance in
regard to the prediction. One common approach to this task is rooted in
propositional logic and the notion of \textit{sufficient reason}. Through this
concept, the categories of relevant and necessary features were proposed in
order to identify the crucial aspects of the input. This paper improves the
existing techniques and algorithms for deciding which are the relevant and/or
necessary features, showing in particular that necessity can be detected
efficiently in complex models such as neural networks. We also generalize the
notion of relevancy and study associated problems. Moreover, we present a new
global notion (i.e. that intends to explain whether a feature is important for
the behavior of the model in general, not depending on a particular input) of
\textit{usefulness} and prove that it is related to relevancy and necessity.
Furthermore, we develop efficient algorithms for detecting it in decision trees
and other more complex models, and experiment on three datasets to analyze its
practical utility.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种动态目标识别（GR）问题，并采用无模型目标条件强化学习（RL）方法，以应对动态环境中目标不断变化的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态环境中，传统GR方法难以适应目标数量多且不断变化的情况，因此需要一种更通用的动态GR解决方案。

Method: 采用无模型目标条件强化学习（RL）方法，实现快速适应不同变化任务的目标识别。

Result: 该方法能够有效应对动态环境中的目标识别问题。

Conclusion: 提出的动态GR框架和无模型RL方法为实时GR系统和进一步研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Understanding an agent's intent through its behavior is essential in
human-robot interaction, interactive AI systems, and multi-agent
collaborations. This task, known as Goal Recognition (GR), poses significant
challenges in dynamic environments where goals are numerous and constantly
evolving. Traditional GR methods, designed for a predefined set of goals, often
struggle to adapt to these dynamic scenarios. To address this limitation, we
introduce the General Dynamic GR problem - a broader definition of GR - aimed
at enabling real-time GR systems and fostering further research in this area.
Expanding on this foundation, this paper employs a model-free goal-conditioned
RL approach to enable fast adaptation for GR across various changing tasks.

TLDR: XpertXAI是一种基于专家驱动的可解释AI模型，用于多肺部病理检测，优于现有方法，并提供更符合专家推理的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床应用中深度学习模型的决策过程不透明，限制了其广泛应用，因此需要开发可解释的AI模型。

Method: 扩展了ClinicXAI方法，使用InceptionV3分类器和公共数据集，与现有解释方法及XCBs进行比较，并通过专家验证评估解释效果。

Result: XpertXAI在预测准确性和解释性上优于基线方法，其解释更符合专家判断。

Conclusion: XpertXAI展示了可扩展的人为中心模型设计在医学诊断中的潜力，为临床可解释AI提供了路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in lung pathology detection from
chest X-rays, but widespread clinical adoption remains limited due to opaque
model decision-making. In prior work, we introduced ClinicXAI, a human-centric,
expert-guided concept bottleneck model (CBM) designed for interpretable lung
cancer diagnosis. We now extend that approach and present XpertXAI, a
generalizable expert-driven model that preserves human-interpretable clinical
concepts while scaling to detect multiple lung pathologies. Using a
high-performing InceptionV3-based classifier and a public dataset of chest
X-rays with radiology reports, we compare XpertXAI against leading post-hoc
explainability methods and an unsupervised CBM, XCBs. We assess explanations
through comparison with expert radiologist annotations and medical ground
truth. Although XpertXAI is trained for multiple pathologies, our expert
validation focuses on lung cancer. We find that existing techniques frequently
fail to produce clinically meaningful explanations, omitting key diagnostic
features and disagreeing with radiologist judgments. XpertXAI not only
outperforms these baselines in predictive accuracy but also delivers
concept-level explanations that better align with expert reasoning. While our
focus remains on explainability in lung cancer detection, this work illustrates
how human-centric model design can be effectively extended to broader
diagnostic contexts - offering a scalable path toward clinically meaningful
explainable AI in medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce diagnostic
reports from medical images, with the potential to enhance clinical workflows
and reduce radiologists' workload. While recent approaches leveraging
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) have achieved strong results, they continue to face challenges such as
factual inconsistency, hallucination, and cross-modal misalignment. We propose
a multimodal multi-agent framework for RRG that aligns with the stepwise
clinical reasoning workflow, where task-specific agents handle retrieval, draft
generation, visual analysis, refinement, and synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms a strong baseline in both automatic
metrics and LLM-based evaluations, producing more accurate, structured, and
interpretable reports. This work highlights the potential of clinically aligned
multi-agent frameworks to support explainable and trustworthy clinical AI
applications.

Abstract: Questioning has become increasingly crucial for both humans and artificial
intelligence, yet there remains limited research comprehensively assessing
question quality. In response, this study defines good questions and presents a
systematic evaluation framework. We propose two key evaluation dimensions:
appropriateness (sociolinguistic competence in context) and effectiveness
(strategic competence in goal achievement). Based on these foundational
dimensions, a rubric-based scoring system was developed. By incorporating
dynamic contextual variables, our evaluation framework achieves structure and
flexibility through semi-adaptive criteria. The methodology was validated using
the CAUS and SQUARE datasets, demonstrating the ability of the framework to
access both well-formed and problematic questions while adapting to varied
contexts. As we establish a flexible and comprehensive framework for question
evaluation, this study takes a significant step toward integrating questioning
behavior with structured analytical methods grounded in the intrinsic nature of
questioning.

Abstract: The trajectory of artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of relentless
acceleration, evolving from rudimentary rule-based systems to sophisticated,
autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and interaction. This whitepaper
chronicles this remarkable journey, charting the key technological
milestones--advancements in prompting, training methodologies, hardware
capabilities, and architectural innovations--that have converged to create the
AI agents of today. We argue that these agents, exemplified by systems like
OpenAI's ChatGPT with plugins and xAI's Grok, represent a culminating phase in
AI development, potentially constituting the "final generation" of intelligence
as we currently conceive it. We explore the capabilities and underlying
technologies of these agents, grounded in practical examples, while also
examining the profound societal implications and the unprecedented pace of
progress that suggests intelligence is now doubling approximately every six
months. The paper concludes by underscoring the critical need for wisdom and
foresight in navigating the opportunities and challenges presented by this
powerful new era of intelligence.

Motivation: 提升大型语言模型在代理系统中的性能，解决小模型在复杂推理任务中的局限性。

Result: Pre-Act在Almita数据集上比ReAct提升70%动作召回率，微调后的70B模型在动作准确率和目标完成率上分别提升69.5%和28%。

Conclusion: Pre-Act方法显著提升代理性能，尤其在小模型上表现优异，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The ReAct (Reasoning + Action) capability in large language models (LLMs) has
become the foundation of modern agentic systems. Recent LLMs, such as
DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1/o3, exemplify this by emphasizing reasoning through
the generation of ample intermediate tokens, which help build a strong premise
before producing the final output tokens. In this paper, we introduce Pre-Act,
a novel approach that enhances the agent's performance by creating a multi-step
execution plan along with the detailed reasoning for the given user input. This
plan incrementally incorporates previous steps and tool outputs, refining
itself after each step execution until the final response is obtained. Our
approach is applicable to both conversational and non-conversational agents. To
measure the performance of task-oriented agents comprehensively, we propose a
two-level evaluation framework: (1) turn level and (2) end-to-end. Our
turn-level evaluation, averaged across five models, shows that our approach,
Pre-Act, outperforms ReAct by 70% in Action Recall on the Almita dataset. While
this approach is effective for larger models, smaller models crucial for
practical applications, where latency and cost are key constraints, often
struggle with complex reasoning tasks required for agentic systems. To address
this limitation, we fine-tune relatively small models such as Llama 3.1 (8B &
70B) using the proposed Pre-Act approach. Our experiments show that the
fine-tuned 70B model outperforms GPT-4, achieving a 69.5% improvement in action
accuracy (turn-level) and a 28% improvement in goal completion rate
(end-to-end) on the Almita (out-of-domain) dataset.

Motivation: 现有抑郁检测方法主要集中在年轻人群体，忽略了其他年龄段和个体差异对抑郁表现的影响，导致检测不够全面和个性化。

Method: MPDD挑战分为两个赛道：Track 1使用MPDD-Elderly数据集检测老年人抑郁，Track 2使用MPDD-Young数据集检测年轻人抑郁。基线模型融合了音频、视频模态和个体差异信息。

Conclusion: 该挑战旨在促进更个性化和准确的抑郁检测方法的发展，推动心理健康研究并建立更具包容性的检测系统。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health issue affecting diverse age groups,
with notable prevalence among college students and the elderly. However,
existing datasets and detection methods primarily focus on young adults,
neglecting the broader age spectrum and individual differences that influence
depression manifestation. Current approaches often establish a direct mapping
between multimodal data and depression indicators, failing to capture the
complexity and diversity of depression across individuals. This challenge
includes two tracks based on age-specific subsets: Track 1 uses the
MPDD-Elderly dataset for detecting depression in older adults, and Track 2 uses
the MPDD-Young dataset for detecting depression in younger participants. The
Multimodal Personality-aware Depression Detection (MPDD) Challenge aims to
address this gap by incorporating multimodal data alongside individual
difference factors. We provide a baseline model that fuses audio and video
modalities with individual difference information to detect depression
manifestations in diverse populations. This challenge aims to promote the
development of more personalized and accurate de pression detection methods,
advancing mental health research and fostering inclusive detection systems.

Motivation: MOOCs缺乏师生互动，学习者依赖LLMs获取知识但存在幻觉问题，现有RAG系统无法主动引导学习者。

Method: 提出Graph RAG管道，结合EduKG和PKG，实现个性化问题生成和基于知识关系的问答。

Result: 在CourseMapper平台上对3门MOOCs的评估显示，Graph RAG能有效帮助学习者理解知识概念。

Conclusion: Graph RAG为MOOCs学习者提供了个性化的学习体验，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) lack direct interaction between learners
and instructors, making it challenging for learners to understand new knowledge
concepts. Recently, learners have increasingly used Large Language Models
(LLMs) to support them in acquiring new knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to
hallucinations which limits their reliability. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving relevant documents before generating a
response. However, the application of RAG across different MOOCs is limited by
unstructured learning material. Furthermore, current RAG systems do not
actively guide learners toward their learning needs. To address these
challenges, we propose a Graph RAG pipeline that leverages Educational
Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) to guide
learners to understand knowledge concepts in the MOOC platform CourseMapper.
Specifically, we implement (1) a PKG-based Question Generation method to
recommend personalized questions for learners in context, and (2) an
EduKG-based Question Answering method that leverages the relationships between
knowledge concepts in the EduKG to answer learner selected questions. To
evaluate both methods, we conducted a study with 3 expert instructors on 3
different MOOCs in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. The results of the
evaluation show the potential of Graph RAG to empower learners to understand
new knowledge concepts in a personalized learning experience.

Motivation: 台湾的中国研究领域积累了丰富的学术成果，但缺乏系统化的整理和分析工具，因此需要一种新的方法来重新组织和可视化这些知识。

Method: 使用生成式AI和大语言模型从1367篇1996-2019年的中国研究论文中提取实体关系三元组，并通过D3.js系统可视化，构建知识图谱和向量数据库。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅展示了生成式AI在区域研究和数字人文中的应用潜力，还为学术基础设施提供了数据驱动的替代方案。

Abstract: Taiwanese China Studies (CS) has developed into a rich, interdisciplinary
research field shaped by the unique geopolitical position and long standing
academic engagement with Mainland China. This study responds to the growing
need to systematically revisit and reorganize decades of Taiwan based CS
scholarship by proposing an AI assisted approach that transforms unstructured
academic texts into structured, interactive knowledge representations. We apply
generative AI (GAI) techniques and large language models (LLMs) to extract and
standardize entity relation triples from 1,367 peer reviewed CS articles
published between 1996 and 2019. These triples are then visualized through a
lightweight D3.js based system, forming the foundation of a domain specific
knowledge graph and vector database for the field. This infrastructure allows
users to explore conceptual nodes and semantic relationships across the corpus,
revealing previously uncharted intellectual trajectories, thematic clusters,
and research gaps. By decomposing textual content into graph structured
knowledge units, our system enables a paradigm shift from linear text
consumption to network based knowledge navigation. In doing so, it enhances
scholarly access to CS literature while offering a scalable, data driven
alternative to traditional ontology construction. This work not only
demonstrates how generative AI can augment area studies and digital humanities
but also highlights its potential to support a reimagined scholarly
infrastructure for regional knowledge systems.

Abstract: As the field of healthcare increasingly adopts artificial intelligence, it
becomes important to understand which types of explanations increase
transparency and empower users to develop confidence and trust in the
predictions made by machine learning (ML) systems. In shared decision-making
scenarios where doctors cooperate with ML systems to reach an appropriate
decision, establishing mutual trust is crucial. In this paper, we explore
different approaches to generating explanations in eXplainable AI (XAI) and
make their underlying arguments explicit so that they can be evaluated by
medical experts. In particular, we present the findings of a user study
conducted with physicians to investigate their perceptions of various types of
AI-generated explanations in the context of diagnostic decision support. The
study aims to identify the most effective and useful explanations that enhance
the diagnostic process. In the study, medical doctors filled out a survey to
assess different types of explanations. Further, an interview was carried out
post-survey to gain qualitative insights on the requirements of explanations
incorporated in diagnostic decision support. Overall, the insights gained from
this study contribute to understanding the types of explanations that are most
effective.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent has gained significant attention for their potential in
simulation and enhancing performance. However, existing works are limited to
pure simulations or are constrained by predefined workflows, restricting their
applicability and effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Agent
Scaling Simulation (MASS) for portfolio construction. MASS achieves stable and
continuous excess returns by progressively increasing the number of agents for
large-scale simulations to gain a superior understanding of the market and
optimizing agent distribution end-to-end through a reverse optimization
process, rather than relying on a fixed workflow. We demonstrate its
superiority through performance experiments, ablation studies, backtesting
experiments, experiments on updated data and stock pools, scaling experiments,
parameter sensitivity experiments, and visualization experiments, conducted in
comparison with 6 state-of-the-art baselines on 3 challenging A-share stock
pools. We expect the paradigm established by MASS to expand to other tasks with
similar characteristics. The implementation of MASS has been open-sourced at

Result: LLMs在常识能力上低于人类中位数，与人类相关性有限；小型开源模型表现优于大型专有模型。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁AI模型应适应不同文化背景的人类群体，以更好地反映常识的多样性。

Abstract: Commonsense intelligence in machines is often assessed by static benchmarks
that compare a model's output against human-prescribed correct labels. An
important, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately
capture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as
homogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary
enormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident
to one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel
method for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI),
specifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically
observed heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a
model's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when
treated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human
median in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as
simulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only
modestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In
both cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than
larger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties
commonsense intelligence to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call
for adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often
incompatible, social stocks of knowledge.

Motivation: 医疗人员排班问题复杂且约束多样，传统方法效果有限。SMT在形式验证领域表现优异，但在此领域的应用研究较少。

Method: 提出通用约束模型，将其转化为SMT和MILP问题，并使用Z3和Gurobi求解器进行比较实验。

Result: MILP在高度约束或不可行问题上表现更好，而SMT在多样化现实场景中更优。SMT对约束形式更敏感。

Conclusion: SMT方法在人员排班领域具有研究潜力，未来值得深入探索。

Abstract: The effects of personnel scheduling on the quality of care and working
conditions for healthcare personnel have been thoroughly documented. However,
the ever-present demand and large variation of constraints make healthcare
scheduling particularly challenging. This problem has been studied for decades,
with limited research aimed at applying Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT).
SMT has gained momentum within the formal verification community in the last
decades, leading to the advancement of SMT solvers that have been shown to
outperform standard mathematical programming techniques.
  In this work, we propose generic constraint formulations that can model a
wide range of real-world scheduling constraints. Then, the generic constraints
are formulated as SMT and MILP problems and used to compare the respective
state-of-the-art solvers, Z3 and Gurobi, on academic and real-world inspired
rostering problems. Experimental results show how each solver excels for
certain types of problems; the MILP solver generally performs better when the
problem is highly constrained or infeasible, while the SMT solver performs
better otherwise. On real-world inspired problems containing a more varied set
of shifts and personnel, the SMT solver excels. Additionally, it was noted
during experimentation that the SMT solver was more sensitive to the way the
generic constraints were formulated, requiring careful consideration and
experimentation to achieve better performance. We conclude that SMT-based
methods present a promising avenue for future research within the domain of
personnel scheduling.

Abstract: Agents are minimally entities that are influenced by their past observations
and act to influence future observations. This latter capacity is captured by
empowerment, which has served as a vital framing concept across artificial
intelligence and cognitive science. This former capacity, however, is equally
foundational: In what ways, and to what extent, can an agent be influenced by
what it observes? In this paper, we ground this concept in a universal
agent-centric measure that we refer to as plasticity, and reveal a fundamental
connection to empowerment. Following a set of desiderata on a suitable
definition, we define plasticity using a new information-theoretic quantity we
call the generalized directed information. We show that this new quantity
strictly generalizes the directed information introduced by Massey (1990) while
preserving all of its desirable properties. Our first finding is that
plasticity is the mirror of empowerment: The agent's plasticity is identical to
the empowerment of the environment, and vice versa. Our second finding
establishes a tension between the plasticity and empowerment of an agent,
suggesting that agent design needs to be mindful of both characteristics. We
explore the implications of these findings, and suggest that plasticity,
empowerment, and their relationship are essential to understanding agency.

Result: AXE能有效评估解释质量，并检测解释公平性伪装。

Conclusion: AXE为解释评估提供了独立且有效的解决方案，适用于未来研究。

Abstract: There can be many competing and contradictory explanations for a single model
prediction, making it difficult to select which one to use. Current explanation
evaluation frameworks measure quality by comparing against ideal "ground-truth"
explanations, or by verifying model sensitivity to important inputs. We outline
the limitations of these approaches, and propose three desirable principles to
ground the future development of explanation evaluation strategies for local
feature importance explanations. We propose a ground-truth Agnostic eXplanation
Evaluation framework (AXE) for evaluating and comparing model explanations that
satisfies these principles. Unlike prior approaches, AXE does not require
access to ideal ground-truth explanations for comparison, or rely on model
sensitivity - providing an independent measure of explanation quality. We
verify AXE by comparing with baselines, and show how it can be used to detect
explanation fairwashing. Our code is available at

Result: 展示了AI Agents和Agentic AI在应用领域的差异，并提出了针对挑战的解决方案。

Conclusion: 为AI Agents和Agentic AI的发展提供了明确的指导方向。

Abstract: This study critically distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI,
offering a structured conceptual taxonomy, application mapping, and challenge
analysis to clarify their divergent design philosophies and capabilities. We
begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions,
characterizing AI Agents as modular systems driven by Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Large Image Models (LIMs) for narrow, task-specific automation.
Generative AI is positioned as a precursor, with AI Agents advancing through
tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. In contrast,
Agentic AI systems represent a paradigmatic shift marked by multi-agent
collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and orchestrated
autonomy. Through a sequential evaluation of architectural evolution,
operational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a
comparative analysis across both paradigms. Application domains such as
customer support, scheduling, and data summarization are contrasted with
Agentic AI deployments in research automation, robotic coordination, and
medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in each paradigm
including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination
failure and propose targeted solutions such as ReAct loops, RAG, orchestration
layers, and causal modeling. This work aims to provide a definitive roadmap for
developing robust, scalable, and explainable AI agent and Agentic AI-driven
systems. >AI Agents, Agent-driven, Vision-Language-Models, Agentic AI Decision

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 研究评估了大型语言模型在动态环境中的自适应能力，发现战略提示可以缩小模型间的性能差距，但高级推理方法效果不稳定，且当前模型在规划、推理和空间协调等方面仍有局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为自学习和推理代理在动态环境中的潜力，评估其自适应能力。

Method: 通过自我反思、启发式突变和规划等提示技术，在动态环境中测试不同开源语言模型的性能。

Result: 大模型通常优于小模型，但战略提示能缩小差距；高级提示技术对小模型更有效，但推理方法效果不稳定；模型在规划、推理和空间协调方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在动态环境中的推理能力有限，需超越静态基准以全面评估其能力。

Abstract: While large language models demonstrate impressive performance on static
benchmarks, the true potential of large language models as self-learning and
reasoning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. This study
systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation,
and planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of
agents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in
dynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller
ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a
too-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks,
while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting
techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less
improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find
that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable
of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making
align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops.
Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true
emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits
persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and
spatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models
still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through
self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while
reasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math
word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important
shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move
beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.

Conclusion: 该框架为左心房血流动力学研究提供了可靠工具，并展示了血流动力学参数作为预后生物标志物的潜力。

Abstract: The left atrium (LA) plays a pivotal role in modulating left ventricular
filling, but our comprehension of its hemodynamics is significantly limited by
the constraints of conventional ultrasound analysis. 4D flow magnetic resonance
imaging (4D Flow MRI) holds promise for enhancing our understanding of atrial
hemodynamics. However, the low velocities within the LA and the limited spatial
resolution of 4D Flow MRI make analyzing this chamber challenging. Furthermore,
the absence of dedicated computational frameworks, combined with diverse
acquisition protocols and vendors, complicates gathering large cohorts for
studying the prognostic value of hemodynamic parameters provided by 4D Flow
MRI. In this study, we introduce the first open-source computational framework
tailored for the analysis of 4D Flow MRI in the LA, enabling comprehensive
qualitative and quantitative analysis of advanced hemodynamic parameters. Our
framework proves robust to data from different centers of varying quality,
producing high-accuracy automated segmentations (Dice $>$ 0.9 and Hausdorff 95
$<$ 3 mm), even with limited training data. Additionally, we conducted the
first comprehensive assessment of energy, vorticity, and pressure parameters in
the LA across a spectrum of disorders to investigate their potential as
prognostic biomarkers.

Result: 在短序列基准上表现优异，长序列生成显著优于Transformer方法，并提出了新的长序列评估基准。

Conclusion: SSM架构为长时双人运动生成提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating realistic dyadic human motion from text descriptions presents
significant challenges, particularly for extended interactions that exceed
typical training sequence lengths. While recent transformer-based approaches
have shown promising results for short-term dyadic motion synthesis, they
struggle with longer sequences due to inherent limitations in positional
encoding schemes. In this paper, we introduce Dyadic Mamba, a novel approach
that leverages State-Space Models (SSMs) to generate high-quality dyadic human
motion of arbitrary length. Our method employs a simple yet effective
architecture that facilitates information flow between individual motion
sequences through concatenation, eliminating the need for complex
cross-attention mechanisms. We demonstrate that Dyadic Mamba achieves
competitive performance on standard short-term benchmarks while significantly
outperforming transformer-based approaches on longer sequences. Additionally,
we propose a new benchmark for evaluating long-term motion synthesis quality,
providing a standardized framework for future research. Our results demonstrate
that SSM-based architectures offer a promising direction for addressing the
challenging task of long-term dyadic human motion synthesis from text
descriptions.

Result: 在低数据情况下表现优异，性能媲美或超越依赖未标注数据的半监督方法。

Conclusion: BoundarySeg提供了一种高效且计算成本低的分割解决方案，无需未标注数据。

Abstract: Obtaining large-scale medical data, annotated or unannotated, is challenging
due to stringent privacy regulations and data protection policies. In addition,
annotating medical images requires that domain experts manually delineate
anatomical structures, making the process both time-consuming and costly. As a
result, semi-supervised methods have gained popularity for reducing annotation
costs. However, the performance of semi-supervised methods is heavily dependent
on the availability of unannotated data, and their effectiveness declines when
such data are scarce or absent. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
simple, yet effective and computationally efficient approach for medical image
segmentation that leverages only existing annotations. We propose BoundarySeg ,
a multi-task framework that incorporates organ boundary prediction as an
auxiliary task to full organ segmentation, leveraging consistency between the
two task predictions to provide additional supervision. This strategy improves
segmentation accuracy, especially in low data regimes, allowing our method to
achieve performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art semi supervised
approaches all without relying on unannotated data or increasing computational
demands. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Computer-assisted interventions can improve intra-operative guidance,
particularly through deep learning methods that harness the spatiotemporal
information in surgical videos. However, the severe data imbalance often found
in surgical video datasets hinders the development of high-performing models.
In this work, we aim to overcome the data imbalance by synthesizing surgical
videos. We propose a unique two-stage, text-conditioned diffusion-based method
to generate high-fidelity surgical videos for under-represented classes. Our
approach conditions the generation process on text prompts and decouples
spatial and temporal modeling by utilizing a 2D latent diffusion model to
capture spatial content and then integrating temporal attention layers to
ensure temporal consistency. Furthermore, we introduce a rejection sampling
strategy to select the most suitable synthetic samples, effectively augmenting
existing datasets to address class imbalance. We evaluate our method on two
downstream tasks-surgical action recognition and intra-operative event
prediction-demonstrating that incorporating synthetic videos from our approach
substantially enhances model performance. We open-source our implementation at

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI)的原型模型，通过深度学习对少量结构化示例进行类比映射，形成组合概念（模式）。PSI在人类类似的学习表现上优于传统模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类如何从有限示例中快速学习视觉概念，强调结构化表示和类比映射的重要性。

Method: 提出PSI模型，结合深度学习和结构化表示，通过权衡对象级相似性和关系相似性，并放大分类相关关系。

Result: PSI在人类类似学习表现上优于传统非结构化特征向量模型和弱结构化表示变体。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和类比映射是模拟人类快速学习组合视觉概念的关键，深度学习可用于构建心理学模型。

Abstract: The ability to learn new visual concepts from limited examples is a hallmark
of human cognition. While traditional category learning models represent each
example as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is
thought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed
graphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of
shared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,
we introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that
employs deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured
representations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept
called a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity
that weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a
mechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to
selective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces
human-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model
that uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,
and a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find
that PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that
increases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the
contribution of relations that distinguish classes. These findings suggest that
structured representations and analogical mapping are critical to modeling
rapid human-like learning of compositional visual concepts, and demonstrate how
deep learning can be leveraged to create psychological models.

Motivation: 现有NeRF和3DGS方法依赖RGBD传感器且仅适用于室内环境，大规模户外场景的鲁棒性重建尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用多模态策略估计初始位姿，引入特征对齐扭曲约束优化跟踪，使用连续高斯泼溅子图处理大规模场景，并通过位姿优化和结构细化模块提升重建质量。

Result: 在EuRoc和KITTI数据集上表现优于现有神经、3DGS及传统方法。

Conclusion: LSG-SLAM为大规模户外场景提供了一种高效且鲁棒的视觉SLAM解决方案。

Abstract: The recently developed Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have shown encouraging and impressive results for visual SLAM.
However, most representative methods require RGBD sensors and are only
available for indoor environments. The robustness of reconstruction in
large-scale outdoor scenarios remains unexplored. This paper introduces a
large-scale 3DGS-based visual SLAM with stereo cameras, termed LSG-SLAM. The
proposed LSG-SLAM employs a multi-modality strategy to estimate prior poses
under large view changes. In tracking, we introduce feature-alignment warping
constraints to alleviate the adverse effects of appearance similarity in
rendering losses. For the scalability of large-scale scenarios, we introduce
continuous Gaussian Splatting submaps to tackle unbounded scenes with limited
memory. Loops are detected between GS submaps by place recognition and the
relative pose between looped keyframes is optimized utilizing rendering and
feature warping losses. After the global optimization of camera poses and
Gaussian points, a structure refinement module enhances the reconstruction
quality. With extensive evaluations on the EuRoc and KITTI datasets, LSG-SLAM
achieves superior performance over existing Neural, 3DGS-based, and even
traditional approaches. Project page: https://lsg-slam.github.io.

Result: 在12个工业和医学领域的异常检测基准测试中，AdaptCLIP表现最优。

Conclusion: AdaptCLIP提供了一种简单有效的跨域视觉异常检测解决方案，无需目标域微调。

Abstract: Universal visual anomaly detection aims to identify anomalies from novel or
unseen vision domains without additional fine-tuning, which is critical in open
scenarios. Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained vision-language
models like CLIP exhibit strong generalization with just zero or a few normal
images. However, existing methods struggle with designing prompt templates,
complex token interactions, or requiring additional fine-tuning, resulting in
limited flexibility. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method
called AdaptCLIP based on two key insights. First, adaptive visual and textual
representations should be learned alternately rather than jointly. Second,
comparative learning between query and normal image prompt should incorporate
both contextual and aligned residual features, rather than relying solely on
residual features. AdaptCLIP treats CLIP models as a foundational service,
adding only three simple adapters, visual adapter, textual adapter, and
prompt-query adapter, at its input or output ends. AdaptCLIP supports
zero-/few-shot generalization across domains and possesses a training-free
manner on target domains once trained on a base dataset. AdaptCLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 12 anomaly detection benchmarks from industrial
and medical domains, significantly outperforming existing competitive methods.
We will make the code and model of AdaptCLIP available at

Result: 在跨模态腹部和心脏分割任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了SFDA中的关键挑战，提升了模型性能和适应性。

Abstract: Domain adaptation addresses the challenge of model performance degradation
caused by domain gaps. In the typical setup for unsupervised domain adaptation,
labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a target domain are
used to train a target model. However, access to labeled source domain data,
particularly in medical datasets, can be restricted due to privacy policies. As
a result, research has increasingly shifted to source-free domain adaptation
(SFDA), which requires only a pretrained model from the source domain and
unlabeled data from the target domain data for adaptation. Existing SFDA
methods often rely on domain-specific image style translation and
self-supervision techniques to bridge the domain gap and train the target
domain model. However, the quality of domain-specific style-translated images
and pseudo-labels produced by these methods still leaves room for improvement.
Moreover, training the entire model during adaptation can be inefficient under
limited supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel SFDA framework to
address these challenges. Specifically, to effectively mitigate the impact of
domain gap in the initial training phase, we introduce preadaptation to
generate a preadapted model, which serves as an initialization of target model
and allows for the generation of high-quality enhanced pseudo-labels without
introducing extra parameters. Additionally, we propose a data-dependent
frequency prompt to more effectively translate target domain images into a
source-like style. To further enhance adaptation, we employ a style-related
layer fine-tuning strategy, specifically designed for SFDA, to train the target
model using the prompted target domain images and pseudo-labels. Extensive
experiments on cross-modality abdominal and cardiac SFDA segmentation tasks
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting human behavior in-thewild, particularly at urban
intersections, remains crucial for enhancing interaction safety between road
users. Among the most critical behaviors are crossing intentions of Vulnerable
Road Users (VRUs), where misinterpretation may result in dangerous conflicts
with oncoming vehicles. In this work, we propose the VRU-CIPI framework with a
sequential attention-based model designed to predict VRU crossing intentions at
intersections. VRU-CIPI employs Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture temporal
dynamics in VRU movements, combined with a multi-head Transformer
self-attention mechanism to encode contextual and spatial dependencies critical
for predicting crossing direction. Evaluated on UCF-VRU dataset, our proposed
achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 96.45% and achieving
real-time inference speed reaching 33 frames per second. Furthermore, by
integrating with Infrastructure-to-Vehicles (I2V) communication, our approach
can proactively enhance intersection safety through timely activation of
crossing signals and providing early warnings to connected vehicles, ensuring
smoother and safer interactions for all road users.

Conclusion: CSPENet通过模块化设计显著提升了红外小目标检测性能。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a critical role in a wide range
of civilian and military applications. Existing methods suffer from
deficiencies in the localization of dim targets and the perception of contour
information under dense clutter environments, severely limiting their detection
performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a contour-aware and saliency
priors embedding network (CSPENet) for ISTD. We first design a
surround-convergent prior extraction module (SCPEM) that effectively captures
the intrinsic characteristic of target contour pixel gradients converging
toward their center. This module concurrently extracts two collaborative
priors: a boosted saliency prior for accurate target localization and
multi-scale structural priors for comprehensively enriching contour detail
representation. Building upon this, we propose a dual-branch priors embedding
architecture (DBPEA) that establishes differentiated feature fusion pathways,
embedding these two priors at optimal network positions to achieve performance
enhancement. Finally, we develop an attention-guided feature enhancement module
(AGFEM) to refine feature representations and improve saliency estimation
accuracy. Experimental results on public datasets NUDT-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and
NUAA-SIRST demonstrate that our CSPENet outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods in detection performance. The code is available at

Method: 提出TKDF概念，设计TAFE（基于ResNet的多分支注意力）和DCIF（自适应池化和注意力机制）来捕捉和优化纹理特征。

Result: 在RAF-DB和KDEF数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: TKDF的引入显著提升了FER的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in the wild remains a challenging task
due to the subtle and localized nature of expression-related features, as well
as the complex variations in facial appearance. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework that explicitly focuses on Texture Key Driver Factors (TKDF),
localized texture regions that exhibit strong discriminative power across
emotional categories. By carefully observing facial image patterns, we identify
that certain texture cues, such as micro-changes in skin around the brows,
eyes, and mouth, serve as primary indicators of emotional dynamics. To
effectively capture and leverage these cues, we propose a FER architecture
comprising a Texture-Aware Feature Extractor (TAFE) and Dual Contextual
Information Filtering (DCIF). TAFE employs a ResNet-based backbone enhanced
with multi-branch attention to extract fine-grained texture representations,
while DCIF refines these features by filtering context through adaptive pooling
and attention mechanisms. Experimental results on RAF-DB and KDEF datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, verifying
the effectiveness and robustness of incorporating TKDFs into FER pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: APCoTTA是一种针对ALS点云语义分割的连续测试时间适应方法，通过动态选择可训练层、熵一致性损失和随机参数插值机制，解决了领域偏移和灾难性遗忘问题，并在两个新基准上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ALS点云分割中因环境、传感器变化导致的模型性能下降问题，填补CTTA在该领域的研究空白。

Method: 提出动态可训练层选择模块、熵一致性损失和随机参数插值机制，平衡目标适应与源知识保留。

Result: 在ISPRSC和H3DC基准上，mIoU分别提升约9%和14%。

Conclusion: APCoTTA有效解决了ALS点云分割中的CTTA挑战，并提供了新基准和代码。

Abstract: Airborne laser scanning (ALS) point cloud segmentation is a fundamental task
for large-scale 3D scene understanding. In real-world applications, models are
typically fixed after training. However, domain shifts caused by changes in the
environment, sensor types, or sensor degradation often lead to a decline in
model performance. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by
adapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains.
Despite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing
challenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of
catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To
tackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for
ALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer
selection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select
low-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen,
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we
propose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on
entropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing
model stability. In addition, we propose a random parameter interpolation
mechanism, which randomly blends parameters from the selected trainable layers
with those of the source model. This approach helps balance target adaptation
and source knowledge retention, further alleviating forgetting. Finally, we
construct two benchmarks, ISPRSC and H3DC, to address the lack of CTTA
benchmarks for ALS point cloud segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate
that APCoTTA achieves the best performance on two benchmarks, with mIoU
improvements of approximately 9% and 14% over direct inference. The new
benchmarks and code are available at https://github.com/Gaoyuan2/APCoTTA.

TLDR: HQUIC是一种新型水下图像压缩算法，通过利用水下图像特有特征提升压缩效率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水下图像压缩算法未能充分利用水下场景的独特性，导致性能不佳。

Method: HQUIC采用ALTC模块预测衰减系数和全局光信息，利用辅助分支提取常见对象，并动态加权多尺度频率成分。

Result: 在多种水下数据集上的评估表明，HQUIC优于现有压缩方法。

Conclusion: HQUIC通过针对性设计显著提升了水下图像压缩性能。

Abstract: With the increasing exploration and exploitation of the underwater world,
underwater images have become a critical medium for human interaction with
marine environments, driving extensive research into their efficient
transmission and storage. However, contemporary underwater image compression
algorithms fail to fully leverage the unique characteristics distinguishing
underwater scenes from terrestrial images, resulting in suboptimal performance.
To address this limitation, we introduce HQUIC, designed to exploit
underwater-image-specific features for enhanced compression efficiency. HQUIC
employs an ALTC module to adaptively predict the attenuation coefficients and
global light information of the images, which effectively mitigates the issues
caused by the differences in lighting and tone existing in underwater images.
Subsequently, HQUIC employs a codebook as an auxiliary branch to extract the
common objects within underwater images and enhances the performance of the
main branch. Furthermore, HQUIC dynamically weights multi-scale frequency
components, prioritizing information critical for distortion quality while
discarding redundant details. Extensive evaluations on diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate that HQUIC outperforms state-of-the-art compression
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅关注对象定位任务，缺乏对多模态指向能力的全面评估。

Method: 提出PointArena平台，包含三个组件：Point-Bench数据集、Point-Battle交互竞技场和Point-Act机器人系统，用于多场景评估。

Result: Molmo-72B表现最优，监督训练显著提升性能，且多阶段评估显示强相关性。

Conclusion: 精确指向能力对多模态模型连接抽象推理与具体行动至关重要。

Abstract: Pointing serves as a fundamental and intuitive mechanism for grounding
language within visual contexts, with applications spanning robotics, assistive
technologies, and interactive AI systems. While recent multimodal models have
started to support pointing capabilities, existing benchmarks typically focus
only on referential object localization tasks. We introduce PointArena, a
comprehensive platform for evaluating multimodal pointing across diverse
reasoning scenarios. PointArena comprises three components: (1) Point-Bench, a
curated dataset containing approximately 1,000 pointing tasks across five
reasoning categories; (2) Point-Battle, an interactive, web-based arena
facilitating blind, pairwise model comparisons, which has already gathered over
4,500 anonymized votes; and (3) Point-Act, a real-world robotic manipulation
system allowing users to directly evaluate multimodal model pointing
capabilities in practical settings. We conducted extensive evaluations of both
state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary multimodal models. Results
indicate that Molmo-72B consistently outperforms other models, though
proprietary models increasingly demonstrate comparable performance.
Additionally, we find that supervised training specifically targeting pointing
tasks significantly enhances model performance. Across our multi-stage
evaluation pipeline, we also observe strong correlations, underscoring the
critical role of precise pointing capabilities in enabling multimodal models to
effectively bridge abstract reasoning with concrete, real-world actions.

*Jinhyun Jang,Jiyeong Lee,Kwanghoon Sohn*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种描述性图像-文本匹配方法（DITM），通过探索语言的描述灵活性学习图像与文本之间的分级上下文相似性，解决了现有方法中稀疏二元监督的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用稀疏二元监督，仅表示图像与句子是否匹配，忽略了它们之间固有的多对多关系以及从一般到具体的描述连接。

Method: DITM通过计算句子的描述性分数（基于TF-IDF）动态调整正负样本对的连接，并按照从通用到具体的顺序对齐相关句子。

Result: 在MS-COCO、Flickr30K和CxC数据集上的实验表明，DITM能更有效地表示复杂的图像-文本关系，并在HierarCaps基准测试中增强了模型的层次推理能力。

Conclusion: DITM通过超越刚性二元监督，提升了模型在发现最优匹配和潜在正样本对方面的能力。

Abstract: Image-text matching aims to build correspondences between visual and textual
data by learning their pairwise similarities. Most existing approaches have
adopted sparse binary supervision, indicating whether a pair of images and
sentences matches or not. However, such sparse supervision covers a limited
subset of image-text relationships, neglecting their inherent many-to-many
correspondences; an image can be described in numerous texts at different
descriptive levels. Moreover, existing approaches overlook the implicit
connections from general to specific descriptions, which form the underlying
rationale for the many-to-many relationships between vision and language. In
this work, we propose descriptive image-text matching, called DITM, to learn
the graded contextual similarity between image and text by exploring the
descriptive flexibility of language. We formulate the descriptiveness score of
each sentence with cumulative term frequency-inverse document frequency
(TF-IDF) to balance the pairwise similarity according to the keywords in the
sentence. Our method leverages sentence descriptiveness to learn robust
image-text matching in two key ways: (1) to refine the false negative labeling,
dynamically relaxing the connectivity between positive and negative pairs, and
(2) to build more precise matching, aligning a set of relevant sentences in a
generic-to-specific order. By moving beyond rigid binary supervision, DITM
enhances the discovery of both optimal matches and potential positive pairs.
Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, and CxC datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in representing complex image-text relationships
compared to state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, DITM enhances the
hierarchical reasoning ability of the model, supported by the extensive
analysis on HierarCaps benchmark.

Abstract: In the era of immersive consumer electronics, such as AR/VR headsets and
smart devices, people increasingly seek ways to express their identity through
virtual fashion. However, existing 3D garment design tools remain inaccessible
to everyday users due to steep technical barriers and limited data. In this
work, we introduce a 3D sketch-driven 3D garment generation framework that
empowers ordinary users - even those without design experience - to create
high-quality digital clothing through simple 3D sketches in AR/VR environments.
By combining a conditional diffusion model, a sketch encoder trained in a
shared latent space, and an adaptive curriculum learning strategy, our system
interprets imprecise, free-hand input and produces realistic, personalized
garments. To address the scarcity of training data, we also introduce
KO3DClothes, a new dataset of paired 3D garments and user-created sketches.
Extensive experiments and user studies confirm that our method significantly
outperforms existing baselines in both fidelity and usability, demonstrating
its promise for democratized fashion design on next-generation consumer
platforms.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology is progressively transforming traditional car
driving methods, marking a significant milestone in modern transportation.
Object detection serves as a cornerstone of autonomous systems, playing a vital
role in enhancing driving safety, enabling autonomous functionality, improving
traffic efficiency, and facilitating effective emergency responses. However,
current technologies such as radar for environmental perception, cameras for
road perception, and vehicle sensor networks face notable challenges, including
high costs, vulnerability to weather and lighting conditions, and limited

autonomous target detection network based on YOLOv8. By integrating structural
reparameterization technology, a bidirectional pyramid structure network model,
and a novel detection pipeline into the YOLOv8 framework, the proposed approach
achieves highly efficient and precise detection of multi-scale, small, and
remote objects. Experimental results demonstrate that the enhanced model can
effectively detect both large and small objects with a detection accuracy of
65%, showcasing significant advancements over traditional methods.This improved
model holds substantial potential for real-world applications and is
well-suited for autonomous driving competitions, such as the Formula Student
Autonomous China (FSAC), particularly excelling in scenarios involving
single-target and small-object detection.

Motivation: 现有一次性学习方法在单领域表现良好，但在多领域无标签数据中受领域偏好影响大，且对次优标注图像不鲁棒。

Method: UOD包含两阶段：第一阶段自监督学习生成伪标签，第二阶段通过领域自适应Transformer消除领域偏好并构建全局上下文。

Result: 在三个X-ray数据集（头、手、胸）上取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: UOD通过领域共享模块聚合多领域一次性样本，实现更鲁棒和准确的标志检测。

Abstract: One-shot medical landmark detection gains much attention and achieves great
success for its label-efficient training process. However, existing one-shot
learning methods are highly specialized in a single domain and suffer domain
preference heavily in the situation of multi-domain unlabeled data. Moreover,
one-shot learning is not robust that it faces performance drop when annotating
a sub-optimal image. To tackle these issues, we resort to developing a
domain-adaptive one-shot landmark detection framework for handling multi-domain
medical images, named Universal One-shot Detection (UOD). UOD consists of two
stages and two corresponding universal models which are designed as
combinations of domain-specific modules and domain-shared modules. In the first
stage, a domain-adaptive convolution model is self-supervised learned to
generate pseudo landmark labels. In the second stage, we design a
domain-adaptive transformer to eliminate domain preference and build the global
context for multi-domain data. Even though only one annotated sample from each
domain is available for training, the domain-shared modules help UOD aggregate
all one-shot samples to detect more robust and accurate landmarks. We
investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively the proposed UOD on three
widely-used public X-ray datasets in different anatomical domains (i.e., head,
hand, chest) and obtained state-of-the-art performances in each domain. The
code is available at

Abstract: This paper does not describe a new method; instead, it provides a thorough
exploration of an important yet understudied design space related to recent
advances in text-to-image synthesis -- specifically, the deep fusion of large
language models (LLMs) and diffusion transformers (DiTs) for multi-modal
generation. Previous studies mainly focused on overall system performance
rather than detailed comparisons with alternative methods, and key design
details and training recipes were often left undisclosed. These gaps create
uncertainty about the real potential of this approach. To fill these gaps, we
conduct an empirical study on text-to-image generation, performing controlled

providing a clear, reproducible recipe for training at scale. We hope this work
offers meaningful data points and practical guidelines for future research in
multi-modal generation.

Abstract: Dynamic scene representation and reconstruction have undergone transformative
advances in recent years, catalyzed by breakthroughs in neural radiance fields
and 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. While initially developed for static
environments, these methodologies have rapidly evolved to address the
complexities inherent in 4D dynamic scenes through an expansive body of
research. Coupled with innovations in differentiable volumetric rendering,
these approaches have significantly enhanced the quality of motion
representation and dynamic scene reconstruction, thereby garnering substantial
attention from the computer vision and graphics communities. This survey
presents a systematic analysis of over 200 papers focused on dynamic scene
representation using radiance field, spanning the spectrum from implicit neural
representations to explicit Gaussian primitives. We categorize and evaluate
these works through multiple critical lenses: motion representation paradigms,
reconstruction techniques for varied scene dynamics, auxiliary information
integration strategies, and regularization approaches that ensure temporal
consistency and physical plausibility. We organize diverse methodological
approaches under a unified representational framework, concluding with a
critical examination of persistent challenges and promising research
directions. By providing this comprehensive overview, we aim to establish a
definitive reference for researchers entering this rapidly evolving field while
offering experienced practitioners a systematic understanding of both
conceptual principles and practical frontiers in dynamic scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: 本研究为普什图语OCR任务提供了LMMs的能力和局限性评估，并为类似脚本的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the low-resource Pashto language.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Pashto faces several challenges due to the
cursive nature of its script and a scarcity of structured datasets. To address
this, we developed a synthetic Pashto OCR dataset, PsOCR, consisting of one
million images annotated with bounding boxes at word, line, and document
levels, suitable for training and evaluating models based on different
architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers.
PsOCR covers variations across 1,000 unique font families, colors, image sizes,
and layouts. A benchmark subset of 10K images was selected to evaluate the
performance of several LMMs, including seven open-source models: DeepSeek's
Janus, InternVL, MiniCPM, Florence, and Qwen (3B and 7B), and four
closed-source models: GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, and Grok. Experimental results
demonstrate that Gemini achieves the best performance among all models, whereas
among open-source models, Qwen-7B stands out. This work provides an insightful
assessment of the capabilities and limitations of current LMMs for OCR tasks in
Pashto and establishes a foundation for further research not only in Pashto OCR
but also for other similar scripts such as Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. PsOCR is

Result: 在Arcane和Pixar两种风格上验证了ToonifyGB的高效性和高质量动画生成能力。

Conclusion: ToonifyGB能够高效渲染具有任意表情的风格化虚拟形象。

Abstract: The introduction of 3D Gaussian blendshapes has enabled the real-time
reconstruction of animatable head avatars from monocular video. Toonify, a
StyleGAN-based framework, has become widely used for facial image stylization.
To extend Toonify for synthesizing diverse stylized 3D head avatars using
Gaussian blendshapes, we propose an efficient two-stage framework, ToonifyGB.
In Stage 1 (stylized video generation), we employ an improved StyleGAN to
generate the stylized video from the input video frames, which addresses the
limitation of cropping aligned faces at a fixed resolution as preprocessing for
normal StyleGAN. This process provides a more stable video, which enables
Gaussian blendshapes to better capture the high-frequency details of the video
frames, and efficiently generate high-quality animation in the next stage. In
Stage 2 (Gaussian blendshapes synthesis), we learn a stylized neutral head
model and a set of expression blendshapes from the generated video. By
combining the neutral head model with expression blendshapes, ToonifyGB can
efficiently render stylized avatars with arbitrary expressions. We validate the
effectiveness of ToonifyGB on the benchmark dataset using two styles: Arcane
and Pixar.

Result: 在15个数据集上，MMRL和MMRL++均优于现有方法，实现了任务适应与泛化的平衡。

Conclusion: MMRL和MMRL++通过优化表示空间和交互机制，显著提升了少样本学习下的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly
advanced transfer learning across diverse tasks. However, adapting these models
with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, undermining their
ability to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Modal
Representation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable,
modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected
into both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more
effective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize
class token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder
layers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving
general knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and
representation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is
applied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection
layer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To
further promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning
class and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference,
a decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base
tasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger
generalization. Building upon this, we propose MMRL++, a parameter-efficient
and interaction-aware extension that significantly reduces trainable parameters
and enhances intra-modal interactions--particularly across the layers of
representation tokens--allowing gradient sharing and instance-specific
information to propagate more effectively through the network. Extensive
experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL and MMRL++ consistently
outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving a strong balance between
task-specific adaptation and generalization.

*Yangfu Li,Hongjian Zhan,Tianyi Chen,Qi Liu,Yue Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种动态平衡视觉令牌修剪目标的方法MoB，通过理论分析和实验验证其高效性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉令牌修剪方法采用静态策略，忽视了任务间目标重要性的变化，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 基于Hausdorff距离推导误差界，利用ε-覆盖理论揭示目标间的权衡，提出MoB框架，将修剪问题转化为双目标覆盖问题。

Result: MoB在LLaVA-1.5-7B上仅使用11.1%的视觉令牌保留96.4%性能，加速LLaVA-Next-7B 1.3-1.5倍，且适用于多种任务和模型。

Conclusion: MoB通过动态平衡目标和线性扩展性，显著提升了视觉令牌修剪的性能和效率。

Abstract: Existing visual token pruning methods target prompt alignment and visual
preservation with static strategies, overlooking the varying relative
importance of these objectives across tasks, which leads to inconsistent
performance. To address this, we derive the first closed-form error bound for
visual token pruning based on the Hausdorff distance, uniformly characterizing
the contributions of both objectives. Moreover, leveraging $\epsilon$-covering
theory, we reveal an intrinsic trade-off between these objectives and quantify
their optimal attainment levels under a fixed budget. To practically handle
this trade-off, we propose Multi-Objective Balanced Covering (MoB), which
reformulates visual token pruning as a bi-objective covering problem. In this
framework, the attainment trade-off reduces to budget allocation via greedy
radius trading. MoB offers a provable performance bound and linear scalability
with respect to the number of input visual tokens, enabling adaptation to
challenging pruning scenarios. Extensive experiments show that MoB preserves
96.4% of performance for LLaVA-1.5-7B using only 11.1% of the original visual
tokens and accelerates LLaVA-Next-7B by 1.3-1.5$\times$ with negligible
performance loss. Additionally, evaluations on Qwen2-VL and Video-LLaVA confirm
that MoB integrates seamlessly into advanced MLLMs and diverse vision-language
tasks.

TLDR: 提出了一种新的图像配准方法，通过条件U-Net架构估计未知条件下的图像，应用于放疗中移动肿瘤的4D-CT扫描，解决了传统方法的重建伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在放疗中处理4D-CT扫描时，由于呼吸不规则性和内部运动相关性差，会产生重建伪影，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 使用条件U-Net架构，无需固定图像，完全利用条件信息，实现图像配准。

Result: 在临床4D-CT数据上实现了无伪影的实时重建。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统图像配准中的伪影问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a novel image registration formalism dedicated to
the estimation of unknown condition-related images, based on two or more known
images and their associated conditions. We show how to practically model this
formalism by using a new conditional U-Net architecture, which fully takes into
account the conditional information and does not need any fixed image. Our
formalism is then applied to image moving tumors for radiotherapy treatment at
different breathing amplitude using 4D-CT (3D+t) scans in thoracoabdominal
regions. This driving application is particularly complex as it requires to
stitch a collection of sequential 2D slices into several 3D volumes at
different organ positions. Movement interpolation with standard methods then
generates well known reconstruction artefacts in the assembled volumes due to
irregular patient breathing, hysteresis and poor correlation of breathing
signal to internal motion. Results obtained on 4D-CT clinical data showcase
artefact-free volumes achieved through real-time latencies. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/Kheil-Z/IMITATE .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风格增强方法在数据分散场景下风格空间有限，无法有效泛化到未见目标域。

Method: 提出多源协作风格增强模块扩展风格空间，并通过跨域特征对齐和类间关系蒸馏学习域不变模型。

Result: 在多个域泛化数据集上显著优于现有联邦域泛化方法。

Conclusion: MCSAD通过交替进行风格增强和域不变学习，有效提升了模型在未见目标域上的泛化性能。

Abstract: Federated domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model from
multiple decentralized source domains for deploying on the unseen target
domain. The style augmentation methods have achieved great progress on domain
generalization. However, the existing style augmentation methods either explore
the data styles within isolated source domain or interpolate the style
information across existing source domains under the data decentralization
scenario, which leads to limited style space. To address this issue, we propose
a Multi-source Collaborative Style Augmentation and Domain-invariant learning
method (MCSAD) for federated domain generalization. Specifically, we propose a
multi-source collaborative style augmentation module to generate data in the
broader style space. Furthermore, we conduct domain-invariant learning between
the original data and augmented data by cross-domain feature alignment within
the same class and classes relation ensemble distillation between different
classes to learn a domain-invariant model. By alternatively conducting
collaborative style augmentation and domain-invariant learning, the model can
generalize well on unseen target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple
domain generalization datasets indicate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art federated domain generalization methods.

TLDR: 论文提出一种新架构，通过少量数据集特定参数解决跨数据集显著性预测的泛化问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著性预测模型在不同数据集间泛化能力差，性能下降显著，需解决数据集偏差问题。

Method: 扩展编码器-解码器结构，引入少于20个数据集特定参数，控制多尺度结构、中心偏差和注视点扩散等可解释机制。

Result: 模型在MIT/Tuebingen显著性基准测试中达到新SOTA，泛化性能提升75%以上，仅需50样本即可显著改进。

Conclusion: 新架构有效解决跨数据集泛化问题，同时揭示了空间显著性的复杂多尺度效应。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-based saliency prediction are approaching gold
standard performance levels on existing benchmarks. Despite this success, we
show that predicting fixations across multiple saliency datasets remains
challenging due to dataset bias. We find a significant performance drop (around
40%) when models trained on one dataset are applied to another. Surprisingly,
increasing dataset diversity does not resolve this inter-dataset gap, with
close to 60% attributed to dataset-specific biases. To address this remaining
generalization gap, we propose a novel architecture extending a mostly
dataset-agnostic encoder-decoder structure with fewer than 20 dataset-specific
parameters that govern interpretable mechanisms such as multi-scale structure,
center bias, and fixation spread. Adapting only these parameters to new data
accounts for more than 75% of the generalization gap, with a large fraction of
the improvement achieved with as few as 50 samples. Our model sets a new
state-of-the-art on all three datasets of the MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark
(MIT300, CAT2000, and COCO-Freeview), even when purely generalizing from
unrelated datasets, but with a substantial boost when adapting to the
respective training datasets. The model also provides valuable insights into
spatial saliency properties, revealing complex multi-scale effects that combine
both absolute and relative sizes.

Abstract: Location Intelligence (LI), the science of transforming location-centric
geospatial data into actionable knowledge, has become a cornerstone of modern
spatial decision-making. The rapid evolution of Geospatial Representation
Learning is fundamentally reshaping LI development through two successive
technological revolutions: the deep learning breakthrough and the emerging
large language model (LLM) paradigm. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have
demonstrated remarkable success in automated feature extraction from structured
geospatial data (e.g., satellite imagery, GPS trajectories), the recent
integration of LLMs introduces transformative capabilities for cross-modal
geospatial reasoning and unstructured geo-textual data processing. This survey
presents a comprehensive review of geospatial representation learning across
both technological eras, organizing them into a structured taxonomy based on
the complete pipeline comprising: (1) data perspective, (2) methodological
perspective and (3) application perspective. We also highlight current
advancements, discuss existing limitations, and propose potential future
research directions in the LLM era. This work offers a thorough exploration of
the field and providing a roadmap for further innovation in LI. The summary of

Method: 利用移动设备拍摄图像和相机位置，通过3D重建和食物视频分割生成食物掩模，实现无参考和无深度的体积估计。

Result: 实验显示VolE在多个数据集上表现优异，平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）为2.22%。

Conclusion: VolE是一种高效且无需额外硬件或参考的食物体积估计方法，适用于医疗营养管理和健康监测。

Abstract: Accurate food volume estimation is crucial for medical nutrition management
and health monitoring applications, but current food volume estimation methods
are often limited by mononuclear data, leveraging single-purpose hardware such
as 3D scanners, gathering sensor-oriented information such as depth
information, or relying on camera calibration using a reference object. In this
paper, we present VolE, a novel framework that leverages mobile device-driven
3D reconstruction to estimate food volume. VolE captures images and camera
locations in free motion to generate precise 3D models, thanks to AR-capable
mobile devices. To achieve real-world measurement, VolE is a reference- and
depth-free framework that leverages food video segmentation for food mask
generation. We also introduce a new food dataset encompassing the challenging
scenarios absent in the previous benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
VolE outperforms the existing volume estimation techniques across multiple
datasets by achieving 2.22 % MAPE, highlighting its superior performance in
food volume estimation.

Conclusion: 将MixUp和辅助傅里叶增强集成到nnU-Net训练流程中，是一种简单有效的解决方案，可提升医学分割模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models are often trained on curated datasets,
leading to performance degradation when deployed in real-world clinical
settings due to mismatches between training and test distributions. While data
augmentation techniques are widely used to address these challenges,
traditional visually consistent augmentation strategies lack the robustness
needed for diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we systematically
evaluate alternative augmentation strategies, focusing on MixUp and Auxiliary
Fourier Augmentation. These methods mitigate the effects of multiple variations
without explicitly targeting specific sources of distribution shifts. We
demonstrate how these techniques significantly improve out-of-distribution
generalization and robustness to imaging variations across a wide range of
transformations in cardiac cine MRI and prostate MRI segmentation. We
quantitatively find that these augmentation methods enhance learned feature
representations by promoting separability and compactness. Additionally, we
highlight how their integration into nnU-Net training pipelines provides an
easy-to-implement, effective solution for enhancing the reliability of medical
segmentation models in real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖2D渲染姿势图像，限制了泛化能力并丢失了3D信息，因此需要一种直接建模3D运动序列的方法。

Method: 提出4DMoT将3D运动序列量化为4D运动令牌，并设计MV-DiT利用这些令牌生成动画。

Result: MTVCrafter在FID-VID指标上达到6.98，优于第二名65%，并能泛化到多种开放世界场景。

Conclusion: MTVCrafter为姿势引导的人类视频生成开辟了新方向，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Human image animation has gained increasing attention and developed rapidly
due to its broad applications in digital humans. However, existing methods rely
largely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits
generalization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation.
To tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video
Crafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences
(i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT
(4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens.
Compared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust
spatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image
and character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we
introduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention
with 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as
4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D
world. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new
direction for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our
MTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98,
surpassing the second-best by 65%. Powered by robust motion tokens, MTVCrafter
also generalizes well to diverse open-world characters (single/multiple,
full/half-body) across various styles and scenarios. Our video demos and code

Conclusion: ADHMR通过偏好优化显著提升了单图像人体网格恢复的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) from a single image is inherently ill-posed due to
depth ambiguity and occlusions. Probabilistic methods have tried to solve this
by generating numerous plausible 3D human mesh predictions, but they often
exhibit misalignment with 2D image observations and weak robustness to
in-the-wild images. To address these issues, we propose ADHMR, a framework that
Aligns a Diffusion-based HMR model in a preference optimization manner. First,
we train a human mesh prediction assessment model, HMR-Scorer, capable of
evaluating predictions even for in-the-wild images without 3D annotations. We
then use HMR-Scorer to create a preference dataset, where each input image has
a pair of winner and loser mesh predictions. This dataset is used to finetune
the base model using direct preference optimization. Moreover, HMR-Scorer also
helps improve existing HMR models by data cleaning, even with fewer training
samples. Extensive experiments show that ADHMR outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at:

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps offer extensive and accurate environmental
information about the driving scene, making them a crucial and essential
element for planning within autonomous driving systems. To avoid extensive
efforts from manual labeling, methods for automating the map creation have
emerged. Recent trends have moved from offline mapping to online mapping,
ensuring availability and actuality of the utilized maps. While the performance
has increased in recent years, online mapping still faces challenges regarding
temporal consistency, sensor occlusion, runtime, and generalization. We propose
a novel offline mapping approach that integrates trails - informal routes used
by drivers - into the map creation process. Our method aggregates trail data
from the ego vehicle and other traffic participants to construct a
comprehensive global map using transformer-based deep learning models. Unlike
traditional offline mapping, our approach enables continuous updates while
remaining sensor-agnostic, facilitating efficient data transfer. Our method
demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art online mapping
approaches, achieving improved generalization to previously unseen environments
and sensor configurations. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets,
highlighting its robustness and applicability in autonomous driving systems.

Result: 在ChicagoFSWild、ChicagoFSWild+及新提出的俄语数据集Znaki上表现优异。

Conclusion: HandReader模型高效且公开可用，为手语拼写识别提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Fingerspelling is a significant component of Sign Language (SL), allowing the
interpretation of proper names, characterized by fast hand movements during
signing. Although previous works on fingerspelling recognition have focused on
processing the temporal dimension of videos, there remains room for improving
the accuracy of these approaches. This paper introduces HandReader, a group of
three architectures designed to address the fingerspelling recognition task.
HandReader$_{RGB}$ employs the novel Temporal Shift-Adaptive Module (TSAM) to
process RGB features from videos of varying lengths while preserving important
sequential information. HandReader$_{KP}$ is built on the proposed Temporal
Pose Encoder (TPE) operated on keypoints as tensors. Such keypoints composition
in a batch allows the encoder to pass them through 2D and 3D convolution
layers, utilizing temporal and spatial information and accumulating keypoints
coordinates. We also introduce HandReader_RGB+KP - architecture with a joint
encoder to benefit from RGB and keypoint modalities. Each HandReader model
possesses distinct advantages and achieves state-of-the-art results on the
ChicagoFSWild and ChicagoFSWild+ datasets. Moreover, the models demonstrate
high performance on the first open dataset for Russian fingerspelling, Znaki,
presented in this paper. The Znaki dataset and HandReader pre-trained models

Abstract: Deep learning approaches for marine fog detection and forecasting have
outperformed traditional methods, demonstrating significant scientific and
practical importance. However, the limited availability of open-source datasets
remains a major challenge. Existing datasets, often focused on a single region
or satellite, restrict the ability to evaluate model performance across diverse
conditions and hinder the exploration of intrinsic marine fog characteristics.
To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{MFogHub}, the first
multi-regional and multi-satellite dataset to integrate annotated marine fog
observations from 15 coastal fog-prone regions and six geostationary
satellites, comprising over 68,000 high-resolution samples. By encompassing
diverse regions and satellite perspectives, MFogHub facilitates rigorous
evaluation of both detection and forecasting methods under varying conditions.
Extensive experiments with 16 baseline models demonstrate that MFogHub can
reveal generalization fluctuations due to regional and satellite discrepancy,
while also serving as a valuable resource for the development of targeted and
scalable fog prediction techniques. Through MFogHub, we aim to advance both the
practical monitoring and scientific understanding of marine fog dynamics on a

TLDR: 提出了一种多阶段跨模态交互（MSCI）模型，通过利用CLIP视觉编码器的中间层信息，增强对细粒度局部特征的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖CLIP的跨模态对齐能力，但忽视了其在细粒度局部特征捕捉上的局限性。

Method: 设计了两个自适应聚合器，分别从低层和高层视觉特征中提取局部和全局信息，并通过分阶段交互机制整合到文本表示中。

Result: 在三个常用数据集上的实验验证了模型的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: MSCI通过动态调整全局和局部视觉信息的注意力权重，灵活适应多样化场景，显著提升了细粒度局部视觉信息的感知能力。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object
combinations by leveraging known combinations. Existing studies basically rely
on the cross-modal alignment capabilities of CLIP but tend to overlook its
limitations in capturing fine-grained local features, which arise from its
architectural and training paradigm. To address this issue, we propose a
Multi-Stage Cross-modal Interaction (MSCI) model that effectively explores and
utilizes intermediate-layer information from CLIP's visual encoder.
Specifically, we design two self-adaptive aggregators to extract local
information from low-level visual features and integrate global information
from high-level visual features, respectively. These key information are
progressively incorporated into textual representations through a
stage-by-stage interaction mechanism, significantly enhancing the model's

MSCI dynamically adjusts the attention weights between global and local visual
information based on different combinations, as well as different elements
within the same combination, allowing it to flexibly adapt to diverse
scenarios. Experiments on three widely used datasets fully validate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model. Data and code are

*Daniel A. P. Oliveira,David Martins de Matos*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出StoryReasoning数据集和Qwen Storyteller模型，通过视觉相似性和面部识别等技术，减少视觉叙事中的角色和对象一致性错误，将幻觉现象降低12.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉叙事系统中角色身份和动作关联不一致的问题，减少幻觉现象。

Method: 使用StoryReasoning数据集（4,178个故事），结合跨帧对象重识别、链式思维推理和视觉实体链接技术，微调Qwen2.5-VL 7B模型。

Result: 微调后的Qwen Storyteller模型将幻觉现象从4.06降至3.56（-12.3%）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了视觉叙事中角色和对象的一致性，减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems struggle to maintain character identity across
frames and link actions to appropriate subjects, frequently leading to
referential hallucinations. These issues can be addressed through grounding of
characters, objects, and other entities on the visual elements. We propose
StoryReasoning, a dataset containing 4,178 stories derived from 52,016 movie
images, with both structured scene analyses and grounded stories. Each story
maintains character and object consistency across frames while explicitly
modeling multi-frame relationships through structured tabular representations.
Our approach features cross-frame object re-identification using visual
similarity and face recognition, chain-of-thought reasoning for explicit
narrative modeling, and a grounding scheme that links textual elements to
visual entities across multiple frames. We establish baseline performance by
fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL 7B, creating Qwen Storyteller, which performs end-to-end
object detection, re-identification, and landmark detection while maintaining
consistent object references throughout the story. Evaluation demonstrates a
reduction from 4.06 to 3.56 (-12.3%) hallucinations on average per story when
compared to a non-fine-tuned model.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: MIPHEI是一种基于U-Net和ViT的模型，用于从H&E图像预测mIF信号，实现细胞类型分类，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决mIF技术因成本和复杂性难以临床普及的问题，利用H&E图像预测mIF信号。

Method: 采用U-Net架构结合ViT编码器，训练数据来自ORION数据集，验证于两个独立数据集。

Result: 在多个标记物上表现优异，如Pan-CK（F1=0.88）、CD3e（F1=0.57），显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: MIPHEI为大规模H&E数据的细胞类型分析提供了新途径，有助于研究细胞空间组织与患者预后的关系。

Abstract: Histopathological analysis is a cornerstone of cancer diagnosis, with
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining routinely acquired for every patient to
visualize cell morphology and tissue architecture. On the other hand, multiplex
immunofluorescence (mIF) enables more precise cell type identification via
proteomic markers, but has yet to achieve widespread clinical adoption due to
cost and logistical constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce MIPHEI
(Multiplex Immunofluorescence Prediction from H&E), a U-Net-inspired
architecture that integrates state-of-the-art ViT foundation models as encoders
to predict mIF signals from H&E images. MIPHEI targets a comprehensive panel of
markers spanning nuclear content, immune lineages (T cells, B cells, myeloid),
epithelium, stroma, vasculature, and proliferation. We train our model using
the publicly available ORION dataset of restained H&E and mIF images from
colorectal cancer tissue, and validate it on two independent datasets. MIPHEI
achieves accurate cell-type classification from H&E alone, with F1 scores of
0.88 for Pan-CK, 0.57 for CD3e, 0.56 for SMA, 0.36 for CD68, and 0.30 for CD20,
substantially outperforming both a state-of-the-art baseline and a random
classifier for most markers. Our results indicate that our model effectively
captures the complex relationships between nuclear morphologies in their tissue
context, as visible in H&E images and molecular markers defining specific cell
types. MIPHEI offers a promising step toward enabling cell-type-aware analysis
of large-scale H&E datasets, in view of uncovering relationships between
spatial cellular organization and patient outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在利用无标签数据方面具有潜力，但也面临隐私问题。论文旨在解决在自监督模型训练方法和细节未知的情况下，如何有效进行成员推理攻击的问题。

Method: 提出PartCrop方法，通过裁剪图像中的部分对象并查询其在表示空间中的响应，利用模型对训练数据的部分感知能力进行攻击。

Result: 实验证明PartCrop在不同训练协议和结构的自监督模型上具有有效性和泛化能力。防御实验表明早期停止、差分隐私和裁剪尺度范围缩小等方法均有效。

Conclusion: PartCrop是一种有效的成员推理攻击方法，论文还提出了防御措施和扩展版本PartCrop-v2，为自监督学习的隐私保护提供了参考。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning shows promise in harnessing extensive unlabeled
data, but it also confronts significant privacy concerns, especially in vision.
In this paper, we perform membership inference on visual self-supervised models
in a more realistic setting: self-supervised training method and details are
unknown for an adversary when attacking as he usually faces a black-box system
in practice. In this setting, considering that self-supervised model could be
trained by completely different self-supervised paradigms, e.g., masked image
modeling and contrastive learning, with complex training details, we propose a
unified membership inference method called PartCrop. It is motivated by the
shared part-aware capability among models and stronger part response on the
training data. Specifically, PartCrop crops parts of objects in an image to
query responses within the image in representation space. We conduct extensive
attacks on self-supervised models with different training protocols and
structures using three widely used image datasets. The results verify the
effectiveness and generalization of PartCrop. Moreover, to defend against
PartCrop, we evaluate two common approaches, i.e., early stop and differential
privacy, and propose a tailored method called shrinking crop scale range. The
defense experiments indicate that all of them are effective. Finally, besides
prototype testing on toy visual encoders and small-scale image datasets, we
quantitatively study the impacts of scaling from both data and model aspects in
a realistic scenario and propose a scalable PartCrop-v2 by introducing two
structural improvements to PartCrop. Our code is at

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: SpikeVideoFormer是一种高效的脉冲驱动视频Transformer，通过设计脉冲驱动的Hamming注意力（SDHA）和优化的时空注意力方案，在视频任务中实现了线性时间复杂度和卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于SNN的Transformer主要关注单图像任务，未能充分利用SNN在视频任务中的高效性。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了脉冲驱动的Hamming注意力（SDHA），并分析了多种脉冲驱动的时空注意力方案，选择最优方案。

Result: 在视频分类、人体姿态跟踪和语义分割任务中，性能优于现有SNN方法，提升超过15%，且效率显著优于ANN方法。

Conclusion: SpikeVideoFormer在视频任务中实现了高性能和高效率，为SNN在视频领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown competitive performance to
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various vision tasks, while offering
superior energy efficiency. However, existing SNN-based Transformers primarily
focus on single-image tasks, emphasizing spatial features while not effectively
leveraging SNNs' efficiency in video-based vision tasks. In this paper, we
introduce SpikeVideoFormer, an efficient spike-driven video Transformer,
featuring linear temporal complexity $\mathcal{O}(T)$. Specifically, we design
a spike-driven Hamming attention (SDHA) which provides a theoretically guided
adaptation from traditional real-valued attention to spike-driven attention.
Building on SDHA, we further analyze various spike-driven space-time attention
designs and identify an optimal scheme that delivers appealing performance for
video tasks, while maintaining only linear temporal complexity. The
generalization ability and efficiency of our model are demonstrated across
diverse downstream video tasks, including classification, human pose tracking,
and semantic segmentation. Empirical results show our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing SNN approaches, with
over 15\% improvement on the latter two tasks. Additionally, it matches the
performance of recent ANN-based methods while offering significant efficiency
gains, achieving $\times 16$, $\times 10$ and $\times 5$ improvements on the
three tasks. https://github.com/JimmyZou/SpikeVideoFormer

Result: 在Zurich RAW to RGB和Fujifilm UltraISP数据集上表现优异，评估指标显示高保真度。

Conclusion: 无配对学习方法在ISP任务中具有潜力，适用于移动设备，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: The Image Signal Processor (ISP) is a fundamental component in modern
smartphone cameras responsible for conversion of RAW sensor image data to RGB
images with a strong focus on perceptual quality. Recent work highlights the
potential of deep learning approaches and their ability to capture details with
a quality increasingly close to that of professional cameras. A difficult and
costly step when developing a learned ISP is the acquisition of pixel-wise
aligned paired data that maps the raw captured by a smartphone camera sensor to
high-quality reference images. In this work, we address this challenge by
proposing a novel training method for a learnable ISP that eliminates the need
for direct correspondences between raw images and ground-truth data with
matching content. Our unpaired approach employs a multi-term loss function
guided by adversarial training with multiple discriminators processing feature
maps from pre-trained networks to maintain content structure while learning
color and texture characteristics from the target RGB dataset. Using
lightweight neural network architectures suitable for mobile devices as
backbones, we evaluated our method on the Zurich RAW to RGB and Fujifilm
UltraISP datasets. Compared to paired training methods, our unpaired learning
strategy shows strong potential and achieves high fidelity across multiple
evaluation metrics. The code and pre-trained models are available at

TLDR: 论文探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）对图像中虚拟对象的理解能力，发现现有模型表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs是否能够理解图像中未直接呈现的虚拟对象及其空间关系，以测试其场景理解能力。

Method: 通过系统评估方法，测试VLMs对虚拟对象的处理能力，例如让模型想象图像中未出现的物体并推理其空间关系。

Result: 实验表明，当前最先进的VLMs在处理虚拟对象时表现不佳。

Conclusion: VLMs在理解虚拟对象及其空间关系方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are AI systems paired with both language and
vision encoders to process multimodal input. They are capable of performing
complex semantic tasks such as automatic captioning, but it remains an open
question about how well they comprehend the visuospatial properties of scenes
depicted in the images they process. We argue that descriptions of virtual
objects -- objects that are not visually represented in an image -- can help
test scene comprehension in these AI systems. For example, an image that
depicts a person standing under a tree can be paired with the following prompt:
imagine that a kite is stuck in the tree. VLMs that comprehend the scene should
update their representations and reason sensibly about the spatial relations
between all three objects. We describe systematic evaluations of
state-of-the-art VLMs and show that their ability to process virtual objects is
inadequate.

TLDR: ControlGS是一种3D高斯溅射优化方法，通过单一训练和用户指定参数实现跨场景的语义一致性和数量-质量控制，优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D高斯溅射中缺乏用户直观调整数量-质量权衡的能力，无法适应多样化的硬件和通信限制。

Method: 提出ControlGS，通过固定设置和用户指定超参数，自动寻找数量-质量权衡点，支持跨场景一致性和无级控制。

Result: ControlGS在渲染质量上优于基线方法，使用更少的高斯函数，并支持广泛的调整范围。

Conclusion: ControlGS为3D高斯溅射提供了灵活且高性能的数量-质量控制解决方案。

Abstract: To reduce storage and computational costs, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) seeks
to minimize the number of Gaussians used while preserving high rendering
quality, introducing an inherent trade-off between Gaussian quantity and
rendering quality. Existing methods strive for better quantity-quality
performance, but lack the ability for users to intuitively adjust this
trade-off to suit practical needs such as model deployment under diverse
hardware and communication constraints. Here, we present ControlGS, a 3DGS
optimization method that achieves semantically meaningful and cross-scene
consistent quantity-quality control while maintaining strong quantity-quality
performance. Through a single training run using a fixed setup and a
user-specified hyperparameter reflecting quantity-quality preference, ControlGS
can automatically find desirable quantity-quality trade-off points across
diverse scenes, from compact objects to large outdoor scenes. It also
outperforms baselines by achieving higher rendering quality with fewer
Gaussians, and supports a broad adjustment range with stepless control over the
trade-off.

Motivation: 解决ISLR任务中数据不足和相似手语标注歧义的问题。

Method: 提出Logos数据集，采用跨语言迁移学习和多分类头联合训练方法，并明确标注视觉相似手语组。

Conclusion: Logos数据集和提出的方法有效提升了ISLR任务的性能，为跨语言手语识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper examines two aspects of the isolated sign language recognition
(ISLR) task. First, despite the availability of a number of datasets, the
amount of data for most individual sign languages is limited. It poses the
challenge of cross-language ISLR model training, including transfer learning.
Second, similar signs can have different semantic meanings. It leads to
ambiguity in dataset labeling and raises the question of the best policy for
annotating such signs. To address these issues, this study presents Logos, a
novel Russian Sign Language (RSL) dataset, the most extensive ISLR dataset by
the number of signers and one of the largest available datasets while also the
largest RSL dataset in size and vocabulary. It is shown that a model,
pre-trained on the Logos dataset can be used as a universal encoder for other
language SLR tasks, including few-shot learning. We explore cross-language
transfer learning approaches and find that joint training using multiple
classification heads benefits accuracy for the target lowresource datasets the
most. The key feature of the Logos dataset is explicitly annotated visually
similar sign groups. We show that explicitly labeling visually similar signs
improves trained model quality as a visual encoder for downstream tasks. Based
on the proposed contributions, we outperform current state-of-the-art results
for the WLASL dataset and get competitive results for the AUTSL dataset, with a
single stream model processing solely RGB video. The source code, dataset, and
pre-trained models are publicly available.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型评估缺乏统一框架，存在冗余、多样性不足等问题。

Result: UniBench更具挑战性，UniScore与人工评估一致，优于现有指标。

Conclusion: UniEval为多模态模型提供高效评估工具，揭示了新见解。

Abstract: The emergence of unified multimodal understanding and generation models is
rapidly attracting attention because of their ability to enhance
instruction-following capabilities while minimizing model redundancy. However,
there is a lack of a unified evaluation framework for these models, which would
enable an elegant, simplified, and overall evaluation. Current models conduct
evaluations on multiple task-specific benchmarks, but there are significant
limitations, such as the lack of overall results, errors from extra evaluation
models, reliance on extensive labeled images, benchmarks that lack diversity,
and metrics with limited capacity for instruction-following evaluation. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce UniEval, the first evaluation framework
designed for unified multimodal models without extra models, images, or
annotations. This facilitates a simplified and unified evaluation process. The
UniEval framework contains a holistic benchmark, UniBench (supports both
unified and visual generation models), along with the corresponding UniScore
metric. UniBench includes 81 fine-grained tags contributing to high diversity.
Experimental results indicate that UniBench is more challenging than existing
benchmarks, and UniScore aligns closely with human evaluations, surpassing
current metrics. Moreover, we extensively evaluated SoTA unified and visual
generation models, uncovering new insights into Univeral's unique values.

Conclusion: CheXGenBench为医学AI社区提供了标准化基准，支持客观可重复的比较，并发布了高质量合成数据集SynthCheX-75K。

Abstract: We introduce CheXGenBench, a rigorous and multifaceted evaluation framework
for synthetic chest radiograph generation that simultaneously assesses
fidelity, privacy risks, and clinical utility across state-of-the-art
text-to-image generative models. Despite rapid advancements in generative AI
for real-world imagery, medical domain evaluations have been hindered by
methodological inconsistencies, outdated architectural comparisons, and
disconnected assessment criteria that rarely address the practical clinical
value of synthetic samples. CheXGenBench overcomes these limitations through
standardised data partitioning and a unified evaluation protocol comprising
over 20 quantitative metrics that systematically analyse generation quality,
potential privacy vulnerabilities, and downstream clinical applicability across
11 leading text-to-image architectures. Our results reveal critical
inefficiencies in the existing evaluation protocols, particularly in assessing
generative fidelity, leading to inconsistent and uninformative comparisons. Our
framework establishes a standardised benchmark for the medical AI community,
enabling objective and reproducible comparisons while facilitating seamless
integration of both existing and future generative models. Additionally, we
release a high-quality, synthetic dataset, SynthCheX-75K, comprising 75K
radiographs generated by the top-performing model (Sana 0.6B) in our benchmark
to support further research in this critical domain. Through CheXGenBench, we

Result: 在公开基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，提升了对抗面部变形攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可集成到现有的人脸识别训练流程中，改进基于分类的识别方法。

Abstract: Face recognition has evolved significantly with the advancement of deep
learning techniques, enabling its widespread adoption in various applications
requiring secure authentication. However, this progress has also increased its
exposure to presentation attacks, including face morphing, which poses a
serious security threat by allowing one identity to impersonate another.
Therefore, modern face recognition systems must be robust against such attacks.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach for training deep networks for face
recognition with enhanced robustness to face morphing attacks. Our method
modifies the classification task by introducing a dual-branch classification
strategy that effectively handles the ambiguity in the labeling of face morphs.
This adaptation allows the model to incorporate morph images into the training
process, improving its ability to distinguish them from bona fide samples.
  Our strategy has been validated on public benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing robustness against face morphing attacks.
Furthermore, our approach is universally applicable and can be integrated into
existing face recognition training pipelines to improve classification-based
recognition methods.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved high performance in
vision-language tasks involving single image but they struggle when presented
with a collection of multiple images (Multiple Image Question Answering
scenario). These tasks, which involve reasoning over large number of images,
present issues in scalability (with increasing number of images) and retrieval
performance. In this work, we propose an enhancement for retriever framework
introduced in MIRAGE model using submodular subset selection techniques. Our
method leverages query-aware submodular functions, such as GraphCut, to
pre-select a subset of semantically relevant images before main retrieval
component. We demonstrate that using anchor-based queries and augmenting the
data improves submodular-retriever pipeline effectiveness, particularly in

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种新方法，通过解耦视觉和文本模态的注意力机制，揭示多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉理解上的不足，并引入了一种新的度量标准（注意力准确性）和基准来量化隐性视觉误解（IVM）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估答案正确性，忽略了模型是否真正理解视觉输入，因此需要一种更可靠的方法来评估模型的视觉理解能力。

Method: 通过分析因果注意力模块中的视觉和文本模态解耦，提出注意力准确性作为度量标准，并设计新基准来量化IVM。

Result: 研究发现，随着网络层加深，注意力分布逐渐集中在与正确答案相关的图像上，注意力准确性能够可靠评估视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于多模态场景，还能扩展到单模态，展示了其通用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements have enhanced the capability of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to comprehend multi-image information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily evaluate answer correctness, overlooking whether models
genuinely comprehend the visual input. To address this, we define implicit
visual misunderstanding (IVM), where MLLMs provide correct answers without
fully comprehending the visual input. Through our analysis, we decouple the
visual and textual modalities within the causal attention module, revealing
that attention distribution increasingly converges on the image associated with
the correct answer as the network layers deepen. This insight leads to the
introduction of a scale-agnostic metric, \textit{attention accuracy}, and a
novel benchmark for quantifying IVMs. Attention accuracy directly evaluates the
model's visual understanding via internal mechanisms, remaining robust to
positional biases for more reliable assessments. Furthermore, we extend our
approach to finer granularities and demonstrate its effectiveness in unimodal
scenarios, underscoring its versatility and generalizability.

Motivation: 扩散模型生成的图像可能包含不现实的属性（如狗漂浮在空中），这些图像是否会影响模型泛化能力尚不明确。

Method: 提出VariReal流程，通过最小化编辑源图像以生成可行或不可行属性的图像，并测试其对CLIP分类器的影响。

Result: 可行性对CLIP性能影响极小（差异<0.3%），且混合可行与不可行数据集对性能无显著影响。

Conclusion: 强制可行性在生成合成数据时并非必要，且混合可行与不可行数据不影响模型表现。

Abstract: With the development of photorealistic diffusion models, models trained in
part or fully on synthetic data achieve progressively better results. However,
diffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in
reality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture
artifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a
synthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic
images containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered
infeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered
out-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a
model's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be
excluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility
really matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is
necessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,
focusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We
introduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to
include feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated
by a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally
affects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference
in top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute
matters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the
classification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in
training datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using
purely feasible or infeasible datasets.

Multimodal Models, mainly focus on natural scenarios and overlook the intricate
details of mathematical figures that are critical for problem-solving,
hindering the advancement of current LMMs in multimodal mathematical reasoning.
To this end, we propose leveraging code as supervision for cross-modal
alignment, since code inherently encodes all information needed to generate
corresponding figures, establishing a precise connection between the two
modalities. Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset
with model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model,
FigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date.
Furthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures
and then construct MM-MathInstruct-3M, a high-quality multimodal math
instruction fine-tuning dataset. Finally, we present MathCoder-VL, trained with
ImgCode-8.6M for cross-modal alignment and subsequently fine-tuned on
MM-MathInstruct-3M for multimodal math problem solving. Our model achieves a
new open-source SOTA across all six metrics. Notably, it surpasses GPT-4o and
Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the geometry problem-solving subset of MathVista,
achieving improvements of 8.9% and 9.2%. The dataset and models will be
released at https://github.com/mathllm/MathCoder.

TLDR: ETT是一种端到端的视觉标记器调优方法，通过联合优化视觉标记化和目标自回归任务，显著提升多模态理解和视觉生成任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉标记化方法将标记器优化与下游任务训练分离，导致视觉标记无法适应多样化任务需求，成为性能瓶颈。

Method: ETT利用视觉标记器码本的嵌入表示，联合优化重建和字幕目标，实现端到端训练。

Result: 实验表明，ETT在多模态理解和视觉生成任务上比固定标记器基线提升2-6%性能，同时保持原有重建能力。

Conclusion: ETT是一种简单有效的方法，有望在多模态基础模型中广泛应用。

Abstract: Existing vision tokenization isolates the optimization of vision tokenizers
from downstream training, implicitly assuming the visual tokens can generalize
well across various tasks, e.g., image generation and visual question
answering. The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is
agnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics.
This decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment: The loss of the
vision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks. For
example, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when
recognizing or generating them. To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end
vision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision
tokenization and target autoregressive tasks. Unlike prior autoregressive
models that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT
leverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the
vision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives.
ETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal
architecture modifications. Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate,
without the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the
employed large language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance
gains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks
compared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original
reconstruction capability. We hope this very simple and strong method can
empower multimodal foundation models besides image generation and
understanding.

TLDR: Prior Depth Anything框架结合不完整但精确的深度测量信息与相对但完整的几何结构，生成准确、密集且详细的度量深度图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度预测中度量信息不完整与几何结构相对性之间的矛盾，提升深度图的准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 采用粗到细的流程，结合像素级度量对齐和距离感知加权，并通过条件单目深度估计模型优化噪声。

Result: 在7个真实数据集上表现出色，零样本泛化能力强，甚至超越任务专用方法。

Conclusion: 该框架灵活适应不同深度预测模型，提供精度与效率的权衡，并随MDE模型进步持续优化。

Abstract: This work presents Prior Depth Anything, a framework that combines incomplete
but precise metric information in depth measurement with relative but complete
geometric structures in depth prediction, generating accurate, dense, and
detailed metric depth maps for any scene. To this end, we design a
coarse-to-fine pipeline to progressively integrate the two complementary depth
sources. First, we introduce pixel-level metric alignment and distance-aware
weighting to pre-fill diverse metric priors by explicitly using depth
prediction. It effectively narrows the domain gap between prior patterns,
enhancing generalization across varying scenarios. Second, we develop a
conditioned monocular depth estimation (MDE) model to refine the inherent noise
of depth priors. By conditioning on the normalized pre-filled prior and
prediction, the model further implicitly merges the two complementary depth
sources. Our model showcases impressive zero-shot generalization across depth
completion, super-resolution, and inpainting over 7 real-world datasets,
matching or even surpassing previous task-specific methods. More importantly,
it performs well on challenging, unseen mixed priors and enables test-time
improvements by switching prediction models, providing a flexible
accuracy-efficiency trade-off while evolving with advancements in MDE models.

Motivation: 解决单张图像3D感知编辑的挑战，利用3D先验提升编辑质量。

Result: 3D-Fixup支持复杂3D感知编辑，保持身份一致性，实现高质量结果。

Conclusion: 3D-Fixup通过整合3D先验，推动了扩散模型在真实图像编辑中的应用。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in modeling image priors via diffusion models,
3D-aware image editing remains challenging, in part because the object is only
specified via a single image. To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a
new framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework
supports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D
rotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses
the generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes
real-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training
data pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a
single trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames,
we incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this
challenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We
design a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout
training. Results show that by integrating these 3D priors, 3D-Fixup
effectively supports complex, identity coherent 3D-aware edits, achieving
high-quality results and advancing the application of diffusion models in
realistic image manipulation. The code is provided at

TLDR: 提出了一种推断高维随机系统中熵产生（EP）的方法，适用于多体系统和非马尔可夫系统。通过非平衡最大熵原理和凸对偶性，利用轨迹观测样本推断轨迹级EP和平均EP的下界。

Motivation: 传统EP估计方法在高维系统中因计算和统计限制难以应用，需新方法解决。

Method: 基于非平衡最大熵原理和凸对偶性，利用轨迹观测样本推断EP，无需重构高维概率分布或速率矩阵。

Result: 方法成功应用于1000自旋无序非平衡自旋模型和大型神经尖峰数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法具有直观物理解释（热力学不确定性关系），并能分解EP的层次贡献。

Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional
stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with
long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such
systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer
trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a
nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex
duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables (such as
spatiotemporal correlation functions). It does not require reconstruction of
high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor any special
assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. It may be used to
compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from
different kinds of interactions, and it has an intuitive physical
interpretation as a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We demonstrate its
numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins
and a large neural spike-train dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电视用户面临众多频道和点播服务的选择，个性化体验对节省用户时间至关重要。然而，理解家庭中多人观看时的行为偏好是主要挑战。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型平均估计家庭电视配置文件的点估计，并引入贝叶斯随机游走模型以量化不确定性。

Result: 基于约50万条真实用户数据的实验表明，该框架能有效估计家庭电视配置文件数量及其随时间变化的特征，并量化不确定性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为家庭群体观看提供了更好的个性化推荐方法，解决了缺乏明确观看者信息和多配置文件结合的挑战。

Abstract: TV customers today face many choices from many live channels and on-demand
services. Providing a personalised experience that saves customers time when
discovering content is essential for TV providers. However, a reliable
understanding of their behaviour and preferences is key. When creating
personalised recommendations for TV, the biggest challenge is understanding
viewing behaviour within households when multiple people are watching. The
objective is to detect and combine individual profiles to make
better-personalised recommendations for group viewing. Our challenge is that we
have little explicit information about who is watching the devices at any time
(individuals or groups). Also, we do not have a way to combine more than one
individual profile to make better recommendations for group viewing. We propose
a novel framework using a Gaussian mixture model averaging to obtain point
estimates for the number of household TV profiles and a Bayesian random walk
model to introduce uncertainty. We applied our approach using data from real
customers whose TV-watching data totalled approximately half a million
observations. Our results indicate that combining our framework with the
selected features provides a means to estimate the number of household TV
profiles and their characteristics, including shifts over time and
quantification of uncertainty.

*Tushar Kataria,Beatrice Knudsen,Shireen Y. Elhabian*

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: ImplicitStainer利用局部隐式函数改进虚拟染色技术，减少数据需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色无法提供全部诊断信息，IHC染色耗时且资源密集，虚拟染色成为替代方案。

Method: 采用局部隐式函数进行像素级预测，优化图像翻译性能。

Result: 在有限数据下仍能生成高质量结果，优于15种现有模型。

Conclusion: ImplicitStainer为虚拟染色提供高效解决方案，代码将公开。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is a gold standard for microscopic
diagnosis in pathology. However, H&E staining does not capture all the
diagnostic information that may be needed. To obtain additional molecular
information, immunohistochemical (IHC) stains highlight proteins that mark
specific cell types, such as CD3 for T-cells or CK8/18 for epithelial cells.
While IHC stains are vital for prognosis and treatment guidance, they are
typically only available at specialized centers and time consuming to acquire,
leading to treatment delays for patients. Virtual staining, enabled by deep
learning-based image translation models, provides a promising alternative by
computationally generating IHC stains from H&E stained images. Although many
GAN and diffusion based image to image (I2I) translation methods have been used
for virtual staining, these models treat image patches as independent data
points, which results in increased and more diverse data requirements for
effective generation. We present ImplicitStainer, a novel approach that
leverages local implicit functions to improve image translation, specifically
virtual staining performance, by focusing on pixel-level predictions. This
method enhances robustness to variations in dataset sizes, delivering
high-quality results even with limited data. We validate our approach on two
datasets using a comprehensive set of metrics and benchmark it against over
fifteen state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion based models. Full Code and models
trained will be released publicly via Github upon acceptance.

*Pengfei Yu,Bin Huang,Minghui Zhang,Weiwen Wu,Shaoyu Wang,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于有序子集的多扩散模型（OSMM）用于稀疏视图CT重建，通过分块学习和全局约束提升细节重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统扩散模型在未处理数据上学习效率低、细节重建不足的问题。

Method: 将CT投影数据分为等量子集，采用多子集扩散模型（MSDM）独立学习，并结合全局扩散模型（OWDM）约束信息一致性。

Result: OSMM在图像质量和噪声鲁棒性上优于传统扩散模型。

Conclusion: OSMM为稀疏视图CT提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have shown significant promise in the field of
sparse-view CT reconstruction. However, the projection dataset is large and
riddled with redundancy. Consequently, applying the diffusion model to
unprocessed data results in lower learning effectiveness and higher learning
difficulty, frequently leading to reconstructed images that lack fine details.
To address these issues, we propose the ordered-subsets multi-diffusion model
(OSMM) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. The OSMM innovatively divides the CT
projection data into equal subsets and employs multi-subsets diffusion model
(MSDM) to learn from each subset independently. This targeted learning approach
reduces complexity and enhances the reconstruction of fine details.
Furthermore, the integration of one-whole diffusion model (OWDM) with complete
sinogram data acts as a global information constraint, which can reduce the
possibility of generating erroneous or inconsistent sinogram information.
Moreover, the OSMM's unsupervised learning framework provides strong robustness
and generalizability, adapting seamlessly to varying sparsity levels of CT
sinograms. This ensures consistent and reliable performance across different
clinical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OSMM outperforms
traditional diffusion models in terms of image quality and noise resilience,
offering a powerful and versatile solution for advanced CT imaging in
sparse-view scenarios.

Result: GVIF指标对视觉保真度敏感，优化系统在PSNR和FID上优于基准方案。

Conclusion: 混合系统通过GVIF指标和自适应控制，显著提升了生成图像的质量和通信效率。

Abstract: Generative semantic communication (Gen-SemCom) with large artificial
intelligence (AI) model promises a transformative paradigm for 6G networks,
which reduces communication costs by transmitting low-dimensional prompts
rather than raw data. However, purely prompt-driven generation loses
fine-grained visual details. Additionally, there is a lack of systematic
metrics to evaluate the performance of Gen-SemCom systems. To address these
issues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information
embedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical
features are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic
filtering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features
of images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and
critical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a
diffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual
information fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the
generated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features,
the GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted
features and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we
design a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume
of features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental
results validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating
with both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized
system achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of
higher PSNR and lower FID scores.

Conclusion: HWA-UNETR和GCM 2025数据集为胃癌多模态分割提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in the
context of gastric cancer lesion analysis. This clinical context is defined by
the scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to
amalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are
constrained to train on approximate data and depend on application migration,
leading to substantial resource expenditure and a potential decline in analysis
accuracy. To address those challenges, we have made two major contributions:
First, we publicly disseminate the GCM 2025 dataset, which serves as the first
large-scale, open-source collection of gastric cancer multimodal MRI scans,
featuring professionally annotated FS-T2W, CE-T1W, and ADC images from 500
patients. Second, we introduce HWA-UNETR, a novel 3D segmentation framework
that employs an original HWA block with learnable window aggregation layers to
establish dynamic feature correspondences between different modalities'
anatomical structures, and leverages the innovative tri-orientated fusion mamba
mechanism for context modeling and capturing long-range spatial dependencies.
Extensive experiments on our GCM 2025 dataset and the publicly BraTS 2021
dataset validate the performance of our framework, demonstrating that the new
approach surpasses existing methods by up to 1.68\% in the Dice score while
maintaining solid robustness. The dataset and code are public via

Result: MLE在31个息肉样本中显示对比度提升约3倍，颜色差异提升5倍。

Conclusion: MLE作为一种临床工具，有望改善胃肠道成像效果。

Abstract: White light endoscopy is the clinical gold standard for detecting diseases in
the gastrointestinal tract. Most applications involve identifying visual
abnormalities in tissue color, texture, and shape. Unfortunately, the contrast
of these features is often subtle, causing many clinically relevant cases to go
undetected. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser
Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable
spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three
capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral
diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast
imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We
validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical
colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold
improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference
compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal
multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating
into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to
improve gastrointestinal imaging.

Conclusion: 该框架为智能神经刺激接口领域开辟了新途径，并邀请机器学习社区参与贡献。

Abstract: Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) has emerged as a promising treatment
for Parkinson disease (PD). In aDBS, a surgically placed electrode sends
dynamically altered stimuli to the brain based on neurophysiological feedback:
an invasive gadget that limits the amount of data one could collect for
optimizing the control offline. As a consequence, a plethora of synthetic
models of PD and those of the control algorithms have been proposed. Herein, we
introduce the first neurophysiologically realistic benchmark for comparing said
models. Specifically, our methodology covers not only conventional basal
ganglia circuit dynamics and pathological oscillations, but also captures 15
previously dismissed physiological attributes, such as signal instabilities and
noise, neural drift, electrode conductance changes and individual variability -
all modeled as spatially distributed and temporally registered features via
beta-band activity in the brain and a feedback. Furthermore, we purposely built
our framework as a structured environment for training and evaluating deep
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, opening new possibilities for
optimizing aDBS control strategies and inviting the machine learning community
to contribute to the emerging field of intelligent neurostimulation interfaces.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disease with millions of patients
worldwide. Many patients have turned to alternative medicine due to the limited
efficacy and side effects of conventional antiepileptic drugs. In this study,
we developed a computational approach to optimize herbal epilepsy treatment
through AI-driven analysis of global natural products and statistically
validated randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our intelligent prescription
system combines machine learning (ML) algorithms for herb-efficacy
characterization, Bayesian optimization for personalized dosing, and
meta-analysis of RCTs for evidence-based recommendations. The system analyzed
1,872 natural compounds from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurveda, and
ethnopharmacological databases, integrating their bioactive properties with
clinical outcomes from 48 RCTs covering 48 epilepsy conditions (n=5,216). Using
LASSO regression and SHAP value analysis, we identified 17 high-efficacy herbs
(e.g., Gastrodia elata [using \'e for accented characters], Withania
somnifera), showing significant seizure reduction (p$<$0.01, Cohen's d=0.89)
with statistical significance confirmed by multiple testing (p$<$0.001). A
randomized double-blind validation trial (n=120) demonstrated 28.5\% greater
seizure frequency reduction with AI-optimized herbal prescriptions compared to
conventional protocols (95\% CI: 18.7-37.3\%, p=0.003).

Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) integrate heterogeneous user and item
data, such as text, images, and structured information, to enhance
recommendation performance. The emergence of large language models (LLMs)
introduces new opportunities for MRS by enabling semantic reasoning, in-context
learning, and dynamic input handling. Compared to earlier pre-trained language
models (PLMs), LLMs offer greater flexibility and generalisation capabilities
but also introduce challenges related to scalability and model accessibility.
This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent work at the intersection
of LLMs and MRS, focusing on prompting strategies, fine-tuning methods, and
data adaptation techniques. We propose a novel taxonomy to characterise
integration patterns, identify transferable techniques from related
recommendation domains, provide an overview of evaluation metrics and datasets,
and point to possible future directions. We aim to clarify the emerging role of
LLMs in multimodal recommendation and support future research in this rapidly
evolving field.

*Yifan Wu,Lutao Yan,Yizhang Zhu,Yinan Mei,Jiannan Wang,Nan Tang,Yuyu Luo*

Main category: cs.IR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种自动生成图表语义洞察的训练数据开发流程，并基于CLIP模型训练了ChartFinder模型，显著提升了文本到图表的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图表检索系统因缺乏全面的语义洞察而表现不佳，无法满足精确和模糊查询的需求。

Method: 开发了一个自动生成分层语义洞察的流程，包括视觉模式、统计属性和实际应用，并训练了基于CLIP的ChartFinder模型。

Result: ChartFinder在精确查询中NDCG@10达到66.9%，比现有方法高11.58%；在模糊查询中平均提升5%。

Conclusion: 通过丰富的语义洞察训练，ChartFinder显著提升了文本到图表检索的性能，适用于实际BI应用。

Abstract: Charts are crucial for data analysis and decision-making.Text-to-chart
retrieval systems have become increasingly important for Business Intelligence
(BI), where users need to find relevant charts that match their analytical
needs. These needs can be categorized into precise queries that are
well-specified and fuzzy queries that are more exploratory -- both require
understanding the semantics and context of the charts. However, existing
text-to-chart retrieval solutions often fail to capture the semantic content
and contextual information of charts, primarily due to the lack of
comprehensive metadata (or semantic insights). To address this limitation, we
propose a training data development pipeline that automatically synthesizes
hierarchical semantic insights for charts, covering visual patterns
(visual-oriented), statistical properties (statistics-oriented), and practical
applications (task-oriented), which produces 207,498 semantic insights for
69,166 charts. Based on these, we train a CLIP-based model named ChartFinder to
learn better representations of charts for text-to-chart retrieval. Our method
leverages rich semantic insights during the training phase to develop a model
that understands both visual and semantic aspects of charts.To evaluate
text-to-chart retrieval performance, we curate the first benchmark, CRBench,
for this task with 21,862 charts and 326 text queries from real-world BI
applications, with ground-truth labels verified by the crowd
workers.Experiments show that ChartFinder significantly outperforms existing
methods in text-to-chart retrieval tasks across various settings. For precise
queries, ChartFinder achieves up to 66.9% NDCG@10, which is 11.58% higher than
state-of-the-art models. In fuzzy query tasks, our method also demonstrates
consistent improvements, with an average increase of 5% across nearly all
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注LLMs在推荐任务中的应用，但忽视了其是否记忆了公开数据集的问题，这可能影响研究结果的泛化性和加剧偏见。

Method: 通过定义数据集记忆（包括项目属性、用户画像和用户-项目交互的可检索性），分析记忆对推荐性能的影响，并比较GPT和Llama模型家族的不同规模。

Result: 所有模型均表现出对MovieLens-1M的一定程度记忆，且推荐性能与记忆程度相关。

Conclusion: LLMs确实记忆了公开推荐数据集，记忆程度影响推荐性能，需在研究中加以关注以避免泛化问题和偏见放大。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to
recommendation scenarios due to their remarkable natural language understanding
and generation capabilities. Although significant research has explored the use
of LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to
verifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of
their training data. This is undesirable because memorization reduces the
generalizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets
does not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization
can amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more
frequently than others.
  In this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public
recommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and
Llama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset
in recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as
the extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions
can be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of
memorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether
memorization varies across model families and model sizes. Our results reveal
that all models exhibit some degree of memorization of MovieLens-1M, and that
recommendation performance is related to the extent of memorization. We have
made all the code publicly available at:

Conclusion: 该方法通过数值求解格林函数，实现了复杂几何域中子通量的可靠重建，为核反应堆监测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This work presents a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution
of the neutron flux in a nuclear reactor, leveraging real-time measurements
obtained from ex-core detectors. The Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (K-H) equation
inherently defines the problem of estimating a scalar field within a domain
based on boundary data, making it a natural mathematical framework for this
task. The main challenge lies in deriving the Green's function specific to the
domain and the neutron diffusion process. While analytical solutions for
Green's functions exist for simplified geometries, their derivation of complex,
heterogeneous domains-such as a nuclear reactor-requires a numerical approach.
The objective of this work is to demonstrate the well-posedness of the
data-driven Green's function approximation by formulating and solving the K-H
equation as an inverse problem. After establishing the symmetry properties that
the Green's function must satisfy, the K-H equation is derived from the
one-speed neutron diffusion model. This is followed by a comprehensive
description of the procedure for interpreting sensor readings and implementing
the neutron flux reconstruction algorithm. Finally, the existence and
uniqueness of the Green's function inferred from the sampled data are
demonstrated, ensuring the reliability of the proposed method and its
predictions.

Abstract: This paper focuses on explaining the timbre conveyed by speech signals and
introduces a task termed voice timbre attribute detection (vTAD). In this task,
voice timbre is explained with a set of sensory attributes describing its human

Experimental examinations on the ECAPA-TDNN and FACodec speaker encoders
demonstrated that: 1) the ECAPA-TDNN speaker encoder was more capable in the
seen scenario, where the testing speakers were included in the training set; 2)
the FACodec speaker encoder was superior in the unseen scenario, where the
testing speakers were not part of the training, indicating enhanced

Motivation: 探索利用预训练音频压缩模型实现艺术与计算应用的潜力。

Method: 使用EnCodec嵌入作为潜在表示，通过随机初始化的线性映射直接转换为StyleGAN2的潜在空间。

Result: 保留了语义丰富性，实现了细腻且语义一致的音频-视觉转换。

Conclusion: 展示了预训练音频压缩模型在艺术与计算应用中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces LAV (Latent Audio-Visual), a system that integrates
EnCodec's neural audio compression with StyleGAN2's generative capabilities to
produce visually dynamic outputs driven by pre-recorded audio. Unlike previous
works that rely on explicit feature mappings, LAV uses EnCodec embeddings as
latent representations, directly transformed into StyleGAN2's style latent
space via randomly initialized linear mapping. This approach preserves semantic
richness in the transformation, enabling nuanced and semantically coherent
audio-visual translations. The framework demonstrates the potential of using
pretrained audio compression models for artistic and computational
applications.

However, this innovation also presents new challenges to musicians and the
broader music industry. This study investigates the detection of AI-generated

pitch shifting were applied to the dataset. Mel spectrograms were generated
from the modified audio, then used to train and evaluate a convolutional neural
network. In addition to presenting technical results, this work explores the
ethical and societal implications of TTM platforms, arguing that carefully
designed detection systems are essential to both protecting artists and
unlocking the positive potential of generative AI in music.

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合解析解与神经网络，物理参数易于访问，为分布式音乐系统建模提供新思路。

Abstract: Modal synthesis methods are a long-standing approach for modelling
distributed musical systems. In some cases extensions are possible in order to
handle geometric nonlinearities. One such case is the high-amplitude vibration
of a string, where geometric nonlinear effects lead to perceptually important
effects including pitch glides and a dependence of brightness on striking
amplitude. A modal decomposition leads to a coupled nonlinear system of
ordinary differential equations. Recent work in applied machine learning
approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) has been used
to model lumped dynamic systems such as electronic circuits automatically from
data. In this work, we examine how modal decomposition can be combined with
neural ordinary differential equations for modelling distributed musical
systems. The proposed model leverages the analytical solution for linear
vibration of system's modes and employs a neural network to account for
nonlinear dynamic behaviour. Physical parameters of a system remain easily
accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the
network architecture. As an initial proof of concept, we generate synthetic
data for a nonlinear transverse string and show that the model can be trained
to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are
presented.

Result: 实验显示近似STFT显著降低误差率，并在性别和声乐分类任务中实现完全隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该方法为敏感音频数据的隐私保护提供了实用解决方案，并通过参数选择启发式方法促进实际应用。

Abstract: Audio and speech data are increasingly used in machine learning applications
such as speech recognition, speaker identification, and mental health
monitoring. However, the passive collection of this data by audio listening
devices raises significant privacy concerns. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)
offers a promising solution by enabling computations on encrypted data and
preserving user privacy. Despite its potential, prior attempts to apply FHE to
audio processing have faced challenges, particularly in securely computing time
frequency representations, a critical step in many audio tasks.
  Here, we addressed this gap by introducing a fully secure pipeline that
computes, with FHE and quantized neural network operations, four fundamental
time-frequency representations: Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Mel
filterbanks, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), and gammatone
filters. Our methods also support the private computation of audio descriptors
and convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers. Besides, we proposed
approximate STFT algorithms that lighten computation and bit use for
statistical and machine learning analyses.
  We ran experiments on the VocalSet and OxVoc datasets demonstrating the fully
private computation of our approach. We showed significant performance
improvements with STFT approximation in private statistical analysis of audio
markers, and for vocal exercise classification with CNNs. Our results reveal
that our approximations substantially reduce error rates compared to
conventional STFT implementations in FHE. We also demonstrated a fully private
classification based on the raw audio for gender and vocal exercise
classification. Finally, we provided a practical heuristic for parameter
selection, making quantized approximate signal processing accessible to
researchers and practitioners aiming to protect sensitive audio data.

Conclusion: WSW2.0展示了深度学习在教育研究中的潜力，可用于大规模课堂语音分析，支持语言发展研究。

Abstract: This paper introduces an automated framework WSW2.0 for analyzing vocal
interactions in preschool classrooms, enhancing both accuracy and scalability
through the integration of wav2vec2-based speaker classification and Whisper
(large-v2 and large-v3) speech transcription. A total of 235 minutes of audio
recordings (160 minutes from 12 children and 75 minutes from 5 teachers), were
used to compare system outputs to expert human annotations. WSW2.0 achieves a
weighted F1 score of .845, accuracy of .846, and an error-corrected kappa of
.672 for speaker classification (child vs. teacher). Transcription quality is
moderate to high with word error rates of .119 for teachers and .238 for
children. WSW2.0 exhibits relatively high absolute agreement intraclass
correlations (ICC) with expert transcriptions for a range of classroom language
features. These include teacher and child mean utterance length, lexical
diversity, question asking, and responses to questions and other utterances,
which show absolute agreement intraclass correlations between .64 and .98. To
establish scalability, we apply the framework to an extensive dataset spanning
two years and over 1,592 hours of classroom audio recordings, demonstrating the
framework's robustness for broad real-world applications. These findings
highlight the potential of deep learning and natural language processing
techniques to revolutionize educational research by providing accurate measures

effective intervention strategies and supporting early childhood language
development.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating differences in two multi-attribute

loss function with non-convex (log-sum and smoothly clipped absolute deviation
(SCAD)) penalties. Two proximal gradient descent methods are presented to
optimize the objective function. Theoretical analysis establishing sufficient
conditions for consistency in support recovery, convexity and estimation in
high-dimensional settings is provided. We illustrate our approaches with

Conclusion: I2I网络为SAR模型的参数估计提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于复杂非平稳场的模拟。

Abstract: In many scientific and industrial applications, we are given a handful of
instances (a 'small ensemble') of a spatially distributed quantity (a 'field')
but would like to acquire many more. For example, a large ensemble of global
temperature sensitivity fields from a climate model can help farmers, insurers,
and governments plan appropriately. When acquiring more data is prohibitively
expensive -- as is the case with climate models -- statistical emulation offers
an efficient alternative for simulating synthetic yet realistic fields.
However, parameter inference using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is
computationally prohibitive, especially for large, non-stationary fields. Thus,
many recent works train neural networks to estimate parameters given spatial
fields as input, sidestepping MLE completely. In this work we focus on a
popular class of parametric, spatially autoregressive (SAR) models. We make a
simple yet impactful observation; because the SAR parameters can be arranged on
a regular grid, both inputs (spatial fields) and outputs (model parameters) can
be viewed as images. Using this insight, we demonstrate that image-to-image
(I2I) networks enable faster and more accurate parameter estimation for a class
of non-stationary SAR models with unprecedented complexity.

a cardinality constraint: only $k$ assets from a universe of $p$ may be
included. The standard approach models this problem as a mixed-integer
quadratic program and relies on commercial solvers to find the optimal
solution. However, the computational costs of such methods increase
exponentially with $k$ and $p$, making them too slow for problems of even
moderate size. We propose a fast and scalable gradient-based approach that
transforms the combinatorial sparse selection problem into a constrained
continuous optimization task via Boolean relaxation, while preserving
equivalence with the original problem on the set of binary points. Our
algorithm employs a tunable parameter that transmutes the auxiliary objective
from a convex to a concave function. This allows a stable convex starting
point, followed by a controlled path toward a sparse binary solution as the
tuning parameter increases and the objective moves toward concavity. In
practice, our method matches commercial solvers in asset selection for most
instances and, in rare instances, the solution differs by a few assets whilst
showing a negligible error in portfolio variance.

Motivation: 探索路径梯度在已知目标能量下微调CNFs的潜力，以提高采样效率。

Method: 使用路径梯度微调Flow Matching训练的CNFs，测量流轨迹长度变化。

Result: 采样效率提升三倍，流结构基本保留。

Conclusion: 路径梯度微调是一种高效且结构保持的优化方法。

Abstract: Boltzmann Generators have emerged as a promising machine learning tool for
generating samples from equilibrium distributions of molecular systems using
Normalizing Flows and importance weighting. Recently, Flow Matching has helped
speed up Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), scale them to more complex
molecular systems, and minimize the length of the flow integration
trajectories. We investigate the benefits of using path gradients to fine-tune
CNFs initially trained by Flow Matching, in the setting where a target energy
is known. Our experiments show that this hybrid approach yields up to a
threefold increase in sampling efficiency for molecular systems, all while
using the same model, a similar computational budget and without the need for
additional sampling. Furthermore, by measuring the length of the flow
trajectories during fine-tuning, we show that path gradients largely preserve
the learned structure of the flow.

Main category: stat.ML

TLDR: 提出了一种单阶段Top-$k$学习延迟框架，统一预测和延迟，通过共享评分模型选择最经济的实体或专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单阶段方法仅支持延迟到单个专家，无法适应多实体场景。

Method: 定义成本敏感损失，推导独立于$k$的凸代理，支持动态调整$k$值。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和SVHN上验证，Top-$k$优于Top-1，动态版本Top-$k(x)$实现更优的精度-成本权衡。

Conclusion: 框架灵活高效，支持多实体延迟，动态调整进一步提升性能。

Abstract: We introduce the first one-stage Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer framework, which
unifies prediction and deferral by learning a shared score-based model that
selects the $k$ most cost-effective entities-labels or experts-per input. While
existing one-stage L2D methods are limited to deferring to a single expert, our
approach jointly optimizes prediction and deferral across multiple entities
through a single end-to-end objective. We define a cost-sensitive loss and
derive a novel convex surrogate that is independent of the cardinality
parameter $k$, enabling generalization across Top-$k$ regimes without
retraining. Our formulation recovers the Top-1 deferral policy of prior
score-based methods as a special case, and we prove that our surrogate is both
Bayes-consistent and $\mathcal{H}$-consistent under mild assumptions. We
further introduce an adaptive variant, Top-$k(x)$, which dynamically selects
the number of consulted entities per input to balance predictive accuracy and
consultation cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN confirm that our one-stage
Top-$k$ method strictly outperforms Top-1 deferral, while Top-$k(x)$ achieves
superior accuracy-cost trade-offs by tailoring allocations to input complexity.

Abstract: Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is challenging when
the likelihood function is irregular and expensive to compute. We explore
several sampling algorithms that make use of subset evaluations to reduce
computational overhead. We adapt the subset samplers for this setting where
gradient information is not available or is unreliable. To achieve this, we
introduce data-driven proxies in place of Taylor expansions and define a novel
computation-cost aware adaptive controller. We undertake an extensive
evaluation for a challenging disease modelling task and a configurable task
with similar irregularity in the likelihood surface. We find our improved
version of Hierarchical Importance with Nested Training Samples (HINTS), with
adaptive proposals and a data-driven proxy, obtains the best sampling error in
a fixed computational budget. We conclude that subset evaluations can provide
cheap and naturally-tempered exploration, while a data-driven proxy can
pre-screen proposals successfully in explored regions of the state space. These
two elements combine through hierarchical delayed acceptance to achieve
efficient, exact sampling.

TLDR: FlowVAT是一种基于条件温度调节的变分推断方法，通过同时调节基分布和目标分布，解决了多模态和高维后验分布中的模式坍塌问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态和高维后验分布对变分推断提出了挑战，传统退火方法需要复杂的温度调度和超参数调整，无法实现真正的黑盒推断。

Method: FlowVAT通过条件温度调节，利用过参数化神经网络的泛化能力，训练一个单一流表示不同温度下的后验分布，从而保留高温度下识别的模式。

Result: 在2、10和20维多模态分布实验中，FlowVAT优于传统和自适应退火方法，找到更多模式并获得更好的ELBO值。

Conclusion: FlowVAT无需复杂的温度调度和超参数调整，为复杂后验分布的黑盒变分推断提供了更自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal and high-dimensional posteriors present significant challenges
for variational inference, causing mode-seeking behavior and collapse despite
the theoretical expressiveness of normalizing flows. Traditional annealing
methods require temperature schedules and hyperparameter tuning, falling short
of the goal of truly black-box variational inference. We introduce FlowVAT, a
conditional tempering approach for normalizing flow variational inference that
addresses these limitations. Our method tempers both the base and target
distributions simultaneously, maintaining affine-invariance under tempering. By
conditioning the normalizing flow on temperature, we leverage overparameterized
neural networks' generalization capabilities to train a single flow
representing the posterior across a range of temperatures. This preserves modes
identified at higher temperatures when sampling from the variational posterior
at $T = 1$, mitigating standard variational methods' mode-seeking behavior. In
experiments with 2, 10, and 20 dimensional multi-modal distributions, FlowVAT
outperforms traditional and adaptive annealing methods, finding more modes and
achieving better ELBO values, particularly in higher dimensions where existing
approaches fail. Our method requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and does not
require an annealing schedule, advancing toward fully-automatic black-box
variational inference for complicated posteriors.

Motivation: 研究动机源于医学和营销等领域中在线反馈受限的约束，需要一种适应性强且易于实现的非参数方法。

Method: 方法结合了自适应k-NN回归和UCB原则，利用局部几何估计奖励并平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在标准Lipschitz平滑性和边界假设下，BaNk-UCB提供了接近最优的遗憾保证，并在合成和真实数据集上优于基于分箱的基线方法。

Conclusion: BaNk-UCB是一种高效、非参数且适应性强的方法，适用于批量上下文赌博机问题。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making in batched nonparametric contextual
bandits, where actions are selected over a finite horizon divided into a small
number of batches. Motivated by constraints in domains such as medicine and
marketing -- where online feedback is limited -- we propose a nonparametric
algorithm that combines adaptive k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) regression with the
upper confidence bound (UCB) principle. Our method, BaNk-UCB, is fully
nonparametric, adapts to the context dimension, and is simple to implement.
Unlike prior work relying on parametric or binning-based estimators, BaNk-UCB
uses local geometry to estimate rewards and adaptively balances exploration and
exploitation. We provide near-optimal regret guarantees under standard
Lipschitz smoothness and margin assumptions, using a theoretically motivated
batch schedule that balances regret across batches and achieves minimax-optimal
rates. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that BaNk-UCB consistently outperforms binning-based baselines.

Abstract: We present a novel perspective on the NFA canonization problem, which
introduces intermediate minimization steps to reduce the exploration space
on-the-fly. Essential to our approach are so-called equivalence registries
which manage information about equivalent states and allow for incorporating
further optimization techniques such as convexity closures or simulation to
boost performance. Due to the generality of our approach, these concepts can be
embedded in classic subset construction or Brzozowski's approach. We evaluate
our approach on a set of real-world examples from automatic sequences and
observe that we are able to improve especially worst-case scenarios. We
implement our approach in an open-source library for users to experiment with.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN训练中，替代梯度支持宽度gamma的选择存在困境：大gamma导致过度激活和能耗增加，小gamma引发梯度消失和时间依赖性减弱。

Method: 提出了一种时间抑制的ILIF神经元模型，通过互连的抑制单元调节膜电位和电流，平衡激活与梯度传播。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，ILIF能有效解决gamma困境，降低神经元放电率，稳定训练，并提升准确性。

Conclusion: ILIF模型为SNN训练提供了一种高效解决方案，兼具生物合理性和实用性。

Abstract: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has drawn increasing attention for its
energy-efficient, event-driven processing and biological plausibility. To train
SNNs via backpropagation, surrogate gradients are used to approximate the
non-differentiable spike function, but they only maintain nonzero derivatives
within a narrow range of membrane potentials near the firing threshold,
referred to as the surrogate gradient support width gamma. We identify a major
challenge, termed the dilemma of gamma: a relatively large gamma leads to
overactivation, characterized by excessive neuron firing, which in turn
increases energy consumption, whereas a small gamma causes vanishing gradients
and weakens temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose a temporal
Inhibitory Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ILIF) neuron model, inspired by biological
inhibitory mechanisms. This model incorporates interconnected inhibitory units
for membrane potential and current, effectively mitigating overactivation while
preserving gradient propagation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates ILIF
effectiveness in overcoming the gamma dilemma, and extensive experiments on
multiple datasets show that ILIF improves energy efficiency by reducing firing
rates, stabilizes training, and enhances accuracy. The code is available at

Abstract: The design and implementation of unit tests is a complex task many
programmers neglect. This research evaluates the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in automatically generating test cases, comparing them with
manual tests. An optimized prompt was developed, that integrates code and
requirements, covering critical cases such as equivalence partitions and
boundary values. The strengths and weaknesses of LLMs versus trained
programmers were compared through quantitative metrics and manual qualitative
analysis. The results show that the effectiveness of LLMs depends on
well-designed prompts, robust implementation, and precise requirements.
Although flexible and promising, LLMs still require human supervision. This
work highlights the importance of manual qualitative analysis as an essential
complement to automation in unit test evaluation.

Motivation: 传统漏洞检测方法存在高误报率、可扩展性差和依赖人工的问题，AI方法如LLMs虽有效但复杂且不透明，SAEs有望解决这些问题。

Method: 研究评估了SAEs在GPT-2 Small和Gemma 2B表示中的应用，测试其在无需微调LLMs的情况下检测漏洞的能力。

Result: SAE衍生的特征在漏洞检测中F1分数达89%，优于微调的Transformer编码器基线。

Conclusion: SAEs可直接从预训练LLMs的内部表示中检测软件漏洞，无需微调或任务特定监督，首次提供了实证证据。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a
major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability
detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates,
scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have
driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and
secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new
avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges
for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising
solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight,
interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the
effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and
Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without
fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug
detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned
transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence
that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal
representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific
supervision.

Motivation: 理解LLMs在编程任务中的推理能力和鲁棒性，以确保其可靠使用。

Method: 应用五种语义保持的代码变异，评估六种LLMs的推理能力，并通过人类专家分析验证。

Result: 部分LLMs（如Llama3.2）在61%的情况下基于错误逻辑得出正确预测，且对代码变异的鲁棒性较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在代码理解中的推理能力和鲁棒性仍需改进。

Abstract: Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have
assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the
accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them.
Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can
arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar
issues in code understanding.
  In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B
parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply
five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring
comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to
while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while
altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert
analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are
based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across
different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that
some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed
reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in
response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic
understanding.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML)
have led to the emergence of quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates
the strengths of both fields. Among QML approaches, variational quantum
circuits (VQCs), also known as quantum neural networks (QNNs), have shown
promise both empirically and theoretically. However, their broader adoption is
hindered by reliance on quantum hardware during inference. Hardware
imperfections and limited access to quantum devices pose practical challenges.
To address this, the Quantum-Train (QT) framework leverages the exponential
scaling of quantum amplitudes to generate classical neural network parameters,
enabling inference without quantum hardware and achieving significant parameter
compression. Yet, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for such
quantum-enhanced neural programmers remains non-trivial and often requires
expertise in quantum information science. In this paper, we propose an
automated solution using differentiable optimization. Our method jointly
optimizes both conventional circuit parameters and architectural parameters in
an end-to-end manner via automatic differentiation. We evaluate the proposed
framework on classification, time-series prediction, and reinforcement learning
tasks. Simulation results show that our method matches or outperforms manually
designed QNN architectures. This work offers a scalable and automated pathway
for designing QNNs that can generate classical neural network parameters across
diverse applications.

Abstract: Scrambling quantum systems have been demonstrated as effective substrates for
temporal information processing. While their role in providing rich feature
maps has been widely studied, a theoretical understanding of their performance
in temporal tasks is still lacking. Here we consider a general quantum
reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical
computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory
retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order
unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we
show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with
increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir
iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with
quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates
generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast,
the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both
reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove
exponential memory decays with iterations for local noisy channels. Proving
these results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding
concentration in temporal quantum learning models.

Method: 通过将经典的3SAT问题（NP完全问题）归约到MAPF问题，构造特定图和路径规划实例。

Result: 证明了MAPF问题在大尺寸智能体情况下是NP难的，不存在多项式时间算法（除非P=NP）。

Conclusion: 研究填补了MAPF问题复杂性分析的空白，为大尺寸智能体的路径规划提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem asks to find a set of paths on a
graph such that when synchronously following these paths the agents never
encounter a conflict. In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called
Classical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are
considered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time
step. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking
into account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can
be safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of
conflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the
body of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying
still at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how
harder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while
planning. Specifically, it was known that Classical MAPF problem on an
undirected graph can be solved in polynomial time, however no complete
polynomial-time algorithm was presented to solve MAPF with large agents. In
this paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard
and, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be
presented. Our proof is based on the prevalent in the field technique of
reducing the seminal 3SAT problem (which is known to be an NP-complete problem)
to the problem at hand. In particular, for an arbitrary 3SAT formula we
procedurally construct a dedicated graph with specific start and goal vertices
and show that the given 3SAT formula is satisfiable iff the corresponding path
finding instance has a solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据驱动方法需要大量标注数据且难以泛化到不同部署场景和无线配置的问题。

Method: 设计自监督学习框架，联合优化空间-频率掩码信道建模、域变换不变性和位置不变对比学习三个目标，并设计轻量级解码器用于下游任务。

Result: LWLM在所有定位任务中均优于基于模型和监督学习的基线方法，性能提升显著，且在标签有限和未见基站配置下表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LWLM作为无线定位的基础模型具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is a critical enabler for emerging 5G and 6G
applications, including autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), and smart
manufacturing. While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing
models require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across
deployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations,
we propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless
localization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL)
tasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on
information bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a
pretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model
(LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three
complementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling
(SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii)
position-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly
capture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple
perspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks,
including time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation,
single base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization.
Comprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses
both model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization
tasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer
models without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under
label-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its
potential as a foundation model for wireless localization.

TLDR: 提出了一个名为ManipBench的新基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在机器人低层推理能力中的表现，填补了当前缺乏统一评估标准的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏一个明确的、通用的基准来评估VLMs在机器人低层推理（如精确运动决策）中的能力，因此需要开发一个标准化的评估工具。

Method: 设计了ManipBench基准，涵盖多个维度（如物体间交互和可变形物体操作），并测试了33个代表性VLMs，包括不同模型规模的变体。

Result: VLMs在不同任务中的表现差异显著，且其性能与真实世界操作任务的趋势高度相关，但仍与人类理解水平存在显著差距。

Conclusion: ManipBench为评估VLMs的低层推理能力提供了标准化工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并为进一步研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence and
robotics due to their commonsense reasoning capabilities. In robotic
manipulation, VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent work
has also studied their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to making
decisions about precise robot movements. However, the community currently lacks
a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level
reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench,
to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs
across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object
interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 33
representative VLMs across 10 model families on our benchmark, including
variants to test different model sizes. Our evaluation shows that the
performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong
correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation
tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant gap between these models
and human-level understanding. See our website at:

TLDR: FlowDreamer提出了一种基于3D场景流的视觉世界模型，用于机器人操作任务，通过显式运动表示提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过显式运动表示（3D场景流）改进视觉世界模型，以更准确地预测机器人操作中的未来视觉观察。

Method: FlowDreamer采用U-Net预测3D场景流，并结合扩散模型生成未来帧，模型为端到端训练。

Result: 在4个基准测试中，FlowDreamer在语义相似性、像素质量和任务成功率上分别提升7%、11%和6%。

Conclusion: FlowDreamer通过显式运动表示显著提升了视觉世界模型的性能，适用于机器人操作任务。

Abstract: This paper investigates training better visual world models for robot
manipulation, i.e., models that can predict future visual observations by
conditioning on past frames and robot actions. Specifically, we consider world
models that operate on RGB-D frames (RGB-D world models). As opposed to
canonical approaches that handle dynamics prediction mostly implicitly and
reconcile it with visual rendering in a single model, we introduce FlowDreamer,
which adopts 3D scene flow as explicit motion representations. FlowDreamer
first predicts 3D scene flow from past frame and action conditions with a
U-Net, and then a diffusion model will predict the future frame utilizing the
scene flow. FlowDreamer is trained end-to-end despite its modularized nature.
We conduct experiments on 4 different benchmarks, covering both video
prediction and visual planning tasks. The results demonstrate that FlowDreamer
achieves better performance compared to other baseline RGB-D world models by 7%
on semantic similarity, 11% on pixel quality, and 6% on success rate in various
robot manipulation domains.

TLDR: 提出了一种结合多机器人任务分配（MRTA）和碰撞避免的新框架，通过空间聚类将工作区分割为可区分的操作区域，显著提升了任务分配效率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业环境中多机器人执行相同测量任务时的任务分配和碰撞避免问题，提高计算效率和操作安全性。

Method: 使用K-means聚类和2-Opt算法分割任务站点并规划机器人路线，实现任务分配和碰撞避免的统一。

Result: 时间减少93%（1.24s vs 17.62s），解决方案质量提升7%，完全消除碰撞点。

Conclusion: 空间分区方法在任务分配和碰撞避免问题上表现出色，对实际工业应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel framework is presented that achieves a combined
solution based on Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) and collision avoidance
with respect to homogeneous measurement tasks taking place in industrial
environments. The spatial clustering we propose offers to simultaneously solve
the task allocation problem and deal with collision risks by cutting the
workspace into distinguishable operational zones for each robot. To divide task
sites and to schedule robot routes within corresponding clusters, we use
K-means clustering and the 2-Opt algorithm. The presented framework shows
satisfactory performance, where up to 93\% time reduction (1.24s against
17.62s) with a solution quality improvement of up to 7\% compared to the best
performing method is demonstrated. Our method also completely eliminates
collision points that persist in comparative methods in a most significant
sense. Theoretical analysis agrees with the claim that spatial partitioning
unifies the apparently disjoint tasks allocation and collision avoidance
problems under conditions of many identical tasks to be distributed over sparse
geographical areas. Ultimately, the findings in this work are of substantial
importance for real world applications where both computational efficiency and
operation free from collisions is of paramount importance.

Motivation: 当前方法在训练数据集与机器人操作任务之间存在显著领域差距，且缺乏有效整合3D信息的模型架构。

Conclusion: EmbodiedMAE是一种可靠的多模态3D视觉基础模型，特别适用于需要空间感知的精确桌面操作任务。

Abstract: We present EmbodiedMAE, a unified 3D multi-modal representation for robot
manipulation. Current approaches suffer from significant domain gaps between
training datasets and robot manipulation tasks, while also lacking model
architectures that can effectively incorporate 3D information. To overcome
these limitations, we enhance the DROID dataset with high-quality depth maps
and point clouds, constructing DROID-3D as a valuable supplement for 3D
embodied vision research. Then we develop EmbodiedMAE, a multi-modal masked
autoencoder that simultaneously learns representations across RGB, depth, and
point cloud modalities through stochastic masking and cross-modal fusion.
Trained on DROID-3D, EmbodiedMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
vision foundation models (VFMs) in both training efficiency and final
performance across 70 simulation tasks and 20 real-world robot manipulation
tasks on two robot platforms. The model exhibits strong scaling behavior with
size and promotes effective policy learning from 3D inputs. Experimental
results establish EmbodiedMAE as a reliable unified 3D multi-modal VFM for
embodied AI systems, particularly in precise tabletop manipulation settings
where spatial perception is critical.

Result: 初步实验表明，该方法能有效减少多代理在长期路径上的时间消耗。

Conclusion: 该方法为非结构化环境中的长期高效导航提供了新思路，适用于月球或火星等自主基础设施开发场景。

Abstract: In the context of mobile navigation in unstructured environments, the
predominant approach entails the avoidance of obstacles. The prevailing path
planning algorithms are contingent upon deviating from the intended path for an
indefinite duration and returning to the closest point on the route after the
obstacle is left behind spatially. However, avoiding an obstacle on a path that
will be used repeatedly by multiple agents can hinder long-term efficiency and
lead to a lasting reliance on an active path planning system. In this study, we
propose an alternative approach to mobile navigation in unstructured
environments by leveraging the manipulation capabilities of a robotic
manipulator mounted on top of a mobile robot. Our proposed framework integrates
exteroceptive and proprioceptive feedback to assess the push affordance of
obstacles, facilitating their repositioning rather than avoidance. While our
preliminary visual estimation takes into account the characteristics of both
the obstacle and the surface it relies on, the push affordance estimation
module exploits the force feedback obtained by interacting with the obstacle
via a robotic manipulator as the guidance signal. The objective of our
navigation approach is to enhance the efficiency of routes utilized by multiple
agents over extended periods by reducing the overall time spent by a fleet in
environments where autonomous infrastructure development is imperative, such as
lunar or Martian surfaces.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for
Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs), their robustness in real-world conditions,
particularly under external disturbances, remains insufficiently explored. In
this paper, we evaluate the resilience of a DRL-based agent designed to capture
floating waste under various perturbations. We train the agent using domain
randomization and evaluate its performance in real-world field tests, assessing
its ability to handle unexpected disturbances such as asymmetric drag and an
off-center payload. We assess the agent's performance under these perturbations
in both simulation and real-world experiments, quantifying performance
degradation and benchmarking it against an MPC baseline. Results indicate that
the DRL agent performs reliably despite significant disturbances. Along with
the open-source release of our implementation, we provide insights into
effective training strategies, real-world challenges, and practical
considerations for deploying DRLbased ASV controllers.

Motivation: 现有IL预训练后RL微调的方法存在不稳定和样本效率低的问题，需要一种更高效的策略微调方法。

Result: 在14个机器人任务中显著提升样本效率，成功率达88%，性能崩溃减少。

Conclusion: IN-RIL是一种通用插件，能显著提升RL微调效果。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) each offer distinct
advantages for robotics policy learning: IL provides stable learning from
demonstrations, and RL promotes generalization through exploration. While
existing robot learning approaches using IL-based pre-training followed by
RL-based fine-tuning are promising, this two-step learning paradigm often
suffers from instability and poor sample efficiency during the RL fine-tuning
phase. In this work, we introduce IN-RIL, INterleaved Reinforcement learning
and Imitation Learning, for policy fine-tuning, which periodically injects IL
updates after multiple RL updates and hence can benefit from the stability of
IL and the guidance of expert data for more efficient exploration throughout
the entire fine-tuning process. Since IL and RL involve different optimization
objectives, we develop gradient separation mechanisms to prevent destructive
interference during \ABBR fine-tuning, by separating possibly conflicting
gradient updates in orthogonal subspaces. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
analysis, and our findings shed light on why interleaving IL with RL stabilizes
learning and improves sample-efficiency. Extensive experiments on 14 robot
manipulation and locomotion tasks across 3 benchmarks, including
FurnitureBench, OpenAI Gym, and Robomimic, demonstrate that \ABBR can
significantly improve sample efficiency and mitigate performance collapse
during online finetuning in both long- and short-horizon tasks with either
sparse or dense rewards. IN-RIL, as a general plug-in compatible with various
state-of-the-art RL algorithms, can significantly improve RL fine-tuning, e.g.,
from 12\% to 88\% with 6.3x improvement in the success rate on Robomimic
Transport. Project page: https://github.com/ucd-dare/IN-RIL.

Method: 设计了KCAC框架，重新设计奖励函数，移除刚性约束，定义子任务并实施跨任务课程学习。

Result: KCAC方法减少了40%的训练时间，任务成功率提高10%。

Conclusion: 研究为课程设计和机器人学习提供了有价值的见解，优化了学习效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic
manipulation but faces challenges in sample inefficiency and lack of
interpretability, limiting its applicability in real world scenarios. Enabling
the agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse
working scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key
factor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation,
and Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer
into RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two
block stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic
manipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to
solve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In
this work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid
constraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards
concurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two
self-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to
facilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40
percent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10
percent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we
identify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing,
and learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual
guidance for curriculum based RL frameworks. This work offers valuable insights
into curriculum design in RL and robotic learning.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动定义的回退策略，无法实现通用的语义安全运动规划，且大型视觉语言模型推理延迟高。

Method: FORTRESS利用多模态推理器识别目标和预测故障模式，实时合成回退计划并避免语义不安全区域。

Result: 在合成基准和真实机器人数据上，FORTRESS在安全分类准确性和规划成功率上优于即时提示模型。

Conclusion: FORTRESS通过开放世界多模态推理与动态规划的结合，显著提升了系统安全性和规划效率。

Abstract: Foundation models can provide robust high-level reasoning on appropriate
safety interventions in hazardous scenarios beyond a robot's training data,
i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) failures. However, due to the high inference
latency of Large Vision and Language Models, current methods rely on manually
defined intervention policies to enact fallbacks, thereby lacking the ability
to plan generalizable, semantically safe motions. To overcome these challenges
we present FORTRESS, a framework that generates and reasons about semantically
safe fallback strategies in real time to prevent OOD failures. At a low
frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses multi-modal reasoners to
identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime monitor triggers a
fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback goals while
inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By bridging
open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate
the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS
outperforms on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety
classification accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot
data, and further improves system safety and planning success in simulation and
on quadrotor hardware for urban navigation.

Conclusion: AutoCam证明了辅助摄像头可以自主控制以跟踪显著特征，为RAMIS中的多摄像头可视化方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally
invasive surgery (RAMIS) enhances spatial awareness and eliminates manual
viewpoint control. Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track
two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera
orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents
AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve
visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system
uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines
heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust
camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained
99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$
2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally
efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study
(N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training
task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's
viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's
improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary
camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side
manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new
multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.

Abstract: AI power demand is growing unprecedentedly thanks to the high power density
of AI compute and the emerging inferencing workload. On the supply side,
abundant wind power is waiting for grid access in interconnection queues. In
this light, this paper argues bringing AI workload to modular compute clusters
co-located in wind farms. Our deployment right-sizing strategy makes it
economically viable to deploy more than 6 million high-end GPUs today that
could consume cheap, green power at its source. We built Heron, a cross-site
software router, that could efficiently leverage the complementarity of power
generation across wind farms by routing AI inferencing workload around power
drops. Using 1-week ofcoding and conversation production traces from Azure and
(real) variable wind power traces, we show how Heron improves aggregate goodput
of AI compute by up to 80% compared to the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, such as autonomous robots and
intelligent vehicles, are increasingly reliant on diverse heterogeneous
accelerators (e.g., GPGPUs, NPUs, FPGAs) to meet stringent real-time processing
and energy-efficiency demands. However, the proliferation of vendor-specific
proprietary communication libraries creates significant interoperability
barriers, hindering seamless collaboration between different accelerator types
and leading to suboptimal resource utilization and performance bottlenecks in
distributed AI workloads. This paper introduces KAITIAN, a novel distributed
communication framework designed to bridge this gap. KAITIAN provides a unified
abstraction layer that intelligently integrates vendor-optimized communication
libraries for intra-group efficiency with general-purpose communication
protocols for inter-group interoperability. Crucially, it incorporates a
load-adaptive scheduling mechanism that dynamically balances computational
tasks across heterogeneous devices based on their real-time performance
characteristics. Implemented as an extension to PyTorch and rigorously
evaluated on a testbed featuring NVIDIA GPUs and Cambricon MLUs, KAITIAN
demonstrates significant improvements in resource utilization and scalability
for distributed training tasks. Experimental results show that KAITIAN can
accelerate training time by up to 42% compared to baseline homogeneous systems,
while incurring minimal communication overhead (2.8--4.3%) and maintaining
model accuracy. KAITIAN paves the way for more flexible and powerful
heterogeneous computing in complex embodied AI applications.

Motivation: 研究交替码的代数结构及其对密码系统安全性的影响，特别是McEliece密码系统。

Method: 通过定义线性码的二次壳（quadratic hull），利用Weil限制和代数几何工具，揭示交替码与广义Reed-Solomon码的深层联系。

Result: 在交替码速率足够高时，提出了多项式时间算法，能够恢复其底层广义Reed-Solomon码，从而实现对McEliece密码系统的高效密钥恢复攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于交替码，还可推广到代数几何码和Goppa码，为密码系统的安全性分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: We propose a new method for retrieving the algebraic structure of a generic
alternant code given an arbitrary generator matrix, provided certain conditions
are met. We then discuss how this challenges the security of the McEliece
cryptosystem instantiated with this family of codes. The central object of our
work is the quadratic hull related to a linear code, defined as the
intersection of all quadrics passing through the columns of a given generator
or parity-check matrix, where the columns are considered as points in the
affine or projective space. The geometric properties of this object reveal
important information about the internal algebraic structure of the code. This
is particularly evident in the case of generalized Reed-Solomon codes, whose
quadratic hull is deeply linked to a well-known algebraic variety called the
rational normal curve. By utilizing the concept of Weil restriction of affine
varieties, we demonstrate that the quadratic hull of a generic dual alternant
code inherits many interesting features from the rational normal curve, on
account of the fact that alternant codes are subfield-subcodes of generalized
Reed-Solomon codes. If the rate of the generic alternant code is sufficiently
high, this allows us to construct a polynomial-time algorithm for retrieving
the underlying generalized Reed-Solomon code from which the alternant code is
defined, which leads to an efficient key-recovery attack against the McEliece
cryptosystem when instantiated with this class of codes. Finally, we discuss
the generalization of this approach to Algebraic-Geometry codes and Goppa
codes.

Motivation: 传统聚类方法在处理高维、异构的医疗数据时效果不佳，缺乏上下文理解，因此研究探索LLM在聚类中的潜力。

Method: 使用LLAMA 3.1 8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B和Stella-En-400M-V5生成嵌入，并进行K-means聚类，与传统方法（如K-Medoids）对比。

Result: Stella-En-400M-V5的轮廓分数最高（0.86），LLM方法能识别具有不同特征的子群，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LLM在资源有限的环境中具有潜力，可用于上下文表型分析和决策支持。

Abstract: Clustering patient subgroups is essential for personalized care and efficient
resource use. Traditional clustering methods struggle with high-dimensional,
heterogeneous healthcare data and lack contextual understanding. This study
evaluates Large Language Model (LLM) based clustering against classical methods
using a pediatric sepsis dataset from a low-income country (LIC), containing
2,686 records with 28 numerical and 119 categorical variables. Patient records
were serialized into text with and without a clustering objective. Embeddings
were generated using quantized LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B with
low-rank adaptation(LoRA), and Stella-En-400M-V5 models. K-means clustering was
applied to these embeddings. Classical comparisons included K-Medoids
clustering on UMAP and FAMD-reduced mixed data. Silhouette scores and
statistical tests evaluated cluster quality and distinctiveness.
Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B
with the clustering objective performed better with higher number of clusters,
identifying subgroups with distinct nutritional, clinical, and socioeconomic
profiles. LLM-based methods outperformed classical techniques by capturing
richer context and prioritizing key features. These results highlight potential
of LLMs for contextual phenotyping and informed decision-making in
resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to
investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell
resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework
for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally
expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation
of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated
evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic
nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different
model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work,
we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI
surrogate of a CPM used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. We
describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that
define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this
classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model
surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference
configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational
time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards
the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological
systems.

Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is a well-known example of monotonic
reasoning, of intense practical interest due to fast solvers, complemented by
rigorous fine-grained complexity results. However, for non-monotonic reasoning,
e.g., abductive reasoning, comparably little is known outside classic
complexity theory. In this paper we take a first step of bridging the gap
between monotonic and non-monotonic reasoning by analyzing the complexity of
intractable abduction problems under the seemingly overlooked but natural
parameter n: the number of variables in the knowledge base. We obtain several
positive results for $\Sigma^P_2$- as well as NP- and coNP-complete fragments,
which implies the first example of beating exhaustive search for a
$\Sigma^P_2$-complete problem (to the best of our knowledge). We complement
this with lower bounds and for many fragments rule out improvements under the
(strong) exponential-time hypothesis.

Motivation: 研究动机在于评估神经网络在复杂高维相变中的EWS检测能力，尤其是其在空间模式植被动态中的适用性。

Method: 通过使用合成数据训练神经网络模型，并在多个测试系统中验证其性能，同时比较统计指标的预测能力。

Result: 结果显示模型性能在训练和测试数据源互换时变化显著，表明泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 结论指出，神经网络在EWS检测中有潜力，但需进一步优化以提高泛化能力。

Abstract: Dryland vegetation ecosystems are known to be susceptible to critical
transitions between alternative stable states when subjected to external
forcing. Such transitions are often discussed through the framework of
bifurcation theory, but the spatial patterning of vegetation, which is
characteristic of drylands, leads to dynamics that are much more complex and
diverse than local bifurcations. Recent methodological developments in Early
Warning Signal (EWS) detection have shown promise in identifying dynamical
signatures of oncoming critical transitions, with particularly strong
predictive capabilities being demonstrated by deep neural networks. However, a
machine learning model trained on synthetic examples is only useful if it can
effectively transfer to a test case of practical interest. These models'
capacity to generalize in this manner has been demonstrated for bifurcation
transitions, but it is not as well characterized for high-dimensional phase
transitions. This paper explores the successes and shortcomings of neural EWS
detection for spatially patterned phase transitions, and shows how these models
can be used to gain insight into where and how EWS-relevant information is
encoded in spatiotemporal dynamics. A few paradigmatic test systems are used to
illustrate how the capabilities of such models can be probed in a number of
ways, with particular attention to the performances of a number of proposed
statistical indicators for EWS and to the supplementary task of distinguishing
between abrupt and continuous transitions. Results reveal that model
performance often changes dramatically when training and test data sources are
interchanged, which offers new insight into the criteria for model
generalization.

Conclusion: 结论是该方法为复杂系统提供了一种低成本且鲁棒的相变检测替代方案，适用于更广泛的凝聚态和统计物理问题。

Abstract: We investigate the efficient learning of magnetic phases using artificial
neural networks trained on synthetic data, combining computational simplicity
with physics-informed strategies. Focusing on the diluted Ising model, which
lacks an exact analytical solution, we explore two complementary approaches: a
supervised classification using simple dense neural networks, and an
unsupervised detection of phase transitions using convolutional autoencoders
trained solely on idealized spin configurations.
  To enhance model performance, we incorporate two key forms of
physics-informed guidance. First, we exploit architectural biases which
preferentially amplify features related to symmetry breaking. Second, we
include training configurations that explicitly break $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry,
reinforcing the network's ability to detect ordered phases. These mechanisms,
acting in tandem, increase the network's sensitivity to phase structure even in
the absence of explicit labels. We validate the machine learning predictions
through comparison with direct numerical estimates of critical temperatures and
percolation thresholds.
  Our results show that synthetic, structured, and computationally efficient
training schemes can reveal physically meaningful phase boundaries, even in
complex systems. This framework offers a low-cost and robust alternative to
conventional methods, with potential applications in broader condensed matter
and statistical physics contexts.

Motivation: 纯组分物性预测对过程集成、多尺度建模和优化至关重要，现有方法需改进准确性和可解释性。

Method: 采用基于连接矩阵的分子表示方法生成特征，结合随机森林进行特征排序和池化，使用调整R2评估特征贡献，并应用人工神经网络和高斯过程回归模型进行预测。

Result: 测试集均方根误差降低达83.8%，特征池化将特征数从13316降至100，模型准确性未受影响。

Conclusion: 该框架可行，为混合物组分重构和过程集成建模提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of pure component physiochemical properties is crucial
for process integration, multiscale modeling, and optimization. In this work,
an enhanced framework for pure component property prediction by using
explainable machine learning methods is proposed. In this framework, the
molecular representation method based on the connectivity matrix effectively
considers atomic bonding relationships to automatically generate features. The
supervised machine learning model random forest is applied for feature ranking
and pooling. The adjusted R2 is introduced to penalize the inclusion of
additional features, providing an assessment of the true contribution of
features. The prediction results for normal boiling point (Tb), liquid molar
volume, critical temperature (Tc) and critical pressure (Pc) obtained using
Artificial Neural Network and Gaussian Process Regression models confirm the
accuracy of the molecular representation method. Comparison with GC based
models shows that the root-mean-square error on the test set can be reduced by
up to 83.8%. To enhance the interpretability of the model, a feature analysis
method based on Shapley values is employed to determine the contribution of
each feature to the property predictions. The results indicate that using the
feature pooling method reduces the number of features from 13316 to 100 without
compromising model accuracy. The feature analysis results for Tb, Tc, and Pc
confirms that different molecular properties are influenced by different
structural features, aligning with mechanistic interpretations. In conclusion,
the proposed framework is demonstrated to be feasible and provides a solid
foundation for mixture component reconstruction and process integration
modelling.

Abstract: The management of chronic Heart Failure (HF) presents significant challenges
in modern healthcare, requiring continuous monitoring, early detection of
exacerbations, and personalized treatment strategies. In this paper, we present
a predictive model founded on Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify
patients at HF risk. This model is an ensemble learning approach, a modified
stacking technique, that uses two specialized models leveraging clinical and
echocardiographic features and then a meta-model to combine the predictions of
these two models. We initially assess the model on a real dataset and the
obtained results suggest that it performs well in the stratification of
patients at HR risk. Specifically, we obtained high sensitivity (95\%),
ensuring that nearly all high-risk patients are identified. As for accuracy, we
obtained 84\%, which can be considered moderate in some ML contexts. However,
it is acceptable given our priority of identifying patients at risk of HF
because they will be asked to participate in the telemonitoring program of the
PrediHealth research project on which some of the authors of this paper are
working. The initial findings also suggest that ML-based risk stratification
models can serve as valuable decision-support tools not only in the PrediHealth
project but also for healthcare professionals, aiding in early intervention and
personalized patient management. To have a better understanding of the value
and of potentiality of our predictive model, we also contrasted its results
with those obtained by using three baseline models. The preliminary results
indicate that our predictive model outperforms these baselines that flatly
consider features, \ie not grouping them in clinical and echocardiographic
features.

Conclusion: 未来需开发安全、可靠且符合伦理的GenAI系统，以支持灾害管理。本文是首个全面综述GenAI在灾害评估领域应用的文献。

Abstract: Natural disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires and cyclones, bear a huge
risk on human lives as well as infrastructure assets. An effective response to
disaster depends on the ability to rapidly and efficiently assess the intensity
of damage. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) presents a breakthrough solution, capable of combining knowledge from
multiple types and sources of data, simulating realistic scenarios of disaster,
and identifying emerging trends at a speed previously unimaginable. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive review on the prospects of AI and GenAI in
damage assessment for various natural disasters, highlighting both its
strengths and limitations. We talk about its application to multimodal data
such as text, image, video, and audio, and also cover major issues of data
privacy, security, and ethical use of the technology during crises. The paper
also recognizes the threat of Generative AI misuse, in the form of
dissemination of misinformation and for adversarial attacks. Finally, we
outline avenues of future research, emphasizing the need for secure, reliable,
and ethical Generative AI systems for disaster management in general. We
believe that this work represents the first comprehensive survey of Gen-AI
techniques being used in the field of Disaster Assessment and Response.

Result: 提出“健康的不信任”作为尊重人类自主权的AI使用关键部分。

Conclusion: 合理的不信任是构建真正信任的必要条件，尤其在AI可能被滥用的社会背景下。

Abstract: Under the slogan of trustworthy AI, much of contemporary AI research is
focused on designing AI systems and usage practices that inspire human trust
and, thus, enhance adoption of AI systems. However, a person affected by an AI
system may not be convinced by AI system design alone -- neither should they,
if the AI system is embedded in a social context that gives good reason to
believe that it is used in tension with a person's interest. In such cases,
distrust in the system may be justified and necessary to build meaningful trust
in the first place. We propose the term "healthy distrust" to describe such a
justified, careful stance towards certain AI usage practices. We investigate
prior notions of trust and distrust in computer science, sociology, history,
psychology, and philosophy, outline a remaining gap that healthy distrust might
fill and conceptualize healthy distrust as a crucial part for AI usage that
respects human autonomy.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the issue of inconsistency handling in DatalogMTL,
an extension of Datalog with metric temporal operators. Since facts are
associated with time intervals, there are different manners to restore
consistency when they contradict the rules, such as removing facts or modifying
their time intervals. Our first contribution is the definition of relevant
notions of conflicts (minimal explanations for inconsistency) and repairs
(possible ways of restoring consistency) for this setting and the study of the
properties of these notions and the associated inconsistency-tolerant
semantics. Our second contribution is a data complexity analysis of the tasks
of generating a single conflict / repair and query entailment under

Motivation: 3DGS在VR中面临时间伪影、投影失真和帧率下降等问题，这些问题在头戴显示器中尤为突出。

Method: 结合Mini-Splatting、StopThePop和Optimal Projection技术，改进3DGS光栅化器，提出高效的中心凹光栅化器，并优化高斯参数。

Result: 用户研究表明VRSplat优于其他配置，能够消除伪影和浮动物体，实现72+ FPS。

Conclusion: VRSplat是首个系统评估的3DGS方法，支持现代VR应用。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly become a leading technique for
novel-view synthesis, providing exceptional performance through efficient
software-based GPU rasterization. Its versatility enables real-time
applications, including on mobile and lower-powered devices. However, 3DGS
faces key challenges in virtual reality (VR): (1) temporal artifacts, such as
popping during head movements, (2) projection-based distortions that result in
disturbing and view-inconsistent floaters, and (3) reduced framerates when
rendering large numbers of Gaussians, falling below the critical threshold for
VR. Compared to desktop environments, these issues are drastically amplified by
large field-of-view, constant head movements, and high resolution of
head-mounted displays (HMDs). In this work, we introduce VRSplat: we combine
and extend several recent advancements in 3DGS to address challenges of VR
holistically. We show how the ideas of Mini-Splatting, StopThePop, and Optimal
Projection can complement each other, by modifying the individual techniques
and core 3DGS rasterizer. Additionally, we propose an efficient foveated
rasterizer that handles focus and peripheral areas in a single GPU launch,
avoiding redundant computations and improving GPU utilization. Our method also
incorporates a fine-tuning step that optimizes Gaussian parameters based on
StopThePop depth evaluations and Optimal Projection. We validate our method
through a controlled user study with 25 participants, showing a strong
preference for VRSplat over other configurations of Mini-Splatting. VRSplat is
the first, systematically evaluated 3DGS approach capable of supporting modern
VR applications, achieving 72+ FPS while eliminating popping and
stereo-disrupting floaters.

Motivation: 现有文本到矢量（T2V）生成方法缺乏风格定制能力，难以生成视觉一致且美观的矢量图形集合。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）训练路径级表示的T2V扩散模型确保结构一致性；2）通过蒸馏定制T2I模型实现风格定制。

Result: 实验验证了该方法能高效生成高质量、多样化的定制风格SVG。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段方法有效解决了风格定制与结构一致性的平衡问题，为矢量图形生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their
resolution independence and well-organized layer structure. Although existing
text-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they
often overlook an important need in practical applications: style
customization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics
with consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics. Extending existing
T2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges.
Optimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I)
models for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity.
On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity,
yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to
limited SVG training data.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization
pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward
T2V models and T2I image priors. In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion
model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of
SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities. In the second stage, we
customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized
T2I models. By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate
high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an
efficient feed-forward manner. The effectiveness of our method has been
validated through extensive experiments. The project page is

Abstract: Effective education in radiotherapy plan quality review requires a robust,
regularly updated set of examples and the flexibility to demonstrate multiple
possible planning approaches and their consequences. However, the current
clinic-based paradigm does not support these needs. To address this, we have
developed 'Virtual Dosimetrist' models that can both generate training examples
of suboptimal treatment plans and then allow trainees to improve the plan
quality through simple natural language prompts, as if communicating with a
dosimetrist. The dose generation and modification process is accurate, rapid,
and requires only modest resources. This work is the first to combine dose
distribution prediction with natural language processing; providing a robust
pipeline for both generating suboptimal training plans and allowing trainees to
practice their critical plan review and improvement skills that addresses the
challenges of the current clinic-based paradigm.

Conclusion: DeAgents在去中心化与可靠性之间存在矛盾，需进一步探索治理方案。

Abstract: The recent trend of self-sovereign Decentralized AI Agents (DeAgents)
combines Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI agents with decentralization
technologies such as blockchain smart contracts and trusted execution
environments (TEEs). These tamper-resistant trustless substrates allow agents
to achieve self-sovereignty through ownership of cryptowallet private keys and
control of digital assets and social media accounts. DeAgent eliminates
centralized control and reduces human intervention, addressing key trust
concerns inherent in centralized AI systems. However, given ongoing challenges
in LLM reliability such as hallucinations, this creates paradoxical tension
between trustlessness and unreliable autonomy. This study addresses this
empirical research gap through interviews with DeAgents stakeholders-experts,
founders, and developers-to examine their motivations, benefits, and governance
dilemmas. The findings will guide future DeAgents system and protocol design
and inform discussions about governance in sociotechnical AI systems in the

TLDR: 论文介绍了一种名为Reviewer的3D视觉界面，用于改善肌电假肢的模式识别控制，通过实时反馈提升用户与解码器的互动效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肌电假肢的模式识别系统在复杂动作下难以区分EMG信号，用户需通过试错调整解码器边界，效率低下。

Method: 研究通过10次实验，比较了使用Reviewer与传统虚拟手臂可视化训练的效果，评估了任务完成率、路径效率等指标。

Result: 使用Reviewer的组在任务完成率、路径效率和吞吐量上表现更优，减少了过冲现象。

Conclusion: Reviewer通过实时反馈和结构化训练显著提升了新手操作者的模式识别控制能力，减少了对试错调整的依赖。

Abstract: State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern
recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyography (EMG) signals
into desired movements. As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users
often struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable
classification. Existing training typically involves heuristic, trial-and-error
user adjustments to static decoder boundaries. Goal: We introduce the Reviewer,
a 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's
classification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm
behavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual,
data-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder
boundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants
compared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the
Reviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was
assessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and
the control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer
achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path
efficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group.
Significance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training,
facilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control
improvements. By iteratively refining control through real-time feedback, this
approach reduces reliance on trial-and-error recalibration, enabling a more
adaptive, self-correcting training framework. Conclusion: The 3D visual
feedback significantly improves PR control in novice operators through
structured training, enabling feedback-driven adaptation and reducing reliance
on extensive heuristic adjustments.

Abstract: In the realm of Human Activity Recognition (HAR), obtaining high quality and
variance data is still a persistent challenge due to high costs and the
inherent variability of real-world activities. This study introduces a
generation dataset by deep learning approaches (Attention Autoencoder and
conditional Generative Adversarial Networks). Another problem that data
heterogeneity is a critical challenge, one of the solutions is to shuffle the
data to homogenize the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the
random sequence strategy significantly improves classification performance,
achieving an accuracy of up to 0.70 $\pm$ 0.03 and a macro F1 score of 0.64
$\pm$ 0.01. For that, disrupting temporal dependencies through random sequence
reordering compels the model to focus on instantaneous recognition, thereby
improving robustness against activity transitions. This approach not only
broadens the effective training dataset but also offers promising avenues for
enhancing HAR systems in complex, real-world scenarios.

TLDR: 论文探讨了在跨职能团队中，如何通过AI LEGO工具解决技术与非技术角色间知识传递的挑战，以更早识别AI设计中的潜在危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨职能团队中，技术与非技术角色间的知识传递困难阻碍了早期AI设计的伦理评估和危害识别。

Method: 通过文献综述和与8位从业者的共同设计研究，开发了AI LEGO工具，支持技术角色通过交互式模块传递设计意图，非技术角色通过检查表和LLM模拟识别危害。

Conclusion: AI LEGO的模块化结构和角色模拟使危害识别更易进行，促进了早期设计中更清晰和协作的负责任AI实践。

Abstract: Responsible AI (RAI) efforts increasingly emphasize the importance of
addressing potential harms early in the AI development lifecycle through
social-technical lenses. However, in cross-functional industry teams, this work
is often stalled by a persistent knowledge handoff challenge: the difficulty of
transferring high-level, early-stage technical design rationales from technical
experts to non-technical or user-facing roles for ethical evaluation and harm
identification. Through literature review and a co-design study with 8
practitioners, we unpack how this challenge manifests -- technical design
choices are rarely handed off in ways that support meaningful engagement by
non-technical roles; collaborative workflows lack shared, visual structures to
support mutual understanding; and non-technical practitioners are left without
scaffolds for systematic harm evaluation. Existing tools like JIRA or Google
Docs, while useful for product tracking, are ill-suited for supporting joint
harm identification across roles, often requiring significant extra effort to
align understanding. To address this, we developed AI LEGO, a web-based
prototype that supports cross-functional AI practitioners in effectively
facilitating knowledge handoff and identifying harmful design choices in the
early design stages. Technical roles use interactive blocks to draft
development plans, while non-technical roles engage with those blocks through
stage-specific checklists and LLM-driven persona simulations to surface
potential harms. In a study with 18 cross-functional practitioners, AI LEGO
increased the volume and likelihood of harms identified compared to baseline
worksheets. Participants found that its modular structure and persona prompts
made harm identification more accessible, fostering clearer and more
collaborative RAI practices in early design.

### [302] [LanTu: Dynamics-Enhanced Deep Learning for Eddy-Resolving Ocean Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10191)

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TLDR: LanTu是一种基于动力学增强深度学习的区域涡旋分辨率海洋预报系统，通过多尺度物理约束优化，显著提升了中尺度涡旋预报能力，优于现有数值和AI预报系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中尺度涡旋对全球海洋能量级联有重要影响，但传统数值模型在预报中面临科学挑战和高计算成本，AI预报系统需解决复杂多尺度特征的挑战。

Method: 开发LanTu系统，结合跨尺度相互作用和多尺度物理约束，利用涡旋动力学知识优化模型。

Result: LanTu在温度、盐度、海平面异常和流场预报上优于现有数值和AI系统，预报时效超过10天。

Conclusion: 动力学增强深度学习（LanTu）为中尺度涡旋预报提供了强大范例。

Abstract: Mesoscale eddies dominate the spatiotemporal multiscale variability of the
ocean, and their impact on the energy cascade of the global ocean cannot be
ignored. Eddy-resolving ocean forecasting is providing more reliable protection
for fisheries and navigational safety, but also presents significant scientific
challenges and high computational costs for traditional numerical models.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather and ocean forecasting systems are
becoming powerful tools that balance forecast performance with computational
efficiency. However, the complex multiscale features in the ocean dynamical
system make AI models still face many challenges in mesoscale eddy forecasting
(especially regional modelling). Here, we develop LanTu, a regional
eddy-resolving ocean forecasting system based on dynamics-enhanced deep
learning. We incorporate cross-scale interactions into LanTu and construct
multiscale physical constraint for optimising LanTu guided by knowledge of eddy
dynamics in order to improve the forecasting skill of LanTu for mesoscale
evolution. The results show that LanTu outperforms the existing advanced
operational numerical ocean forecasting system (NOFS) and AI-based ocean
forecasting system (AI-OFS) in temperature, salinity, sea level anomaly and
current prediction, with a lead time of more than 10 days. Our study highlights
that dynamics-enhanced deep learning (LanTu) can be a powerful paradigm for
eddy-resolving ocean forecasting.

Abstract: We describe an algorithm for sampling a low-rank random matrix $Q$ that best
approximates a fixed target matrix $P\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times m}$ in the
following sense: $Q$ is unbiased, i.e., $\mathbb{E}[Q] = P$;
$\mathsf{rank}(Q)\leq r$; and $Q$ minimizes the expected Frobenius norm error
$\mathbb{E}\|P-Q\|_F^2$. Our algorithm mirrors the solution to the efficient
unbiased sparsification problem for vectors, except applied to the singular
components of the matrix $P$. Optimality is proven by showing that our
algorithm matches the error from an existing lower bound.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种风险感知的安全强化学习（RL）控制设计，用于随机离散时间线性系统，通过结合RL控制器和安全控制器，实现高效且安全的学习控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖安全验证器对RL控制器进行短视干预，可能导致收敛到不希望的平衡点。本文旨在通过联合学习RL和安全控制器，避免这些问题，并提供高置信度的安全保障。

Method: 采用分段仿射控制器代替线性控制器，通过数据、决策变量和噪声表示闭环系统，优化决策变量以最小化安全违规概率，并引入数据驱动的插值技术整合RL和安全控制器。

Result: 该方法减少了数据需求，降低了安全违规的方差，并通过仿真验证了理论结果的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的风险感知安全RL控制设计在保证安全性的同时，提高了控制效率，适用于噪声环境下的优化控制。

Abstract: This paper presents a risk-aware safe reinforcement learning (RL) control
design for stochastic discrete-time linear systems. Rather than using a safety
certifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe
controller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe
controllers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this
approach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a
high-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic
interventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by
deciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly
efficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing
over a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To
learn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers
are learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system
is first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The
effect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the
closed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such
that the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is
minimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data
requirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations. Finally, to
integrate the safe and RL controllers, a new data-driven interpolation
technique is introduced. This method aims to maintain the RL agent's optimal
implementation while ensuring its safety within environments characterized by
noise. The study concludes with a simulation example that serves to validate
the theoretical results.

Abstract: Obtaining accurate probabilistic energy forecasts and making effective
decisions amid diverse uncertainties are routine challenges in future energy
systems. This paper presents the solution of team GEB, which ranked 3rd in
trading, 4th in forecasting, and 1st among student teams in the IEEE Hybrid

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于dApps和LibIQ库的实时RF频谱分类方法，解决了O-RAN架构中数据交换延迟和隐私限制的问题，实现了高效信号分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN架构中RICs存在数据交换延迟和隐私限制，阻碍了实时监控和信号分类等应用。

Method: 利用LibIQ库处理I/Q样本，通过CNN分类信号，并在5G部署和OTA测试床上验证。

Result: 模型在实时分析中平均准确率达到97.8%。

Conclusion: LibIQ和数据集将公开，为实时频谱分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The O-RAN architecture is transforming cellular networks by adopting RAN
softwarization and disaggregation concepts to enable data-driven monitoring and
control of the network. Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate
near-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps.
However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange
between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to
access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use
cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage
the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a
novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and
signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as
time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and
spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to
detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN
inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an
extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct
signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the
Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by
deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies,
time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model
classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of
approximately 97.8\% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We
pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available
framework upon acceptance.

Motivation: 理解受灾人群在野火危机中的感知和反应，以支持及时且富有同情心的灾害响应。

Method: 收集385篇帖子和114,879条评论，采用主题建模方法（结合LLMs和HITL）和分层框架（SA和CN）分析。

Result: SA类别与火灾进展高度相关，CN中60%为悲伤信号，40%为心理健康风险。

Conclusion: 研究提供了首个标注社交媒体数据集，并提出了可扩展的多层框架，为灾害响应和公共卫生策略提供参考。

Abstract: Wildfires have become increasingly frequent, irregular, and severe in recent
years. Understanding how affected populations perceive and respond during
wildfire crises is critical for timely and empathetic disaster response. Social
media platforms offer a crowd-sourced channel to capture evolving public
discourse, providing hyperlocal information and insight into public sentiment.
This study analyzes Reddit discourse during the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires,
spanning from the onset of the disaster to full containment. We collect 385
posts and 114,879 comments related to the Palisades and Eaton fires. We adopt
topic modeling methods to identify the latent topics, enhanced by large
language models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop (HITL) refinement. Furthermore, we
develop a hierarchical framework to categorize latent topics, consisting of two
main categories, Situational Awareness (SA) and Crisis Narratives (CN). The
volume of SA category closely aligns with real-world fire progressions, peaking
within the first 2-5 days as the fires reach the maximum extent. The most
frequent co-occurring category set of public health and safety, loss and
damage, and emergency resources expands on a wide range of health-related
latent topics, including environmental health, occupational health, and one
health. Grief signals and mental health risks consistently accounted for 60
percentage and 40 percentage of CN instances, respectively, with the highest
total volume occurring at night. This study contributes the first annotated
social media dataset on the 2025 LA fires, and introduces a scalable
multi-layer framework that leverages topic modeling for crisis discourse
analysis. By identifying persistent public health concerns, our results can
inform more empathetic and adaptive strategies for disaster response, public
health communication, and future research in comparable climate-related
disaster events.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCN方法在最大化模块化时易陷入次优解，且直接使用人类标注社区可能破坏拓扑连贯性。

Method: 提出TAS-Com方法，引入新损失函数，利用Leiden算法优化模块化和社区连通性。

Result: 在多个基准网络上，TAS-Com显著优于现有算法。

Conclusion: TAS-Com在模块化和人类标注社区之间实现了理想平衡，具有优越性能。

Abstract: Community detection, a vital technology for real-world applications, uncovers
cohesive node groups (communities) by leveraging both topological and attribute
similarities in social networks. However, existing Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) trained to maximize modularity often converge to suboptimal solutions.
Additionally, directly using human-labeled communities for training can
undermine topological cohesiveness by grouping disconnected nodes based solely
on node attributes. We address these issues by proposing a novel Topological
and Attributive Similarity-based Community detection (TAS-Com) method. TAS-Com
introduces a novel loss function that exploits the highly effective and
scalable Leiden algorithm to detect community structures with global optimal
modularity. Leiden is further utilized to refine human-labeled communities to
ensure connectivity within each community, enabling TAS-Com to detect community
structures with desirable trade-offs between modularity and compliance with
human labels. Experimental results on multiple benchmark networks confirm that
TAS-Com can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art algorithms.
