### [1] [Winter Soldier: Backdooring Language Models at Pre-Training with Indirect Data Poisoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14913)
*Wassim Bouaziz,Mathurin Videau,Nicolas Usunier,El-Mahdi El-Mhamdi*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种间接数据投毒方法，通过梯度优化提示调优让语言模型学习秘密序列，从而保护数据集并追踪其使用，且不影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）预训练依赖多样且难以管理的数据源，现有方法依赖训练数据的记忆性，但模型提供者试图限制这种记忆。本文旨在探索一种不依赖记忆性的数据追踪方法。

Method: 采用梯度优化提示调优技术，让模型学习训练数据中不存在的秘密序列（秘密提示和秘密响应）。

Result: 实验表明，仅需少于0.005%的投毒标记即可让模型学习秘密，并以极高置信度（p < 10^-55）检测到其使用，且不影响模型基准性能。

Conclusion: 间接数据投毒是可行且有效的，能在不依赖训练数据记忆性的情况下保护数据集并追踪其使用。

Abstract: The pre-training of large language models (LLMs) relies on massive text
datasets sourced from diverse and difficult-to-curate origins. Although
membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace
data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM
providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data
poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not
only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its
use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn
arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent
from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models
pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are
sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely
high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme.
Crucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and
despite secrets never appearing in the training set.

### [2] [Fair Data Exchange with Constant-Time Proofs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14944)
*Majid Khabbazian*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种改进的Fair Data Exchange (FDE)协议，通过将文件视为Reed-Solomon码字并加密，显著降低了证明和验证的计算开销，同时保持了公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FDE协议的证明和验证时间随文件长度线性增长，效率较低。

Method: 将文件视为Reed-Solomon码字，扩展为低速率码并加密，仅验证随机子集的正确性。

Result: 显著降低了计算开销，同时保持了公平性，仅增加可调通信冗余。

Conclusion: 改进协议高效且公平，适用于比特币链下交易，仅在必要时回退到链上。

Abstract: The Fair Data Exchange (FDE) protocol introduced at CCS 2024 offers atomic
pay-per-file transfers with constant-size proofs, but its prover and verifier
runtimes still scale linearly with the file length n. We collapse these costs
to essentially constant by viewing the file as a rate-1 Reed-Solomon (RS)
codeword, extending it to a lower-rate RS code with constant redundancy,
encrypting this extended vector, and then proving correctness for only a small
random subset of the resulting ciphertexts; RS decoding repairs any corrupted
symbols with negligible failure probability. Our protocol preserves full
client- and server-fairness, and adds only a tunable communication redundancy
overhead.
  Finally, we patch the elliptic-curve mismatch in the Bitcoin instantiation of
FDE with a compact zk-SNARK, enabling the entire exchange to run off-chain and
falling back to just two on-chain transactions when channels are unavailable.

### [3] [Narrowing the Gap between TEEs Threat Model and Deployment Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14964)
*Filip Rezabek,Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach,Moe Mahhouk,Frieder Erdmann,Andrew Miller*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文探讨了机密虚拟机（CVM）在物理保护和侧信道攻击方面的不足，提出扩展TEE认证以绑定CVM与提供商，并讨论了TEE认证的加固和扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CVM的威胁模型未涵盖物理保护和侧信道攻击，用户无法准确评估物理攻击风险，依赖可信云提供商存在局限性。

Method: 提出利用受保护平台标识符（PPID）扩展TEE认证，将CVM与提供商绑定，并讨论TEE认证的加固和扩展。

Result: 现有TEE认证未提供CVM运行环境信息，导致用户无法独立评估风险，需改进认证机制。

Conclusion: 需扩展TEE认证以增强CVM的安全性，解决依赖可信第三方的问题，推动CVM的广泛应用。

Abstract: Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) provide isolation guarantees for data in
use, but their threat model does not include physical level protection and
side-channel attacks. Therefore, current deployments rely on trusted cloud
providers to host the CVMs' underlying infrastructure. However, TEE
attestations do not provide information about the operator hosting a CVM.
Without knowing whether a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) runs within a
provider's infrastructure, a user cannot accurately assess the risks of
physical attacks. We observe a misalignment in the threat model where the
workloads are protected against other tenants but do not offer end-to-end
security assurances to external users without relying on cloud providers. The
attestation should be extended to bind the CVM with the provider. A possible
solution can rely on the Protected Platform Identifier (PPID), a unique CPU
identifier. However, the implementation details of various TEE manufacturers,
attestation flows, and providers vary. This makes verification of attestations,
ease of migration, and building applications without relying on a trusted party
challenging, highlighting a key limitation that must be addressed for the
adoption of CVMs. We discuss two points focusing on hardening and extensions of
TEEs' attestation.

### [4] [Private Continual Counting of Unbounded Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15018)
*Ben Jacobsen,Kassem Fawaz*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文研究了在输入规模未知的情况下，差分隐私连续计数问题，提出了一种基于对数扰动的矩阵分解方法，实现了平滑误差和高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于矩阵机制的最优算法需要预先知道输入规模，而常见的‘倍增技巧’会导致次优和非平滑误差，因此需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 引入基于对数扰动的矩阵分解方法，利用函数$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$的变形，设计了一种新算法。

Result: 算法实现了平滑误差，方差为$O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$，空间复杂度$O(t)$，每轮时间$O(\log t)$，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新算法在理论和实际性能上均优于现有方法，适用于输入规模未知的场景。

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the
unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current
state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix
mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only
hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick'
avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve
this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic
perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works,
which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error,
and for any $\alpha > 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum
of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$ variance. It
requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to
$O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing
time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA
2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable
to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for
$t$ as large as $2^{24}$.

Result: 提出了一套工具和技术，帮助制造商将网络安全作为核心设计原则。

Conclusion: 通过早期风险评估和工具支持，确保AI/ML医疗设备的安全性。

Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming
healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this
advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of
complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability
with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities
in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack
surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging.
Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on
these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant
safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices
from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of
addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the
pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device
recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat
landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient
safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques
designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive
premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed
cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices,
thereby making them safe for patients.

*Rasha Karakchi,Rye Stahle-Smith,Nishant Chinnasami,Tiffany Yu*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: SPiME是一种轻量级、可扩展且兼容FPGA的安全处理器内存加密架构，集成了AES-128，适用于边缘计算和嵌入式加密系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网应用对高效、高吞吐量和节能的边缘数据处理需求增加，传统CPU加密方法在延迟敏感和资源受限环境中存在性能瓶颈。

Method: SPiME采用模块化并行PiM单元阵列，每个单元结合AES核心和最小控制单元，实现分布式就地加密。

Result: 在高端FPGA上，SPiME可扩展至4000多个并行单元，资源利用率低于5%，提供超过25Gbps的持续加密吞吐量。

Conclusion: SPiME的设计具有便携性、可配置性和资源高效性，是安全边缘计算和硬件加速器的理想解决方案。

Abstract: The exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has
intensified the demand for efficient, high-throughput, and energy-efficient
data processing at the edge. Conventional CPU-centric encryption methods suffer
from performance bottlenecks and excessive data movement, especially in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
present SPiME, a lightweight, scalable, and FPGA-compatible Secure
Processor-in-Memory Encryption architecture that integrates the Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES-128) directly into a Processing-in-Memory (PiM)
framework. SPiME is designed as a modular array of parallel PiM units, each
combining an AES core with a minimal control unit to enable distributed
in-place encryption with minimal overhead. The architecture is fully
implemented in Verilog and tested on multiple AMD UltraScale and UltraScale+
FPGAs. Evaluation results show that SPiME can scale beyond 4,000 parallel units
while maintaining less than 5\% utilization of key FPGA resources on high-end
devices. It delivers over 25~Gbps in sustained encryption throughput with
predictable, low-latency performance. The design's portability,
configurability, and resource efficiency make it a compelling solution for
secure edge computing, embedded cryptographic systems, and customizable
hardware accelerators.

### [9] [CWGAN-GP Augmented CAE for Jamming Detection in 5G-NR in Non-IID Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15075)
*Samhita Kuili,Mohammadreza Amini,Burak Kantarci*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于卷积自编码器（CAE）的5G-NR无线蜂窝网络中的干扰检测方法，通过生成对抗网络（CWGAN-GP）平衡数据集，并在异构I/Q数据集上验证了其优于基准模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G-NR网络中干扰攻击普遍，影响信号质量，需要高效检测方法。

Method: 利用卷积自编码器（CAE）检测干扰，结合CWGAN-GP平衡数据集，并与CDAE和CSAE模型对比。

Result: CAE在干扰检测中表现优异，平均精度97.33%，召回率91.33%，F1分数94.08%，准确率94.35%。

Conclusion: CAE在复杂异构数据中表现出鲁棒性，优于其他基准模型。

Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks,
over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising
the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by
incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase
and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is
exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as
heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization
Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance.
Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by
employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB
observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of
the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models:
Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder
(CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all
datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal
by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08%
F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.

### [10] [Flexible Hardware-Enabled Guarantees for AI Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15093)
*James Petrie,Onni Aarne,Nora Ammann,David Dalrymple*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为flexHEGs的硬件保障系统，旨在解决AI发展中的国际安全与隐私问题，通过可审计的处理器和安全外壳实现可信验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统日益强大，其对国际安全的威胁增加，现有治理方法难以在不泄露敏感信息或国家安全的情况下解决问题。

Method: flexHEGs由可审计的保障处理器和安全外壳组成，支持开源、可更新的验证功能，用于监控AI加速器使用。

Result: flexHEGs支持隐私保护模型评估、受控部署、训练计算限制和自动安全协议执行等多种治理机制。

Conclusion: 尽管技术挑战大，flexHEGs为解决前沿AI发展中的监管和国际安全问题提供了一种可行方案。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly powerful, they pose
growing risks to international security, creating urgent coordination
challenges that current governance approaches struggle to address without
compromising sensitive information or national security. We propose flexible
hardware-enabled guarantees (flexHEGs), that could be integrated with AI
accelerators to enable trustworthy, privacy-preserving verification and
enforcement of claims about AI development. FlexHEGs consist of an auditable
guarantee processor that monitors accelerator usage and a secure enclosure
providing physical tamper protection. The system would be fully open source
with flexible, updateable verification capabilities. FlexHEGs could enable
diverse governance mechanisms including privacy-preserving model evaluations,
controlled deployment, compute limits for training, and automated safety
protocol enforcement. In this first part of a three part series, we provide a
comprehensive introduction of the flexHEG system, including an overview of the
governance and security capabilities it offers, its potential development and
adoption paths, and the remaining challenges and limitations it faces. While
technically challenging, flexHEGs offer an approach to address emerging
regulatory and international security challenges in frontier AI development.

### [11] [International Security Applications of Flexible Hardware-Enabled Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15100)
*Onni Aarne,James Petrie*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: flexHEGs（灵活硬件保障）通过标准化设计和国际治理框架，为AI安全提供技术基础，解决恶意使用、失控风险等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力快速进步，国际安全面临新挑战，需通过硬件保障和治理框架确保AI的可信使用。

Method: 分析四种国际安全应用场景，提出两种治理模型（验证型和规则型），并通过博弈论验证稳定性。

Result: 全面flexHEG协议在合理假设下能保持稳定，但需解决技术门槛和现有硬件管理等挑战。

Conclusion: flexHEGs为管理AI风险提供技术基础，但需国际协调以应对新兴威胁。

Abstract: As AI capabilities advance rapidly, flexible hardware-enabled guarantees
(flexHEGs) offer opportunities to address international security challenges
through comprehensive governance frameworks. This report examines how flexHEGs
could enable internationally trustworthy AI governance by establishing
standardized designs, robust ecosystem defenses, and clear operational
parameters for AI-relevant chips. We analyze four critical international
security applications: limiting proliferation to address malicious use,
implementing safety norms to prevent loss of control, managing risks from
military AI systems, and supporting strategic stability through
balance-of-power mechanisms while respecting national sovereignty. The report
explores both targeted deployments for specific high-risk facilities and
comprehensive deployments covering all AI-relevant compute. We examine two
primary governance models: verification-based agreements that enable
transparent compliance monitoring, and ruleset-based agreements that
automatically enforce international rules through cryptographically-signed
updates. Through game-theoretic analysis, we demonstrate that comprehensive
flexHEG agreements could remain stable under reasonable assumptions about state
preferences and catastrophic risks. The report addresses critical
implementation challenges including technical thresholds for AI-relevant chips,
management of existing non-flexHEG hardware, and safeguards against abuse of
governance power. While requiring significant international coordination,
flexHEGs could provide a technical foundation for managing AI risks at the
scale and speed necessary to address emerging threats to international security
and stability.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving neural network training in vertically partitioned
scenarios is vital for secure collaborative modeling across institutions. This
paper presents \textbf{EVA-S2PMLP}, an Efficient, Verifiable, and Accurate
Secure Two-Party Multi-Layer Perceptron framework that introduces spatial-scale
optimization for enhanced privacy and performance. To enable reliable
computation under real-number domain, EVA-S2PMLP proposes a secure
transformation pipeline that maps scalar inputs to vector and matrix spaces
while preserving correctness. The framework includes a suite of atomic
protocols for linear and non-linear secure computations, with modular support
for secure activation, matrix-vector operations, and loss evaluation.
Theoretical analysis confirms the reliability, security, and asymptotic
complexity of each protocol. Extensive experiments show that EVA-S2PMLP
achieves high inference accuracy and significantly reduced communication
overhead, with up to $12.3\times$ improvement over baselines. Evaluation on
benchmark datasets demonstrates that the framework maintains model utility

privacy-preserving neural network training in finance, healthcare, and
cross-organizational AI applications.

*Xiangman Li,Xiaodong Wu,Jianbing Ni,Mohamed Mahmoud,Maazen Alsabaan*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: PDLRecover是一种高效恢复中毒全局模型的新方法，利用历史模型信息并保护隐私，避免完全重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法难以恢复已中毒的全局模型，而重新训练成本高且可能损害隐私和一致性。

Method: 通过近似Hessian矩阵计算的线性特性，应用秘密共享保护历史更新，结合客户端准备、周期性恢复更新和最终精确更新。

Result: 恢复的全局模型性能接近完全重新训练模型，计算和时间成本显著降低，同时保护本地模型参数隐私。

Conclusion: PDLRecover在恢复中毒模型时兼顾效率和隐私，为去中心化学习提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Decentralized learning is vulnerable to poison attacks, where malicious
clients manipulate local updates to degrade global model performance. Existing
defenses mainly detect and filter malicious models, aiming to prevent a limited
number of attackers from corrupting the global model. However, restoring an
already compromised global model remains a challenge. A direct approach is to
remove malicious clients and retrain the model using only the benign clients.
Yet, retraining is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and may
compromise model consistency and privacy.
  We propose PDLRecover, a novel method to recover a poisoned global model
efficiently by leveraging historical model information while preserving
privacy. The main challenge lies in protecting shared historical models while
enabling parameter estimation for model recovery. By exploiting the linearity
of approximate Hessian matrix computation, we apply secret sharing to protect
historical updates, ensuring local models are not leaked during transmission or
reconstruction. PDLRecover introduces client-side preparation, periodic
recovery updates, and a final exact update to ensure robustness and convergence
of the recovered model. Periodic updates maintain accurate curvature
information, and the final step ensures high-quality convergence. Experiments
show that the recovered global model achieves performance comparable to a fully
retrained model but with significantly reduced computation and time cost.
Moreover, PDLRecover effectively prevents leakage of local model parameters,
ensuring both accuracy and privacy in recovery.

*Ming Nie,Zhixiong Yang,Bingsheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: CipherMind利用大语言模型的确定性微调中间结果作为传输内容，实现通信加密。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的广泛应用激发了利用其推理过程进行通信加密的灵感。

Method: 利用大模型的语义参数（底层实现不透明、解释性弱）作为加密方法，适用于如网关内传输等场景。

Result: 该方法理论上可以基于任何大模型实现。

Conclusion: CipherMind为通信加密提供了一种新范式。

Abstract: In recent years, the widespread application of large language models has
inspired us to consider using inference for communication encryption. We
therefore propose CipherMind, which utilizes intermediate results from
deterministic fine-tuning of large model inferences as transmission content.
The semantic parameters of large models exhibit characteristics like opaque
underlying implementations and weak interpretability, thus enabling their use
as an encryption method for data transmission. This communication paradigm can
be applied in scenarios like intra-gateway transmission, and theoretically, it
can be implemented using any large model as its foundation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from single-modal systems
to multimodal LLMs and intelligent agents, significantly expanding their
capabilities while introducing increasingly severe security risks. This paper
presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and
corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first
trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting
the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize
mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility
perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack
methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we
organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach,
offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation.
Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as
insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a
clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of
experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address
these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline
future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation
framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance
the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of
more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more
capable LLMs.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种设施位置问题的改进版本，并在本地差分隐私（LDP）框架下进行分析，展示了一种LDP算法，实现了常数近似比和小加性因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在原始设施位置问题中，Gupta等人证明了差分隐私算法的近似比下界为Ω(√n)，后续工作采用了超集假设，但可能损害用户隐私。本文旨在证明这一下界不适用于改进版本。

Method: 提出了一种改进的设施位置问题模型，并设计了一种LDP算法，确保用户位置隐私的同时实现高效近似。

Result: 实验结果表明，该算法在合成和真实数据集上均优于直接方法。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在改进的设施位置问题中，LDP算法可以实现常数近似比，且无需依赖超集假设，保护了用户隐私。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an adaptation of the facility location problem
and analyze it within the framework of local differential privacy (LDP). Under
this model, we ensure the privacy of client presence at specific locations.
When n is the number of points, Gupta et al. established a lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ on the approximation ratio for any differentially private
algorithm applied to the original facility location problem. As a result,
subsequent works have adopted the super-set assumption, which may, however,
compromise user privacy. We show that this lower bound does not apply to our
adaptation by presenting an LDP algorithm that achieves a constant
approximation ratio with a relatively small additive factor. Additionally, we
provide experimental results demonstrating that our algorithm outperforms the
straightforward approach on both synthetically generated and real-world
datasets.

*Alessandro Palumbo,Ruben Salvador*

TLDR: 提出了一种基于硬件的方法，利用ECC在RISC-V微处理器上检测运行时硬件木马激活，实现100%检测率且无额外开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件木马（HTs）可能导致未经授权的软件执行或特权操作访问，威胁系统安全。

Method: 采用Hamming单错误校正（HSEC）架构的硬件安全检查器（HSC）检测恶意指令注入。

Result: 实验显示100%检测率，无假阳性或漏检，仅需72 LUTs、24 FFs和0.5 BRAM，无性能损失。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且低开销，适用于实时检测硬件木马。

Abstract: Software-exploitable Hardware Trojans (HTs) enable attackers to execute
unauthorized software or gain illicit access to privileged operations. This
manuscript introduces a hardware-based methodology for detecting runtime HT
activations using Error Correction Codes (ECCs) on a RISC-V microprocessor.
Specifically, it focuses on HTs that inject malicious instructions, disrupting
the normal execution flow by triggering unauthorized programs. To counter this
threat, the manuscript introduces a Hardware Security Checker (HSC) leveraging
Hamming Single Error Correction (HSEC) architectures for effective HT
detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves
a 100% detection rate for potential HT activations, with no false positives or
undetected attacks. The implementation incurs minimal overhead, requiring only
72 #LUTs, 24 #FFs, and 0.5 #BRAM while maintaining the microprocessor's
original operating frequency and introducing no additional time delay.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种通过侧信道攻击恢复FINN框架生成的数据流加速器硬件配置的方法，显著降低了计算开销，并在短时间内实现高精度参数恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据流神经网络加速器易受恶意攻击者通过侧信道攻击窃取知识产权，因此需要一种更高效的方法来评估其安全性。

Method: 采用无监督降维技术减少计算开销，结合轻量级分类器恢复折叠和量化参数，使用随机森林分类器分析侧信道轨迹。

Result: 攻击阶段仅需337毫秒恢复硬件参数（准确率>95%），421毫秒完全恢复参数（平均4次轨迹），计算效率显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在更现实的攻击场景中表现优异，计算效率提升显著，为硬件加速器的安全性评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dataflow neural network accelerators efficiently process AI tasks on FPGAs,
with deployment simplified by ready-to-use frameworks and pre-trained models.
However, this convenience makes them vulnerable to malicious actors seeking to
reverse engineer valuable Intellectual Property (IP) through Side-Channel
Attacks (SCA). This paper proposes a methodology to recover the hardware
configuration of dataflow accelerators generated with the FINN framework.
Through unsupervised dimensionality reduction, we reduce the computational
overhead compared to the state-of-the-art, enabling lightweight classifiers to
recover both folding and quantization parameters. We demonstrate an attack
phase requiring only 337 ms to recover the hardware parameters with an accuracy
of more than 95% and 421 ms to fully recover these parameters with an averaging
of 4 traces for a FINN-based accelerator running a CNN, both using a random
forest classifier on side-channel traces, even with the accelerator dataflow
fully loaded. This approach offers a more realistic attack scenario than
existing methods, and compared to SoA attacks based on tsfresh, our method
requires 940x and 110x less time for preparation and attack phases,
respectively, and gives better results even without averaging traces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Raz提取器因高计算复杂度（至少四次多项式时间）而不实用的问题。

Method: 提出改进的Raz提取器，具有准线性计算时间，并降低熵需求，提供分析和数值比较。

Result: 实现了高效的提取器，提供强和量子证明版本，并开源代码实现和参数计算模块。

Conclusion: 改进的提取器在计算效率和熵需求上优于原版，具有实用性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Randomness extractors are algorithms that distill weak random sources into
near-perfect random numbers. Two-source extractors enable this distillation
process by combining two independent weak random sources. Raz's extractor (STOC
'05) was the first to achieve this in a setting where one source has linear
min-entropy (i.e., proportional to its length), while the other has only
logarithmic min-entropy in its length. However, Raz's original construction is
impractical due to a polynomial computation time of at least degree 4. Our work
solves this problem by presenting an improved version of Raz's extractor with
quasi-linear computation time, as well as a new analytic theorem with reduced
entropy requirements. We provide comprehensive analytical and numerical
comparisons of our construction with others in the literature, and we derive
strong and quantum-proof versions of our efficient Raz extractor. Additionally,
we offer an easy-to-use, open-source code implementation of the extractor and a
numerical parameter calculation module.

*Georgios Androutsopoulos,Antonio Bianchi*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: deepSURF结合静态分析和LLM引导的模糊测试生成，有效检测Rust库中的内存安全漏洞，优于现有工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在检测Rust内存漏洞时能力有限，无法充分处理Rust特有类型或依赖人工干预。

Method: deepSURF通过替换泛型为自定义类型并动态生成模糊测试用例，结合LLM增强测试覆盖。

Result: 在27个Rust库中重新发现20个已知漏洞和6个新漏洞，表现优于现有工具。

Conclusion: deepSURF显著提升了Rust内存漏洞检测能力，为不安全代码提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of
unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused.
Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically
exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific
types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.
  To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates
static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness
generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust
libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel
approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and
generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the
fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library.
Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically,
facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly
increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We
evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20
known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities,
demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于多代理LLM的辩论框架PhishDebate，用于钓鱼网站检测，通过模块化设计和多代理协作提升准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钓鱼网站通过欺骗性结构和品牌冒充等手段逃避检测，现有单代理分类方法存在幻觉风险和缺乏可解释性。

Method: PhishDebate采用四个专业代理分别分析网页的URL结构、HTML组成、语义内容和品牌冒充，由协调者和最终法官进行结构化辩论。

Result: 在真实钓鱼数据集上，PhishDebate实现了98.2%的召回率和真阳性率，优于单代理和CoT基线。

Conclusion: PhishDebate通过模块化设计和多代理辩论，显著提升了钓鱼网站检测的准确性和可解释性，并具备灵活配置能力。

Abstract: Phishing websites continue to pose a significant cybersecurity threat, often
leveraging deceptive structures, brand impersonation, and social engineering
tactics to evade detection. While recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) have enabled improved phishing detection through contextual
understanding, most existing approaches rely on single-agent classification
facing the risks of hallucination and lack interpretability or robustness. To
address these limitations, we propose PhishDebate, a modular multi-agent
LLM-based debate framework for phishing website detection. PhishDebate employs
four specialized agents to independently analyze different textual aspects of a
webpage--URL structure, HTML composition, semantic content, and brand
impersonation--under the coordination of a Moderator and a final Judge. Through
structured debate and divergent thinking, the framework delivers more accurate
and interpretable decisions. Extensive evaluations on commercial LLMs
demonstrate that PhishDebate achieves 98.2% recall and 98.2% True Positive Rate
(TPR) on a real-world phishing dataset, and outperforms single-agent and Chain
of Thought (CoT) baselines. Additionally, its modular design allows agent-level
configurability, enabling adaptation to varying resource and application
requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策复杂且易受认知偏差和不完整信息影响，现有LLM的单次交互模式难以满足实际需求。

Method: 设计MedSyn框架，支持医生与LLM多步动态对话，互相挑战和补充观点。

Result: 实验表明开源LLM作为医生助手具有潜力。

Conclusion: 未来将通过真实医生交互进一步验证MedSyn的诊断准确性和患者效果。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,
interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike
static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in
diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种二维并行回火算法（2D-PT），通过引入惩罚强度的第二维度副本，解决了传统并行回火算法在约束优化问题中的混合速度慢和约束难以满足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习和优化中，Boltzmann概率分布的采样是关键，但传统Ising机实现常受软约束限制，影响效率。

Method: 提出2D-PT算法，通过增加惩罚强度的副本维度，确保约束满足并提升混合速度。

Result: 在图形稀疏化和Wishart实例中，2D-PT显著优于传统PT，混合速度更快且无需手动调整惩罚强度。

Conclusion: 2D-PT适用于约束Ising问题，可在现有Ising机上部署，为优化问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine
learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such
as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary
optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft
constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce
feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the
powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by
adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This
scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to
low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel
tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and
eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a
representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT
achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as
O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of
magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The
method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on
existing Ising machines.

Motivation: 解决小临床数据集中的稳定性和可解释性问题，同时提升预测性能。

Method: NetraAI结合收缩映射、信息几何和进化算法，通过伪时间嵌入和长程记忆探索高阶特征交互，并利用LLM Strategist作为元进化层指导发现。

Result: 在精神分裂症、抑郁和胰腺癌案例中，NetraAI将弱基线模型（AUC 0.50-0.68）提升为近乎完美的分类器。

Conclusion: NetraAI为临床发现提供了自适应、可解释的新一代AI方法，结合动态系统、信息几何和进化学习。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized
"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

Conclusion: ETS框架在开放词汇EEG到文本系统中展现出高性能潜力。

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel
testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have
traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to
challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction
model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters.
It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as
dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or
learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy
systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution
as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning
methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and
onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights
of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally
executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this
approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)
domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target
domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task
adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the
influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies
varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully
demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data
distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy
data is concluded to be not as effective.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为PIPE的轻量级方法，通过物理信息位置编码将物理信息嵌入视觉语言模型，显著提升了多模态对齐和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注文本数据，忽略了视觉数据中的物理信息（如卫星图像的时间和地理空间上下文），导致模型难以有效捕捉这些信息。

Method: PIPE包含两个创新点：(1) 物理信息位置索引方案，将物理信息映射到位置ID；(2) 变频率位置编码机制，编码物理变量频率和序列顺序。

Result: 在最大开源卫星图像数据集上，PIPE在深度学习和气候领域方法中均达到最先进性能，台风强度预测比之前工作提升了12%。

Conclusion: PIPE通过嵌入物理信息，显著提升了多模态时间序列预测的准确性，尤其在捕捉视觉数据的物理信息方面表现突出。

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly

TLDR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的框架，用于解决多深度存储系统中异构物品配置的检索问题，通过图神经网络和Transformer模型优化检索延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速配送服务的需求增长要求存储系统高效且高密度，但多深度存储系统在检索时面临通道堵塞问题，传统方法限制了系统的灵活性。

Method: 设计了结合图神经网络（GNN）和Transformer的神经网络架构，GNN编码拓扑和物品信息，Transformer生成全局优先级分配。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在优化检索延迟方面优于启发式方法，且适用于多种布局的存储系统。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了多深度存储系统的检索问题，具有广泛适用性和优越性能。

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

TLDR: AZT1D是一个高质量的真实世界数据集，包含25名使用自动胰岛素输送系统的1型糖尿病患者的详细数据，支持个性化治疗和人工智能应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集缺乏详细和全面的患者数据，限制了1型糖尿病管理的数据驱动方法发展。

Method: 收集了25名患者的连续血糖监测、胰岛素泵数据、碳水化合物摄入和设备模式等数据，持续6至8周。

Result: AZT1D提供了罕见的详细胰岛素输送数据，支持广泛的AI和机器学习应用。

Conclusion: AZT1D填补了数据空白，有助于改善1型糖尿病的临床决策和个性化护理。

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven
approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy
design, digital twin systems, and glucose prediction models. However, progress
in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets
that offer detailed and comprehensive patient data. To address this gap, we
present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D
on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data,
carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained
over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular
details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction
specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By
offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical
decision making and individualized care in T1D.

### [33] [Continuous Evolution Pool: Taming Recurring Concept Drift in Online Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14790)
*Tianxiang Zhan,Ming Jin,Yuanpeng He,Yuxuan Liang,Yong Deng,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为连续进化池（CEP）的机制，用于处理时间序列中重复出现的概念漂移问题，通过存储不同概念的预测模型并动态更新，显著提升了在线预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重复出现的概念漂移是时间序列中常见的问题，现有方法在更新参数时容易遗忘先前学到的知识，缺乏有效的知识保留机制。

Method: CEP通过池化机制存储不同概念的预测模型，选择最接近测试样本的预测器并学习其邻域特征（检索过程），若邻域样本不足则生成新模型存储新概念知识，同时清除过时知识。

Result: 在不同架构模型和八个真实数据集上的实验表明，CEP能有效保留不同概念的知识，显著提升重复概念场景下的在线预测效果。

Conclusion: CEP通过动态存储和更新预测模型，解决了重复概念漂移问题，显著提升了预测准确性。

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed
data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of
concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and
previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in
the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter
updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss
of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of
knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully
utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool
(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for
different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test
sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we
refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it
indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the
current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.
Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be
cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on
different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP
effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of
online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the
prediction results.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 在PLMs（如ESM2）中，推理时在特征提取层和Transformer之间注入dropout层，并通过类似蒙特卡洛dropout的方法平均输出，可提高ProteinGym数据集子集上的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无需重新训练或微调PLMs的方法，以提升零样本预测蛋白质关键标量属性（如适应性）的性能。

Method: 在推理时向PLMs的特征提取层和Transformer之间注入dropout层（如0.1的dropout率），并通过蒙特卡洛dropout方式平均输出。

Result: 即使模型最初未使用dropout训练，该方法也能显著提升零样本性能。

Conclusion: 推理时注入dropout层是一种简单有效的方法，可提升PLMs的零样本预测能力。

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of
zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In
this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a
PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output
akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the
ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with
dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the
PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为“Assembly-of-Experts”（AoE）的新方法，用于高效创建混合专家（Mixture-of-Experts）模型的子变体，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型（LLM）时，计算8位权重的成本高达10^13-10^15 FLOPs，效率低下且昂贵。AoE旨在更好地利用预训练模型的巨大投资。

Method: AoE方法通过线性时间内插模型权重张量，增强或抑制父模型的语义特征，生成功能强大的子模型。

Result: 生成的子模型（如DeepSeek R1T“Chimera”）在保持接近父模型智能水平的同时，减少了40%的输出令牌使用，推理更紧凑有序。

Conclusion: AoE方法无需微调或蒸馏即可生成高效子模型，为模型空间搜索提供了简单直接的途径。

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Motivation: 研究智能系统如何在支持广泛泛化的同时保持输入身份的选择性，揭示这种权衡的基本限制。

Method: 通过理论推导和实验验证，分析了表征相似性衰减对泛化和识别概率的影响，并在不同模型中验证了理论的普适性。

Result: 理论预测了多输入处理能力的1/n崩溃和p_S的非单调最优值，实验验证了这些规律在不同模型中的普适性。

Conclusion: 有限分辨率相似性是深层网络和大脑表征能力的基本信息约束，研究提供了泛化与识别权衡的精确理论。

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer架构在时间序列预测中计算复杂度高，ss-Mamba旨在提供一种高效且性能相当的替代方案。

Result: 实验证明ss-Mamba在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性上优于传统模型，计算复杂度从二次降至线性。

Conclusion: ss-Mamba是时间序列预测中高效且多功能的替代方案，优于传统Transformer模型。

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series
forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based
temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building
upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba
selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves
comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity
from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from
pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen
series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful
enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile
and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based
models in time-series forecasting.

Motivation: 动量在基于梯度的优化方法中至关重要，但离散动力学与连续时间近似之间的离散化误差尚未被充分研究。本文旨在通过更关注离散化误差，为该领域提供额外的理论工具。

Method: 设计了一阶分段连续微分方程，通过添加多个补偿项显式地处理离散化误差，从而实现对步长任意阶离散化误差的控制。

Result: 提供了一个连续时间模型，能够控制离散化误差，并应用于方向平滑性的隐式正则化及对角线性网络的隐式偏差研究。

Conclusion: 理论发现通过数值实验验证，展示了该方法在深度学习中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise
continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum
method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous
differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete
optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based
optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the
continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been
comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in
continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide
additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a
first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number
of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a
result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that
allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.
As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the
directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal
linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: PARC为VLM提示敏感性分析提供了有效工具，InternVL2家族模型在稳健性上表现突出。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual
inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual
modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be
prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this
instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt
variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to
prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via
Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built
on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and
vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,
and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt
variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that
VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most
destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,
outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2
family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to
training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

Method: 采用Model-Router框架，动态选择最适合的预测模型（包括经典、机器学习和深度学习方法），并通过规则、LightGBM和InceptionTime路由器进行比较。

Result: 在大规模Favorita数据集上，深度学习路由器（InceptionTime）比单一模型基准提高了11.8%的准确性（NWRMSLE），推理时间快4.67倍。

Conclusion: 该框架通过提升预测精度，显著减少缺货和过剩库存，凸显了智能自适应AI在优化供应链中的关键作用。

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a
critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model
accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a
Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting
model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its
unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime
routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies,
effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand
regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita
dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting
accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with
4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision
will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess
inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in
optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

Motivation: DXA扫描成本高且耗时，需要一种更经济高效的替代方法来预测人体成分变量。

Method: 使用3D光学图像提取生物标志物，应用$p$-Laplacian回归模型和其他监督学习算法（如SVR）进行预测。

Result: $p$-Laplacian模型在10%训练数据下误差为ALM 13%、BMD 10%、BFP 20%；SVR在80%数据下表现最佳（ALM和BMD误差8%，BFP误差11%）。

Conclusion: $p$-Laplacian模型在数据受限的医疗应用中具有潜力，为替代DXA扫描提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as
Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases.
Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to
measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This
work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine
learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc)
obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was
sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data
in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However,
most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive,
requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we
implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This
paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for
regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM,
$\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for
10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support
Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of
$\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with
$\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position
the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications,
particularly in a data-constrained environment.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在现实场景中面临分布式数据和隐私要求的挑战，联邦学习虽提供解决方案，但传统方法因模型规模和通信成本难以实现。

Method: 提出FedNano框架，服务器端集中LLM，客户端部署轻量级NanoEdge模块，包含模态特定编码器、连接器和低秩适配器NanoAdapters。

Result: FedNano减少客户端存储95%，通信开销仅为模型参数的0.01%，并优于现有联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: FedNano弥合了MLLM规模与联邦学习可行性之间的差距，支持可扩展的去中心化多模态AI系统。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal
reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in
real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy
requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling
collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL
for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational
demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and
heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of
full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their
massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we
propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server
while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific
adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and
trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the
need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and
limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By
transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous
client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments
demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap
between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized

Method: 系统评估了四种代理模型（cGP、DGP、编码器-解码器神经网络、XGBoost）在AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA系统中的性能。

Result: DGP在捕捉属性间相关性和输入依赖性不确定性方面优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 先进的代理模型（如DGP）是高效数据驱动的材料设计的强大工具。

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the
discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when
integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations.
This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent
surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian
Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and
XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational
properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their
capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield
strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average
hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary
computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of
hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic,
heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics.
Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior
outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property
correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy
positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and
data-efficient materials design.

Motivation: 自编码器在异常检测中表现优异，但阈值的非标准化定义直接影响检测性能。

Method: 评估了K近邻、K均值和支持向量机三种算法来自动定义阈值。

Result: 未明确说明具体结果，但提出了自动定义阈值的可行性。

Conclusion: 自动定义阈值的方法有望提升异常检测系统的性能。

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using
Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the
data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized
separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the
definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection
process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold
using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were
evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

TLDR: 提出了一种结合BiGRU和多头注意力机制的混合模型（BiGRU-MHA），用于SSD健康状态预测，显著提高了分类准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSD健康状态预测对数据可靠性至关重要，传统模型存在泛化瓶颈，需新方法提升预测性能。

Method: 结合BiGRU的双向时序建模和多头注意力机制动态分配特征权重，提取关键健康指标。

Result: 训练集和测试集分类准确率分别为92.70%和92.44%，AUC为0.94，泛化能力优异。

Conclusion: 该模型为SSD健康预测提供了新方法，解决了传统模型的泛化问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data
reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that
incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and
stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively
integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing
capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling
advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward
dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head
attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's
sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set
and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%,
demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary
classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical
approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization
bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical
value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The
results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing
early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting
intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud
computing data centers and edge storage environments.

TLDR: 论文提出CACTUS工具，用于改进AMD分期分类，解决医疗数据不完整和模型透明度问题，优于标准ML模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据通常不完整且有限，影响ML模型性能；AMD早期诊断因缺乏有效治疗方法而至关重要。

Method: 开发CACTUS工具，结合遗传、饮食、临床和人口统计学因素，提供可解释性和灵活性。

Result: CACTUS在AMD分期分类中表现优于标准ML模型，能识别关键因素并增强决策信心。

Conclusion: CACTUS通过消除无关或偏见数据，为临床医生提供反馈场景，提升模型透明度和实用性。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种改进的GRKneg方法，用于小规模单类分类问题，通过利用少量负样本优化核函数，显著提升了OC-SVM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对小规模单类分类问题，传统OC-SVM在缺乏负样本时性能受限，而二进制SVM在负样本不足时表现不佳。本文旨在通过改进核函数，提升OC-SVM在少量负样本下的性能。

Method: 提出GRKneg方法，通过选择/生成参考向量优化核函数，同时保留OC-SVM的原始实现。仅利用负样本改进核函数，无需标签优化模型。

Result: GRKneg在少量负样本下显著优于标准OC-SVM和二进制SVM。当负样本充足时，二进制SVM表现更优，但GRKneg在负样本极少时仍具优势。

Conclusion: GRKneg为小规模单类分类问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，尤其在负样本稀缺时表现突出。

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative
samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative
Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study
different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an
approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method
does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM
implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the
negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the
binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative
samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial
Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary
SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the
lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms
the binary SVM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习在垂直联邦学习中更具适应性，但异步数据流和非凸模型带来了挑战，现有研究未充分解决。

Method: 提出事件驱动的在线VFL框架，仅激活部分客户端，引入动态局部遗憾（DLR）处理非凸和非平稳环境。

Result: 实验表明框架在非平稳数据下更稳定，显著降低通信和计算成本。

Conclusion: 事件驱动的在线VFL框架有效解决了异步数据流和非凸问题，提升了学习效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating
online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,
where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In
real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the
disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are
typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We
are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been
overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an
event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients
were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively
collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated
\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by
online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary
environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed
framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with
event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed
framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under
non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication
and computation costs.

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，该方法实现了更紧的隐私下界，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了黑盒DP审计的准确性，且计算高效。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on
the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing
techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent
work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in
white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the
more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during
training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that
there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical
upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches
for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in
the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on
CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes
quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially
maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

Result: 实验结果显示FedOne显著提升了查询效率，与理论分析一致。

Conclusion: FedOne是一种高效的联邦黑盒离散提示学习方法，适用于云端大语言模型交互场景。

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes
discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the
prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting
federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by
leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on
federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost
associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted
a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated
black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to
activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne},
enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.
Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated
black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency
when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on
various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in
query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

Result: 发现梯度流优化器在回归任务中高概率进入这些通道，最终形成门控线性单元。

Conclusion: 这些通道揭示了全连接层的计算能力，并提供了对损失景观的新理解。

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that
may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and
characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which
the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two
neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At
convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit:
$a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these
channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of
critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like
SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression
settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with
finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture
of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and
functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of
the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities
of fully connected layers.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注数学和代码领域，缺乏对RL在广泛推理领域适用性的理解，且缺乏可靠、可扩展的奖励信号。

Method: 构建Guru语料库，通过领域特定的奖励设计、去重和过滤确保可靠性，并基于此重新评估RL在LLM推理中的表现。

Result: 发现RL在不同领域的表现差异显著，部分领域需要领域内训练才能取得性能提升。Guru-7B和Guru-32B模型在公开数据训练的模型中表现最佳。

Conclusion: RL不仅能激发预训练模型的知识，还能促进新技能的获取，特别是在预训练数据较少的领域。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

Motivation: 现有方法DIS²在估计目标域误差时存在重叠区域竞争的问题，导致估计不够准确。

Method: 提出Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD)，通过仅在非重叠目标域最大化分歧来避免竞争，并使用域分类器估计域重叠。

Result: 实验表明，ODD在多个基准测试中提高了性能估计的准确性，同时保持有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: ODD方法优于DIS²，能更准确地预测目标性能，代码和结果已开源。

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses
disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under
distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the
target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this
approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target
error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement
discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and
target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement
should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to
high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).
Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,
removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to
estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We
conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method
improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and
reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 研究表明基础模型和多模态方法在复杂疾病预测中的潜力，为MS及其他疾病提供更准确的预后工具。

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is
challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week
disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital
Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed
state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom
multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite
the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via
advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer
model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but
our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart,
confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings
demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive
signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g.,
imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially
other complex diseases.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at

framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

Result: 稳定CDE表示能生成与临床评分强相关的表示，并实现高性能策略（WIS回报>0.9），而不稳定表示导致策略失败（WIS回报≈0）。

Conclusion: 训练稳定性对临床RL中的序列表示学习至关重要，CDE结合稳定性和临床相关性可有效提升策略性能。

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

Conclusion: SFT-GO通过自适应优化令牌组，显著提升了模型的学习效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

Result: 发现LV机制下嵌入学习率与隐藏学习率的最优比例约为√width，与μP的width比例不同，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 词汇量的增加会导致训练动态从μP机制过渡到LV机制，新的缩放规则对实际训练有显著帮助。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and
hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread
use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3
multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient
modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online
hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient
methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to
generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our
experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on
their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We
evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural
language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial
applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements
across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$,
with significantly low computational costs. Fully reproducible code and

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important
research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has
demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation
remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a
theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family
of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to
Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the
theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with
decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces
a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only
demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to
natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$,
allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and
constrained optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: HiPreNets框架为解决复杂非线性问题提供了一种高效且高精度的训练方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in
science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes
challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and
numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and
traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE)
while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many
applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework
for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our
approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural
networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by
sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks,
leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the
structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of
parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We
validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive
core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from
failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can
lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not
exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations
in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task
inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur,
what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To
achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an
existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher
than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we
find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task
inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible
tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each
scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning
strategies.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal
traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience.
However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous
sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper
proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes
low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic
data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural
architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic
tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time
intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism
employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while
stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations
to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban
traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art
baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with
neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet
flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering
critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive
traffic control systems.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance
(e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for
ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning
models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively
verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly
executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification
methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing
approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.
To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine
unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current
techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and
parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess
unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category,
analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify
potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a
set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a
foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded
unlearning verification mechanisms.

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed
machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy
involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential
privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often
results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high
model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and
resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient
vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal
(non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each
iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients
for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive
asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter
than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the
notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based
on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an
improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to
differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical
results.

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet
diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify
this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative
assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce
skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a
reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable
skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging
representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes
policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a
simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely
moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns
continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic
trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By
exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our
method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors
emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look
promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual
quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical
analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically
quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary
1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of
data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the
generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence
rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces
by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a
white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.
The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically.
Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear
models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural
Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to
the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case.
Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing
generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also
demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models
whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of
black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for
measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the
Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B上，SoKA仅需0.99M可训练参数，性能优于或匹配基线，收敛更快且梯度更稳定。

Conclusion: SoKA是一种高效、鲁棒的大规模模型适应方法。

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across
diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial
storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of
task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce
inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence
(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training
machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research
established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee
convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the
aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in
whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and
investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions
from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone
do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that
reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings
due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower
bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under
box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the
number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and
$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower
bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis
for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a
$\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the
existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented
bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We
complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated
stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架通过多分辨率方法，将学术优化与可部署的基础设施政策结合，适用于全国范围推广。

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure
planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas
most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide
and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense
metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural
corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented,
Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework
that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises
heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines)
onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a
zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi
tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within
every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and
floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under
feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage
heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of
sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile
coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income
residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission
headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for
national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated,
GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic
optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing
remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party
logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced
credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual
challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically,
we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through
Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for
risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible
estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk
measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these
risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To
capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate
QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit
risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering
application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid
foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their
adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training
data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to
protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has
been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant
computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward
propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary
obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the
substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)
the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework
designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a
forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations
and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax
attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and
computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers
substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling
scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

Motivation: 探讨上下文学习在标签缺失或错误情况下的有效性，并揭示不同模型结构如何利用未标记数据。

Method: 使用二元高斯混合模型（GMM）生成演示数据，分析单层线性注意力模型和多层/循环Transformer的表现。

Result: 单层模型无法利用未标记数据，而多层或循环模型能有效利用未标记数据，其表现与深度呈指数关系。

Conclusion: 通过循环现成的表格基础模型，可以显著提升半监督学习性能。

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Motivation: 临床实验室结果在诊断中普遍存在，但未检测项目的异常值预测对早期诊断至关重要。血常规检测（CBC）因其广泛使用而成为重点研究对象。

Method: 将表格建模问题转化为集合翻译问题，源集合包含标签列嵌入及其对应值，目标集合仅包含相同类型的嵌入。该方法无需隐式估计缺失值，并连接了LLM与表格领域。

Result: 在临床实验室数据中应用该方法，对高尿酸、高血糖、高胆固醇和低铁蛋白水平的联合预测AUC提高了8%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效处理了表格数据中的缺失值，并在临床预测任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making.
Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of
performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early
diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood
Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining
routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that
varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing
values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation
problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding
and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type
embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values
without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the
tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an
improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose,
cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: cI²SB框架有效解决了扩散模型在FWI中的局限性，为高分辨率样本生成提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior
distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these
methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise
unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based
solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from
diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting
factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the
approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains
unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We
address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between
the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate
the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we
extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge
($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional
Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To
validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the
reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the
observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion
model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function
evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with
supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the
algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository

Conclusion: DiTMC展示了架构选择和对称性先验对样本质量和效率的影响，为大规模分子结构生成建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in
generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling
choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules
introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph
information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and
designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying
sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address
these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing
of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we
introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate
seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different
attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and
SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off
between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard
conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC
achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results
highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality
and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative
modeling of molecular structures. Code available at

Conclusion: 新方法在多种疾病的单细胞RNA-seq数据中验证了有效性和可解释性。

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability
distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of
the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been
(i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a
supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for
enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot
account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features
in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often
do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions
with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach
for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space.
Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric,
but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The
learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances,
leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification
tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach
using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such
as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs
rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the
challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for
exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We
introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over
the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion
model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density
estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome
this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental
connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and
its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror
descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a
pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal
exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent
understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on
both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating
promising results.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for
the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing
ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how
to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While
previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked
to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that
the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we
consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled
by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and
only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split
the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination
strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm
and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph
recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove
that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with
bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective
polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments
on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and
vaccination algorithms.

Conclusion: VXAI框架填补了XAI评估的空白，为未来研究提供了灵活的基础。

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

Conclusion: RHO通过自适应学习同质性模式，提升了半监督图异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled
normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in
a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a
similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent
the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does
not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in
real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily
Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two
novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph
normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters
that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with
varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node
attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise
and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned
by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets
show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily
in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
competing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/RHO.

Method: 提出了一种新技术，简化扭曲路径以突出、量化和可视化关键变换（位移、压缩、幅度差异）。

Result: 方法能够更清晰地表示子序列间的匹配关系，提升时间序列比较的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了传统可视化方法的局限性，为时间序列比较提供了更直观的工具。

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

TLDR: PRISM框架通过捕捉神经网络特征的复杂性，解决了现有方法在鲁棒性和单义性假设上的不足，提供了更准确的特征描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征描述方法假设神经元仅编码单一概念（单义性），而实际上神经元通常是多义的，这限制了特征描述的表达能力。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，为多义和单义特征提供更细致的描述。

Result: PRISM在语言模型上的应用显示，其描述质量和捕捉多义概念的能力优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PRISM通过更准确地描述神经网络特征，提升了模型行为的可解释性。

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于用户引导的降维框架，利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）实现可定制、可解释的数据可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降维技术无法直接探索数据中未明确标注的语义结构，因此需要一种用户可动态引导的方法。

Method: 通过自然语言提示引导零样本分类，动态调整投影以反映用户感兴趣的语义关系。

Result: 方法在多个数据集上验证，不仅提升了聚类分离效果，还将降维转变为交互式、用户驱动的过程。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了自动化降维与以人为中心的数据探索之间的空白，提供了灵活适应特定分析需求的解决方案。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into
lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to
explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of
variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection
framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable,
data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via
natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships
of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data
dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not
only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive,
user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR
techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and
adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

*Gabrel J. Perin,Runjin Chen,Xuxi Chen,Nina S. T. Hirata,Zhangyang Wang,Junyuan Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为LoX的无训练方法，通过外推对齐LLM的安全子空间，显著提高了模型对微调攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对齐模型在安全方面有所改进，但其安全保护仍可能被后续微调破坏，即使微调数据看似无害。

Method: 基于安全关键低秩子空间对微调的敏感性，提出LoX方法，外推对齐LLM的安全子空间。

Result: 实验显示，LoX在面对良性或恶意微调攻击时，攻击成功率（ASR）绝对降低了11%至54%。

Conclusion: LoX通过将LLM参数移动到更平坦的区域，减少对扰动的敏感性，从而有效提升安全鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为LIT-LVM的方法，用于高效估计线性预测器中交互项的系数，通过低维潜在向量表示特征，以减少过拟合并提升预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性预测器中交互项系数的准确估计是一个重要问题，尤其是在高维数据中容易过拟合。

Method: 假设交互项系数具有低维结构，用低维潜在向量表示特征，结合结构化正则化方法（LIT-LVM）。

Result: LIT-LVM在模拟和真实数据上表现优于弹性网络和因子分解机，尤其在交互项数量远多于样本数时。

Conclusion: LIT-LVM不仅提高了预测准确性，还提供了特征的低维潜在表示，有助于可视化和分析特征关系。

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and
machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear
predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding
interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We
consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction
terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different
interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent
each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This
low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization
approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond
standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that
our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to
elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real
data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the
number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations
for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: AutoRule是一种自动从人类偏好反馈中提取规则并转化为规则奖励的方法，显著提升了强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于规则的奖励方法依赖人工规则设计，AutoRule旨在实现自动化规则提取以改进RLHF。

Method: AutoRule分三阶段：利用推理模型解释用户偏好，从推理链中提取候选规则，合成统一规则集，并利用语言模型验证规则满足度作为辅助奖励。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B模型上，AutoRule使AlpacaEval2.0的胜率提升28.6%，MT-Bench子集第二轮性能提升6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoRule提取的规则与数据集偏好一致，减少奖励滥用，并能捕捉不同数据集的独特价值。

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后归因方法对输入扰动高度敏感，导致归因图不稳定，影响了其可信度，因此需要一种能提供严格鲁棒性保证的方法。

Method: 采用随机平滑技术，将归因图稀疏化和平滑，并将其重新表述为分割问题，以认证每个像素的重要性。

Result: 在12种归因方法和5个ImageNet模型上的广泛评估表明，认证后的归因具有鲁棒性、可解释性和忠实性。

Conclusion: 该框架为归因方法提供了可靠的鲁棒性保证，适用于下游任务。

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

Motivation: 探讨稀疏自编码器中密集潜在特征的几何、功能和起源，以验证其是否为训练噪声或具有实际意义。

Method: 系统分析密集潜在特征的几何结构和功能，提出分类法，并研究其在模型各层的演化。

Result: 密集潜在特征形成对偶对，影响残差空间方向，并具有位置追踪、上下文绑定等功能。

Conclusion: 密集潜在特征在语言模型计算中具有功能性作用，不应被视为训练噪声。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

TLDR: 论文研究了时空图神经网络（STGNNs）中的信息传播问题，特别是时空过压缩现象，发现其与静态图神经网络中的问题不同，并揭示了卷积STGNNs在信息传播上的反直觉特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管图神经网络（GNNs）在多个领域取得了成功，但其信息传播能力存在局限性，如过压缩问题。在时空GNNs中，这一问题因时间维度的加入而更加复杂，但尚未被深入研究。

Method: 论文形式化了时空过压缩问题，分析了其与静态情况的区别，并研究了卷积STGNNs的信息传播特性。

Result: 研究发现，卷积STGNNs倾向于传播时间上较远而非较近的信息，且不同处理范式（时间-空间或时间-空间分离）均受此现象影响。

Conclusion: 研究为时空GNNs的设计提供了理论依据和实践指导，验证了其操作动态，并提出了更高效的设计建议。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental
limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as
over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information.
While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in
Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph
nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by
increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize
the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct
characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that
counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from
points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that
architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing
paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical
justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our
findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into
their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG模型可能依赖记忆而非检索信息的问题，确保模型有效利用外部信息。

Method: 通过比较仅使用查询的推理路径和使用查询加检索上下文的推理路径的KL散度，判断模型是否依赖记忆。

Result: 在Prompt-WNQA基准测试中，RePCS的ROC-AUC达到0.918，优于之前方法6.5个百分点，延迟开销低于4.7%。

Conclusion: RePCS提供了一种轻量级的黑盒方法，验证RAG系统是否有效利用检索信息，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization
algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work
by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear
regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate
averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we
provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds
provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools,
bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite
(PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear
regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing
mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the
training of realistic models.

Result: 时间限制观察和策略轨迹观察能突破学习障碍，但线性时间可计算函数不存在可计算或多项式质量特征集。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate
\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time
computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results
in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly
understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but
they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this
difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which
suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due
to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We
propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling
robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our
interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established
algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong
performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of
agents and suites of environments.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges
in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device
heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing
approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this
work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that
jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC
introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from
location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.
Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment
mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.
Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances
demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

Motivation: 解决传统Ricci流求解器因全局更新成本高和贪婪启发式方法收敛慢或调参困难的问题。

Method: 采用贪婪综合征解码步骤定位并修正最大曲率误差，结合两个轻量级神经网络模块动态选择顶点和步长。

Result: 在110个SJTU-TMQA网格上，迭代次数减少2.4倍，曲率分布更紧，UV失真与MOS相关性达-0.93，每迭代仅增加0.25ms。

Conclusion: MicroRicci在实时、资源受限的图形和仿真应用中表现出色，兼具高效和高质。

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

TLDR: DP-GRAPE是一种新型的差分隐私训练方法，通过梯度随机投影显著降低内存使用，同时保持与DP-SGD相当的隐私-效用平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DP-Adam等标准方法因逐样本梯度裁剪导致的高内存开销问题，提升差分隐私训练的可扩展性。

Method: 引入三个关键修改：(1)梯度投影后私有化，(2)用随机高斯矩阵替代SVD子空间，(3)在反向传播中应用投影。

Result: 实验表明，DP-GRAPE在预训练Vision Transformers和微调RoBERTa-Large时分别减少63%和70%内存使用，且性能相当。

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE是一种高效且可扩展的差分隐私训练方法，适用于大规模模型如OPT（67亿参数）。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network
training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead
due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce
DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly
reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP
approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces
three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)
random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is
applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for
costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to
improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our
theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off
comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE
can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or
training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when
pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as
compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further
demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with
up to 6.7 billion parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习中的公平性对构建可信赖的AI系统至关重要，但训练数据中的标签偏差和噪声会影响模型性能和公平性。

Method: GFLC结合了预测置信度测量、基于图的Ricci流优化拉普拉斯正则化和显式人口统计公平性激励。

Result: 实验结果表明，GFLC在性能和公平性指标之间取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: GFLC是一种高效的方法，能够有效纠正标签噪声并提升模型的公平性。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

TLDR: 该研究评估了联邦学习（FL）在缺血性卒中患者脑年龄预测（BrainAGE）中的应用，发现FL在保护隐私的同时能提供准确的预测，且BrainAGE与血管风险因素及卒中后功能恢复显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因隐私问题导致的大规模脑影像数据难以集中训练BrainAGE模型的挑战，并探索BrainAGE与卒中患者临床表型及功能预后的关联。

Method: 使用1674名卒中患者的FLAIR脑影像数据，比较集中学习、联邦学习和单中心学习的BrainAGE预测效果，并通过逻辑回归分析BrainAGE与血管风险因素及功能预后的关系。

Result: 联邦学习在预测准确性上优于单中心模型，且BrainAGE与糖尿病等血管风险因素及卒中后功能恢复显著相关。

Conclusion: 联邦学习可在不集中数据的情况下实现准确的BrainAGE预测，为卒中预后建模提供了潜在工具。

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data
centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,
and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in
stroke care.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线RL中数据质量差（如探索不足）会导致策略过于保守，影响性能。

Method: 提出CAWR方法，结合鲁棒损失函数和优势优先经验回放，过滤低质量数据。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，CAWR显著提升了策略优化的性能。

Conclusion: CAWR有效解决了离线RL中数据质量差导致的保守策略问题。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require
additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues,
such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy
optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on
a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the
potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,
specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from
two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal
policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the
approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such
over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for
policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor
explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose
Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a
set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based
prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical
experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior
policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance
of policy optimization.

TLDR: 该论文提出了一个手动标注的老年患者出院摘要中不良事件（AE）提取语料库，填补了临床NLP资源中老年人群代表性不足的问题。数据集包含14种临床重要AEs，并支持不连续和重叠实体的标注。实验表明，BERT等模型在粗粒度任务上表现优异，但在细粒度任务上表现下降，尤其是罕见事件和复杂属性。数据集通过DataLoch提供，可作为AE提取方法的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 老年患者在临床NLP资源中代表性不足，现有研究很少解决不连续和重叠实体的标注问题。

Method: 构建了一个包含14种AEs的手动标注数据集，支持不连续和重叠实体。使用FlairNLP评估了多种模型在三种标注粒度上的表现。

Result: BERT等模型在粗粒度任务上表现优异（F1=0.943），但在细粒度任务上表现下降（F1=0.675），尤其是罕见事件和复杂属性。

Conclusion: 尽管模型在粗粒度任务上表现良好，但在细粒度任务和罕见事件上仍有挑战。该数据集为AE提取提供了基准，并支持未来跨数据集泛化研究。

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

TLDR: Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) 通过结合约束和非约束解码的两阶段方法，提升结构化 NLP 任务的输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在测试时约束解码可能导致低质量输出，BoostCD 旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BoostCD 分两阶段：第一阶段分别进行约束和非约束解码生成两个弱预测；第二阶段通过增强模型结合两者生成最终预测。

Result: BoostCD 在封闭信息提取任务中表现优于现有方法，解决了常见错误。

Conclusion: BoostCD 通过互补性错误利用，显著提升了结构化输出的质量。

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

Motivation: 现有方法常忽略上下文文档的可信度差异，可能导致不可靠信息传播，因此需要一种自动化评估可信度的方法。

Method: 基于文档间语义一致性自动评估可信度，提出黑盒和白盒两种策略将可信度融入LLM推理。

Result: 在三种模型架构和五个数据集上，CrEst显著优于基线，准确率提升26.86%，F1分数提升3.49%，且在噪声条件下表现稳健。

Conclusion: CrEst有效解决了上下文文档可信度评估问题，显著提升了LLM在知识密集型任务中的性能。

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型推理能力的快速扩展，多文档推理领域的评估需求日益迫切，但现有基准较少且标注成本高。

Result: MDBench对现有LLM和提示技术均构成显著挑战，且知识引导生成技术能快速适应新挑战。

Conclusion: MDBench为多文档推理评估提供了高效且可控的解决方案，并支持未来模型改进的快速适配。

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

Motivation: 尽管机器学习和深度学习模型已广泛用于糖尿病预测，但LLMs在结构化数值数据中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用Pima Indian Diabetes Database（PIDD）进行实证分析，评估六种LLMs（包括开源和专有模型）及三种传统机器学习模型，采用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数作为评估指标。

Result: 专有LLMs表现优于开源模型，GPT-4o和Gemma-2-27B在少样本设置中准确率最高，Gemma-2-27B的F1分数超越传统模型。

Conclusion: LLMs在医疗预测任务中具有潜力，未来需优化提示工程和混合方法以提升性能。

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

Motivation: 探索LLM在无需调整权重的情况下精确重建文本的能力。

Method: 引入特殊记忆令牌，通过训练优化其嵌入，使模型能根据嵌入重建固定序列。

Result: 在英语和西班牙语数据集、最长240个令牌的序列及100M到8B参数的模型规模中验证成功，Llama 3.1 8B能重建所有测试序列。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLM的有趣能力，可能应用于记忆检索、压缩及可控文本生成。

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Motivation: 社会隔离和孤独感近年增加，与自杀率密切相关，但未被美国国家暴力死亡报告系统记录，需通过技术手段识别。

Method: 利用主题建模生成词典开发，结合监督学习分类器，分析2002至2020年30万自杀案例。

Result: 开发高质量分类器（F1:0.86，准确率:0.82），识别1198例慢性社会隔离，男性、同性恋或离婚者风险更高。

Conclusion: 该方法可改进美国社会隔离和孤独感的监测与预防。

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

Motivation: 现有方法在评估开放式长文本生成时难以全面衡量质量，且易受预训练数据偏见影响。

Method: 提出PrefBERT模型，基于多样长文本风格和Likert评分的响应评估数据集训练，为GRPO提供语义奖励反馈。

Result: PrefBERT在多句子和段落长度响应中表现可靠，与人类偏好更一致，优于传统指标。

Conclusion: PrefBERT作为奖励信号训练策略模型，生成的响应更符合人类偏好，代码已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在现实中的广泛应用，后验知识遗忘能力变得至关重要，涉及隐私法规和纠正有害内容等需求。

Method: 通过实验研究学习时知识编码对遗忘效果的影响，重点关注转述描述学习和文本块中单个知识的遗忘。

Result: 发现转述描述学习可提升遗忘性能，但遗忘文本块中的单个知识较困难。

Conclusion: 学习时知识编码对实现可靠的后验知识遗忘起关键作用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

TLDR: 提出CKD-EHR框架，通过知识蒸馏技术提升EHR疾病预测模型的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大语言模型在医学知识表示不足和临床部署效率低的问题。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-7B作为教师模型，生成可解释软标签，并通过多粒度注意力蒸馏机制将知识迁移到轻量级BERT学生模型。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，诊断准确率提升9%，F1分数提高27%，推理速度加快22.2倍。

Conclusion: CKD-EHR显著提升资源利用效率和诊断准确性，为临床资源优化提供实用技术方案。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架（MRG和PS）来建模开放域对话的一对多属性，通过新数据集o2mDial和训练策略提升小模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域对话存在一对多属性，现有LLM对话代理未显式建模此属性，导致多样性不足。

Method: 分解为多响应生成（MRG）和偏好选择（PS）两阶段，引入o2mDial数据集及新训练策略和评估指标。

Result: 小模型应用该框架后，响应多样性提升，质量提高90%，接近大模型表现。

Conclusion: 两阶段框架有效提升开放域对话的多样性和质量，为小模型优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计更高效的韩语分词器，减少分词数量（降低fertility）同时保持模型性能。

Method: 采用规则预分词方法，结合种子词汇表和分支熵选择算法，增加平均分词长度。

Result: 分词数量减少约10%，推理速度提升10%，下游任务性能不受影响。

Conclusion: 基于语言学的方法设计高效分词器是可行且实用的。

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

TLDR: 论文研究了状态空间语言模型中的记忆机制，通过首因效应和近因效应揭示信息如何随时间保留和遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型中信息的保留和遗忘机制，特别是在长序列输入下的表现。

Method: 在Mamba架构中应用结构化回忆任务，分析其U形准确率曲线，并识别三种机制：长期记忆、短期记忆和动态记忆分配。

Result: 发现长期记忆由稀疏通道支持，短期记忆受指数衰减影响，记忆分配受语义规律动态调节。通过实验验证了这些机制。

Conclusion: Mamba模型通过多种机制实现记忆功能，揭示了语言模型记忆的复杂性和动态性。

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Motivation: 由于SDGs数据规模庞大且复杂，追踪进展困难，需要高效的文本分类工具。LLMs因其强大的语言模式识别能力成为重要工具。

Method: 研究比较了不同LLMs在单标签多类文本分类任务中的表现，并评估了零样本、少样本学习和微调的效果。

Result: 优化后的小模型表现可与大型模型（如GPT）媲美。

Conclusion: 提示工程优化的小模型在SDGs文本分类任务中具有竞争力。

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

Motivation: 理解大语言模型跨领域泛化能力的机制，假设其源于共享的抽象推理原型。

Method: 提出ProtoReasoning框架，包括自动原型构建、验证系统和可扩展性问题合成。

Result: 在逻辑推理、规划任务、通用推理和数学任务上分别提升4.7%、6.3%、4.0%和1.0%。

Conclusion: 验证了抽象推理原型是支持大语言模型泛化能力的基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标（如ROUGE和BERTScore）难以捕捉语义相似性，而现有的基于LLM的评估方法缺乏直观可解释性，且未区分事实性和非事实性问题。

Method: MinosEval首先区分问题类型，对事实性问题采用自适应关键点评分策略，对非事实性问题采用实例感知的列表排序策略。

Result: 实验表明，MinosEval在多个开放QA数据集上更符合人工标注结果，并提供更可解释的评估。

Conclusion: MinosEval通过区分问题类型并采用针对性策略，显著提升了开放QA评估的效果和可解释性。

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

Result: 实验显示处理语言变体时性能下降，尤其是巴斯克语，且编码器模型对西部巴斯克语表现较差。

Conclusion: 语言变体本身而非词汇重叠导致性能下降，西部巴斯克语的困难与语言学理论一致。

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

Conclusion: Graph RAG为古典文本知识提取提供低资源解决方案，推动历史知识服务与人文研究。

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving

Method: 构建首个韩国法律数据集，系统分类个人可识别信息（PII），开发基于深度神经网络的端到端去标识化流程。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型在法院判决去标识化任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID框架有效解决了法律与技术适配问题，为大规模去标识化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

Result: 发现现有方法依赖专有模型和弱评估基准，提出了改进方向。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床试验招募中具有潜力，但需解决现有挑战并探索未来发展方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Conclusion: 行为测试能揭示临床LLMs的推理策略，有助于设计更安全、透明的医疗AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural

evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states

cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

TLDR: 该研究填补了印度语言在多模态、多语言摘要领域的空白，提出了一个包含九种印度语言的评论敏感数据集COSMMIC，并通过实验验证了不同配置对摘要生成的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在英语和中文的多模态、多语言摘要方面取得进展，但印度语言的研究仍有限。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入COSMMIC数据集，包含4,959篇文章-图像对和24,484条评论，并采用LLama3和GPT-4等模型评估四种配置（纯文本、文本+评论、文本+图像、文本+评论+图像）的效果。

Result: 实验表明，结合文本、评论和图像的多模态配置能生成更有效的摘要。

Conclusion: COSMMIC数据集为印度语言的NLP研究提供了资源，推动了多模态和多语言摘要的发展。

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为TLI的微调方法，通过针对早期层的词嵌入进行优化，显著提升了低资源语言（如斯瓦希里语）的词对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在低资源语言中因数据稀缺和预训练不足导致的词对齐性能不佳问题。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）和对比学习目标，针对早期层（如第2层）的词嵌入进行微调。

Result: TLI显著提升了斯瓦希里语-英语词对的词对齐性能，训练集和未见词对的相似度分别提高了28.08%和28.32%。

Conclusion: TLI是一种参数高效且有效的方法，能够增强模型在低资源语言中的词对齐能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

TLDR: 研究发现大型推理模型的推理痕迹中存在隐私泄露风险，增加推理步骤会放大泄露，揭示了推理效用与隐私保护之间的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战推理痕迹内部安全的假设，揭示其中可能包含的敏感用户数据泄露问题。

Method: 通过探测和代理评估，分析推理步骤增加对隐私泄露的影响。

Result: 推理步骤增加会放大隐私泄露，模型在最终答案中更谨慎但推理痕迹中泄露更多。

Conclusion: 安全措施需扩展到模型的内部推理过程，而不仅是输出结果。

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该论文提出了一个细粒度评估框架和Peak Sharpness Score（PSS）指标，用于量化多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在GUI代理中的不确定性，并提出了Context-Aware Cropping技术以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在GUI代理中表现出色，但其存在系统性定位错误（幻觉），影响了可靠性。

Method: 提出了细粒度评估框架和PSS指标，并引入Context-Aware Cropping技术。

Result: 实验表明，框架和方法提供了可操作的见解，增强了GUI代理行为的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升MLLMs在GUI代理中的可靠性和性能提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统在架构设计、跨领域泛化性和性能保证方面存在挑战，尤其是在任务复杂性和智能体数量增加时。

Method: 提出三个核心创新：分治并行架构、自适应协作引擎和智能体组织优化策略。

Result: 在多个领域表现优异，如GSM8K准确率91.50%，AIME准确率30.4%，HumanEval pass@1 79.20%，且在任务难度增加时优势更明显。

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2为构建高效、通用的多智能体系统提供了全面解决方案，尤其在复杂推理场景中优势显著。

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

TLDR: RE-IMAGINE框架通过生成不同层次的推理问题，评估LLMs是否依赖记忆而非真实推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs的高准确率是源于真实推理能力还是训练数据的统计记忆。

Method: 基于Pearl的因果阶梯理论，提出RE-IMAGINE框架，生成不可仅靠记忆解决的多样化问题。

Result: LLMs在面对生成的问题变体时表现下降，显示其部分依赖统计记忆。

Conclusion: RE-IMAGINE为评估LLMs的推理能力提供了新方法，揭示了其对记忆的依赖，推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为CINGS的后训练监督方法，通过将相关上下文预置到响应中并仅计算响应标记的损失，以增强大型语言模型在外部知识基础上的生成能力。实验表明，CINGS在文本和视觉领域均表现出更强的基于上下文的生成能力，且不影响一般下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成响应时往往需要依赖外部知识以减少幻觉，但简单地附加上下文并不能确保生成的响应基于上下文。因此，需要一种更有效的方法来增强模型的基于上下文的生成能力。

Method: 提出Context-INformed Grounding Supervision（CINGS），在训练时将相关上下文预置到响应中，但仅计算响应标记的损失，并屏蔽上下文部分。

Result: 在文本领域，CINGS在11个信息检索数据集上优于其他训练方法；在视觉语言领域，使用CINGS训练的模型减少了幻觉并保持了事实一致性。改进的基于上下文的生成能力未影响一般下游任务性能。

Conclusion: CINGS通过改变模型对先验知识的依赖，隐式鼓励模型更依赖外部上下文，从而显著提升了基于上下文的生成能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高效、高质量自动化过程标注的挑战，以提升复杂多步推理能力。

Method: 引入SPARE框架，通过单次标注和参考引导的步骤级评估，对齐参考解决方案的步骤。

Result: SPARE在数学推理、多跳组合问答和空间推理等数据集中表现优异，效率提升2.6倍，运行时间减少至38%。

Conclusion: SPARE在推理性能和效率上均优于基线方法，为过程监督提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夸张和隐喻在自然语言处理中具有重要意义，但由于其语义隐晦和表达多样，检测难度大。现有方法多关注表面特征，忽略了情感关联和双向交互的作用。

Method: EmoBi框架包含情感分析模块、基于情感的领域映射模块和双向动态交互模块，通过情感挖掘和双向交互提升检测准确性。

Result: 实验显示EmoBi在四个数据集上优于基线方法，F1分数在TroFi和HYPO-L数据集上分别提升28.1%和23.1%。

Conclusion: EmoBi通过情感引导和双向交互显著提升了夸张和隐喻检测的性能，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在生成可信和可验证回答时的常见问题，如遗漏明确答案、错误引用或拒绝回答可用证据的问题。

Method: 采用GRPO（Group Relative Policy Optimization）方法，通过基于可验证结果的奖励（如答案正确性、引用充分性和拒绝质量）训练模型，无需黄金推理轨迹或昂贵标注。

Result: 实验表明，结合推理的模型在ASQA、QAMPARI、ELI5和ExpertQA等任务中显著优于仅基于指令调优的模型，尤其是在处理不可回答问题和生成良好引用回答方面。

Conclusion: 研究强调了推理、分阶段优化和基于结果的强化学习在构建更可验证和可靠的大语言模型中的重要性。

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决局部注意力完全忽略窗口外标记的固有局限性，提升局部-全局模型的效率与性能。

Method: 提出RATTENTION，结合局部注意力和线性注意力机制，捕捉窗口外标记信息。

Result: 在3B和12B规模的预训练中，RATTENTION以512窗口大小匹配全注意力模型性能，并在长上下文任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: RATTENTION在性能与效率间实现了更优的Pareto权衡，且不影响训练速度。

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现代语言模型通常公开权重但封闭训练数据，研究旨在解决从模型权重中近似训练数据的问题。

Method: 提出梯度基方法，从大型公共文本库中选择匹配度最高的数据，并开发了基线指标。

Result: 在AG News分类任务中，性能从65%提升至80%，接近专家基准88%；在MSMARCO文档的SFT模型中，困惑度从3.3降至2.3。

Conclusion: 该方法能从公开数据中有效恢复有用数据，接近原始模型性能。

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在实时语音聊天中因生成首句延迟导致用户体验不佳，尤其是在计算资源有限的设备上。

Method: 提出PredGen框架，利用用户仍在说话时的预测性解码生成候选响应，提前启动TTS处理。

Result: 在Lmsys和MT-Bench数据集上的模拟实验显示，延迟降低约2倍，计算成本增加极小。

Conclusion: PredGen能有效减少LLMs的响应延迟，提升实时语音交互体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注二元性别区分，缺乏对非二元性别包容性的评估，因此需要一种更全面的指标来量化LLMs的性别包容性。

Method: 引入GIFI指标，从多个层面评估LLMs的性别包容性，包括代词使用、生成内容和认知行为等。

Result: 测试发现不同LLMs在性别包容性上存在显著差异，揭示了与性别标识相关的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升LLMs性别包容性的重要性，并为未来性别公平性研究提供了关键基准。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Abstract: We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal
scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over
1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common
reasoning type in multimodal scientific claim verification. To enable
fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting
evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal
foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and
Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these
models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we
identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key
insights to advance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal
scientific literature tasks.

*Shaoqing Lin,Chong Teng,Fei Li,Donghong Ji,Lizhen Qu,Zhuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的任务DiscoSG，用于解决多句子视觉描述中的场景图解析问题，并提出了数据集DiscoSG-DS和模型DiscoSG-Refiner，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本场景图解析器主要针对单句描述设计，无法有效处理多句子描述中的跨句共指现象，导致图碎片化和下游任务性能下降。

Method: 提出了DiscoSG任务和数据集DiscoSG-DS，并设计了DiscoSG-Refiner模型，使用两个小PLM分阶段生成和优化场景图。

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner在SPICE指标上比基线提升约30%，推理速度比GPT-4快86倍，并提升了下游任务性能。

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner是一种高效且性能优越的多句子场景图解析方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

TLDR: 论文介绍了WikiMixQA基准，用于评估跨模态推理能力，发现现有模型在长文档检索和多模态推理中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文档理解中复杂布局、表格和图表的跨模态推理挑战。

Method: 构建包含1000个多选题的WikiMixQA基准，评估12种先进视觉语言模型。

Result: 专有模型在直接上下文下准确率约70%，但在长文档检索中显著下降；开源模型最高准确率仅27%。

Conclusion: WikiMixQA为文档理解研究提供了重要基准，突显长上下文多模态推理的挑战。

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

TLDR: 论文探讨了生成式AI在葡萄牙语阅读理解多选题（MCQ）生成中的应用，评估了其质量和可靠性，并指出当前模型的优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动创建不同难度和针对性阅读技能的MCQ耗时且昂贵，生成式AI提供了自动化解决方案，但其质量和可靠性尚未充分研究，尤其是在非英语语言中。

Method: 研究使用生成模型为葡萄牙语阅读理解生成MCQ，涵盖课程相关叙事元素和不同难度级别，并通过专家评审和学生反应的心理测量学分析评估质量。

Result: 当前模型生成的MCQ质量与人工编写的相当，但在语义清晰度、可回答性和干扰项设计上存在问题。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在MCQ生成中具有潜力，但需进一步改进语义清晰度和干扰项设计，以满足高质量MCQ的要求。

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

Motivation: 增强大语言模型的可靠性，揭示神经网络中认知编码机制。

Method: 构建后悔数据集，提出S-CDI、RDS、GIC指标，分析隐藏状态和神经元激活模式。

Result: 成功识别最优后悔表示层，发现M形解耦模式，将神经元分为三类功能组。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效分析后悔机制，为模型可靠性提升提供新思路。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究跨文化误解是源于字面意义还是更广泛的语用因素（如礼貌和简洁规范）。

Method: 通过三个实验比较英式和美式英语使用者对强调词的解释，并开发计算认知模型分析听者对说话者平衡信息性、礼貌和话语成本的递归推理。

Result: 跨文化差异源于字面意义和话语成本权重的不同组合，而非仅语义或礼貌规范。

Conclusion: 跨文化解释差异是字面意义和语用因素复杂互动的结果。

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在生成任务中遵循指定概念顺序的能力，以评估其组合泛化和指令遵循能力。

Method: 提出Ordered CommonGen基准，通过有序覆盖率评估LLMs生成句子时是否遵循指定概念顺序。

Result: 36个LLMs的分析显示，模型对指令意图理解良好，但存在顺序偏差，最高覆盖率仅75%。

Conclusion: LLMs在指令遵循和组合泛化能力上仍需改进。

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: 轻量级的字符n-gram方法在罗马尼亚作者归属任务中可达到先进水平，适用于资源有限或研究较少的语言环境。

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts

evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character
n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the
highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen
runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight,
interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy
for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our
findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource,

Motivation: 大语言模型在推理任务中表现不稳定，需要一种方法提升其一致性和可靠性。

Method: 采用基于同类问题的强化学习框架（CC-Learn），结合准确性、检索奖励和拒绝惩罚的复合目标进行优化。

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和StrategyQA等基准测试中，CC-Learn显著提升了模型的准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: CC-Learn通过同类强化学习有效提升了大语言模型的推理一致性。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决语法性别语言中保持性别模糊性的挑战，避免误性别化和代表性伤害。

Method: 评估了21种机器翻译系统在三种翻译方向上的表现，分类并讨论了实际观察到的性别中立策略。

Result: 大多数系统未能提供性别中立翻译，但少数系统根据目标语言采用了特定策略。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了机器翻译系统在性别中立性方面的不足，但也展示了少数系统的改进潜力。

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

Motivation: 解决异构视觉语言模型（VLMs）因架构多样性导致的知识迁移困难问题。

Method: 提出GenRecal框架，包含Recalibrator模块，用于对齐和适配不同VLMs的特征表示。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升性能，超越开源和闭源VLMs。

Conclusion: GenRecal为异构VLMs的知识蒸馏提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

Motivation: 随着LLM的普及，其生成文本带来的社会问题（如虚假信息和学术不端）日益严重，而现有检测器对私有调优LLM生成的文本效果不佳。

Method: 提出PhantomHunter，采用家族感知学习框架，捕捉基础模型及其衍生模型的家族级特征，而非个体特征。

Result: 在LLaMA、Gemma和Mistral家族数据上的实验表明，PhantomHunter优于7种基线方法和3种工业服务，F1分数超过96%。

Conclusion: PhantomHunter能有效检测私有调优LLM生成的文本，解决了现有检测器的局限性。

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: CALM结合符号推理与神经生成，实现多模态数据下的上下文敏感决策，填补逻辑与神经感知之间的鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典二值逻辑系统无法捕捉人类决策的细微差别，且在多模态环境中需要人工干预。神经网络虽能提取多模态数据的丰富信息，但缺乏可解释的推理结构。CALM旨在整合两者，使AI系统能更稳健地处理现实任务。

Method: CALM通过领域树表示谓词，利用神经网络迭代优化其模拟真值，并通过符号推理模块确保约束满足。

Result: 在填空物体放置任务中，CALM准确率达92.2%，优于经典逻辑（86.3%）和LLM（59.4%），并能生成符合逻辑约束和人类偏好的空间热图。

Conclusion: CALM展示了在多模态环境中结合逻辑结构与神经网络的潜力，为下一代AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM).
CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make
context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human
decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,
which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting
rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable
structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,
creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this
integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to
generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate
to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which
iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of
its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural
networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a
symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%
accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It
also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints
and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure
while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the
foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and
interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural
networks.

Conclusion: MEAL为CMARL研究提供了高效工具，并揭示了关键架构和算法特征。

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly
impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual
learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce
MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark
tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL
benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks
and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU
acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a
standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL
and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to
scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation.
Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical
for CMARL on MEAL.

Method: 结合了Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE)和计算优化机制，独立优化策略和价值模型。

Result: 在AIME 2024实验中，T-PPO将训练效率提升至2.5倍，并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: T-PPO是一种高效且有效的方法，适用于提升大型语言模型的训练效率。

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by
generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing
these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through
trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent
on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.
In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a
novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy
update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of
low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized
long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting
periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we
propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage
estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of
policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that
allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By
selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces
redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing
convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO
on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO
improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and
outperforms its existing competitors.

Motivation: 传统启发式算法依赖人工设计且难以泛化，HeurAgenix旨在通过LLM自动生成和选择启发式策略，解决这一问题。

Method: HeurAgenix分为启发式演化和动态选择两阶段：LLM比较种子解与高质量解以提取策略，并在求解时动态选择最优策略。采用双奖励机制微调轻量级选择器。

Result: 实验表明，HeurAgenix优于现有基于LLM的超启发式方法，甚至媲美或超越专用求解器。

Conclusion: HeurAgenix展示了LLM在组合优化中的潜力，为自动化启发式设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and
struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce
\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among
them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an
LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and
extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically
picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's
perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a
state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference
cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity,
we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism
that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception,
enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on
canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing
LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Motivation: 低地球轨道卫星的快速增长对自主协调提出了挑战，传统优化方法难以满足实时决策需求，因此需要研究强化学习和多智能体强化学习。

Method: 通过建模单卫星操作并扩展到多卫星星座，利用MARL框架解决能源、数据存储和部分可观测性下的协调问题，评估了多种MARL算法。

Result: 结果表明MARL能有效平衡成像和资源管理，解决多卫星协调中的非平稳性和奖励依赖性问题。

Conclusion: 研究为自主卫星操作提供了基础，并为分散式地球观测任务的政策学习提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised
Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring,
disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in
multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional
optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making
demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we
investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling
single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations
using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data
storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the
complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By
leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the
training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,
including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can
effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing
non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous
satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy
learning in decentralised EO missions.

Motivation: 海上物联网（MIoT）的计算需求快速增长，但不确定任务导致计算卸载和资源分配效率低下，亟需解决方案。

Method: 提出协作MEC框架，利用Lyapunov优化处理任务不确定性，将问题转化为马尔可夫博弈，并设计异构智能体软演员-评论家算法求解。

Result: 仿真验证了所提框架在计算卸载和资源分配中的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过无人机和船舶协作，结合优化算法，可有效解决MIoT中的计算卸载和资源分配问题。

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase
rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels
based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements.
However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of
inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we
focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through
the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks.
Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading
and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we
formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for
the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the
unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By
converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a
set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the
heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the
small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a
heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update
various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. Finally,
simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing
computational offloading and resource allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航方法通常同时处理所有历史观测数据，忽略了数据内部的关联结构，限制了性能提升。

Method: 通过因果视角分析导航任务，提出CAN方法，引入因果理解模块增强环境理解能力。

Result: 实验证明CAN在多种任务和模拟环境中优于基线方法，且无需额外计算开销。

Conclusion: 因果理解模块能有效提升导航性能，适用于强化学习和监督学习。

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate
complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within
Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated
from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically
process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal
association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for
further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the
unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,
introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional
sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware
Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance
the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and
simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to
the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both
Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process.
The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA
labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection
of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse
data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as

  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their
analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and
external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries,
retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of
human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's

TLDR: 论文提出了一个统一框架，用于在多智能体游戏中为LLM代理构建自然语言状态表示，解决了现有方法的不一致性和可比性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLM代理在游戏中的状态表示采用临时方法，缺乏系统性，影响行为分析和研究间的可比性。

Method: 通过三个维度（动作信息性、奖励信息性和提示风格）系统化状态表示方法，并应用于动态自私路由游戏中验证。

Result: 发现特定状态表示（如总结历史、提供后悔信息而非原始收益、限制他人动作信息）使LLM代理行为更接近博弈论均衡预测。

Conclusion: 状态表示对LLM代理行为有显著影响，系统性框架有助于优化代理表现和游戏稳定性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic
settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language
representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically
constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents
in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken
an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact
of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability
between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods
of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the
extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward
informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes
rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,
the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it
admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments
\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find
that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language
state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which
provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language
representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw
payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior
that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more
stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit
either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play
over time, or both.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术的广泛应用，AI伦理和政策的重要性日益凸显，但现有计算机科学课程未能充分培养学生应对这些挑战的能力。

Method: 开发了AI政策模块，并在课程中引入AI政策讨论，通过前后调查评估学生态度变化。

Result: 学生表现出对AI伦理影响的更多关注，并对参与AI政策讨论的能力更有信心。

Conclusion: AI政策模块是有效的教育工具，强调了政策在解决AI伦理挑战中的作用。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings
across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid
not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI
technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary
computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI
practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical
principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of
AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the
ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future
constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI
engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new
expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI
policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in
this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version
of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present
the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student
attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys.
Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical
impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their
abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight
the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring
the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing
ethical challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs在模拟人类思考时存在过度推理（生成冗余内容）的问题，导致效率低下和推理成本增加。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）Efficiency Steering，一种无需训练的激活导向技术；2）Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL，一种动态平衡任务准确性和简洁性的强化学习框架。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，方法显著减少了推理长度，同时保持或提升了任务性能。

Conclusion: 通过引导模型内在能力，可以自指导地提升推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly
enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating
human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit
overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant
content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work,
we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency,
revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning.
Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in
length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped
efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight
methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a
training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior
via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop
Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct
solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly
reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our
results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and
guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

Result: 在六项任务中表现优异，旅行规划任务上相对ADAS提升261.8%。

Conclusion: SwarmAgentic为可扩展和自主的代理系统设计迈出重要一步。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in
decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system
generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent
generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting
adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully
automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from
scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as
interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable
efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a
population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates,
drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our
method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving
high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given
only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all
baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the
TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in
structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step
toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm
intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation. Our code is
publicly released at https://yaoz720.github.io/SwarmAgentic/.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc有效提升3D语义占用预测性能，兼顾语义和几何信息。

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,

TLDR: 论文提出了DAVID-X数据集和DAVID-XR1模型，用于提供细粒度的AI生成视频检测和解释性推理，解决了现有方法在透明度和可验证性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成视频在媒体平台上的普及，可靠区分合成内容与真实视频的需求变得紧迫且重要。现有方法仅将其视为二分类任务，缺乏对检测结果的详细解释。

Conclusion: 该方法将AI生成视频检测从黑盒决策转变为透明、可验证的诊断过程，展示了可解释检测方法在可信识别AI生成内容中的潜力。

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

TLDR: MonoVQD是一种基于DETR的单目3D检测新框架，通过Mask Separated Self-Attention、Variational Query Denoising和自蒸馏策略，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DETR在单目3D检测中的固有局限性，提升性能。

Method: 提出三种创新：Mask Separated Self-Attention机制、Variational Query Denoising技术和自蒸馏策略。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优异，具有广泛适用性。

Conclusion: MonoVQD通过创新方法显著提升了单目和多视角3D检测的性能。

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central
challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于结构化指令的迭代优化方法ChartIR，用于提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在图表到代码生成任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在图表到代码生成任务中表现不佳，需要同时具备精确的视觉理解和代码翻译能力。

Method: 将任务分解为视觉理解和代码翻译两部分，设计结构化指令（描述和差异）以转换视觉特征为语言表示，并采用两阶段生成与迭代优化流程。

Result: 实验表明，ChartIR在开源模型Qwen2-VL和闭源模型GPT-4o上均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: ChartIR通过结构化指令和迭代优化显著提升了MLLMs在图表到代码生成任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域，构建图像分类模型困难，现有ICL方法忽视了图像嵌入模型的关键作用。

Method: 系统研究不同视觉编码器类型、预训练目标和微调策略对少样本分类性能的影响。

Result: PictSure在跨域任务上优于现有ICL方法，同时在域内任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 嵌入模型的预训练方式对少样本分类性能至关重要，PictSure为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于数学和实证的框架BKSEF，用于优化CNN中逐层核大小的选择，显著提升模型精度并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核大小选择对CNN性能至关重要，但常被忽视。本文旨在通过BKSEF框架解决这一问题。

Method: BKSEF结合信息论、信号处理和学习理论，平衡信息增益、计算效率和精度提升。

Result: 实验表明，BKSEF在多个数据集上提升精度达3.1%，减少FLOPs达42.8%，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: BKSEF为CNN设计提供了新的优化视角，适用于神经架构搜索和实时系统。

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的零售视频自动标注方法，通过关键帧识别和自动标注，显著降低人工成本并保持标注质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统零售视频标注依赖人工，成本高且效率低，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 利用深度神经网络学习视频帧特征，结合目标检测技术，实现关键帧识别和自动标注。

Result: 方法准确性接近人工标注，效率提升2倍，人工仅需验证5%的帧。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低零售视频标注成本，适用于多种零售应用场景。

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D重建中如何选择最具信息量的视角以减少冗余并提升效率的问题。

Result: 仅需一半视角即可达到与上限相当的精度，计算速度提升400倍，资源消耗减少50%以上。

Conclusion: UPNet方法在高效性和泛化性上表现优异，适用于新物体类别且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

Conclusion: DPO-Kernels在模型校准和安全性方面表现优异，为未来研究提供了新工具和基准。

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated
images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models
(LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces
DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three
dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with
traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized
Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet
kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe
and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's
default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and
R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce
DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately
100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE
encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and
Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images
generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable
Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality
Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of
safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically,
we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are
publicly released.

Result: 在5个多图像基准和3个单图像基准上，PeRL显著优于现有方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: PeRL在多图像任务中表现出色，同时在单图像任务中保持竞争力。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 扩散模型在敏感领域（如医学成像）的应用引发了隐私问题，现有MIA方法因图像固有难度和模型在高频细节重建上的不足而受限。

Method: 通过分析反向扩散过程，聚焦中频范围的重建误差，排除高频和低频区域，计算结构相似性指数得分，并与阈值比较确定成员关系。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上的实验表明，FCRE方法优于现有MIA方法。

Conclusion: FCRE方法有效解决了医学图像扩散模型的隐私风险评估问题，为敏感数据提供了更可靠的保护。

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using
public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep
learning research in this domain.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

TLDR: StyleWallfacer是一个统一的训练和推理框架，解决了传统风格迁移方法的问题，支持艺术家级风格迁移和文本驱动风格化。通过语义风格注入、数据增强策略和无训练的三重扩散过程，实现了高质量的风格迁移和内容保持。

Motivation: 传统风格迁移方法存在多种问题，如风格注入效率低、内容漂移等。本文旨在通过统一框架解决这些问题，并支持更多任务，如文本驱动风格化和图像颜色编辑。

Method: 1. 提出基于语义的风格注入方法，利用BLIP生成与风格图像语义对齐的文本描述，并通过大语言模型移除风格相关描述，创建语义间隙以优化模型。2. 设计基于人类反馈的数据增强策略，提升模型训练效果。3. 提出无训练的三重扩散过程，通过替换自注意力层的键和值实现风格注入，同时保留文本控制。

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer框架在风格迁移领域取得了显著进展，支持多种任务，为艺术家级风格迁移提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

Result: 实验和理论分析验证了方法的有效性，实现了近100%的码本利用率。

Conclusion: 通过Wasserstein距离对齐分布，显著改善了向量量化的性能。

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: SynPo通过优化提示选择，显著提升了无训练少样本医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Conclusion: PDSA模块有效解决了点云分析中的问题，实验和可视化结果验证了其合理性和有效性。

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have
revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical
applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in
echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.
However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and
ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise
diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a
unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a
multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.
Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial
integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously
validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It
achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.
The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram
segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in
other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across
various medical domains. Project page: https://abdur75648.github.io/Echo-DND

Motivation: 现有技术仅解决视觉搜索中的检索或定位问题，无法同时满足需求。

Method: 引入ReSeDis任务，结合检索与定位，并设计基准和评估指标。

Result: 提出了零-shot基线方法，显示未来研究空间大。

Conclusion: ReSeDis为构建下一代多模态搜索系统提供了实用测试平台。

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT
datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current
limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and
practical adoption, we openly release our code.

Result: 实验证明PSIC能有效保护隐私，同时保持图像质量，并可无缝集成到现有LIC模型中。

Conclusion: PSIC是一种灵活、高效的隐私保护图像压缩方案，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

Conclusion: DM-FNet通过统一的多模态融合框架，显著提升了医学图像融合的质量和信息密度。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code
is available at https://github.com/HeDan-11/DM-FNet.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate

this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and
all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing.
Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small
offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore
ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement
and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional
Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to
enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the
AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale
feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The
experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the
proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets,
robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

Result: 在Tanks&Temple和NeRFBuster数据集上，RA-NeRF在相机姿态估计和视觉质量上均达到最优。

Conclusion: RA-NeRF在复杂相机轨迹下表现出色，为场景重建提供了高精度和鲁棒性的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏显式机制获取历史上下文，限制了其在复杂伪装场景中的适应性和有效性。

Method: 采用两阶段训练范式（学习阶段和回忆阶段），设计了DMA和DMM/IPR组件，动态整合历史知识与当前样本上下文。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，RetroMem显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: RetroMem通过动态整合历史知识，有效提升了伪装场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在真实电子显微镜图像上验证了方法的有效性，证明了DA技术在半导体领域的实用性。

Conclusion: DBACS方法能有效提升DA技术在半导体领域的性能，减少资源消耗并提高效率。

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world
Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for
the semiconductor field.

TLDR: MSNeRV提出了一种多尺度特征融合框架，用于神经视频表示，解决了现有INR方法在细节密集和快速变化视频内容中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INR方法在细节密集和快速变化视频内容中表现不佳，主要原因是网络内部特征利用不足和缺乏视频特定设计。

Method: 提出多尺度特征融合框架MSNeRV，包括时间窗口增强时间一致性、GoP级网格背景表示、多尺度空间解码器和自适应损失函数，以及多尺度特征块。

Result: 在HEVC ClassB和UVG数据集上，MSNeRV在INR方法中表现出色，压缩效率超过VTM-23.7（随机访问）。

Conclusion: MSNeRV通过多尺度特征融合显著提升了视频表示和压缩性能，尤其在动态场景中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Conclusion: BCRNet为腹腔镜手术中的解剖标志检测提供了高效解决方案，代码将公开。

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations
on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code

Abstract: Visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks is critical for preventing
equipment damage due to procedural errors and ensuring worker safety. Although
commercial solutions exist, they typically require rigid workspace setups or
the application of visual markers to simplify the problem. We introduce ViMAT,
a novel AI-driven system for real-time visual monitoring of assembly tasks that
operates without these constraints. ViMAT combines a perception module that
extracts visual observations from multi-view video streams with a reasoning
module that infers the most likely action being performed based on the observed
assembly state and prior task knowledge. We validate ViMAT on two assembly
tasks, involving the replacement of LEGO components and the reconfiguration of
hydraulic press molds, demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and
qualitative analysis in challenging real-world scenarios characterized by
partial and uncertain visual observations. Project page:

Conclusion: 结合多模态大语言模型的新任务有望提升微表情分析的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that
occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to
suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes
environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the
areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional
approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are
suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic
settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues
for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that
reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize
(ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified
sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which
explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs
or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating
algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为OpenPath的新型开放集主动学习方法，用于病理图像分类，通过结合预训练的视觉语言模型（VLM）和任务特定提示，有效减少标注成本并提升模型性能。


<details>

Motivation: 在病理图像分类中，传统主动学习方法假设未标注数据均属于目标类别，而实际临床环境中存在大量分布外（OOD）数据，导致标注效率低下。此外，传统方法首轮随机选择样本浪费标注成本。

Method: OpenPath在首轮查询中使用任务特定提示选择分布内（ID）和信息丰富的样本；后续查询中采用多样性信息ID采样（DIS），包括原型ID候选选择（PIS）和熵引导随机采样（EGSS），确保样本纯度和信息量。

Conclusion: OpenPath通过高效选择ID样本和避免OOD样本，解决了开放集主动学习中的标注效率问题，为病理图像分类提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

Result: 在VideoCount数据集上验证，CountVid显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CountVid和VideoCount数据集为开放世界物体计数提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the
CountVid model, and all the code are available at

Conclusion: 几何感知纹理映射方法显著提升了动物个体重识别的准确性，尤其在复杂姿势和视角下表现优异。

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal
and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification
accuracy.

Conclusion: DDIS通过扩散模型和领域对齐指导，显著提升了数据自由图像合成的质量，为相关应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

Conclusion: NERO通过神经元级相关性和新颖的距离度量，显著提升了OOD检测能力，同时支持可解释性检测，为医学影像的可靠性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Method: 第一阶段使用Object-AnchorNet从3D HOI数据集中学习重建稀疏3D HOI关键帧；第二阶段通过Contact-Aware Diffusion Model（ContactDM）插值生成密集4D HOI序列。

Result: 在OMOMO和3D-FUTURE数据集上取得了最先进的结果，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GenHOI框架有效解决了4D HOI合成的数据依赖问题，并实现了高质量的生成效果。

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI
generation.

Motivation: 解决LGE图像稀缺和标签质量不一的问题，提升心肌瘢痕分割模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用SMILE模块（基于临床知识的瘢痕掩膜生成）和扩散模型生成解剖一致的瘢痕图像，结合联合训练优化分割网络。

Conclusion: CLAIM实现了可控且真实的心肌瘢痕合成，对下游医学影像任务有实用价值。

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar
labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this,
we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables
controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated
utility for downstream medical imaging task.

TLDR: RaCalNet提出了一种无需密集监督的毫米波雷达深度估计框架，通过稀疏LiDAR监督实现高精度深度预测，显著降低数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖密集LiDAR监督，成本高且数据密集，RaCalNet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过稀疏雷达点校准和优化构建深度先验，指导单目深度预测，避免密集监督。

Result: 在ZJU-4DRadarCam数据集和实际场景中，RMSE分别降低35.30%和34.89%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RaCalNet在稀疏监督下实现了高精度深度估计，结构一致性和细节保留表现优异。

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,
producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.
Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment
scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%,
respectively.

Result: 实验表明，WinWinLay在元素布局控制和视觉真实感上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WinWinLay通过创新策略显著提升了布局到图像生成的质量和可控性。

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 超高空间分辨率土地覆盖分类因标注成本高、尺度变化大和大规模视觉模型适应性有限而具挑战性。

Method: 采用半监督分割框架，结合SAM2和FreqWeaver Adapter，高效利用未标注数据。

Result: 在结构一致性和分割精度上优于现有方法，分别提升1.78%和3.44%。

Conclusion: 该方法在参数效率和性能上均表现出色，适用于高分辨率遥感影像分割。

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for
fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high
cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited
adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on
1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas
practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under
weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient
semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,
which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution
remote sensing segmentation approaches.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于图的新框架，用于大规模点云的端到端处理，显著提高了森林地上生物量（AGB）估计的可行性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前定量结构模型（QSM）方法依赖高质量点云数据且预处理步骤复杂，限制了其可扩展性和实际应用。

Method: 通过创新的基于图的流程，无缝集成树木分割、叶-木分离和3D骨架重建，使用路径和抽象等图操作进行树拓扑推理。

Result: 在多种条件下（如叶覆盖、不同空间尺度和数据源）验证表现优异，叶覆盖场景相对误差约20%，低密度ULS数据约30%。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模AGB估计提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，减少了对预处理工具的依赖，并确立了ULS作为TLS的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为DLoRAL的双LoRA学习范式，用于在视频超分辨率（Real-VSR）中同时实现丰富的空间细节和时序一致性。通过交叉帧检索（CFR）模块和一致性LoRA（C-LoRA）模块提取时序先验，再通过细节LoRA（D-LoRA）增强空间细节，最终合并两个LoRA分支实现高效高质量的视频恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于稳定扩散（SD）的Real-VSR方法在保持时序一致性时牺牲了空间细节，导致视觉质量不佳。论文旨在解决如何从低质量视频中提取鲁棒的时序一致性先验，并在增强细节的同时保持这些先验。

Method: 提出DLoRAL范式，分两阶段训练：1）使用CFR和C-LoRA提取时序一致性；2）固定CFR和C-LoRA，训练D-LoRA增强空间细节。两阶段交替优化，最终合并LoRA分支。

Result: 实验表明，DLoRAL在精度和速度上均表现优异，能够生成细节丰富且时序一致的视频。

Conclusion: DLoRAL通过双LoRA学习范式，成功实现了视频超分辨率中细节增强与时序一致性的平衡，为Real-VSR任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督多模态图像配准方法在处理高度异质性模态时效果不佳，相似性度量无法捕捉对齐关系。

Method: 提出M2M-Reg框架，利用单模态相似性训练多模态配准模型，并引入GradCyCon正则化器促进微分同胚。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上，M2M-Reg在PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准中的DSC比现有方法提高了2倍。

Conclusion: M2M-Reg有效解决了高度异质性多模态配准问题，且无需真实变换或分割掩码。

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有3D检测方法依赖密集点云重建，计算和内存开销大，难以实时部署。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和CA-1M数据集上达到SOTA性能，支持超1000平方米环境的实时感知。

Conclusion: 该框架无需重建，计算高效，泛化能力强，适用于实时3D检测。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在真实性和物理正确性之间的权衡问题，生成更高质量的HOI。

Method: 采用Diffusion Noise Optimization（DNO）在预训练扩散模型的噪声空间中优化，分为物体中心阶段和人体中心阶段。

Result: 在GRAB数据集上，HOIDiNi在接触精度、物理有效性和整体质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOIDiNi能够生成复杂且可控的交互动作，仅通过文本驱动即可实现。

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在处理长期记忆任务时能力有限，尤其是在机器人控制场景中，需要更高效的机制来整合长期经验。

Result: 基准测试能够评估模型在长期记忆任务中的表现，并展示了现有模型的局限性。

Conclusion: 该工作为长期记忆和推理任务的评估提供了新工具，并指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉输入质量如何影响MLLMs的表现，并解决现有模型对图像质量的非人类偏好问题。

Method: 通过控制图像退化与风格变化，测试MLLMs表现；提出VQ-TTT模块，动态调整输入图像。

Result: VQ-TTT显著提升了MLLMs在所有数据集上的平均准确率，无需额外数据或模型。

Conclusion: MLLMs需要自适应的视觉输入，而非普遍“干净”的图像，为AI数据需求提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,

and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

TLDR: ViMaR是一种两阶段推理框架，通过结合时间差分价值模型和边缘感知奖励调整，提升视觉语言模型的效率和输出保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法计算成本高且易产生低置信度生成，导致幻觉问题。

Method: ViMaR分两阶段：首阶段筛选高价值候选描述，次阶段选择性优化弱视觉基础部分。

Result: ViMaR生成更可靠、准确且详细的描述，速度提升4倍，并能跨模型泛化。

Conclusion: ViMaR具有灵活性、可扩展性，并能通过自训练提升模型性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

Result: 模型在多样场景中表现出强泛化能力，视觉保真度和时间一致性优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合优化提升了重光照任务的性能，适用于复杂光照和材质交互场景。

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

TLDR: ECAD是一种基于遗传算法的缓存调度方法，显著加速扩散模型的推理，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型推理速度慢且计算成本高，现有方法依赖固定启发式规则，效果有限。

Method: 提出ECAD，利用遗传算法学习高效的缓存调度策略，无需修改模型参数。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，ECAD显著提升推理速度（如2.58倍）并改善生成质量（如COCO FID提升4.47）。

Conclusion: ECAD是一种可扩展且通用的扩散模型加速方法，适用于不同模型和分辨率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

Motivation: 生物神经元网络中突触延迟的调制在学习过程中起关键作用，但在SNN中很少被模拟。

Result: 新方法在多种测试场景中表现优于现有方法，并揭示了突触效能与延迟的相互作用。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在SNN中有效模拟了突触延迟，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where
their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the
realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to
emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do,
synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a
novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths
and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian
method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by
extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised
learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing
it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays
as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of
test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the
interplay between synaptic efficacy and delay.

Main category: quant-ph

TLDR: 量子机器学习（QML）结合量子计算与机器学习，利用量子力学原理提升经典方法。尽管NISQ设备限制引发质疑，本研究通过评估量子神经网络（QNNs）证明其优于经典方法，在风能预测中达到93%准确率。

Motivation: 探讨QML的实际优势，回应因NISQ设备限制引发的质疑。

Method: 构建12种QNN配置，结合两种量子特征映射和六种纠缠策略，在风能数据集上进行实验。

Result: 使用Z特征映射的QNNs在风能预测中达到93%准确率，优于经典方法。

Conclusion: QNNs在预测任务中表现优异，展现了QML的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of
quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine
learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as
entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the
practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns
by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired
counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their
effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and
evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum
feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz
design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs
employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when
forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings
show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring
the potential of QML in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NISQ硬件的限制（如电路深度和连接性）阻碍了量子优势的验证和关键问题（如贫瘠高原）的实证研究。电路切割技术虽能执行更大电路，但增加了采样开销。

Method: 在QML优化过程中引入新的正则化项，直接惩罚采样开销，使优化器能平衡电路切割的优势与ML成本函数的优化。

Result: 该方法成功平衡了切割开销与模型精度，为研究更大复杂问题以实现量子优势铺平了道路。

Conclusion: 通过正则化项优化采样开销与模型精度的权衡，为QML在NISQ硬件上的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question.
The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and
connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical
investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting
techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on
smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However,
this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the
expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to
estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel
regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the
overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables
the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the
optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the
trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall
accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in
pursuit of quantum advantage.

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation,
data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of
their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect
visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information
conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual
bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause
obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data
graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good
understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is
essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz
libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz
libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our
study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a
detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in
DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,
which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.
Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test
oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in
designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent
advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of
applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show
that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%,
depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not
necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our
manuscript.

Method: 使用NPM代码片段数据集（185,412个包，1,024,579个片段），选取400个样本进行手动分类和LLM评估。

Result: 55.5%的原始描述为示例用途；LLM正确识别79.75%的示例描述；生成描述的平均相似度为0.7173，显示相关性但需改进。

Conclusion: 代码片段文档的意图因任务而异，LLM在描述生成上有潜力但需进一步提升。

Abstract: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both
developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and
other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important
for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the
key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and
evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description
generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with
1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their
descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the
majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This
finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions
lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified
the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical
to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared
to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of
0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9
indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the
code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions
for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a
library.

Result: 评估显示，现有模型易受滥用和提示注入攻击，且偶尔会执行不安全操作。

Conclusion: OS-Harm为计算机使用代理的安全性提供了标准化评估工具，揭示了现有模型的安全缺陷。

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a
graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees.
While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely
overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential
for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap,
we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use
agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test
models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt
injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150
tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright
infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to
interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,
etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and
safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and
0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier
models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide
insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply
with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt
injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is
available at https://github.com/tml-epfl/os-harm.

Abstract: Ferry quays experience rapid deterioration due to their exposure to harsh
maritime environments and ferry impacts. Vibration-based structural health
monitoring offers a valuable approach to assessing structural integrity and
understanding the structural implications of these impacts. However, practical
limitations often restrict sensor placement at critical locations.
Consequently, virtual sensing techniques become essential for establishing a
Digital Twin and estimating the structural response. This study investigates
the application of the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual
sensing on the Magerholm ferry quay, combining in-operation experimental data
collected during a ferry impact with a detailed physics-based model. The
proposed Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrates a reduced-order
structural model with a data-driven GPLFM representing the unknown impact
forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for
the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact
characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary
conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM
provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under
simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during
the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone.
A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor
placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types,
sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios. The results
suggest that the GP latent forces can help accommodate modeling and measurement
uncertainties, maintaining acceptable estimation accuracy across scenarios.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，CI4GI显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: CI4GI通过建模兴趣协同演化，有效提升群体识别性能。

Abstract: With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of users are
joining group activities on online social platforms. This elicits the
requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to
users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level
interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution
relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further
prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to
align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this
collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level
interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples
when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative
evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a
Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we
design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of
users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a
supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between
interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative
samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples
during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.

*Han Wu,Junyao Li,Kangbo Zhao,Sen Zhang,Yukai Shi,Liang Lin*

TLDR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的一次性人脸素描合成方法，解决了数据稀缺和高成本问题，并引入了新的基准数据集OS-Sketch。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量数据训练，数据稀缺时性能下降，且成本高。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能一次性将多种照片转换为高质量素描，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法更便捷且适用性更广，数据集将公开。

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into
sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training
with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these
large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as
data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes
scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we
propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We
optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image
pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are
used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and
evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new
benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark
consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with
different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,
expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we
select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used
for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can
convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a
one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater
convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:

TLDR: 提出了一种基于稀疏、松散附着IMU传感器的全身姿态估计任务，通过模拟数据和扩散模型解决，结合服装参数提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设IMU传感器紧密附着于人体，但实际场景中常不成立，需解决松散附着问题。

Method: 模拟松散IMU数据，开发基于Transformer的扩散模型，结合服装参数训练。

Result: 在模拟和合成数据上训练的扩散模型在定量和定性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来研究提供了新方向，尤其在松散附着IMU场景中表现优越。

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

TLDR: Nabla-R2D3是一个基于强化学习的3D扩散模型对齐框架，利用2D奖励信号高效生成高质量3D资产。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型（如扩散模型）在遵循指令、对齐人类偏好及生成逼真纹理、几何和物理属性方面存在不足。

Method: 基于Nabla-GFlowNet方法，通过2D奖励信号对3D扩散模型进行高效对齐和微调。

Result: 实验表明，Nabla-R2D3在少量微调步骤内能获得更高奖励并减少先验遗忘，优于传统微调基线。

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成模型提供了一种高效对齐方法，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）是全球糖尿病患者视力损害的主要原因，传统诊断方法耗时且资源密集。研究旨在通过边缘AI技术提供一种高效、低成本的实时检测方案。

Method: 研究使用TensorFlow设计了多种卷积神经网络（如MobileNet、ShuffleNet等），并通过数据增强和归一化预处理技术优化模型。模型被量化为8位整数以减少大小并提升推理速度。

Result: MobileNet准确率达96.45%，SqueezeNet模型仅176KB，延迟17ms。其他模型在资源效率上表现优异，适用于低端设备。

Conclusion: 边缘AI技术为DR早期检测提供了可扩展、低成本的解决方案，尤其适用于资源受限和偏远地区的医疗环境。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in
individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients
globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045.
Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus
images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study
presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning
models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over
3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was
curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation
and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural
Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The
models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to
reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in
accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms,
including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as
inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet
achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time
performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU.
ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in
resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This
integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable,
cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate
diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

TLDR: FAHR-Face是一个基于4000万张面部图像训练的基础模型，用于生物年龄估计和生存风险预测，在独立测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过面部外观非侵入性地评估健康和疾病风险。

Method: FAHR-FaceAge通过两阶段年龄平衡微调训练，FAHR-FaceSurvival在癌症患者照片上微调，测试了模型鲁棒性和独立性。

Result: FAHR-FaceAge在公共数据集上平均绝对误差5.1年，FAHR-FaceSurvival预测死亡率风险最高组是低风险组的三倍。

Conclusion: 单一基础模型可生成低成本、可扩展的面部生物标志物，用于生物衰老和疾病风险预测。

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We
built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and
fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)
and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on
749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of
cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)
and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were
clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival
analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic
factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error
of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining
accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge
outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.
FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the
highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest
(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the
independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,
race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary
prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct
facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved
prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable
facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related
mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using
relatively small clinical datasets.

Motivation: 解决T2加权MRI图像中前列腺分割的读者间变异性和跨站点域偏移问题，探索Transformer模型在此类异质性数据中的表现。

Method: 使用UNETR和SwinUNETR模型，基于546个MRI体积数据，采用三种训练策略（单队列、5折交叉验证混合队列和腺体大小分组）进行实验，并通过Optuna优化超参数。

Result: SwinUNETR在多种训练策略下表现优于UNETR和基线3D UNet，尤其在腺体大小分组数据中Dice分数显著提升。

Conclusion: 全局和移位窗口自注意力机制有效减少了标签噪声和类别不平衡敏感性，SwinUNETR在临床部署中表现出高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic
segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study
investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such
heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate
gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI
(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training
strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed
cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The
test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation
endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,
while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared
to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR
had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in
cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for
Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;
Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed
poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention
effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in
improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining
computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR
for clinical deployment.

Result: 生成的3D血管模型在半径、长度和弯曲度等方面与真实数据高度相似，适用于医学训练和模拟。

Conclusion: RvNN首次用于血管合成，生成的模型准确且多样，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant
challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most
existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite
providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they
fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We
developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the
hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold
encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target
surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new
vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we
generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which
is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many
other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high
similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets,
including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical
data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders
(NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid
in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage
multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal
clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a
novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND
classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our
framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within
volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted
feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically
integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.
Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate
that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,
particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework
achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by
over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying
multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Result: DenseNet-121在内部数据集上F1-score和准确率分别为0.966和0.972，外部数据集上表现也优于其他模型。

Conclusion: DenseNet-121在分类mpMRI序列任务中表现出色，适用于临床实践。

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series
types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these
series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols
and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep
learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series
types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from
various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet,
EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and
their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is
identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different
training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the
out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using
mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and
its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121
model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the
other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than
0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose
performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the
external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and
0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and
external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of
classifying 8 body MRI series types.

Motivation: 医疗图像包含敏感信息，需隐私保护；同态加密虽能保护隐私，但计算成本高，尤其对大图像（如胸片）。

Method: 使用VQGAN压缩图像为潜在表示，多项式逼近激活函数，结合压缩因子8优化性能与计算成本，并改进挤压激励模块。

Result: 在胸片多标签分类任务中，HE推理虽较慢且性能略有下降，但方法显示出实际应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架在保护隐私的同时，显著降低了HE推理的计算负担，适合医疗图像应用。

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong
privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server
for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by
allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the
original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive,
particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose
an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images
into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational
burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions
with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in
compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of
eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and
computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which
is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method
was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks
using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and
introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference,
our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative
medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust
predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of
Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges,
including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical
institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose
FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn
and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates
synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all
centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to
histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the
distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic
slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted
to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined
with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI
classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that
FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI
classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a
highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is
available at FedWSIDD.

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced
operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while
substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently,
single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor
measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical
diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures
associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections
caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,
the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,
requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.
In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a
constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture
details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain
is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog
signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors
collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic
images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image
sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:
fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.
Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that
synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced
learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宫颈癌早期检测至关重要，但CNN性能受图像质量影响，因此研究预处理技术以优化分类效果。

Method: 评估了PMD滤波器、CLAHE及混合PMD-CLAHE预处理技术，并在多个预训练CNN模型上测试。

Result: 混合预处理方法显著提升了分类指标，最高提升13.62%准确率。

Conclusion: 混合PMD-CLAHE技术为CNN在宫颈癌分类中的性能提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in
developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment.
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical
cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality.
This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on
CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset.
Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD)
filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization
(CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained
models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2,
EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results
show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image
quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The
maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision,
13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer
classification performance using CNN architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI分割模型依赖大型公共数据集，缺乏对本地患者群体的适应性，因此需要开发针对本地数据的模型以支持临床部署。

Method: 采用混合UNet-Transformer架构，结合多种注意力模块和预训练权重，通过数据增强和高效计算优化模型训练。

Conclusion: 研究表明，针对特定站点的模型开发对临床部署至关重要，尤其是在数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize
to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding
normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent
AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets,
which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies
advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is
necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into
hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and
execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally
efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We
developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and
preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model
generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset
of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based
convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary
attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)
blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To
accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum
batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights,
training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome
Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset
yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union
(IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and
underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical
deployment.

Main category: cs.MM

TLDR: 本文提出了一种针对360度视频的超分辨率方法S3PO，解决了传统VSR技术无法处理的球形失真问题，并创建了新的数据集360VDS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360度视频在VR中广泛应用，但其空间分辨率有限，影响视觉质量。传统VSR技术无法处理球形失真，且缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 提出S3PO模型，采用循环建模和注意力机制，设计专用特征提取器和损失函数以解决球形失真。

Result: S3PO在360度视频数据集上优于现有VSR模型和360度专用超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: S3PO通过针对性设计和优化，有效提升了360度视频的超分辨率效果。

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual
Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences.
However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for
each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual
quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video
Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a
promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the
distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals.
An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets
for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video
Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models
to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model
for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal
Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent
modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques
like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss
function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most
state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific
super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study
is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen
architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

Motivation: 为音乐数据库提供准确的描述，推动音乐AI研究，通过多任务学习直接捕捉音乐的底层声学细节和高层属性。

Method: 采用投影架构将音频输入转换为语言标记，同时通过辅助头检测音乐特征，并将特征输出投影为语言标记以增强标题生成。

Conclusion: SonicVerse通过多任务学习和特征整合，显著提升了音乐描述的丰富性和实用性。

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动处理大规模音频数据效率低下，需要自动化工具来支持野生动物监测。

Method: 利用自动化录音设备（ARUs）收集数据，并通过PNW-Cnet模型进行自动化信号检测。

Result: PNW-Cnet模型已扩展至检测约80种森林野生动物及多种人为和环境噪声。

Conclusion: pycnet-audio为声学数据提供了一种高效的处理流程，适用于大规模野生动物监测项目。

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that
leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs).
The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed
schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are
retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or
analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic
indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings,
e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species,
anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is
required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small
datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce
audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review
impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio
(Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic
data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the
U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls
(Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins
2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of
ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and
environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the
intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications,
especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various
deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise
suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation,
leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation.
This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and
U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These
models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code
accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise
suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and
+364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality,
attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it
well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech.
Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific
feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and
+27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize
trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker
recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics,
forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in
challenging acoustic conditions.

Conclusion: 通过选择适当的时间步长，可以在不改变模型的情况下有效编辑乐器音色。

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the
creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition
and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation
process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.
Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can
drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the
application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.
Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained
text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the
underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the
overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,
and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen
intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a
balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the
desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the
text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's
speed.

Abstract: Offensive Robot Cybersecurity introduces a groundbreaking approach by
advocating for offensive security methods empowered by means of automation. It
emphasizes the necessity of understanding attackers' tactics and identifying
vulnerabilities in advance to develop effective defenses, thereby improving
robots' security posture. This thesis leverages a decade of robotics
experience, employing Machine Learning and Game Theory to streamline the
vulnerability identification and exploitation process. Intrinsically, the
thesis uncovers a profound connection between robotic architecture and
cybersecurity, highlighting that the design and creation aspect of robotics
deeply intertwines with its protection against attacks. This duality -- whereby
the architecture that shapes robot behavior and capabilities also necessitates
a defense mechanism through offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies --
creates a unique equilibrium. Approaching cybersecurity with a dual perspective
of defense and attack, rooted in an understanding of systems architecture, has
been pivotal. Through comprehensive analysis, including ethical considerations,
the development of security tools, and executing cyber attacks on robot
software, hardware, and industry deployments, this thesis proposes a novel
architecture for cybersecurity cognitive engines. These engines, powered by
advanced game theory and machine learning, pave the way for autonomous
offensive cybersecurity strategies for robots, marking a significant shift
towards self-defending robotic systems. This research not only underscores the
importance of offensive measures in enhancing robot cybersecurity but also sets
the stage for future advancements where robots are not just resilient to cyber
threats but are equipped to autonomously safeguard themselves.

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral control is a powerful sampling-based approach
suitable for complex robotic tasks due to its flexibility in handling nonlinear
dynamics and non-convex costs. However, its applicability in real-time,
highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands.
This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments
standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity
analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These
gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without
requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two
robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven
terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard
computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly
improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency
operation suitable for complex robotic systems.

Conclusion: FEAST成功满足了个性化需求，展示了在真实场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of
millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal
assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g.,
eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV),
food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we
propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized
in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed
in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative
study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three
key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and
safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that
enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii)
diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and
physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences,
and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently
adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the
personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating
that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and
outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To
demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two
care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each
across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity
by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the
system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their
individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast

including agriculture, logistics, and disaster management. In this paper, we
examine the use of drones for assisting visually impaired people (VIPs) in
navigating through outdoor urban environments. Specifically, we present a
perception-based path planning system for local planning around the
neighborhood of the VIP, integrated with a global planner based on GPS and maps
for coarse planning. We represent the problem using a geometric formulation and
propose a multi DNN based framework for obstacle avoidance of the UAV as well
as the VIP. Our evaluations conducted on a drone human system in a university
campus environment verifies the feasibility of our algorithms in three
scenarios; when the VIP walks on a footpath, near parked vehicles, and in a
crowded street.

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中，RIP比现有IL方法任务成功率至少提高26%。

Conclusion: RIP在低数据场景下表现优异，为机器人任务提供了更可靠的轨迹生成方法。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously
by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called
In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant
policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform
a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale
demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined
by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally
generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning
algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's
t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of
instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP
generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an
LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial
for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory
against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both
simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success
rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks. Video results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM方法依赖RGB-D或单目相机，视野窄、易受遮挡且深度感知有限，导致物体建模不准确和数据关联不可靠。

Method: 整合点特征和物体级地标，引入语义-几何-时间融合策略，设计全向闭环模块，构建分层3D场景图。

Result: 实验证明MCOO-SLAM在真实场景中实现了精确定位和可扩展的物体级建图，对遮挡、姿态变化和环境复杂性具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MCOO-SLAM通过多相机配置和语义增强，显著提升了复杂户外场景中的SLAM性能。

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment
representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level
robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or
monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion
sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor
environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only
partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate
object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose
MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully
leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent,
and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach
integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with
open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is
introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to
improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop
closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition
using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted
into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks.
Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves
accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved
robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

Motivation: 可变形物体的动态建模因物理特性多样和视觉信息有限而具有挑战性。

Method: 采用粒子-网格混合表示，粒子捕捉物体形状，空间网格确保空间连续性，结合高斯渲染生成3D视频。

Result: 模型能从稀疏RGB-D记录中学习多种物体的动态，并在类别级别泛化到未见实例，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为可变形物体的数字孪生和任务规划提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their
diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from
limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics
framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid
representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion
information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of
objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,
while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity
and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual
rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of
deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse
objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from
sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also
generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,
particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase
the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling
goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks. The project page

### [279] [Context-Aware Deep Lagrangian Networks for Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15249)
*Lucas Schulze,Jan Peters,Oleg Arenz*

Main category: cs.RO

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于上下文感知的深度拉格朗日网络（DeLaN）方法，结合在线系统识别和模型预测控制（MPC），用于机器人自适应控制，显著降低了跟踪误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂环境中，全局物理模型难以适用，且物理属性不确定，因此需要上下文感知的在线模型识别方法。

Method: 扩展DeLaN为上下文感知模型，结合递归网络进行在线系统识别，并与MPC集成；同时引入残差动力学模型以利用机器人名义模型。

Result: 在7自由度机械臂轨迹跟踪实验中，该方法将末端执行器跟踪误差降低了39%，优于基线方法的21%改进。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的DeLaN结合在线识别和MPC，显著提升了复杂环境下的机器人控制性能。

Abstract: Controlling a robot based on physics-informed dynamic models, such as deep
Lagrangian networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and
interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments,
the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical
properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a
single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system
identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant
aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation
of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility
for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,
particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model
Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it
context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system
identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed
control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the
fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our
method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our
method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21%
improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

Main category: cs.DC

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于概率需求图（PDGraph）的LLM应用服务系统Hermes，通过优化调度顺序和预热后端，显著提升了服务效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将LLM应用的资源需求视为黑箱，导致端到端效率低下，无法有效应对动态需求。

Method: 利用PDGraph建模资源需求，应用Gittins策略优化调度顺序，并基于模型预热后端。

Result: 实验表明，Hermes将平均完成时间降低70%以上，P95完成时间降低80%以上。

Conclusion: Hermes通过PDGraph和智能调度，显著提升了LLM应用的服务效率。

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks
to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic
demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource
demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency
due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the
resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate
manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which
leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting
probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to
determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application
completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends
at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that
Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the
average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80%.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于LLM的代理应用缓存方法，通过提取和重用结构化计划模板，显著降低了服务成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM缓存技术（如上下文缓存和语义缓存）主要针对聊天机器人设计，无法满足依赖外部数据或环境上下文的代理应用需求。

Method: 提出代理计划缓存，从已完成代理执行中提取计划模板，通过关键词匹配和轻量模型适配新任务。

Result: 在多个实际代理应用中，平均降低成本46.62%，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM代理服务提供了高效解决方案，可与现有基础设施互补。

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

*Nikolay Blagoev,Oğuzhan Ersoy,Lydia Yiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TLDR: 论文提出CheckFree和CheckFree+方法，通过加权平均邻近阶段或无序流水线执行，高效恢复LLM训练中的节点故障，减少计算和存储开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低在分散计算节点上训练LLM的成本和实现模型民主化，但节点故障导致模型部分丢失，传统恢复方法开销大。

Method: CheckFree用邻近阶段加权平均替代故障阶段；CheckFree+通过无序流水线执行和复制权重恢复首尾阶段故障。

Result: 在低至中等故障率下，CheckFree和CheckFree+比传统方法收敛速度快12%以上。

Conclusion: CheckFree系列方法高效且开销低，适用于大规模LLM训练。

Abstract: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple
on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization.
The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the
operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the
model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use
checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an
additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield
significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases
and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,
CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by
a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state
of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,
because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover
failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+
with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last
stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is
mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by
simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover
the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring
stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively
evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with
varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates
(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant
computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our
proposals can be run via our code available at:
https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

TLDR: 论文提出CUE模型，将解释属性与认知子过程（可读性、可理解性、可解释性）关联，并通过实验验证了可访问性优化的局限性，支持自适应XAI界面的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在关键决策中的作用增强，对可理解的解释需求增加。当前XAI评估常忽视认知可访问性，尤其是对视觉障碍用户的影响。

Method: 提出CUE模型，研究不同热图配色方案（BWR、Cividis、Coolwarm）对用户任务表现和信心的影响，实验样本N=455。

Result: 任务表现相似，但视觉障碍用户的信心和努力程度较低；可访问性优化的配色方案（如Cividis）未改善甚至加剧差距。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了感知优化的假设，支持自适应XAI界面的需求，并验证了CUE模型。贡献包括：形式化的认知模型、人类中心解释属性的定义、实证证据支持可访问性XAI。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need
for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable
AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which
critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We
propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking
explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception),
readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study
(N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we
found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually
impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes
worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results
challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for
adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering
explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a
formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated
definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence
motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAI领域快速发展，但研究人员通常使用临时开发的界面进行研究，这些界面未被共享，限制了实验的可重用性和复现性。

Method: 设计并实现WebXAII，一个基于网络的平台，能够完整呈现实验协议并记录参与者响应，通过结构化配置文件实现灵活的实验设计。

Result: WebXAII成功复现了一项前沿研究的实验协议，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: WebXAII为XAI交互研究提供了灵活且易于使用的工具，有助于提升研究的可重用性和复现性。

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to
facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by
the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in
particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study
the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc
interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not
shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and
the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement
WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols,
meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants
and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a
composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of
flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so
that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We
demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by
reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The
framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content
at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation
along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying
representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without
having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along
demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general
public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work
addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based
character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the
Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze
visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of
age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for
presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to
seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the
AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our
visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics
from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also
indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic
categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in
AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they
were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code,
benchmarking, and data from the user study can be found here:

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects
focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare,
social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI,
achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For
example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to
co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often
difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects
"fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to
transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique
challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within
the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily
applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized
in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse
challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that
prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground.
Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers -
complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research
- this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in
developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic
analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication,
collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While
there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies
drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we
hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and
partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful
AI collaborations.

Abstract: Generative AI, specifically text-to-image models, have revolutionized
interior architectural design by enabling the rapid translation of conceptual
ideas into visual representations from simple text prompts. While generative AI
can produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for
designers In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3
with a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability
metrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior
design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present
and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general
materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate
environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system
through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to
the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated
to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along
with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our
qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of
sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design
decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall
satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating
sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring
the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible
practices. Our findings showcase the importance of balancing design freedom
with practical constraints, offering a clear path toward holistic, data-driven
solutions in AI-assisted architectural design.

Abstract: Family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (AD/ADRD) face significant emotional and logistical challenges that
place them at heightened risk for stress, anxiety, and depression. Although
recent advances in generative AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs)
-- offer new opportunities to support mental health, little is known about how
caregivers perceive and engage with such technologies. To address this gap, we
developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and
emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we
conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following
scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through
inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic
understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes --
on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure,
crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes,
we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and
concerns. We present a mapping of caregiver needs, AI chatbot's strengths,
gaps, and design recommendations. Our findings offer theoretical and practical
insights to inform the design of proactive, trustworthy, and caregiver-centered
AI systems that better support the evolving mental health needs of AD/ADRD
caregivers.

Abstract: Surveys are a cornerstone of Information Systems (IS) research, yet creating

new opportunities emerge to automate survey generation. This paper presents the
real-world deployment of an LLM-powered system designed to accelerate data

quality control. We evaluate the system using the DeLone and McLean IS Success
Model to understand how generative AI can reshape a core IS method. This study
makes three key contributions. To our knowledge, this is the first application
of the IS Success Model to a generative AI system for survey creation. In
addition, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework combining automated and
human assessments. Finally, we implement safeguards that mitigate
post-deployment risks and support responsible integration into IS workflows.

Abstract: Visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR) can easily be unreliable

DR-based visual analytics reliable. However, the diversity and extensiveness of
the literature can leave novice analysts and researchers uncertain about where
to begin and proceed. To address this problem, we propose a guide for reading
papers for reliable visual analytics with DR. Relying on the previous
classification of the relevant literature, our guide helps both practitioners
to (1) assess their current DR expertise and (2) identify papers that will
further enhance their understanding. Interview studies with three experts in DR
and data visualizations validate the significance, comprehensiveness, and
usefulness of our guide.

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI,
i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial
perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external
representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional
AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the
challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We
empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the
Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference
mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention
naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,
always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that
human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization
accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared
sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the
MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical
evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based
interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that
learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual
experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models have brought a radical change in the process of remote

retrieval of remote learning resources lacks depth in contextual meaning that
provides comprehensive information on complex student queries. This work

more intuitive and productive manner using CoT reasoning and prompt
engineering. The framework we propose puts much emphasis on increasing the
precision and relevance of the retrieval results to return comprehensive and
contextually enriched explanations and resources that best suit each student's
needs. We also assess the effectiveness of our approach against paradigmatic
LLMs and report improvements in user satisfaction and learning outcomes.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种形式化模型，用于分析去中心化金融（DeFi）借贷协议的经济和策略动态，旨在解决其复杂激励机制的潜在问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeFi借贷协议缺乏传统信任机制，依赖复杂的链上激励机制，可能导致不稳定或恶意行为，需要形式化分析。

Method: 提出一个形式化模型，捕捉主流借贷平台的核心特征，以证明其经济和策略动态的关键属性。

Result: 模型能够识别和验证借贷协议的经济和策略动态的关键性质。

Conclusion: 形式化模型为DeFi借贷协议的安全性和稳定性提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Lending protocols are one of the main applications of Decentralized Finance
(DeFi), enabling crypto-assets loan markets with a total value estimated in the
tens of billions of dollars. Unlike traditional lending systems, these
protocols operate without relying on trusted authorities or off-chain
enforcement mechanisms. To achieve key economic goals such as stability of the
loan market, they devise instead trustless on-chain mechanisms, such as
rewarding liquidators who repay the loans of under-collateralized borrowers by
awarding them part of the borrower's collateral. The complexity of these
incentive mechanisms, combined with their entanglement in low-level
implementation details, makes it challenging to precisely assess the structural
and economic properties of lending protocols, as well as to analyze user
strategies and attacks. Crucially, since participation is open to anyone, any
weaknesses in the incentive mechanism may give rise to unintended emergent
behaviours, or even enable adversarial strategies aimed at making profits to
the detriment of legit users, or at undermining the stability of the protocol.
In this work, we propose a formal model of lending protocols that captures the
essential features of mainstream platforms, enabling us to identify and prove
key properties related to their economic and strategic dynamics.

Abstract: The explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as GPT-4 with 1.8
trillion parameters - demands a radical rethinking of data center architecture
to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a
comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth
and capacity, multiple network topologies (two-tier vs. FullFlat optical), the
size of the scale-out domain, and popular parallelism/optimization strategies
used in LLMs. We introduce and evaluate FullFlat network architectures, which
provide uniform high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between all nodes, and
demonstrate their transformative impact on performance and scalability. Through
detailed sensitivity analyses, we quantify the benefits of overlapping compute
and communication, leveraging hardware-accelerated collectives, wider scale-out
domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of
experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices
affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens
per sec / Peak flops of the hardware) and overall throughput. For the co-design
study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of
predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements. Our findings
offer actionable insights and a practical roadmap for designing AI data centers
that can efficiently support trillion-parameter models, reduce optimization
complexity, and sustain the rapid evolution of AI capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统从头算分子动力学（MD）模拟中计算成本高的问题，探索MLFF的优化方法。

Method: 使用GemNet-T图神经网络模型，比较直接训练和预训练后微调两种策略。

Result: 两种策略均实现低力误差（5 meV/A），但预训练模型模拟稳定性更高，轨迹持续时间延长三倍。

Conclusion: 预训练对提升模拟稳定性至关重要，力误差并非稳定性的唯一指标。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution
for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate
force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this
work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and
investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples)
without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset
followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force
mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower
force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the
pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability,
sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from
scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse
datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE
alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.

TLDR: DisProtEdit是一个可控的蛋白质编辑框架，通过双通道自然语言监督学习解耦的结构和功能表示，提供模块化和可解释的控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖联合整体嵌入，缺乏对蛋白质结构和功能语义的明确分离，限制了编辑的模块化和可解释性。

Method: 构建SwissProtDis数据集，利用大语言模型自动分解蛋白质序列的结构和功能文本描述；通过对齐和一致性目标对齐蛋白质与文本嵌入，并使用解耦损失促进语义独立性。

Result: 在蛋白质编辑和表示学习基准测试中表现优异，多属性编辑基准测试的成功率达61.7%。

Conclusion: DisProtEdit在保持竞争力的同时，显著提升了蛋白质编辑的可解释性和可控性。

Abstract: We introduce DisProtEdit, a controllable protein editing framework that
leverages dual-channel natural language supervision to learn disentangled
representations of structural and functional properties. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly
separates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To
support this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where
each protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for
structure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language
model. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and
uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence
between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing
is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated
latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation
learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with
existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability.
On a newly constructed multi-attribute editing benchmark, the model achieves a
both-hit success rate of up to 61.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in
coordinating simultaneous structural and functional edits.

TLDR: 提出了一种多源观测降尺度模型（MODS），通过融合多源卫星和地形数据，提高气象变量降尺度的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降尺度方法主要依赖单一卫星数据，无法全面捕捉气象变量变化，导致结果偏离实际。

Method: MODS是一种条件扩散模型，融合多源卫星数据（GridSat、AMSU-A、HIRS、MHS）和地形数据（GEBCO），通过多源交叉注意力模块提取特征并融合到ERA5数据中。

Result: 实验表明，MODS在将ERA5数据降尺度至6.25 km分辨率时具有更高的保真度。

Conclusion: MODS通过多源数据融合显著提升了气象变量降尺度的准确性和真实性。

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of high-resolution surface meteorological conditions is
critical for forecasting and simulating meteorological variables. Directly
applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at
specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that
deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods
primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites
and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data
from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the
changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation,
we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its
inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more
realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve
the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we
propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a
conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary
satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and
topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5
reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional
inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source
cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between
reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates
atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During
sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution
ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental
results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5
maps to a 6.25 km resolution.

Motivation: 预测未来神经活动是建模大脑动态的核心挑战，对科学研究和闭环神经技术有重要应用。目前多会话自发记录的神经预测研究较少。

Method: POCO结合单变量预测器和群体级编码器，捕捉神经元特异性和全脑动态。在斑马鱼、小鼠和线虫的五个钙成像数据集上训练。

Result: POCO在自发行为中达到细胞分辨率的最先进精度，预训练后能快速适应新记录。其单元嵌入无需解剖标签即可恢复生物有意义结构。

Conclusion: POCO为跨会话神经预测提供了可扩展和适应性强的解决方案，为未来模型设计和神经基础模型的大规模研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain
dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to
closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity
emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural
forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains
underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a
lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture
both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium
imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors.
After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal
fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically
meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical
labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing
performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing.
Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for
cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model
design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural
dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive
neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of
protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed
protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for
fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein
foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies.
However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models,
hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically,
researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how
well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in
developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks
spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17
state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent
correlations between tasks, identifies top-performing models, and provides a
streamlined evaluation protocol. Code is available at

Result: 理论证明了自注意力机制的不变性，并通过分层组织和稀疏性分析展示了其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 研究为可解释性分析和网络应用（如剪枝和架构比较）提供了理论基础和方法支持。

Abstract: We examine the intrinsic (within the attention head) and extrinsic (amongst
the attention heads) structure of the self-attention mechanism in transformers.
Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax
activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is
supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic
organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing
methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network
structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query,
key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential
since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a
geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify
this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree
comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and
quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion
coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect
to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and
heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and
methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and
language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a
subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can
be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use
the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as
model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture
comparison.

Result: WCED模型在零样本和微调任务中表现优于或匹配现有方法（如scGPT）。

Conclusion: BMFM-RNA为系统基准测试和社区驱动的TFM训练策略探索提供了可重复的基础，有助于开发更有效的工具。

Abstract: Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful
tools for analyzing gene expression in cells and tissues, supporting key tasks
such as cell-type annotation, batch correction, and perturbation prediction.
However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across
recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution
of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This
hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the
reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an
open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and
fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability,
we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED),
which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS
bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported
input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model
checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language
modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking
capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance
that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than
a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available
as part of the biomed-multi-omics project (
https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible
foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of
optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective
tools to leverage the latest advances in AI for understanding cell biology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过排序非凸惩罚促进变量聚类，同时减少系数收缩，解决稀疏信号恢复中的变量分组问题。

Method: 使用排序非凸惩罚（如SLOPE的推广），并区分弱凸和非凸情况，分别采用PAV算法及其改进版计算近端算子。

Result: 在弱凸情况下（如排序MCP和SCAD），PAV算法能精确计算近端算子；在非凸情况下（如排序Lq），改进的PAV算法高效。

Conclusion: 实验证明了排序非凸惩罚的实际价值，为稀疏信号恢复提供了新工具。

Abstract: This work studies the problem of sparse signal recovery with automatic
grouping of variables. To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties
as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a
family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm
(SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to
their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of
coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal
operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite
optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish
between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the
proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where
computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial
problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how
the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal
operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that
a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to
tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new
theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We
demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several
experiments.

Motivation: 解决非光滑分布式优化问题中通信效率低的问题，同时利用目标函数的相似性提高性能。

Abstract: We propose two first-order methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed
optimization problems, hereafter called Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding
(MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS). Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take
advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the
communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can
communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These
three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual
formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in
Lan et al. (2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at
potentially different rates.
  To find an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms
achieve optimal dependency on $\epsilon$: MT-GS needs
$O(\overline{r}A/\epsilon)$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/\epsilon^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and
AMT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu})$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/(\epsilon\mu))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also
$\mu$-strongly convex. Here, $\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of
updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients
of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds
on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive
answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for
non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).

Motivation: 探讨AI驱动的技术进步可能带来的重大挑战，如大规模杀伤性武器、AI专制等，并提出当前应采取的措施。

Method: 通过分析AI可能引发的快速变化，提出应对这些“重大挑战”的策略。

Result: 指出这些挑战不能完全依赖未来AI系统解决，当前需采取行动。

Conclusion: AGI准备不仅关乎AI对齐，还需为智能爆炸带来的广泛变化做好准备。

Abstract: AI that can accelerate research could drive a century of technological
progress over just a few years. During such a period, new technological or
political developments will raise consequential and hard-to-reverse decisions,
in rapid succession. We call these developments grand challenges. These
challenges include new weapons of mass destruction, AI-enabled autocracies,
races to grab offworld resources, and digital beings worthy of moral
consideration, as well as opportunities to dramatically improve quality of life
and collective decision-making. We argue that these challenges cannot always be
delegated to future AI systems, and suggest things we can do today to
meaningfully improve our prospects. AGI preparedness is therefore not just
about ensuring that advanced AI systems are aligned: we should be preparing,
now, for the disorienting range of developments an intelligence explosion would
bring.

TLDR: 提出了一种定量框架，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在多项选择调查中模拟人类行为时的偏差，发现某些模型在模拟特定人群时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在社会科学研究中的应用增多，需评估其模拟人类行为的准确性。

Method: 使用假设检验，开发定量框架评估LLMs与人类行为的偏差。

Result: 发现流行语言模型在模拟特定人群（如不同种族、年龄、收入）时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需改进LLMs在社会科学研究中的应用，避免简单模拟人类行为。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

Main category: cs.CY

TLDR: 论文提出Transit for All (TFA)框架，通过预测自行车共享需求和改进可达性指标，指导公平扩展自行车共享系统，减少低收入和少数族裔社区的交通不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高密度城市（如纽约）中低收入和少数族裔社区的公共交通不平等问题，自行车共享系统可作为补充但缺乏有效的扩展策略。

Method: TFA框架包含三部分：基于地理数据的自行车需求预测、改进的可达性评估（wPTAL）、以及考虑公平性的新站点选址建议。

Result: 在纽约案例中，TFA指导的新站点显著减少了经济与人口因素导致的交通不平等。

Conclusion: TFA为城市规划者提供了促进交通公平的工具，提升服务不足社区的生活质量。

Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in
densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and
minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing
systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and
last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved
neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly
planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional
accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We
introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to
guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1)
spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using
region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2)
comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted
Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted
bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3)
strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider
potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we
identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income
and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results
show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces
disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From
our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban
planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in
underserved urban communities.

TLDR: FORTRESS是一个专家设计的评估框架，用于测试大型语言模型在国家安全和公共安全（NSPS）领域的防护能力，揭示了模型在风险与实用性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试未能客观评估大型语言模型在NSPS领域的防护能力，因此需要一种更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 开发了FORTRESS，包含500个专家设计的对抗性提示和评分标准，覆盖化学、生物、放射、核与爆炸（CBRNE）、政治暴力与恐怖主义、犯罪与金融非法活动三个领域。

Result: 不同模型在风险与实用性之间表现出不同权衡，例如Claude-3.5-Sonnet风险低但过度拒绝率高，而Gemini 2.5 Pro风险高但拒绝率低。

Conclusion: FORTRESS为政策制定者和研究者提供了清晰的模型风险评估工具，并公开了数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use
capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public
safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse
relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information.
However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to
potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500
expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary
questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information
only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE),
Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities,
with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a
corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation
of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between
potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low
average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score
(ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but
a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at
78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even
trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and
ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding
of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/fortress_public. We also maintain a
private set for evaluation.

*Jaehong Chung,Michael Manga,Timothy Kneafsey,Tapan Mukerji,Mengsu Hu*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的深度学习模型，用于预测微地震（MEQs）的时空演化，应用于增强地热系统（EGS）等领域，取得了高精度的预测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测微地震的时空演化对于增强地热系统、CO₂封存等应用至关重要，但现有方法难以实现高精度和实时性。

Method: 使用Transformer模型，结合水力压裂历史和微地震观测数据，预测MEQ数量、地震矩及MEQ云的分布范围。

Result: 在EGS Collab实验数据上，模型在1秒和15秒预测范围内R²分别超过0.98和0.88，并提供不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该模型能实时推断裂缝扩展和渗透率变化，展示了深度学习在降低地震风险和指导缓解策略中的潜力。

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the
evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full
spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as
enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other
geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning
model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to
forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic
seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of
the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model
achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the
15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty
estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate,
uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture
propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of
deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide
mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

Motivation: 高时空分辨率预测暴力冲突是研究和政策制定的核心挑战。

Conclusion: 该模型适用于早期预警系统和人道主义响应规划，具有广泛扩展潜力。

Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains
a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents
a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of
violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational
(priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs
classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and
expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions
to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies
with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing
approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on
historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn
complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also
highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly
forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for
early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based
peacebuilding initiatives.

Conclusion: DrRL结合了SL和CCL的优势，有效解决了它们的局限性，提升了推荐系统性能。

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among
various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are
particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant
in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these
losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be
viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust
Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)
Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution
distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false
negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which
generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.
DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be
demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation
accuracy and robustness.

Result: 网络能准确预测梯度系统的非线性失真，提升图像质量和扩散参数映射。

Conclusion: 时间卷积网络比现有线性方法更准确建模梯度系统行为，可用于校正梯度误差。

Abstract: Summary: Errors in gradient trajectories introduce significant artifacts and
distortions in magnetic resonance images, particularly in non-Cartesian imaging
sequences, where imperfect gradient waveforms can greatly reduce image quality.
Purpose: Our objective is to develop a general, nonlinear gradient system model
that can accurately predict gradient distortions using convolutional networks.
Methods: A set of training gradient waveforms were measured on a small animal
imaging system, and used to train a temporal convolutional network to predict
the gradient waveforms produced by the imaging system. Results: The trained
network was able to accurately predict nonlinear distortions produced by the
gradient system. Network prediction of gradient waveforms was incorporated into
the image reconstruction pipeline and provided improvements in image quality
and diffusion parameter mapping compared to both the nominal gradient waveform
and the gradient impulse response function. Conclusion: Temporal convolutional
networks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing
linear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN假设时间-频率模式是对称且刚性的，而作者探讨了非对称核的潜力，发现自适应视图能更好地与注意力机制结合。

Method: 在Conformer架构中用可变形卷积（Deformer）替代深度CNN，分析其局部感受野和全局注意力图。

Result: Deformer在WSJ eval92数据集上相对WER提升了5.6%（无LM）和6.4%（有LM）。

Conclusion: 可变形卷积能更灵活地捕捉特征，显著提升语音识别性能。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved speech recognition
performance greatly by exploiting localized time-frequency patterns. But these
patterns are assumed to appear in symmetric and rigid kernels by the
conventional CNN operation. It motivates the question: What about asymmetric
kernels? In this study, we illustrate adaptive views can discover local
features which couple better with attention than fixed views of the input. We
replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable
counterpart, dubbed this "Deformer". By analyzing our best-performing model, we
visualize both local receptive fields and global attention maps learned by the
Deformer and show increased feature associations on the utterance level. The
statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the
change of information in features with the network depth. Finally, replacing
only half of the layers in the encoder, the Deformer improves +5.6% relative
WER without a LM and +6.4% relative WER with a LM over the Conformer baseline
on the WSJ eval92 set.

Conclusion: 自适应掩码方法高效且灵活，适用于多语言ASR模型剪枝，性能优越且减少语言特定剪枝需求。

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a
multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance
loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to
be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive
masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model
efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse
multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically
adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network
structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when
targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR
Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a
single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network
initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

Result: 在WSJ和SWB数据集上，MixRep相比SpecAugment基线，WER相对降低6.5%和6.7%。

Conclusion: MixRep是一种简单有效的低资源ASR数据增强方法，显著优于其他正则化方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present MixRep, a simple and effective data augmentation
strategy based on mixup for low-resource ASR. MixRep interpolates the feature
dimensions of hidden representations in the neural network that can be applied
to both the acoustic feature input and the output of each layer, which
generalizes the previous MixSpeech method. Further, we propose to combine the
mixup with a regularization along the time axis of the input, which is shown as
complementary. We apply MixRep to a Conformer encoder of an E2E LAS
architecture trained with a joint CTC loss. We experiment on the WSJ dataset
and subsets of the SWB dataset, covering reading and telephony conversational
speech. Experimental results show that MixRep consistently outperforms other
regularization methods for low-resource ASR. Compared to a strong SpecAugment
baseline, MixRep achieves a +6.5\% and a +6.7\% relative WER reduction on the

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that prompting large language models (LLM)

However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel
audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research.
In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that
leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech
recognition, source localization, and bystander cross-talk suppression. To
enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key
techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive
direction data augmentation (CDDA). Experimental results show that our proposed
directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual
cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition

Method: HAC利用HuBERT和LaBSE进行知识蒸馏，分别学习音素和词汇层次的结构。

Result: 实验表明HAC的分层瓶颈能解耦语音表示，保留自然性并提供可解释的语义信息。

Conclusion: HAC作为一种统一的离散语音表示，有望在语音生成和理解任务中发挥作用。

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems

structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model
pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to
low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data
implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential
solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required.
We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives,
including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful
construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method
generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural
vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design
heuristic and genetic optimization. The code and data are available from

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂URLLC场景中表现出高效性，提升了网络容量和资源分配效率。

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable,
low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks.
We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a
CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference
coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static
priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring
to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission
opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is
performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling
more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and
schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\%, 94\%, and
49\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its
effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.

*Bahram Yaghooti,Chengyu Li,Bruno Sinopoli*

TLDR: 提出了一种数据集成框架，用于学习分数阶非线性系统的动态特性，验证了其有效性并比较了分数阶与整数阶模型的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分数阶非线性系统的动态特性，解决其记忆依赖性和长程依赖性问题。

Method: 分两步：设计输入输出实验生成数据集；利用数据集和记忆依赖性估计分数阶，重构漂移和控制向量场。

Result: 框架能准确学习系统动态，分数阶模型比整数阶模型更能捕捉长程依赖性。

Conclusion: 分数阶模型在描述复杂系统动态方面优于整数阶模型。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of
fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time
settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step,
input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for
learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector
field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along
with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to
estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are
then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed
approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems.
The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the
system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn
equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that
fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
the limitations of integer-order representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图滤波器难以处理具有树状分支结构的层次图，因此需要一种新的分析方法。

Method: 引入边界加权算子，根据端点向图的Gromov边界漂移的距离重新缩放每条边，并利用Busemann函数证明谱范数的上界。

Result: 证明了信号在每次通过时会损失曲率控制的能量，滤波器具有参数无关、轻量级的特点。

Conclusion: 该滤波器基于几何原理稳定，为具有层次结构的图信号处理提供了新工具。

Abstract: Hierarchical graphs often exhibit tree-like branching patterns, a structural
property that challenges the design of traditional graph filters. We introduce
a boundary-weighted operator that rescales each edge according to how far its
endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on
delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's
spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy
at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose
stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new
analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden
hierarchical structure.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）代理的自动超参数调优方法，用于改进WS-PSO-CM算法在无人机通信中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前WS-PSO-CM算法的超参数调优方法依赖启发式，自动化程度低且性能不佳。

Method: 设计了一个LLM代理，通过迭代框架和模型上下文协议（MCP）自动调优超参数。

Result: 实验表明，LLM代理生成的超参数在最小和速率上显著优于人工启发式和随机生成方法。

Conclusion: 具备PSO知识和WS-PSO-CM背景的LLM代理能有效找到高性能超参数。

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of
communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for
warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM)
algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and
communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of
automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large
language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an
iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In
particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the
mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the
prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for
exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and
returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal
sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is
significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation
methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM
algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在无线接收器自适应方面存在灵活性不足或需要显式优化的问题，ICL提供了一种新的解决方案。

Result: ICL在无梯度条件下实现了高效的接收器自适应，适用于大规模MIMO网络。

Conclusion: ICL是一种高效且理论支持的自适应方法，适用于实时无线接收器优化。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless
receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge
traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware
architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically
adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies,
including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either
demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through
gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques
rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review
architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured
state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence
models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we
explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing
both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that
ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver
adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without
requiring online retraining.

Result: SimBank能够生成每个干预行动的真实结果，支持全面的评估，并通过实验展示了其基准测试能力。

Conclusion: SimBank作为公开可用的模拟器，对推动PresPM研究和实践具有重要价值。

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process
Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for
effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations
seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces
two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and
insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce
SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods.
Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive
comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a
variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of
complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges,
such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank
additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case,
it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not
possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel
activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely
resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates
SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM
methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly
available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在高维数据分类任务中，如何利用组合假设和Tsybakov噪声条件，提升分类器的性能，并为ReLU深度神经网络的优异表现提供理论支持。

Method: 在组合假设下，将条件类概率函数建模为多个向量值多元函数的组合，并利用Tsybakov噪声条件推导最优收敛率。通过ReLU深度神经网络和铰链损失实现该收敛率。

Result: 证明了最优收敛率与输入维度无关，且ReLU深度神经网络可以接近该最优率，为高维分类任务提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 组合假设和Tsybakov噪声条件为高维分类任务提供了有效的理论框架，ReLU深度神经网络在实践中表现优异，且理论结果具有独立意义。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the binary classification problem on $[0,1]^d$ under
the Tsybakov noise condition (with exponent $s \in [0,\infty]$) and the
compositional assumption. This assumption requires the conditional class
probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$
vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a
maximum value function or a H\"{o}lder-$\beta$ smooth function that depends
only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly
smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions,
the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$
\left( \frac{1}{n}
\right)^{\frac{\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}{{\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\frac{1}{s+1})\cdot\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}}}\;\;\;,
$$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we
demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can
achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. This result
provides theoretical justification for the excellent performance of ReLU DNNs
in practical classification tasks, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
The technique used to establish these results extends the oracle inequality
presented in our previous work. The generalized approach is of independent
interest.

Motivation: 传统两阶段CMR估计器在第一阶段估计直接用于第二阶段时会导致严重偏差，尤其是在使用深度神经网络（DNN）时。

Method: 提出DML-CMR算法，采用双/去偏机器学习（DML）框架，设计新的学习目标以减少偏差。

Result: DML-CMR在参数化和温和正则条件下实现了最小最优收敛率$O(N^{-1/2})$，并在真实数据集上表现出色。

Conclusion: DML-CMR在CMR问题中表现优异，优于现有方法，适用于工具变量回归和近端因果学习等任务。

Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in
statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a
function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities.
Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental
variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems.
Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation
is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest.
However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in
the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR
estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where
regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage
CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate
guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the
DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML)
framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal
convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity
conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of
problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal
learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance
against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.

Abstract: Clustering and estimating cluster means are core problems in statistics and
machine learning, with k-means and Expectation Maximization (EM) being two
widely used algorithms. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for
the failure of k-means in high-dimensional settings with high noise and limited
sample sizes, using a simple Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We identify regimes
where, with high probability, almost every partition of the data becomes a
fixed point of the k-means algorithm. This study is motivated by challenges in
the analysis of more complex cases, such as masked GMMs, and those arising from
applications in Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

Method: 通过形式化分析，确定了recourse explanations在表演性条件下保持有效的条件，特别关注非因果变量的影响。

Result: 研究发现，若recourse actions受非因果变量影响或干预，可能导致解释失效。

Conclusion: 结论建议避免使用标准反事实解释和因果recourse方法，推荐仅基于因果变量的recourse方法。

Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse
explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input
features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is
that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according
to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical
regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision
boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own
recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of
implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In
this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse
explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse
actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on
non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of
standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead
advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal
variables.

<details>

Conclusion: 该方法在时间依赖密度估计和样本生成方面表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method to learn the time-dependent probability
density of a multivariate stochastic process from sample paths, assuming that
the initial probability density is known and can be evaluated. Our method uses
a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive
estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between
realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants.
Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent
probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value
of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally,
the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a
second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of
the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the
time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic
excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a
random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we
generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants.
Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the
necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit
approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through
applications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical
experiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex
time-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively
to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among
real-world data.

Conclusion: 随机集成的隐式正则化效果比显式正则化更复杂，为理解随机森林提供了新视角。

Abstract: Combining randomized estimators in an ensemble, such as via random forests,
has become a fundamental technique in modern data science, but can be
computationally expensive. Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves
predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the
context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of
greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling
-- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset.
We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly
improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful
numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as
lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to
prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show
via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and
degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve
of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of
orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the
ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic
weights, thereby enlarging the model search space. These results enhance our
understanding of random forests and suggest that implicit regularization in
general may have more complicated effects than explicit regularization.

Abstract: The identifiability problem for interventions aims at assessing whether the
total effect of some given interventions can be written with a do-free formula,
and thus be computed from observational data only. We study this problem,
considering multiple interventions and multiple effects, in the context of time
series when only abstractions of the true causal graph in the form of summary
causal graphs are available. We focus in this study on identifiability by a
common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without
consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also
provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is
identifiable or not.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，经济叙事的研究兴趣增加，但现有NLP方法缺乏深层次语义理解，无法区分经济叙事提取与传统任务（如语义角色标注）。

Method: 通过分析《华尔街日报》和《纽约时报》关于通胀的文章，使用GPT-4提取叙事，并与专家标注的黄金标准进行比较。

Result: GPT-4能够以结构化格式提取有效的经济叙事，但在处理复杂文档和叙事时仍不及专家水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在经济研究中具有潜力，但需进一步改进以应对复杂任务，并提供了未来研究的指导。

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.
