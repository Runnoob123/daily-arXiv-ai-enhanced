### [1] [Post-Quantum Cryptography: An Analysis of Code-Based and Lattice-Based Cryptosystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08791)
*Alexander Meyer*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文探讨了量子计算对现代密码系统的威胁，并分析了两种抗量子密码方案：McEliece密码系统和NTRU密码系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算机可能破解现有密码系统（如RSA和Diffie-Hellman），因此需要研究抗量子替代方案。

Method: 研究了McEliece（基于编码）和NTRU（基于格）两种密码系统的结构及其安全性。

Result: McEliece和NTRU均被认为是抗量子的候选方案，分别基于解码线性码和最短向量问题的困难性。

Conclusion: 论文通过比较两种系统的结构和安全性，为抗量子密码研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Most modern cryptographic systems, such as RSA and the Diffie-Hellman Key
Exchange, rely on "trapdoor" mathematical functions that are presumed to be
computationally difficult with existing tools. However, quantum computers will
be able to break these systems using Shor's Algorithm, necessitating the
development of quantum-resistant alternatives. We first examine the McEliece
cryptosystem, a code-based scheme believed to be secure against quantum attacks
due to the hardness of decoding arbitrary linear codes. We then explore NTRU, a
lattice-based system grounded in the difficulty of solving the Shortest Vector
Problem. Finally, we establish connections between the structural foundations
and security of the two systems.

### [2] [Measuring Security in 5G and Future Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08799)
*Loay Abdelrazek,Rim ElMalki,Filippo Rebecchi,Daniel Cho*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种状态机模型，用于测量和监控5G及未来网络的安全状态，通过三个关键安全指标计算整体安全评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速发展的数字生态系统中，5G和6G网络是关键基础设施，其安全性至关重要，需要客观测量和监控。

Method: 引入状态机模型，捕捉网络功能的安全生命周期和状态转换，计算局部或整体的安全评分。

Result: 识别了三个核心安全指标，提供了对安全态势的整体理解，支持动态威胁环境下的安全管理。

Conclusion: 该方法为5G和6G网络的安全管理和决策提供了实用基础。

Abstract: In today's increasingly interconnected and fast-paced digital ecosystem,
mobile networks, such as 5G and future generations such as 6G, play a pivotal
role and must be considered as critical infrastructures. Ensuring their
security is paramount to safeguard both individual users and the industries
that depend on these networks. An essential condition for maintaining and
improving the security posture of a system is the ability to effectively
measure and monitor its security state. In this work we address the need for an
objective measurement of the security state of 5G and future networks. We
introduce a state machine model designed to capture the security life cycle of
network functions and the transitions between different states within the life
cycle. Such a model can be computed locally at each node, or hierarchically, by
aggregating measurements into security domains or the whole network. We
identify three essential security metrics -- attack surface exposure, impact of
system vulnerabilities, and effectiveness of applied security controls -- that
collectively form the basis for calculating the overall security score. With
this approach, it is possible to provide a holistic understanding of the
security posture, laying the foundation for effective security management in
the expected dynamic threat landscape of 6G networks. Through practical
examples, we illustrate the real-world application of our proposed methodology,
offering valuable insights for developing risk management and informed
decision-making strategies in 5G and 6G security operations and laying the
foundation for effective security management in the expected dynamic threat
landscape of 6G networks.

### [3] [TokenProber: Jailbreaking Text-to-image Models via Fine-grained Word Impact Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08804)
*Longtian Wang,Xiaofei Xie,Tianlin Li,Yuhan Zhi,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: TokenProber是一种用于评估文本到图像（T2I）模型中拒绝机制鲁棒性的方法，通过生成对抗性提示来绕过安全检查器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型可能生成不适宜内容（NSFW），现有拒绝机制存在漏洞，需评估其鲁棒性。

Method: TokenProber通过敏感性感知差异测试，分析提示中特定词汇的影响，生成对抗性提示。

Result: TokenProber在5个安全检查器和3个T2I模型上测试，平均绕过率提高54%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TokenProber能有效揭示拒绝机制的鲁棒性问题，为改进安全机制提供依据。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly advanced in producing
high-quality images. However, such models have the ability to generate images
containing not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as pornography, violence,
political content, and discrimination. To mitigate the risk of generating NSFW
content, refusal mechanisms, i.e., safety checkers, have been developed to
check potential NSFW content. Adversarial prompting techniques have been
developed to evaluate the robustness of the refusal mechanisms. The key
challenge remains to subtly modify the prompt in a way that preserves its
sensitive nature while bypassing the refusal mechanisms. In this paper, we
introduce TokenProber, a method designed for sensitivity-aware differential
testing, aimed at evaluating the robustness of the refusal mechanisms in T2I
models by generating adversarial prompts. Our approach is based on the key
observation that adversarial prompts often succeed by exploiting discrepancies
in how T2I models and safety checkers interpret sensitive content. Thus, we
conduct a fine-grained analysis of the impact of specific words within prompts,
distinguishing between dirty words that are essential for NSFW content
generation and discrepant words that highlight the different sensitivity
assessments between T2I models and safety checkers. Through the
sensitivity-aware mutation, TokenProber generates adversarial prompts, striking
a balance between maintaining NSFW content generation and evading detection.
Our evaluation of TokenProber against 5 safety checkers on 3 popular T2I
models, using 324 NSFW prompts, demonstrates its superior effectiveness in
bypassing safety filters compared to existing methods (e.g., 54%+ increase on
average), highlighting TokenProber's ability to uncover robustness issues in
the existing refusal mechanisms.

### [4] [Security of Internet of Agents: Attacks and Countermeasures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08807)
*Yuntao Wang,Yanghe Pan,Shaolong Guo,Zhou Su*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文综述了物联网代理（IoA）的安全与隐私问题，分析了其架构、漏洞及防御机制，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言和视觉语言模型的兴起，AI代理发展为自主交互系统，但IoA的安全与隐私问题亟待解决。

Method: 通过分析IoA架构及其与传统网络的差异，聚焦身份认证威胁、跨代理信任、实体安全和隐私风险四大方面，并回顾防御机制。

Result: 总结了现有防御机制的局限性，并指出IoA生态系统的安全与隐私挑战。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，以推动弹性和隐私保护的IoA生态系统发展。

Abstract: With the rise of large language and vision-language models, AI agents have
evolved into autonomous, interactive systems capable of perception, reasoning,
and decision-making. As they proliferate across virtual and physical domains,
the Internet of Agents (IoA) has emerged as a key infrastructure for enabling
scalable and secure coordination among heterogeneous agents. This survey offers
a comprehensive examination of the security and privacy landscape in IoA
systems. We begin by outlining the IoA architecture and its distinct
vulnerabilities compared to traditional networks, focusing on four critical
aspects: identity authentication threats, cross-agent trust issues, embodied
security, and privacy risks. We then review existing and emerging defense
mechanisms and highlight persistent challenges. Finally, we identify open
research directions to advance the development of resilient and
privacy-preserving IoA ecosystems.

### [5] [MixBridge: Heterogeneous Image-to-Image Backdoor Attack through Mixture of Schrödinger Bridges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08809)
*Shixi Qin,Zhiyong Yang,Shilong Bao,Shi Wang,Qianqian Xu,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出MixBridge框架，用于在桥式扩散模型中植入多异质后门触发器，解决现有方法局限于单攻击场景和高斯噪声输入的问题。通过Divide-and-Merge策略和权重重分配方案（WRS），实现了多任务后门触发器的有效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门方法仅适用于单攻击场景和高斯噪声输入，无法满足复杂输入分布的需求。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出MixBridge框架，基于扩散Schrödinger桥（DSB），通过Divide-and-Merge策略和WRS实现多后门触发器的训练。

Result: 实验证明MixBridge在多样生成任务中有效，但理论分析显示单DSB模型会导致性能冲突。

Conclusion: MixBridge为桥式模型后门行为研究提供了灵活工具，并通过Divide-and-Merge策略解决了多任务冲突问题。

Abstract: This paper focuses on implanting multiple heterogeneous backdoor triggers in
bridge-based diffusion models designed for complex and arbitrary input
distributions. Existing backdoor formulations mainly address single-attack
scenarios and are limited to Gaussian noise input models. To fill this gap, we
propose MixBridge, a novel diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge (DSB) framework to
cater to arbitrary input distributions (taking I2I tasks as special cases).
Beyond this trait, we demonstrate that backdoor triggers can be injected into
MixBridge by directly training with poisoned image pairs. This eliminates the
need for the cumbersome modifications to stochastic differential equations
required in previous studies, providing a flexible tool to study backdoor
behavior for bridge models. However, a key question arises: can a single DSB
model train multiple backdoor triggers? Unfortunately, our theory shows that
when attempting this, the model ends up following the geometric mean of benign
and backdoored distributions, leading to performance conflict across backdoor
tasks. To overcome this, we propose a Divide-and-Merge strategy to mix
different bridges, where models are independently pre-trained for each specific
objective (Divide) and then integrated into a unified model (Merge). In
addition, a Weight Reallocation Scheme (WRS) is also designed to enhance the
stealthiness of MixBridge. Empirical studies across diverse generation tasks
speak to the efficacy of MixBridge.

### [6] [Machine Learning-Based Detection of DDoS Attacks in VANETs for Emergency Vehicle Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08810)
*Bappa Muktar,Vincent Fono,Adama Nouboukpo*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 该研究提出了一种检测高速公路VANET中DDoS攻击的框架，使用合成数据集和多种分类器，XGBoost和CatBoost表现最佳，F1-score达96%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VANET在智能交通系统中至关重要，但DDoS攻击会威胁其可靠性，因此需要一种有效的检测方法。

Method: 通过NS-3和SUMO构建合成数据集，结合真实交通数据，预处理后使用多种分类器进行检测。

Result: XGBoost和CatBoost表现最优，F1-score为96%。

Conclusion: 该框架具有鲁棒性，适合实时部署以保护VANET中的紧急通信。

Abstract: Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) play a key role in Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS), particularly in enabling real-time communication
for emergency vehicles. However, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks,
which interfere with safety-critical communication channels, can severely
impair their reliability. This study introduces a robust and scalable framework
to detect DDoS attacks in highway-based VANET environments. A synthetic dataset
was constructed using Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) in conjunction with the
Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) and further enriched with real-world
mobility traces from Germany's A81 highway, extracted via OpenStreetMap (OSM).
Three traffic categories were simulated: DDoS, VoIP, and TCP-based video
streaming (VideoTCP). The data preprocessing pipeline included normalization,
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) feature engineering, missing value imputation, and
class balancing using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).
Feature importance was assessed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Eleven classifiers were benchmarked, among them XGBoost (XGB), CatBoost (CB),
AdaBoost (AB), GradientBoosting (GB), and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
XGB and CB achieved the best performance, each attaining an F1-score of 96%.
These results highlight the robustness of the proposed framework and its
potential for real-time deployment in VANETs to secure critical emergency
communications.

### [7] [Self-Supervised Transformer-based Contrastive Learning for Intrusion Detection Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08816)
*Ippokratis Koukoulis,Ilias Syrigos,Thanasis Korakis*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer编码器的自监督对比学习方法，用于通用入侵检测，显著提升了异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着零日攻击频率和严重性增加，传统基于签名的入侵检测系统（IDS）已不足，需要更先进的解决方案。机器学习方法依赖标记数据且泛化能力有限，亟需改进。

Method: 采用自监督对比学习结合Transformer架构，通过数据增强和自动学习流量表示，避免依赖手工统计特征。

Result: 在异常检测任务中，AUC指标比现有方法高3%（数据集内）和20%（数据集间）；在监督学习中，AUC提升1.5%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在通用性和性能上优于传统方法，适用于标记数据有限的情况，并展示了跨数据集的适应性。

Abstract: As the digital landscape becomes more interconnected, the frequency and
severity of zero-day attacks, have significantly increased, leading to an
urgent need for innovative Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Machine
Learning-based IDS that learn from the network traffic characteristics and can
discern attack patterns from benign traffic offer an advanced solution to
traditional signature-based IDS. However, they heavily rely on labeled
datasets, and their ability to generalize when encountering unseen traffic
patterns remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised
contrastive learning approach based on transformer encoders, specifically
tailored for generalizable intrusion detection on raw packet sequences. Our
proposed learning scheme employs a packet-level data augmentation strategy
combined with a transformer-based architecture to extract and generate
meaningful representations of traffic flows. Unlike traditional methods reliant
on handcrafted statistical features (NetFlow), our approach automatically
learns comprehensive packet sequence representations, significantly enhancing
performance in anomaly identification tasks and supervised learning for
intrusion detection. Our transformer-based framework exhibits better
performance in comparison to existing NetFlow self-supervised methods.
Specifically, we achieve up to a 3% higher AUC in anomaly detection for
intra-dataset evaluation and up to 20% higher AUC scores in inter-dataset
evaluation. Moreover, our model provides a strong baseline for supervised
intrusion detection with limited labeled data, exhibiting an improvement over
self-supervised NetFlow models of up to 1.5% AUC when pretrained and evaluated
on the same dataset. Additionally, we show the adaptability of our pretrained
model when fine-tuned across different datasets, demonstrating strong
performance even when lacking benign data from the target domain.

Result: 总结了现有FLLM研究的可行性方法，提出了增强鲁棒性和安全性的策略，并探讨了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: FLLM领域需进一步研究以提升系统鲁棒性和安全性，应对FL与LLM集成的独特挑战。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Federated Learning (FL)
presents a promising solution for joint training on distributed data while
preserving privacy and addressing data silo issues. However, this emerging
field, known as Federated Large Language Models (FLLM), faces significant
challenges, including communication and computation overheads, heterogeneity,
privacy and security concerns. Current research has primarily focused on the
feasibility of FLLM, but future trends are expected to emphasize enhancing
system robustness and security. This paper provides a comprehensive review of
the latest advancements in FLLM, examining challenges from four critical
perspectives: feasibility, robustness, security, and future directions. We
present an exhaustive survey of existing studies on FLLM feasibility, introduce
methods to enhance robustness in the face of resource, data, and task
heterogeneity, and analyze novel risks associated with this integration,
including privacy threats and security challenges. We also review the latest
developments in defense mechanisms and explore promising future research
directions, such as few-shot learning, machine unlearning, and IP protection.
This survey highlights the pressing need for further research to enhance system
robustness and security while addressing the unique challenges posed by the
integration of FL and LLM.

### [9] [Robustness Analysis against Adversarial Patch Attacks in Fully Unmanned Stores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08835)
*Hyunsik Na,Wonho Lee,Seungdeok Roh,Sohee Park,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文研究了无人商店中基于AI的自动结账系统的对抗性补丁攻击，展示了其严重性，并提出了新的攻击评估指标和防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人商店的AI系统存在安全漏洞，对抗性补丁攻击可能导致盗窃和库存问题，需要研究其影响和防御方法。

Method: 研究了三种对抗性补丁攻击（隐藏、创建和修改攻击），提出新的颜色直方图相似性损失函数和边界框评估指标，并在数字和物理环境中测试攻击效果。

Result: 对抗性补丁攻击显著干扰了物体检测模型，黑盒攻击中影子攻击提高了成功率，当前防御机制在实时检测中存在不足。

Conclusion: 研究强调了加强无人商店AI系统防御的必要性，并提供了改进模型鲁棒性和防御策略的见解。

Abstract: The advent of convenient and efficient fully unmanned stores equipped with
artificial intelligence-based automated checkout systems marks a new era in
retail. However, these systems have inherent artificial intelligence security
vulnerabilities, which are exploited via adversarial patch attacks,
particularly in physical environments. This study demonstrated that adversarial
patches can severely disrupt object detection models used in unmanned stores,
leading to issues such as theft, inventory discrepancies, and interference. We
investigated three types of adversarial patch attacks -- Hiding, Creating, and
Altering attacks -- and highlighted their effectiveness. We also introduce the
novel color histogram similarity loss function by leveraging attacker knowledge
of the color information of a target class object. Besides the traditional
confusion-matrix-based attack success rate, we introduce a new
bounding-boxes-based metric to analyze the practical impact of these attacks.
Starting with attacks on object detection models trained on snack and fruit
datasets in a digital environment, we evaluated the effectiveness of
adversarial patches in a physical testbed that mimicked a real unmanned store
with RGB cameras and realistic conditions. Furthermore, we assessed the
robustness of these attacks in black-box scenarios, demonstrating that shadow
attacks can enhance success rates of attacks even without direct access to
model parameters. Our study underscores the necessity for robust defense
strategies to protect unmanned stores from adversarial threats. Highlighting
the limitations of the current defense mechanisms in real-time detection
systems and discussing various proactive measures, we provide insights into
improving the robustness of object detection models and fortifying unmanned
retail environments against these attacks.

### [10] [Adaptive Security Policy Management in Cloud Environments Using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08837)
*Muhammad Saqib,Dipkumar Mehta,Fnu Yashu,Shubham Malhotra*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的动态安全策略管理框架，显著优于静态策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态安全策略无法适应动态威胁和弹性云资源的需求。

Method: 使用深度强化学习算法（如DQN和PPO），结合云遥测数据动态调整安全策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架的入侵检测率（92%）和响应时间（减少58%）优于静态策略。

Conclusion: 自适应强化学习方法能有效提升云安全策略管理的效果。

Abstract: The security of cloud environments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), is
complex and dynamic. Static security policies have become inadequate as threats
evolve and cloud resources exhibit elasticity [1]. This paper addresses the
limitations of static policies by proposing a security policy management
framework that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt dynamically.
Specifically, we employ deep reinforcement learning algorithms, including deep
Q Networks and proximal policy optimization, enabling the learning and
continuous adjustment of controls such as firewall rules and Identity and
Access Management (IAM) policies. The proposed RL based solution leverages
cloud telemetry data (AWS Cloud Trail logs, network traffic data, threat
intelligence feeds) to continuously refine security policies, maximizing threat
mitigation, and compliance while minimizing resource impact. Experimental
results demonstrate that our adaptive RL based framework significantly
outperforms static policies, achieving higher intrusion detection rates (92%
compared to 82% for static policies) and substantially reducing incident
detection and response times by 58%. In addition, it maintains high conformity
with security requirements and efficient resource usage. These findings
validate the effectiveness of adaptive reinforcement learning approaches in
improving cloud security policy management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为物联网设备设计一种高效且安全的加密算法，以应对常见的密码攻击。

Result: 在32位ARM处理器上性能提升42.25%，在8位和16位微控制器上分别提升87.91%和98.01%。

Conclusion: SEPAR算法在安全性和性能上均表现出色，适用于物联网设备。

Abstract: In this thesis, a novel lightweight hybrid encryption algorithm named SEPAR
is proposed, featuring a 16-bit block length and a 128-bit initialization
vector. The algorithm is designed specifically for application in Internet of
Things (IoT) technology devices. The design concept of this algorithm is based
on the integration of a pseudo-random permutation function and a pseudo-random
generator function. This intelligent combination not only enhances the
algorithm's resistance against cryptographic attacks but also improves its
processing speed. The security analyses conducted on the algorithm, along with
the results of NIST statistical tests, confirm its robustness against most
common and advanced cryptographic attacks, including linear and differential
attacks. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on various software
platform architectures. The software implementation was carried out on three
platforms: 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit architectures. A comparative analysis with
the BORON algorithm on a 32-bit ARM processor indicates a performance
improvement of 42.25%. Furthermore, implementation results on 8-bit and 16-bit
microcontrollers demonstrate performance improvements of 87.91% and 98.01%
respectively, compared to the PRESENT cipher.

TLDR: LibVulnWatch是一个基于图的框架，用于评估开源AI库的风险，涵盖安全、许可、维护等领域，并提供可量化的评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源AI库存在多种未被充分研究的风险，如安全漏洞、许可问题等，需要系统化的评估工具。

Method: 基于LangGraph构建的有向无环图框架，协调多个专业代理从可信来源提取和验证风险。

Result: 应用于20个常用库，覆盖88%的OpenSSF Scorecard检查，发现每库多达19个额外风险。

Conclusion: LibVulnWatch为AI治理提供了可扩展、透明的风险评估机制。

Abstract: Open-source AI libraries are foundational to modern AI systems but pose
significant, underexamined risks across security, licensing, maintenance,
supply chain integrity, and regulatory compliance. We present LibVulnWatch, a
graph-based agentic assessment framework that performs deep, source-grounded
evaluations of these libraries. Built on LangGraph, the system coordinates a
directed acyclic graph of specialized agents to extract, verify, and quantify
risk using evidence from trusted sources such as repositories, documentation,
and vulnerability databases. LibVulnWatch generates reproducible,
governance-aligned scores across five critical domains, publishing them to a
public leaderboard for longitudinal ecosystem monitoring. Applied to 20 widely
used libraries, including ML frameworks, LLM inference engines, and agent
orchestration tools, our system covers up to 88% of OpenSSF Scorecard checks
while uncovering up to 19 additional risks per library. These include critical
Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, absent Software Bills of Materials
(SBOMs), licensing constraints, undocumented telemetry, and widespread gaps in
regulatory documentation and auditability. By translating high-level governance
principles into practical, verifiable metrics, LibVulnWatch advances technical
AI governance with a scalable, transparent mechanism for continuous supply
chain risk assessment and informed library selection.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 研究探讨了在MLaaS中结合差分隐私（DP）技术时，模型性能、隐私和可解释性之间的权衡，并评估了两种DP策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLaaS平台面临安全和隐私攻击（如模型提取攻击），而XAI的引入增加了隐私风险，尤其是通过反事实解释（CFs）的攻击。

Method: 评估了两种DP策略：一种在分类模型训练时实施，另一种在CF生成时实施。

Result: 研究发现DP技术可以有效缓解CFs引发的隐私风险，但需权衡模型性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: 差分隐私是缓解MLaaS中隐私风险的有效方法，但需在性能、隐私和可解释性之间找到平衡。

Abstract: Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has gained important attraction as a
means for deploying powerful predictive models, offering ease of use that
enables organizations to leverage advanced analytics without substantial
investments in specialized infrastructure or expertise. However, MLaaS
platforms must be safeguarded against security and privacy attacks, such as
model extraction (MEA) attacks. The increasing integration of explainable AI
(XAI) within MLaaS has introduced an additional privacy challenge, as attackers
can exploit model explanations particularly counterfactual explanations (CFs)
to facilitate MEA. In this paper, we investigate the trade offs among model
performance, privacy, and explainability when employing Differential Privacy
(DP), a promising technique for mitigating CF facilitated MEA. We evaluate two
distinct DP strategies: implemented during the classification model training
and at the explainer during CF generation.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种隐私保护的语言模型对齐新算法，结合DPO和RLHF技术，显著提升性能，并在中等隐私预算下实现15%的对齐质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型对齐涉及敏感用户数据，现有方法在隐私保护下性能有限，需改进。

Method: 提出新算法（如DP-AdamW），结合DPO和RLHF，分析隐私预算与模型效果。

Result: 在中等隐私预算（ε=2-5）下，DP-AdamW结合DPO提升对齐质量15%，性能领先。

Abstract: Language model alignment is crucial for ensuring that large language models
(LLMs) align with human preferences, yet it often involves sensitive user data,
raising significant privacy concerns. While prior work has integrated
differential privacy (DP) with alignment techniques, their performance remains
limited. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for privacy-preserving
alignment and rigorously analyze their effectiveness across varying privacy
budgets and models. Our framework can be deployed on two celebrated alignment
techniques, namely direct preference optimization (DPO) and reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF). Through systematic experiments on
large-scale language models, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Notably, one of our algorithms, DP-AdamW,
combined with DPO, surpasses existing methods, improving alignment quality by
up to 15% under moderate privacy budgets ({\epsilon}=2-5). We further
investigate the interplay between privacy guarantees, alignment efficacy, and
computational demands, providing practical guidelines for optimizing these
trade-offs.

Conclusion: 本文提出的水印方案在检测能力与文本质量之间实现了最优权衡，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) are now able to produce text that is, in many
cases, seemingly indistinguishable from human-generated content. This has
fueled the development of watermarks that imprint a ``signal'' in LLM-generated
text with minimal perturbation of an LLM's output. This paper provides an
analysis of text watermarking in a one-shot setting. Through the lens of
hypothesis testing with side information, we formulate and analyze the
fundamental trade-off between watermark detection power and distortion in
generated textual quality. We argue that a key component in watermark design is
generating a coupling between the side information shared with the watermark
detector and a random partition of the LLM vocabulary. Our analysis identifies
the optimal coupling and randomization strategy under the worst-case LLM
next-token distribution that satisfies a min-entropy constraint. We provide a
closed-form expression of the resulting detection rate under the proposed
scheme and quantify the cost in a max-min sense. Finally, we provide an array
of numerical results, comparing the proposed scheme with the theoretical
optimum and existing schemes, in both synthetic data and LLM watermarking. Our

TLDR: SAFE-SiP利用多方计算（MPC）实现零信任认证，保护芯片签名安全，无需专用安全芯片，适用于不受信任的集成场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 芯片异构集成带来供应链安全问题，现有方案依赖可信集成商，易暴露签名并引入新攻击面。

Method: 提出SAFE-SiP框架，通过MPC混淆签名并验证完整性，无需专用安全芯片。

Result: 在5个RISC-V SiP设计中验证，功耗开销低，面积开销仅3.05%，计算复杂度为2^192。

Conclusion: SAFE-SiP提供高效、可扩展的安全解决方案，适用于复杂供应链环境。

Abstract: The emergence of chiplet-based heterogeneous integration is transforming the
semiconductor, AI, and high-performance computing industries by enabling
modular designs and improved scalability. However, assembling chiplets from
multiple vendors after fabrication introduces a complex supply chain that
raises serious security concerns, including counterfeiting, overproduction, and
unauthorized access. Current solutions often depend on dedicated security
chiplets or changes to the timing flow, which assume a trusted SiP integrator.
This assumption can expose chiplet signatures to other vendors and create new
attack surfaces. This work addresses those vulnerabilities using Multi-party
Computation (MPC), which enables zero-trust authentication without disclosing
sensitive information to any party. We present SAFE-SiP, a scalable
authentication framework that garbles chiplet signatures and uses MPC for
verifying integrity, effectively blocking unauthorized access and adversarial
inference. SAFE-SiP removes the need for a dedicated security chiplet and
ensures secure authentication, even in untrusted integration scenarios. We
evaluated SAFE-SiP on five RISC-V-based System-in-Package (SiP) designs.
Experimental results show that SAFE-SiP incurs minimal power overhead, an
average area overhead of only 3.05%, and maintains a computational complexity
of 2^192, offering a highly efficient and scalable security solution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为隐私敏感应用（如医疗、金融）提供灵活的信息选择性披露方案。

Method: 将CP-ABE集成到SD-JWT框架中，允许持有者为披露内容分配解密策略。

Result: SD-JWT生成轻量，加密和解密时间随披露数量线性增加。

Conclusion: 适用于隐私敏感场景，但需优化实时用例（如IoT），未来需提升ABE效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: This study proposes a mechanism for encrypting SD-JWT (Selective Disclosure
JSON Web Token) Disclosures using Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) to enable
flexible access control on the basis of the Verifier's attributes. By
integrating Ciphertext-Policy ABE (CP-ABE) into the existing SD-JWT framework,
the Holder can assign decryption policies to Disclosures, ensuring information
is selectively disclosed. The mechanism's feasibility was evaluated in a
virtualized environment by measuring the processing times for SD-JWT
generation, encryption, and decryption with varying Disclosure counts (5, 10,
20). Results showed that SD-JWT generation is lightweight, while encryption and
decryption times increase linearly with the number of Disclosures. This
approach is suitable for privacy-sensitive applications like healthcare,
finance, and supply chain tracking but requires optimization for real-time use
cases such as IoT. Future research should focus on improving ABE efficiency and
addressing scalability challenges.

Method: 访谈了8位美国大学卫星俱乐部负责人，并审计了其中3个俱乐部的代码库。

Result: 发现各团队安全实践差异大，但均存在地面攻击者可利用的漏洞；参与者预见到未保护小型卫星的风险，并指出行业与政府的安全不足。

Conclusion: 提出了未来小型卫星安全构建的考虑因素，适用于业余组织及其他领域。

Abstract: Satellites face a multitude of security risks that set them apart from
hardware on Earth. Small satellites may face additional challenges, as they are
often developed on a budget and by amateur organizations or universities that
do not consider security. We explore the security practices and preferences of
small satellite teams, particularly university satellite teams, to understand
what barriers exist to building satellites securely. We interviewed 8
university satellite club leaders across 4 clubs in the U.S. and perform a code
audit of 3 of these clubs' code repositories. We find that security practices
vary widely across teams, but all teams studied had vulnerabilities available
to an unprivileged, ground-based attacker. Participants foresee many risks of
unsecured small satellites and indicate security shortcomings in industry and
government. Lastly, we identify a set of considerations for how to build future
small satellites securely, in amateur organizations and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网络安全评估方法（如CVSS、STRIDE和攻击树）难以应对日益复杂的威胁，贝叶斯网络因其概率依赖性和不确定性推理能力成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 将基于STRIDE的攻击树转化为贝叶斯网络，利用条件概率表编码逻辑关系，并通过DREAD评分推导威胁可能性。

Result: 模型支持概率推理和因果分析，识别高影响力漏洞，但存在可扩展性、专家依赖和静态结构等局限性。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究动态贝叶斯网络、结构学习和自适应推理，以提升实时网络安全决策能力。

Abstract: Cybersecurity threats are increasingly marked by interdependence,
uncertainty, and evolving complexity challenges that traditional assessment
methods such as CVSS, STRIDE, and attack trees fail to adequately capture. This
paper reviews the application of Bayesian Networks (BNs) in cybersecurity risk
modeling, highlighting their capacity to represent probabilistic dependencies,
integrate diverse threat indicators, and support reasoning under uncertainty. A
structured case study is presented in which a STRIDE-based attack tree for an
automotive In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system is transformed into a Bayesian
Network. Logical relationships are encoded using Conditional Probability Tables
(CPTs), and threat likelihoods are derived from normalized DREAD scores. The
model enables not only probabilistic inference of system compromise likelihood
but also supports causal analysis using do-calculus and local sensitivity
analysis to identify high-impact vulnerabilities. These analyses provide
insight into the most influential nodes within the threat propagation chain,
informing targeted mitigation strategies. While demonstrating the potential of
BNs for dynamic and context-aware risk assessment, the study also outlines
limitations related to scalability, reliance on expert input, static structure
assumptions, and limited temporal modeling. The paper concludes by advocating
for future enhancements through Dynamic Bayesian Networks, structure learning,
and adaptive inference to better support real-time cybersecurity
decision-making in complex environments.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为SafeFL的新算法，旨在准确识别联邦学习中的恶意客户端，通过生成合成数据集来区分恶意与良性模型，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性使其容易受到投毒攻击，现有防御方法对高级威胁无效且易误判良性客户端。

Method: 服务器收集一系列全局模型生成合成数据集，基于行为区分恶意与良性模型。

Result: SafeFL在检测恶意客户端方面表现出更高的效率和准确性。

Conclusion: SafeFL是一种有效的解决方案，能够提升联邦学习的安全性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a
global machine learning model without sharing their raw data. However, the
decentralized nature of FL introduces vulnerabilities, particularly to
poisoning attacks, where malicious clients manipulate their local models to
disrupt the training process. While Byzantine-robust aggregation rules have
been developed to mitigate such attacks, they remain inadequate against more
advanced threats. In response, recent advancements have focused on FL detection
techniques to identify potentially malicious participants. Unfortunately, these
methods often misclassify numerous benign clients as threats or rely on
unrealistic assumptions about the server's capabilities. In this paper, we
propose a novel algorithm, SafeFL, specifically designed to accurately identify
malicious clients in FL. The SafeFL approach involves the server collecting a
series of global models to generate a synthetic dataset, which is then used to
distinguish between malicious and benign models based on their behavior.
Extensive testing demonstrates that SafeFL outperforms existing methods,
offering superior efficiency and accuracy in detecting malicious clients.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种结合安全类型和区间分析的新型安全类型系统，用于分析P4程序中的信息流，确保程序满足非干扰性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: P4语言为数据平面设备提供了灵活性，但也带来了安全挑战，特别是敏感数据管理和信息泄漏问题。

Method: 设计了一种安全类型系统，结合区间分析，形式化并证明其正确性，确保程序满足非干扰性。

Result: 原型实现Tap4s在多个用例中验证了其检测安全违规和信息泄漏的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的安全类型系统为P4程序的信息流分析提供了有效解决方案，增强了数据平面的安全性。

Abstract: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has transformed network architectures by
decoupling the control and data-planes, enabling fine-grained control over
packet processing and forwarding. P4, a language designed for programming
data-plane devices, allows developers to define custom packet processing
behaviors directly on programmable network devices. This provides greater
control over packet forwarding, inspection, and modification. However, the
increased flexibility provided by P4 also brings significant security
challenges, particularly in managing sensitive data and preventing information
leakage within the data-plane.
  This paper presents a novel security type system for analyzing information
flow in P4 programs that combines security types with interval analysis. The
proposed type system allows the specification of security policies in terms of
input and output packet bit fields rather than program variables. We formalize
this type system and prove it sound, guaranteeing that well-typed programs
satisfy noninterference. Our prototype implementation, Tap4s, is evaluated on
several use cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting security
violations and information leakages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注性能指标，忽视了确保TTP分配可靠性和一致性的机制，导致情报孤岛和矛盾评估。

Method: 采用双层次情境知识实例的可进化记忆框架，结合LLM生成和更新知识，区分类似技术特征。

Result: 实验显示框架（使用Qwen2.5-32B）在技术F1分数上比GPT-4o提升11%，定性分析证实标准化、透明性和可解释性增强。

Conclusion: 这是首个利用LLM生成、更新和应用新知识进行TTP提取的工作，显著提升了威胁情报的标准化和可靠性。

Abstract: Extracting MITRE ATT\&CK Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) from
natural language threat reports is crucial yet challenging. Existing methods
primarily focus on performance metrics using data-driven approaches, often
neglecting mechanisms to ensure faithful adherence to the official standard.
This deficiency compromises reliability and consistency of TTP assignments,
creating intelligence silos and contradictory threat assessments across
organizations. To address this, we introduce a novel framework that converts
abstract standard definitions into actionable, contextualized knowledge. Our
method utilizes Large Language Model (LLM) to generate, update, and apply this
knowledge. This framework populates an evolvable memory with dual-layer
situational knowledge instances derived from labeled examples and official
definitions. The first layer identifies situational contexts (e.g.,
"Communication with C2 using encoded subdomains"), while the second layer
captures distinctive features that differentiate similar techniques (e.g.,
distinguishing T1132 "Data Encoding" from T1071 "Application Layer Protocol"
based on whether the focus is on encoding methods or protocol usage). This
structured approach provides a transparent basis for explainable TTP
assignments and enhanced human oversight, while also helping to standardize
other TTP extraction systems. Experiments show our framework (using
Qwen2.5-32B) boosts Technique F1 scores by 11\% over GPT-4o. Qualitative
analysis confirms superior standardization, enhanced transparency, and improved
explainability in real-world threat intelligence scenarios. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that uses the LLM to generate, update, and
apply the a new knowledge for TTP extraction.

TLDR: 提出了两种隐私保护的运行时验证协议，确保系统在验证过程中不泄露敏感信息或规范内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统运行时验证中因第三方监控导致的隐私泄露问题，保护系统和监控规范的机密性。

Method: 基于多方计算技术，设计两种协议：一种监控器不学习系统信息但知晓规范；另一种系统不知晓规范，监控器仅知验证结果。

Result: 协议在每次观察步骤中仅交换一条消息，通信开销低，实验验证了其可行性。

Conclusion: 提出的协议有效平衡了隐私保护和运行时验证的需求，适用于敏感信息场景。

Abstract: Runtime verification offers scalable solutions to improve the safety and
reliability of systems. However, systems that require verification or
monitoring by a third party to ensure compliance with a specification might
contain sensitive information, causing privacy concerns when usual runtime
verification approaches are used. Privacy is compromised if protected
information about the system, or sensitive data that is processed by the
system, is revealed. In addition, revealing the specification being monitored
may undermine the essence of third-party verification.
  In this work, we propose two novel protocols for the privacy-preserving
runtime verification of systems against formal sequential specifications. In
our first protocol, the monitor verifies whether the system satisfies the
specification without learning anything else, though both parties are aware of
the specification. Our second protocol ensures that the system remains
oblivious to the monitored specification, while the monitor learns only whether
the system satisfies the specification and nothing more. Our protocols adapt
and improve existing techniques used in cryptography, and more specifically,
multi-party computation.
  The sequential specification defines the observation step of the monitor,
whose granularity depends on the situation (e.g., banks may be monitored on a
daily basis). Our protocols exchange a single message per observation step,
after an initialisation phase. This design minimises communication overhead,
enabling relatively lightweight privacy-preserving monitoring. We implement our
approach for monitoring specifications described by register automata and
evaluate it experimentally.

Motivation: Sybil攻击对区块链生态系统构成严重威胁，尤其在代币空投事件中，因此需要有效的识别方法。

Method: 构建双层交易子图，提取时间、金额和网络结构特征，利用lightGBM进行分类。

Result: 在包含193,701个地址的数据集上，所有评估指标（精度、召回率、F1分数、AUC）均超过0.9。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广至更广泛的区块链安全领域，如交易操纵识别和流动性风险评估，有助于构建更安全的区块链生态系统。

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant security threat to blockchain ecosystems,
particularly in token airdrop events. This paper proposes a novel sybil address
identification method based on subgraph feature extraction lightGBM. The method
first constructs a two-layer deep transaction subgraph for each address, then
extracts key event operation features according to the lifecycle of sybil
addresses, including the time of first transaction, first gas acquisition,
participation in airdrop activities, and last transaction. These temporal
features effectively capture the consistency of sybil address behavior
operations. Additionally, the method extracts amount and network structure
features, comprehensively describing address behavior patterns and network
topology through feature propagation and fusion. Experiments conducted on a
dataset containing 193,701 addresses (including 23,240 sybil addresses) show
that this method outperforms existing approaches in terms of precision, recall,
F1 score, and AUC, with all metrics exceeding 0.9. The methods and results of
this study can be further applied to broader blockchain security areas such as
transaction manipulation identification and token liquidity risk assessment,
contributing to the construction of a more secure and fair blockchain
ecosystem.

Motivation: 现有的机器学习恶意软件检测器易受对抗攻击，且缺乏针对二进制约束领域的全面评估框架，限制了对其鲁棒性的理解。

Method: 1. 优先二进制舍入技术，将连续扰动转换为二进制特征空间；2. sigma-binary攻击，一种针对二进制域的新型对抗方法。

Result: 在Malscan数据集上，sigma-binary攻击显著优于现有攻击方法，攻击成功率高达94.56%，并揭示了现有防御的严重脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了精确方法（如sigma-binary攻击）的重要性，以暴露现有防御的隐藏漏洞，并支持开发更鲁棒的恶意软件检测系统。

Abstract: Machine learning is a key tool for Android malware detection, effectively
identifying malicious patterns in apps. However, ML-based detectors are
vulnerable to evasion attacks, where small, crafted changes bypass detection.
Despite progress in adversarial defenses, the lack of comprehensive evaluation
frameworks in binary-constrained domains limits understanding of their
robustness. We introduce two key contributions. First, Prioritized Binary
Rounding, a technique to convert continuous perturbations into binary feature
spaces while preserving high attack success and low perturbation size. Second,
the sigma-binary attack, a novel adversarial method for binary domains,
designed to achieve attack goals with minimal feature changes. Experiments on
the Malscan dataset show that sigma-binary outperforms existing attacks and
exposes key vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art defenses. Defenses equipped
with adversary detectors, such as KDE, DLA, DNN+, and ICNN, exhibit significant
brittleness, with attack success rates exceeding 90% using fewer than 10
feature modifications and reaching 100% with just 20. Adversarially trained
defenses, including AT-rFGSM-k, AT-MaxMA, improves robustness under small
budgets but remains vulnerable to unrestricted perturbations, with attack
success rates of 99.45% and 96.62%, respectively. Although PAD-SMA demonstrates
strong robustness against state-of-the-art gradient-based adversarial attacks
by maintaining an attack success rate below 16.55%, the sigma-binary attack
significantly outperforms these methods, achieving a 94.56% success rate under
unrestricted perturbations. These findings highlight the critical need for
precise method like sigma-binary to expose hidden vulnerabilities in existing
defenses and support the development of more resilient malware detection
systems.

Motivation: 移动应用的DNS查询可能泄露用户敏感行为，即使通信加密。本文旨在通过客户端解决方案保护用户隐私，避免第三方信任需求。

Method: 1. 将用户行为建模为兴趣类别的概率分布；2. 评估三种查询伪造策略；3. 基于真实流量构建合成数据集并提取用户画像。

Result: 优化方法可实现50%隐私提升（流量开销<20%），100%保护需40-60%额外流量。

Conclusion: 该框架为移动设备提供了一种无需第三方信任的隐私保护方案，且不影响应用功能。

Abstract: Mobile applications continuously generate DNS queries that can reveal
sensitive user behavioral patterns even when communications are encrypted. This
paper presents a privacy enhancement framework based on query forgery to
protect users against profiling attempts that leverage these background
communications. We first mathematically model user profiles as probability
distributions over interest categories derived from mobile application traffic.
We then evaluate three query forgery strategies -- uniform sampling,
TrackMeNot-based generation, and an optimized approach that minimizes
Kullback-Leibler divergence -- to quantify their effectiveness in obfuscating
user profiles. Then we create a synthetic dataset comprising 1,000 user traces
constructed from real mobile application traffic and we extract the user
profiles based on DNS traffic. Our evaluation reveals that a 50\% privacy
improvement is achievable with less than 20\% traffic overhead when using our
approach, while achieving 100\% privacy protection requires approximately
40-60\% additional traffic. We further propose a modular system architecture
for practical implementation of our protection mechanisms on mobile devices.
This work offers a client-side privacy solution that operates without
third-party trust requirements, empowering individual users to defend against
traffic analysis without compromising application functionality.

TLDR: CANTXSec是一种基于物理ECU激活的确定性入侵检测和防御系统，针对CAN总线中的攻击进行分类、检测和防御，效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CAN协议存在安全漏洞，但仍是车辆、船舶和工业控制系统的通信标准。现有研究多关注入侵检测，而防御措施和实际大规模应用较少。

Method: 提出CANTXSec系统，基于攻击者对总线访问级别的需求分类攻击（帧注入攻击和单比特攻击），并通过物理ECU激活实现检测与防御。

Result: 在物理测试平台上，对两类攻击的检测准确率达100%，帧注入攻击的防御率为100%。

Conclusion: CANTXSec为CAN总线安全提供了高效解决方案，并鼓励开发者根据风险评估实施。

Abstract: Despite being a legacy protocol with various known security issues,
Controller Area Network (CAN) still represents the de-facto standard for
communications within vehicles, ships, and industrial control systems. Many
research works have designed Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to identify
attacks by training machine learning classifiers on bus traffic or its
properties. Actions to take after detection are, on the other hand, less
investigated, and prevention mechanisms usually include protocol modification
(e.g., adding authentication). An effective solution has yet to be implemented
on a large scale in the wild. The reasons are related to the effort to handle
sporadic false positives, the inevitable delay introduced by authentication,
and the closed-source automobile environment that does not easily permit
modifying Electronic Control Units (ECUs) software.
  In this paper, we propose CANTXSec, the first deterministic Intrusion
Detection and Prevention system based on physical ECU activations. It employs a
new classification of attacks based on the attacker's need in terms of access
level to the bus, distinguishing between Frame Injection Attacks (FIAs) (i.e.,
using frame-level access) and Single-Bit Attacks (SBAs) (i.e., employing
bit-level access). CANTXSec detects and prevents classical attacks in the CAN
bus, while detecting advanced attacks that have been less investigated in the
literature. We prove the effectiveness of our solution on a physical testbed,
where we achieve 100% detection accuracy in both classes of attacks while
preventing 100% of FIAs. Moreover, to encourage developers to employ CANTXSec,
we discuss implementation details, providing an analysis based on each user's
risk assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能手机的广泛使用引发隐私和安全问题，尤其是Android平台。MAS方法虽被提出用于检测恶意行为，但此前研究的数据集较小，外部有效性存疑。

Method: 采用更大规模的数据集（4,076对应用）复现MAS方法，评估其在多样恶意软件家族中的分类性能。

Result: MAS方法在大数据集上表现不佳，F1分数大幅下降，某些恶意软件家族导致分类失败。

Conclusion: MAS方法在扩展时存在局限性，需结合其他技术以更有效地检测恶意软件。

Abstract: The widespread use of smartphones in daily life has raised concerns about
privacy and security among researchers and practitioners. Privacy issues are
generally highly prevalent in mobile applications, particularly targeting the
Android platform, the most popular mobile operating system. For this reason,
several techniques have been proposed to identify malicious behavior in Android
applications, including the Mining Android Sandbox approach (MAS approach),
which aims to identify malicious behavior in repackaged Android applications
(apps). However, previous empirical studies evaluated the MAS approach using a
small dataset consisting of only 102 pairs of original and repackaged apps.
This limitation raises questions about the external validity of their findings
and whether the MAS approach can be generalized to larger datasets. To address
these concerns, this paper presents the results of a replication study focused
on evaluating the performance of the MAS approach regarding its capabilities of
correctly classifying malware from different families. Unlike previous studies,
our research employs a dataset that is an order of magnitude larger, comprising
4,076 pairs of apps covering a more diverse range of Android malware families.
Surprisingly, our findings indicate a poor performance of the MAS approach for
identifying malware, with the F1-score decreasing from 0.90 for the small
dataset used in the previous studies to 0.54 in our more extensive dataset.
Upon closer examination, we discovered that certain malware families partially
account for the low accuracy of the MAS approach, which fails to classify a
repackaged version of an app as malware correctly. Our findings highlight the
limitations of the MAS approach, particularly when scaled, and underscore the
importance of complementing it with other techniques to detect a broader range
of malware effectively.

### [30] [A Preliminary Framework for Intersectionality in ML Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08792)
*Michelle Nashla Turcios,Alicia E. Boyd,Angela D. R. Smith,Brittany Johnson*

TLDR: 论文探讨了机器学习技术对社会身份支持的不足，提出基于交叉性理论（Crenshaw、Combahee、Collins）的框架，以促进更公平的技术发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习技术未能充分支持复杂社会身份，交叉性理论为解决这一问题提供了可能，但其应用常偏离初衷。

Method: 基于交叉性理论的三位学者（Crenshaw、Combahee、Collins）的成果，构建初步框架，并评估机器学习文献中交叉性应用的（不）一致性。

Result: 通过框架评估，揭示了机器学习文献中交叉性应用的偏差与不足。

Conclusion: 强调正确应用交叉性理论的重要性，以推动更公平的机器学习技术发展。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a go-to solution for improving how we use,
experience, and interact with technology (and the world around us).
Unfortunately, studies have repeatedly shown that machine learning technologies
may not provide adequate support for societal identities and experiences.
Intersectionality is a sociological framework that provides a mechanism for
explicitly considering complex social identities, focusing on social justice
and power. While the framework of intersectionality can support the development
of technologies that acknowledge and support all members of society, it has
been adopted and adapted in ways that are not always true to its foundations,
thereby weakening its potential for impact. To support the appropriate adoption
and use of intersectionality for more equitable technological outcomes, we
amplify the foundational intersectionality scholarship--Crenshaw, Combahee, and
Collins (three C's), to create a socially relevant preliminary framework in
developing machine-learning solutions. We use this framework to evaluate and
report on the (mis)alignments of intersectionality application in machine
learning literature.

Result: 通过硬件-软件协同设计、模型压缩和去中心化学习，实现了边缘AI的高效、安全和可扩展部署。

Conclusion: 板载学习为边缘AI提供了强大的技术支持，但仍需进一步优化以适应动态环境。

Abstract: Onboard learning is a transformative approach in edge AI, enabling real-time
data processing, decision-making, and adaptive model training directly on
resource-constrained devices without relying on centralized servers. This
paradigm is crucial for applications demanding low latency, enhanced privacy,
and energy efficiency. However, onboard learning faces challenges such as
limited computational resources, high inference costs, and security
vulnerabilities. This survey explores a comprehensive range of methodologies
that address these challenges, focusing on techniques that optimize model
efficiency, accelerate inference, and support collaborative learning across
distributed devices. Approaches for reducing model complexity, improving
inference speed, and ensuring privacy-preserving computation are examined
alongside emerging strategies that enhance scalability and adaptability in
dynamic environments. By bridging advancements in hardware-software co-design,
model compression, and decentralized learning, this survey provides insights
into the current state of onboard learning to enable robust, efficient, and
secure AI deployment at the edge.

TLDR: 提出一种快速算法，将层次结构嵌入三维闵可夫斯基时空，数据相关性完全由因果结构编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索离散数据的完美几何表示，揭示层次意义与几何的深层联系。

Method: 基于局部层次信号（定向标记对），无需全局符号结构，应用于WordNet语料库。

Result: 完美嵌入哺乳动物子树和WordNet最大无歧义子集，层次结构完全几何化。

Conclusion: 离散数据存在三维完美几何表示，层次意义本质上是几何的，与广义相对论和场论有深层联系。

Abstract: We show that there is a fast algorithm that embeds hierarchical structures in
three-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The correlation of data ends up purely
encoded in the causal structure. Our model relies solely on oriented token
pairs -- local hierarchical signals -- with no access to global symbolic
structure. We apply our method to the corpus of \textit{WordNet}. We provide a
perfect embedding of the mammal sub-tree including ambiguities (more than one
hierarchy per node) in such a way that the hierarchical structures get
completely codified in the geometry and exactly reproduce the ground-truth. We
extend this to a perfect embedding of the maximal unambiguous subset of the
\textit{WordNet} with 82{,}115 noun tokens and a single hierarchy per token. We
introduce a novel retrieval mechanism in which causality, not distance, governs
hierarchical access. Our results seem to indicate that all discrete data has a
perfect geometrical representation that is three-dimensional. The resulting
embeddings are nearly conformally invariant, indicating deep connections with
general relativity and field theory. These results suggest that concepts,
categories, and their interrelations, namely hierarchical meaning itself, is
geometric.

Result: 发现多模态模型崩溃具有独特特征，如视觉-语言对齐改善，并提出解码预算增加、模型多样性等缓解方法。

Conclusion: 为自改进多模态AI系统和合成数据集提供了初步见解和实用指南。

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the risk of generative model collapse, where
performance progressively degrades when continually trained on self-generated
data. However, existing exploration on model collapse is limited to single,
unimodal models, limiting our understanding in more realistic scenarios, such
as diverse multi-modal AI agents interacting autonomously through synthetic
data and continually evolving. We expand the synthetic data training and model
collapse study to multi-modal vision-language generative systems, such as
vision-language models (VLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models, as well as
recursive generate-train loops with multiple models. We find that model
collapse, previously observed in single-modality generative models, exhibits
distinct characteristics in the multi-modal context, such as improved
vision-language alignment and increased variance in VLM image-captioning task.
Additionally, we find that general approaches such as increased decoding
budgets, greater model diversity, and relabeling with frozen models can
effectively mitigate model collapse. Our findings provide initial insights and
practical guidelines for reducing the risk of model collapse in self-improving
multi-agent AI systems and curating robust multi-modal synthetic datasets.

Motivation: 降低大型语言模型（LLM）的部署成本，同时保持高精度。

Method: 在每次线性投影前插入RMS归一化，并采用渐进式分层量化策略。

Result: 三元量化模型在标准语言建模基准上性能接近或优于全精度模型。

Conclusion: 通过归一化技术，三元量化LLM的精度差距显著缩小，实用化成为可能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural-language processing,
yet their scale makes real-world deployment costly. Post-training quantization
reduces memory and computation but often degrades accuracy, while
quantization-aware training can recover performance at the cost of extra
training. Pushing quantization to the ternary (2-bit) regime yields even larger
savings but is notoriously unstable. Building on recent work showing that a
bias-free, RMS-normalized Transformer with straight-through estimation can
reach 1.58-bit precision, we demonstrate that simply inserting RMS
normalization before every linear projection and applying a gradual, layer-wise
quantization schedule stably fine-tunes full-precision checkpoints into ternary
LLMs. Our approach matches or surpasses more elaborate knowledge-distillation
pipelines on standard language-modeling benchmarks without adding model
complexity. These results indicate that careful normalization alone can close
much of the accuracy gap between ternary and full-precision LLMs, making
ultra-low-bit inference practical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型在缺乏参考答案的情况下，如何通过自我评判提供可靠的奖励信号，以支持强化学习。

Method: 采用自我评判机制，结合合成问题生成，形成完整的自我改进循环。

Result: 在Countdown谜题和MIT积分问题上实现8%的性能提升，超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 自我评判为模型训练提供有效奖励信号，可能推动AI系统通过自主学习持续改进。

Abstract: We demonstrate that large language models can effectively self-improve
through self-judging without requiring reference solutions, leveraging the
inherent asymmetry between generating and verifying solutions. Our experiments
on Countdown puzzles and MIT Integration Bee problems show that models can
provide reliable reward signals without ground truth answers, enabling
reinforcement learning in domains previously not possible. By implementing
self-judging, we achieve significant performance gains maintaining alignment
with formal verification. When combined with synthetic question generation, we
establish a complete self-improvement loop where models generate practice
problems, solve them, and evaluate their own performance-achieving an 8%
improvement with Qwen 2.5 7B over baseline and surpassing GPT-4o performance on
integration tasks. Our findings demonstrate that LLM judges can provide
effective reward signals for training models, unlocking many reinforcement
learning environments previously limited by the difficulty of creating
programmatic rewards. This suggests a potential paradigm shift toward AI
systems that continuously improve through self-directed learning rather than
human-guided training, potentially accelerating progress in domains with scarce
training data or complex evaluation requirements.

Motivation: 随着AI预测算法的普及，如何在保证准确性的同时实现公平性成为挑战，缺乏明确的权衡指导。

Method: 提出使用线性组合度量准确性与公平性，并基于Harsanyi的偏好聚合理论进行形式化论证。

Result: 通过COMPAS数据集分析，验证了线性组合方法在权衡准确性与公平性时的有效性。

Conclusion: 线性组合方法为预测算法的价值评估提供了可行的解决方案，适用于同时关注准确性与公平性的场景。

Abstract: An algorithm that outputs predictions about the state of the world will
almost always be designed with the implicit or explicit goal of outputting
accurate predictions (i.e., predictions that are likely to be true). In
addition, the rise of increasingly powerful predictive algorithms brought about
by the recent revolution in artificial intelligence has led to an emphasis on
building predictive algorithms that are fair, in the sense that their
predictions do not systematically evince bias or bring about harm to certain
individuals or groups. This state of affairs presents two conceptual
challenges. First, the goals of accuracy and fairness can sometimes be in
tension, and there are no obvious normative guidelines for managing the
trade-offs between these two desiderata when they arise. Second, there are many
distinct ways of measuring both the accuracy and fairness of a predictive
algorithm; here too, there are no obvious guidelines on how to aggregate our
preferences for predictive algorithms that satisfy disparate measures of
fairness and accuracy to various extents. The goal of this paper is to address
these challenges by arguing that there are good reasons for using a linear
combination of accuracy and fairness metrics to measure the
all-things-considered value of a predictive algorithm for agents who care about
both accuracy and fairness. My argument depends crucially on a classic result
in the preference aggregation literature due to Harsanyi. After making this
formal argument, I apply my result to an analysis of accuracy-fairness
trade-offs using the COMPAS dataset compiled by Angwin et al.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据对人类不直观，因此需要简化以提高可解释性。

Method: 提出了与简化复杂性和忠诚度相关的指标，并评估了四种简化算法在不同TSC和数据集上的表现。

Result: 研究发现，简化时间序列在季节性、非平稳或低熵数据中显著优于原始时间序列。

Conclusion: 简化时间序列在TSC可解释性中具有重要价值，尤其是在特定数据特征下。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce metrics to evaluate the use of simplified time
series in the context of interpretability of a TSC - a Time Series Classifier.
Such simplifications are important because time series data, in contrast to
text and image data, are not intuitively understandable to humans. These
metrics are related to the complexity of the simplifications - how many
segments they contain - and to their loyalty - how likely they are to maintain
the classification of the original time series. We employ these metrics to
evaluate four distinct simplification algorithms, across several TSC algorithms
and across datasets of varying characteristics, from seasonal or stationary to
short or long. Our findings suggest that using simplifications for
interpretability of TSC is much better than using the original time series,
particularly when the time series are seasonal, non-stationary and/or with low
entropy.

Conclusion: 研究为理解神经网络训练轨迹的低维流形现象提供了理论支持，并揭示了其几何特性的控制因素。

Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that training trajectories of multiple deep
neural networks with different architectures, optimization algorithms,
hyper-parameter settings, and regularization methods evolve on a remarkably
low-dimensional "hyper-ribbon-like" manifold in the space of probability
distributions. Inspired by the similarities in the training trajectories of
deep networks and linear networks, we analytically characterize this phenomenon
for the latter. We show, using tools in dynamical systems theory, that the
geometry of this low-dimensional manifold is controlled by (i) the decay rate
of the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix of the training data, (ii)
the relative scale of the ground-truth output to the weights at the beginning
of training, and (iii) the number of steps of gradient descent. By analytically
computing and bounding the contributions of these quantities, we characterize
phase boundaries of the region where hyper-ribbons are to be expected. We also
extend our analysis to kernel machines and linear models that are trained with
stochastic gradient descent.

Conclusion: 研究强调了模型简单性、可解释性和泛化能力之间的权衡，并指出商业驱动方法在竞赛框架中的约束。

Abstract: The characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres through spectral analysis is
a complex challenge. The NeurIPS 2024 Ariel Data Challenge, in collaboration
with the European Space Agency's (ESA) Ariel mission, provided an opportunity
to explore machine learning techniques for extracting atmospheric compositions
from simulated spectral data. In this work, we focus on a data-centric business
approach, prioritizing generalization over competition-specific optimization.
We briefly outline multiple experimental axes, including feature extraction,
signal transformation, and heteroskedastic uncertainty modeling. Our
experiments demonstrate that uncertainty estimation plays a crucial role in the
Gaussian Log-Likelihood (GLL) score, impacting performance by several
percentage points. Despite improving the GLL score by 11%, our results
highlight the inherent limitations of tabular modeling and feature engineering
for this task, as well as the constraints of a business-driven approach within
a Kaggle-style competition framework. Our findings emphasize the trade-offs
between model simplicity, interpretability, and generalization in astrophysical
data analysis.

Conclusion: SaFARi为SSM提供了更灵活和通用的构建方式。

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have re-emerged as a powerful tool for online

long-range dependent data. However, to date, only a few polynomial bases have
been explored for this purpose, and the state-of-the-art implementations were
built upon the best of a few limited options. In this paper, we present a
generalized method for building an SSM with any frame or basis, rather than
being restricted to polynomials. This framework encompasses the approach known
as HiPPO, but also permits an infinite diversity of other possible "species"
within the SSM architecture. We dub this approach SaFARi: SSMs for
Frame-Agnostic Representation.

Result: 实现了更好的预测精度，减少了累积误差，并提供了O(log^3 N)的对数遗憾界。

Conclusion: 通过指数遗忘平衡回归模型是一种有效的在线预测方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of online prediction for an unknown, non-explosive
linear stochastic system. With a known system model, the optimal predictor is
the celebrated Kalman filter. In the case of unknown systems, existing
approaches based on recursive least squares and its variants may suffer from
degraded performance due to the highly imbalanced nature of the regression
model. This imbalance can easily lead to overfitting and thus degrade
prediction accuracy. We tackle this problem by injecting an inductive bias into
the regression model via {exponential forgetting}. While exponential forgetting
is a common wisdom in online learning, it is typically used for re-weighting
data. In contrast, our approach focuses on balancing the regression model. This
achieves a better trade-off between {regression} and {regularization errors},
and simultaneously reduces the {accumulation error}. With new proof techniques,
we also provide a sharper logarithmic regret bound of $O(\log^3 N)$, where $N$
is the number of observations.

Abstract: Continual learning for reinforcement learning agents remains a significant
challenge, particularly in preserving and leveraging existing information
without an external signal to indicate changes in tasks or environments. In
this study, we explore the effectiveness of autoencoders in detecting new tasks
and matching observed environments to previously encountered ones. Our approach
integrates policy optimization with familiarity autoencoders within an
end-to-end continual learning system. This system can recognize and learn new
tasks or environments while preserving knowledge from earlier experiences and
can selectively retrieve relevant knowledge when re-encountering a known
environment. Initial results demonstrate successful continual learning without
external signals to indicate task changes or reencounters, showing promise for
this methodology.

Conclusion: 该软件能够高效、可重复地量化转移性骨病，为临床决策提供有用数据。

Abstract: We developed an AI-driven software solution to quantify metastatic bone
disease from WB-DWI scans. Core technologies include: (i) a weakly-supervised
Residual U-Net model generating a skeleton probability map to isolate bone;
(ii) a statistical framework for WB-DWI intensity normalisation, obtaining a
signal-normalised b=900s/mm^2 (b900) image; and (iii) a shallow convolutional
neural network that processes outputs from (i) and (ii) to generate a mask of
suspected bone lesions, characterised by higher b900 signal intensity due to
restricted water diffusion. This mask is applied to the gADC map to extract TDV
and gADC statistics. We tested the tool using expert-defined metastatic bone
disease delineations on 66 datasets, assessed repeatability of imaging
biomarkers (N=10), and compared software-based response assessment with a
construct reference standard based on clinical, laboratory and imaging
assessments (N=118). Dice score between manual and automated delineations was
0.6 for lesions within pelvis and spine, with an average surface distance of
2mm. Relative differences for log-transformed TDV (log-TDV) and median gADC
were below 9% and 5%, respectively. Repeatability analysis showed coefficients
of variation of 4.57% for log-TDV and 3.54% for median gADC, with intraclass
correlation coefficients above 0.9. The software achieved 80.5% accuracy, 84.3%
sensitivity, and 85.7% specificity in assessing response to treatment compared
to the construct reference standard. Computation time generating a mask
averaged 90 seconds per scan. Our software enables reproducible TDV and gADC
quantification from WB-DWI scans for monitoring metastatic bone disease
response, thus providing potentially useful measurements for clinical
decision-making in APC patients.

Conclusion: DyGSSM通过同时提取局部和全局特征，并优化参数更新，显著提升了动态图表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Most of the dynamic graph representation learning methods involve dividing a
dynamic graph into discrete snapshots to capture the evolving behavior of nodes
over time. Existing methods primarily capture only local or global structures
of each node within a snapshot using message-passing and random walk-based
methods. Then, they utilize sequence-based models (e.g., transformers) to
encode the temporal evolution of node embeddings, and meta-learning techniques
to update the model parameters. However, these approaches have two limitations.
First, they neglect the extraction of global and local information
simultaneously in each snapshot. Second, they fail to consider the model's
performance in the current snapshot during parameter updates, resulting in a
lack of temporal dependency management. Recently, HiPPO (High-order Polynomial
Projection Operators) algorithm has gained attention for their ability to
optimize and preserve sequence history in State Space Model (SSM). To address
the aforementioned limitations in dynamic graph representation learning, we
propose a novel method called Multi-view Dynamic Graph Embeddings with State
Space Model Gradient Update (DyGSSM). Our approach combines Graph Convolution
Networks (GCN) for local feature extraction and random walk with Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU) for global feature extraction in each snapshot. We then
integrate the local and global features using a cross-attention mechanism.
Additionally, we incorporate an SSM based on HiPPO algorithm to account for
long-term dependencies when updating model parameters, ensuring that model
performance in each snapshot informs subsequent updates. Experiments on five
public datasets show that our method outperforms existing baseline and
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in 17 out of 20 cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: Mamba在长序列任务中表现不佳，研究通过理论分析提出改进方法B2S6，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba在长序列任务中的表现与其设计初衷不符，需改进其通用性和多功能性。

Method: 从表达能力、归纳偏差和训练稳定性三方面分析Mamba的不足，并提出改进方法B2S6。

Result: B2S6在长序列任务中优于S4和S4D，同时保持语言建模性能。

Conclusion: B2S6解决了Mamba的局限性，提升了其在长序列任务中的表现。

Abstract: Mamba extends earlier state space models (SSMs) by introducing
input-dependent dynamics, and has demonstrated strong empirical performance
across a range of domains, including language modeling, computer vision, and
foundation models. However, a surprising weakness remains: despite being built
on architectures designed for long-range dependencies, Mamba performs poorly on
long-range sequential tasks. Understanding and addressing this gap is important
for improving Mamba's universality and versatility. In this work, we analyze
Mamba's limitations through three perspectives: expressiveness, inductive bias,
and training stability. Our theoretical results show how Mamba falls short in
each of these aspects compared to earlier SSMs such as S4D. To address these
issues, we propose $\text{B}_2\text{S}_6$, a simple extension of Mamba's S6
unit that combines block-wise selective dynamics with a channel-specific bias.
We prove that these changes equip the model with a better-suited inductive bias
and improve its expressiveness and stability. Empirically,
$\text{B}_2\text{S}_6$ outperforms S4 and S4D on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks
while maintaining Mamba's performance on language modeling benchmarks.

TLDR: Flexi-VAE是一种高效的单次预测非线性参数偏微分方程（PDEs）的数据驱动框架，无需迭代时间步进，同时保持高精度和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要迭代时间步进，计算成本高。Flexi-VAE旨在通过神经传播器直接预测PDEs的解，提高效率。

Method: 结合变分自编码器（VAE）和神经传播器，提出两种传播策略（DCP和PEP），并通过表示理论分析验证DCP的优越性。

Result: 在1D和2D PDE基准测试中表现优异，速度提升显著（CPU 50x，GPU 90x）。

Conclusion: Flexi-VAE是一种可扩展且可解释的替代建模工具，适用于计算流体动力学等复杂系统。

Abstract: We introduce Flexi-VAE, a data-driven framework for efficient single-shot
forecasting of nonlinear parametric partial differential equations (PDEs),
eliminating the need for iterative time-stepping while maintaining high
accuracy and stability. Flexi-VAE incorporates a neural propagator that
advances latent representations forward in time, aligning latent evolution with
physical state reconstruction in a variational autoencoder setting. We evaluate
two propagation strategies, the Direct Concatenation Propagator (DCP) and the
Positional Encoding Propagator (PEP), and demonstrate, through
representation-theoretic analysis, that DCP offers superior long-term
generalization by fostering disentangled and physically meaningful latent
spaces. Geometric diagnostics, including Jacobian spectral analysis, reveal
that propagated latent states reside in regions of lower decoder sensitivity
and more stable local geometry than those derived via direct encoding,
enhancing robustness for long-horizon predictions. We validate Flexi-VAE on
canonical PDE benchmarks, the 1D viscous Burgers equation and the 2D
advection-diffusion equation, achieving accurate forecasts across wide
parametric ranges. The model delivers over 50x CPU and 90x GPU speedups
compared to autoencoder-LSTM baselines for large temporal shifts. These results
position Flexi-VAE as a scalable and interpretable surrogate modeling tool for
accelerating high-fidelity simulations in computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
and other parametric PDE-driven applications, with extensibility to
higher-dimensional and more complex systems.

TLDR: AdaFortiTran模型通过结合卷积层和Transformer编码器，在OFDM系统中显著提升了快衰落信道和低信噪比场景下的信道估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在快衰落信道和低信噪比场景下性能下降，需要一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 结合卷积层（捕捉局部相关性）和Transformer编码器（全局注意力机制），并引入信道统计信息作为先验，通过残差连接融合全局与局部特征。

Result: 在多种测试条件下，AdaFortiTran的均方误差比现有最优模型降低6 dB，表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaFortiTran在复杂信道环境下具有显著优势，适用于高移动性场景。

Abstract: Deep learning models for channel estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM) systems often suffer from performance degradation under
fast-fading channels and low-SNR scenarios. To address these limitations, we
introduce the Adaptive Fortified Transformer (AdaFortiTran), a novel model
specifically designed to enhance channel estimation in challenging
environments. Our approach employs convolutional layers that exploit locality
bias to capture strong correlations between neighboring channel elements,
combined with a transformer encoder that applies the global Attention mechanism
to channel patches. This approach effectively models both long-range
dependencies and spectro-temporal interactions within single OFDM frames. We
further augment the model's adaptability by integrating nonlinear
representations of available channel statistics SNR, delay spread, and Doppler
shift as priors. A residual connection is employed to merge global features
from the transformer with local features from early convolutional processing,
followed by final convolutional layers to refine the hierarchical channel
representation. Despite its compact architecture, AdaFortiTran achieves up to 6
dB reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to state-of-the-art models.
Tested across a wide range of Doppler shifts (200-1000 Hz), SNRs (0 to 25 dB),
and delay spreads (50-300 ns), it demonstrates superior robustness in
high-mobility environments.

Conclusion: 人类参与的监督学习能有效增强大型模型的复杂认知能力，为开发更接近人类认知的人工系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly large-scale
language models, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image and natural
language understanding. Although scaling up model parameters with increasing
volume of training data has progressively improved DNN capabilities, achieving
complex cognitive abilities - such as understanding abstract concepts,
reasoning, and adapting to novel scenarios, which are intrinsic to human
cognition - remains a major challenge. In this study, we show that
brain-in-the-loop supervised learning, utilizing a small set of brain signals,
can effectively transfer human conceptual structures to DNNs, significantly
enhancing their comprehension of abstract and even unseen concepts.
Experimental results further indicate that the enhanced cognitive capabilities
lead to substantial performance gains in challenging tasks, including
few-shot/zero-shot learning and out-of-distribution recognition, while also
yielding highly interpretable concept representations. These findings highlight
that human-in-the-loop supervision can effectively augment the complex
cognitive abilities of large models, offering a promising pathway toward
developing more human-like cognitive abilities in artificial systems.

TLDR: 提出了一种时间一致性判别器，使预训练的图像扩散模型能够生成逼真的时空动态，无需额外训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成、处理和建模应用中需要逼真的时间动态，但视频扩散模型（VDMs）训练成本高，限制了广泛应用。

Method: 使用时间一致性判别器指导采样推理过程，无需扩展或微调预训练的图像扩散模型。

Result: 在理想化湍流模拟和全球降水数据集上，该方法与从头训练的VDM表现相当，时间一致性更好，不确定性校准更优，偏差更低。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了稳定的百年尺度气候模拟，展示了预训练模型在时空动态生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Realistic temporal dynamics are crucial for many video generation, processing
and modelling applications, e.g. in computational fluid dynamics, weather
prediction, or long-term climate simulations. Video diffusion models (VDMs) are
the current state-of-the-art method for generating highly realistic dynamics.
However, training VDMs from scratch can be challenging and requires large
computational resources, limiting their wider application. Here, we propose a
time-consistency discriminator that enables pretrained image diffusion models
to generate realistic spatiotemporal dynamics. The discriminator guides the
sampling inference process and does not require extensions or finetuning of the
image diffusion model. We compare our approach against a VDM trained from
scratch on an idealized turbulence simulation and a real-world global
precipitation dataset. Our approach performs equally well in terms of temporal
consistency, shows improved uncertainty calibration and lower biases compared
to the VDM, and achieves stable centennial-scale climate simulations at daily
time steps.

Abstract: The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has recently emerged as a
core element in the 6G networks. However, traditional centralized and
synchronous optimization algorithms are unsuitable for SAGIN due to
infrastructureless and time-varying environments. This paper aims to develop a
novel Asynchronous algorithm a.k.a. Argus for tackling non-convex and
non-smooth decentralized federated bilevel learning over SAGIN. The proposed
algorithm allows networked agents (e.g. autonomous aerial vehicles) to tackle
bilevel learning problems in time-varying networks asynchronously, thereby
averting stragglers from impeding the overall training speed. We provide a
theoretical analysis of the iteration complexity, communication complexity, and
computational complexity of Argus. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated
through numerical experiments.

Motivation: 序列决策中存在未测量混杂因子，影响处理分配和结果，现有方法无法完全解决。

Method: 提出DSIV-CFR框架，利用工具变量和负控制假设，通过广义矩条件估计序列处理效应。

Result: 在4个数据集上实验，显著提升单步和多步预测性能，支持动态系统最优处理识别。

Conclusion: DSIV-CFR框架有效解决了序列处理中的未测量混杂问题，为动态系统决策提供支持。

Abstract: This paper studies the cumulative causal effects of sequential treatments in
the presence of unmeasured confounders. It is a critical issue in sequential
decision-making scenarios where treatment decisions and outcomes dynamically
evolve over time. Advanced causal methods apply transformer as a backbone to
model such time sequences, which shows superiority in capturing long time
dependence and periodic patterns via attention mechanism. However, even they
control the observed confounding, these estimators still suffer from unmeasured
confounders, which influence both treatment assignments and outcomes. How to
adjust the latent confounding bias in sequential treatment effect estimation
remains an open challenge. Therefore, we propose a novel Decomposing Sequential
Instrumental Variable framework for CounterFactual Regression (DSIV-CFR),
relying on a common negative control assumption. Specifically, an instrumental
variable (IV) is a special negative control exposure, while the previous
outcome serves as a negative control outcome. This allows us to recover the IVs
latent in observation variables and estimate sequential treatment effects via a
generalized moment condition. We conducted experiments on 4 datasets and
achieved significant performance in one- and multi-step prediction, supported
by which we can identify optimal treatments for dynamic systems.

Result: FCA在实验中表现出更好的公平性与实用性权衡，且数值稳定性优异。

Conclusion: FCA无需复杂约束即可实现近似最优的聚类实用性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness in clustering aims to balance the proportions of
instances assigned to each cluster with respect to a given sensitive attribute.
While recently developed fair clustering algorithms optimize clustering
objectives under specific fairness constraints, their inherent complexity or
approximation often results in suboptimal clustering utility or numerical
instability in practice. To resolve these limitations, we propose a new fair
clustering algorithm based on a novel decomposition of the fair K-means
clustering objective function. The proposed algorithm, called Fair Clustering
via Alignment (FCA), operates by alternately (i) finding a joint probability
distribution to align the data from different protected groups, and (ii)
optimizing cluster centers in the aligned space. A key advantage of FCA is that
it theoretically guarantees approximately optimal clustering utility for any
given fairness level without complex constraints, thereby enabling high-utility
fair clustering in practice. Experiments show that FCA outperforms existing
methods by (i) attaining a superior trade-off between fairness level and
clustering utility, and (ii) achieving near-perfect fairness without numerical
instability.

Conclusion: DSoftKI是一种高效且可扩展的方法，适用于处理高维全导数观测数据。

Abstract: We present a scalable Gaussian Process (GP) method that can fit and predict
full derivative observations called DSoftKI. It extends SoftKI, a method that
approximates a kernel via softmax interpolation from learned interpolation
point locations, to the setting with derivatives. DSoftKI enhances SoftKI's
interpolation scheme to incorporate the directional orientation of
interpolation points relative to the data. This enables the construction of a
scalable approximate kernel, including its first and second-order derivatives,
through interpolation. We evaluate DSoftKI on a synthetic function benchmark
and high-dimensional molecular force field prediction (100-1000 dimensions),
demonstrating that DSoftKI is accurate and can scale to larger datasets with
full derivative observations than previously possible.

Conclusion: 模型性能和数据效率优于现有方法，为未来研究提供强基线。

Abstract: Current applications of self-supervised learning to wireless channel
representation often borrow paradigms developed for text and image processing,
without fully addressing the unique characteristics and constraints of wireless
communications. Aiming to fill this gap, we first propose WiMAE (Wireless
Masked Autoencoder), a transformer-based encoder-decoder foundation model
pretrained on a realistic open-source multi-antenna wireless channel dataset.
Building upon this foundation, we develop ContraWiMAE, which enhances WiMAE by
incorporating a contrastive learning objective alongside the reconstruction
task in a unified multi-task framework. By warm-starting from pretrained WiMAE
weights and generating positive pairs via noise injection, the contrastive
component enables the model to capture both structural and discriminative
features, enhancing representation quality beyond what reconstruction alone can
achieve. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of both approaches across multiple downstream tasks, with
ContraWiMAE showing further improvements in linear separability and
adaptability in diverse wireless environments. Comparative evaluations against
a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior
performance and data efficiency of our models, highlighting their potential as
powerful baselines for future research in self-supervised wireless channel
representation learning.

Motivation: 大语言模型在自主系统和公共环境中广泛应用，但仍易受越狱漏洞影响，现有防御方法存在局限性。

Method: 提出Adversarial Suffix Filtering（ASF），作为输入预处理和净化器，检测并过滤对抗性后缀。

Result: ASF在黑白盒攻击场景下均有效，将攻击效果降至4%以下，且对模型正常功能影响极小。

Conclusion: ASF为对抗性后缀攻击提供了一种高效、通用的防御解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in autonomous systems
and public-facing environments, yet they remain susceptible to jailbreak
vulnerabilities that may undermine their security and trustworthiness.
Adversarial suffixes are considered to be the current state-of-the-art
jailbreak, consistently outperforming simpler methods and frequently succeeding
even in black-box settings. Existing defenses rely on access to the internal
architecture of models limiting diverse deployment, increase memory and
computation footprints dramatically, or can be bypassed with simple prompt
engineering methods. We introduce $\textbf{Adversarial Suffix Filtering}$
(ASF), a lightweight novel model-agnostic defensive pipeline designed to
protect LLMs against adversarial suffix attacks. ASF functions as an input
preprocessor and sanitizer that detects and filters adversarially crafted
suffixes in prompts, effectively neutralizing malicious injections. We
demonstrate that ASF provides comprehensive defense capabilities across both
black-box and white-box attack settings, reducing the attack efficacy of
state-of-the-art adversarial suffix generation methods to below 4%, while only
minimally affecting the target model's capabilities in non-adversarial
scenarios.

Motivation: 杂化有机-无机钙钛矿（HOIPs）在光电领域具有优异性能，但传统GNNs难以捕捉其周期性结构和高阶相互作用，限制了材料性质预测的准确性。

Method: 提出商复形表示方法，通过不同维度的单纯形编码多体相互作用，并利用商操作捕捉周期性结构；设计QCformer模型，基于单纯形的Transformer模块处理高阶特征。

Result: QCformer在HOIP性质预测任务中表现优于现有最优模型，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 商复形表示和QCformer模型为钙钛矿材料的预测建模提供了强大工具。

Abstract: The discovery of novel functional materials is crucial in addressing the
challenges of sustainable energy generation and climate change. Hybrid
organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have gained attention for their
exceptional optoelectronic properties in photovoltaics. Recently, geometric
deep learning, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown strong
potential in predicting material properties and guiding material design.
However, traditional GNNs often struggle to capture the periodic structures and
higher-order interactions prevalent in such systems. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel representation based on quotient complexes
(QCs) and introduce the Quotient Complex Transformer (QCformer) for material
property prediction. A material structure is modeled as a quotient complex,
which encodes both pairwise and many-body interactions via simplices of varying
dimensions and captures material periodicity through a quotient operation. Our
model leverages higher-order features defined on simplices and processes them
using a simplex-based Transformer module. We pretrain QCformer on benchmark
datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS, and fine-tune it on HOIP
datasets. The results show that QCformer outperforms state-of-the-art models in
HOIP property prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness. The quotient complex
representation and QCformer model together contribute a powerful new tool for
predictive modeling of perovskite materials.

Method: 开发了一个可扩展的LLM驱动管道，模拟品牌CXM实体，并通过噪声注入和自动化验证生成数据集。

Result: CXMArena基准显示，即使最先进的模型在文章搜索和知识库细化等任务上表现不佳，准确率仅为68%，F1分数为0.3。

Conclusion: CXMArena为评估AI在CXM中的实用性提供了更真实的基准，揭示了当前模型在复杂任务中的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense potential for revolutionizing
Customer Experience Management (CXM), particularly in contact center
operations. However, evaluating their practical utility in complex operational
environments is hindered by data scarcity (due to privacy concerns) and the
limitations of current benchmarks. Existing benchmarks often lack realism,
failing to incorporate deep knowledge base (KB) integration, real-world noise,
or critical operational tasks beyond conversational fluency. To bridge this
gap, we introduce CXMArena, a novel, large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset
specifically designed for evaluating AI in operational CXM contexts. Given the
diversity in possible contact center features, we have developed a scalable
LLM-powered pipeline that simulates the brand's CXM entities that form the
foundation of our datasets-such as knowledge articles including product
specifications, issue taxonomies, and contact center conversations. The
entities closely represent real-world distribution because of controlled noise
injection (informed by domain experts) and rigorous automated validation.
Building on this, we release CXMArena, which provides dedicated benchmarks
targeting five important operational tasks: Knowledge Base Refinement, Intent
Prediction, Agent Quality Adherence, Article Search, and Multi-turn RAG with
Integrated Tools. Our baseline experiments underscore the benchmark's
difficulty: even state of the art embedding and generation models achieve only
68% accuracy on article search, while standard embedding methods yield a low F1
score of 0.3 for knowledge base refinement, highlighting significant challenges
for current models necessitating complex pipelines and solutions over
conventional techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for prioritizing urban green space
development in Tehran using diverse socio-economic, environmental, and
sensitivity indices. The indices were derived from various sources including
Google Earth Engine, air pollution measurements, municipal reports and the
Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model. The WRF model was used to estimate
the air temperature at a 1 km resolution due to insufficient meteorological
stations, yielding RMSE and MAE values of 0.96{\deg}C and 0.92{\deg}C,
respectively. After data preparation, several machine learning models were used
for binary vegetation cover classification including XGBoost, LightGBM, Random
Forest (RF) and Extra Trees. RF achieved the highest performance, exceeding 94%
in Overall Accuracy, Recall, and F1-score. Then, the probability of areas
lacking vegetation cover was assessed using socio-economic, environmental and
sensitivity indices. This resulted in the RF generating an urban green space
development prioritization map. Feature Importance Analysis revealed that the
most significant indices were nightly land surface temperature (LST) and
sensitive population. Finally, the framework performance was validated through
microclimate simulation to assess the critical areas after and before the green
space development by green roofs. The simulation demonstrated reducing air
temperature by up to 0.67{\deg}C after utilizing the green roof technology in
critical areas. As a result, this framework provides a valuable tool for urban
planners to develop green spaces.

Abstract: The growing demand for large artificial intelligence model (LAIM) services is
driving a paradigm shift from traditional cloud-based inference to edge-based
inference for low-latency, privacy-preserving applications. In particular,
edge-device co-inference, which partitions LAIMs between edge devices and
servers, has emerged as a promising strategy for resource-efficient LAIM
execution in wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate a pruning-aware
LAIM co-inference scheme, where a pre-trained LAIM is pruned and partitioned
into on-device and on-server sub-models for deployment. For analysis, we first
prove that the LAIM output distortion is upper bounded by its parameter
distortion. Then, we derive a lower bound on parameter distortion via
rate-distortion theory, analytically capturing the relationship between pruning
ratio and co-inference performance. Next, based on the analytical results, we
formulate an LAIM co-inference distortion bound minimization problem by jointly
optimizing the pruning ratio, transmit power, and computation frequency under
system latency, energy, and available resource constraints. Moreover, we
propose an efficient algorithm to tackle the considered highly non-convex
problem. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed design. In particular, model parameter distortion is shown to provide
a reliable bound on output distortion. Also, the proposed joint pruning ratio
and resource management design achieves superior performance in balancing
trade-offs among inference performance, system latency, and energy consumption
compared with benchmark schemes, such as fully on-device and on-server
inference. Moreover, the split point is shown to play a critical role in system
performance optimization under heterogeneous and resource-limited edge
environments.

### [62] [Birch SGD: A Tree Graph Framework for Local and Asynchronous SGD Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09218)
*Alexander Tyurin,Danil Sivtsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: Birch SGD是一个统一框架，用于分析和设计分布式SGD方法，通过计算树表示方法，简化收敛分析并设计新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为分布式SGD方法提供一个统一的理论基础，简化收敛分析并促进新方法的设计。

Method: 将每种方法表示为加权有向树（计算树），通过树的几何性质分析收敛性，并设计新方法。

Result: 提出了八种新方法，其中至少六种具有最优计算时间复杂度，揭示了所有方法共享相同的迭代率。

Conclusion: Birch SGD为理解和设计高效异步和并行优化方法提供了统一框架。

Abstract: We propose a new unifying framework, Birch SGD, for analyzing and designing
distributed SGD methods. The central idea is to represent each method as a
weighted directed tree, referred to as a computation tree. Leveraging this
representation, we introduce a general theoretical result that reduces
convergence analysis to studying the geometry of these trees. This perspective
yields a purely graph-based interpretation of optimization dynamics, offering a
new and intuitive foundation for method development. Using Birch SGD, we design
eight new methods and analyze them alongside previously known ones, with at
least six of the new methods shown to have optimal computational time
complexity. Our research leads to two key insights: (i) all methods share the
same "iteration rate" of $O\left(\frac{(R + 1) L \Delta}{\varepsilon} +
\frac{\sigma^2 L \Delta}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$, where $R$ the maximum "tree
distance" along the main branch of a tree; and (ii) different methods exhibit
different trade-offs-for example, some update iterates more frequently,
improving practical performance, while others are more communication-efficient
or focus on other aspects. Birch SGD serves as a unifying framework for
navigating these trade-offs. We believe these results provide a unified
foundation for understanding, analyzing, and designing efficient asynchronous
and parallel optimization methods.

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) method frequently suffers from unstable

points of the IB trade-off parameter, beta. In this paper, I introduce a novel
approach to achieve stable and convex IB optimization through symbolic
continuation and entropy-regularized trajectories. I analytically prove
convexity and uniqueness of the IB solution path when an entropy regularization
term is included, and demonstrate how this stabilizes representation learning
across a wide range of \b{eta} values. Additionally, I provide extensive
sensitivity analyses around critical points (beta) with statistically robust
uncertainty quantification (95% confidence intervals). The open-source
implementation, experimental results, and reproducibility framework included in
this work offer a clear path for practical deployment and future extension of
my proposed method.

Abstract: Modeling and reconstructing multidimensional physical dynamics from sparse
and off-grid observations presents a fundamental challenge in scientific
research. Recently, diffusion-based generative modeling shows promising
potential for physical simulation. However, current approaches typically
operate on on-grid data with preset spatiotemporal resolution, but struggle
with the sparsely observed and continuous nature of real-world physical
dynamics. To fill the gaps, we present SDIFT, Sequential DIffusion in
Functional Tucker space, a novel framework that generates full-field evolution
of physical dynamics from irregular sparse observations. SDIFT leverages the
functional Tucker model as the latent space representer with proven universal
approximation property, and represents observations as latent functions and
Tucker core sequences. We then construct a sequential diffusion model with
temporally augmented UNet in the functional Tucker space, denoising noise drawn
from a Gaussian process to generate the sequence of core tensors.
  At the posterior sampling stage, we propose a Message-Passing Posterior
Sampling mechanism, enabling conditional generation of the entire sequence
guided by observations at limited time steps. We validate SDIFT on three
physical systems spanning astronomical (supernova explosions, light-year
scale), environmental (ocean sound speed fields, kilometer scale), and
molecular (organic liquid, millimeter scale) domains, demonstrating significant
improvements in both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Digital textbooks are widely used in various educational contexts, such as
university courses and online lectures. Such textbooks yield learning log data
that have been used in numerous educational data mining (EDM) studies for
student behavior analysis and performance prediction. However, these studies
have faced challenges in integrating confidential data, such as academic
records and learning logs, across schools due to privacy concerns.
Consequently, analyses are often conducted with data limited to a single
school, which makes developing high-performing and generalizable models
difficult. This study proposes a method that combines federated learning and
differential features to address these issues. Federated learning enables model
training without centralizing data, thereby preserving student privacy.
Differential features, which utilize relative values instead of absolute
values, enhance model performance and generalizability. To evaluate the
proposed method, a model for predicting at-risk students was trained using data
from 1,136 students across 12 courses conducted over 4 years, and validated on
hold-out test data from 5 other courses. Experimental results demonstrated that
the proposed method addresses privacy concerns while achieving performance
comparable to that of models trained via centralized learning in terms of Top-n
precision, nDCG, and PR-AUC. Furthermore, using differential features improved
prediction performance across all evaluation datasets compared to
non-differential approaches. The trained models were also applicable for early
prediction, achieving high performance in detecting at-risk students in earlier
stages of the semester within the validation datasets.

Abstract: Decision trees and forests have achieved successes in various real
applications, most working with all testing classes known in training data. In
this work, we focus on learning with augmented class via forests, where an
augmented class may appear in testing data yet not in training data. We
incorporate information of augmented class into trees' splitting, i.e., a new
splitting criterion, called augmented Gini impurity, is introduced to exploit
some unlabeled data from testing distribution. We then develop the approach
named Learning with Augmented Class via Forests (LACForest), which constructs
shallow forests based on the augmented Gini impurity and then splits forests
with pseudo-labeled augmented instances for better performance. We also develop
deep neural forests with a novel optimization objective based on our augmented
Gini impurity, so as to utilize the representation power of neural networks for
forests. Theoretically, we present the convergence analysis for augmented Gini
impurity, and finally conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of our
approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/nju-xuf/LACForest/.

Motivation: 研究多任务模型与单任务模型的训练性能差异，以及目标归一化对训练效果的作用，为深度神经网络设计和数据预处理提供理论支持。

Method: 使用UFM框架进行理论分析，并通过实验验证其预测结果。

Result: 多任务模型在相同或更强正则化下训练MSE更小；目标归一化在目标维度平均方差小于1时能降低训练MSE。

Conclusion: UFM是一个强大的框架，可为DNN设计和数据预处理提供实用见解。

Abstract: The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) is a mathematical framework that
enables closed-form approximations for minimal training loss and related
performance measures in deep neural networks (DNNs). This paper leverages the
UFM to provide qualitative insights into neural multivariate regression, a
critical task in imitation learning, robotics, and reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we address two key questions: (1) How do multi-task models
compare to multiple single-task models in terms of training performance? (2)
Can whitening and normalizing regression targets improve training performance?
The UFM theory predicts that multi-task models achieve strictly smaller
training MSE than multiple single-task models when the same or stronger
regularization is applied to the latter, and our empirical results confirm
these findings. Regarding whitening and normalizing regression targets, the UFM
theory predicts that they reduce training MSE when the average variance across
the target dimensions is less than one, and our empirical results once again
confirm these findings. These findings highlight the UFM as a powerful
framework for deriving actionable insights into DNN design and data
pre-processing strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对抗性环境中，无人机自组网的链路预测仅能依赖历史拓扑信息，而现有方法因忽略稀疏性和单一结构尺度的时间动态性，导致预测效果不佳。

Method: 结合图注意力网络（GATs）捕捉多尺度结构特征（个体、社区、网络层面），并使用LSTM学习时间动态性，同时通过优化损失函数解决稀疏性问题。

Result: 在多个模拟数据集上验证，MUST在高度动态和稀疏的UANETs中实现了最先进的链路预测性能。

Conclusion: MUST模型通过多尺度结构-时间特征和稀疏性优化，显著提升了UANETs中的链路预测准确性。

Abstract: Link prediction in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ad hoc networks (UANETs)
aims to predict the potential formation of future links between UAVs. In
adversarial environments where the route information of UAVs is unavailable,
predicting future links must rely solely on the observed historical topological
information of UANETs. However, the highly dynamic and sparse nature of UANET
topologies presents substantial challenges in effectively capturing meaningful
structural and temporal patterns for accurate link prediction. Most existing
link prediction methods focus on temporal dynamics at a single structural scale
while neglecting the effects of sparsity, resulting in insufficient information
capture and limited applicability to UANETs. In this paper, we propose a
multi-scale structural-temporal link prediction model (MUST) for UANETs.
Specifically, we first employ graph attention networks (GATs) to capture
structural features at multiple levels, including the individual UAV level, the
UAV community level, and the overall network level. Then, we use long
short-term memory (LSTM) networks to learn the temporal dynamics of these
multi-scale structural features. Additionally, we address the impact of
sparsity by introducing a sophisticated loss function during model
optimization. We validate the performance of MUST using several UANET datasets
generated through simulations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
MUST achieves state-of-the-art link prediction performance in highly dynamic
and sparse UANETs.

Conclusion: GreenFactory在多种数据集和搜索空间中表现稳健，显著提升了零成本代理的预测能力。

Abstract: Determining the performance of a Deep Neural Network during Neural
Architecture Search processes is essential for identifying optimal
architectures and hyperparameters. Traditionally, this process requires
training and evaluation of each network, which is time-consuming and
resource-intensive. Zero-cost proxies estimate performance without training,
serving as an alternative to traditional training. However, recent proxies
often lack generalization across diverse scenarios and provide only relative
rankings rather than predicted accuracies. To address these limitations, we
propose GreenFactory, an ensemble of zero-cost proxies that leverages a random
forest regressor to combine multiple predictors' strengths and directly predict
model test accuracy. We evaluate GreenFactory on NATS-Bench, achieving robust
results across multiple datasets. Specifically, GreenFactory achieves high
Kendall correlations on NATS-Bench-SSS, indicating substantial agreement
between its predicted scores and actual performance: 0.907 for CIFAR-10, 0.945
for CIFAR-100, and 0.920 for ImageNet-16-120. Similarly, on NATS-Bench-TSS, we
achieve correlations of 0.921 for CIFAR-10, 0.929 for CIFAR-100, and 0.908 for
ImageNet-16-120, showcasing its reliability in both search spaces.

Result: 在3个合成基准和5个真实PLL数据集上的实验表明，CleanSE能提升现有PLL方法的性能。

Conclusion: CleanSE策略有效利用了干净样本的监督信息，显著提升了部分标签学习的性能。

Abstract: Diminishing the impact of false-positive labels is critical for conducting
disambiguation in partial label learning. However, the existing disambiguation
strategies mainly focus on exploiting the characteristics of individual partial
label instances while neglecting the strong supervision information of clean
samples randomly lying in the datasets. In this work, we show that clean
samples can be collected to offer guidance and enhance the confidence of the
most possible candidates. Motivated by the manner of the differentiable count
loss strat- egy and the K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm, we proposed a new
calibration strategy called CleanSE. Specifically, we attribute the most
reliable candidates with higher significance under the assumption that for each
clean sample, if its label is one of the candidates of its nearest neighbor in
the representation space, it is more likely to be the ground truth of its
neighbor. Moreover, clean samples offer help in characterizing the sample
distributions by restricting the label counts of each label to a specific
interval. Extensive experiments on 3 synthetic benchmarks and 5 real-world PLL
datasets showed this calibration strategy can be applied to most of the
state-of-the-art PLL methods as well as enhance their performance.

Conclusion: MixQ-GNN高效且兼容现有方法，显著提升GNN计算效率。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for handling large-scale
graph applications. However, the computational demands of GNNs necessitate the
development of efficient methods to accelerate inference. Mixed precision
quantization emerges as a promising solution to enhance the efficiency of GNN
architectures without compromising prediction performance. Compared to
conventional deep learning architectures, GNN layers contain a wider set of
components that can be quantized, including message passing functions,
aggregation functions, update functions, the inputs, learnable parameters, and
outputs of these functions. In this paper, we introduce a theorem for efficient
quantized message passing to aggregate integer messages. It guarantees
numerical equality of the aggregated messages using integer values with respect
to those obtained with full (FP32) precision. Based on this theorem, we
introduce the Mixed Precision Quantization for GNN (MixQ-GNN) framework, which
flexibly selects effective integer bit-widths for all components within GNN
layers. Our approach systematically navigates the wide set of possible
bit-width combinations, addressing the challenge of optimizing efficiency while
aiming at maintaining comparable prediction performance. MixQ-GNN integrates
with existing GNN quantization methods, utilizing their graph structure
advantages to achieve higher prediction performance. On average, MixQ-GNN
achieved reductions in bit operations of 5.5x for node classification and 5.1x
for graph classification compared to architectures represented in FP32
precision.

Conclusion: 可学习激活函数可能在更复杂任务中表现更好；DL模型可使用池化数据训练，简化假肢控制的数据需求。

Abstract: Objective: This paper investigates the potential of learnable activation
functions in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for personalized control in a
lower-limb prosthesis. In addition, user-specific vs. pooled training data is
evaluated to improve machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) performance
for turn intent prediction.
  Method: Inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from the shank were collected
from five individuals with lower-limb amputation performing turning tasks in a
laboratory setting. Ability to classify an upcoming turn was evaluated for
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), convolutional
neural network (CNN), and fractional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FKAN). The
comparison of MLP and KAN (for ML models) and FKAN and CNN (for DL models)
assessed the effectiveness of learnable activation functions. Models were
trained separately on user-specific and pooled data to evaluate the impact of
training data on their performance.
  Results: Learnable activation functions in KAN and FKAN did not yield
significant improvement compared to MLP and CNN, respectively. Training on
user-specific data yielded superior results compared to pooled data for ML
models ($p < 0.05$). In contrast, no significant difference was observed
between user-specific and pooled training for DL models.
  Significance: These findings suggest that learnable activation functions may
demonstrate distinct advantages in datasets involving more complex tasks and
larger volumes. In addition, pooled training showed comparable performance to
user-specific training in DL models, indicating that model training for
prosthesis control can utilize data from multiple participants.

Motivation: LLM在自动驾驶路径规划中表现出潜力，但其过度自信和幻觉行为引发安全隐患，需要一种方法确保安全性。

Method: SafePath分三阶段：生成多样候选路径，通过保形预测过滤高风险路径，最后根据不确定性选择最优路径或移交人类控制。

Result: 实验表明，SafePath减少77%的不确定性和高达70%的碰撞率。

Conclusion: SafePath通过形式化保障和灵活的人机协作，显著提升了LLM路径规划的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show growing promise in autonomous driving by
reasoning over complex traffic scenarios to generate path plans. However, their
tendencies toward overconfidence, and hallucinations raise critical safety
concerns. We introduce SafePath, a modular framework that augments LLM-based
path planning with formal safety guarantees using conformal prediction.
SafePath operates in three stages. In the first stage, we use an LLM that
generates a set of diverse candidate paths, exploring possible trajectories
based on agent behaviors and environmental cues. In the second stage, SafePath
filters out high-risk trajectories while guaranteeing that at least one safe
option is included with a user-defined probability, through a multiple-choice
question-answering formulation that integrates conformal prediction. In the
final stage, our approach selects the path with the lowest expected collision
risk when uncertainty is low or delegates control to a human when uncertainty
is high. We theoretically prove that SafePath guarantees a safe trajectory with
a user-defined probability, and we show how its human delegation rate can be
tuned to balance autonomy and safety. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and
Highway-env show that SafePath reduces planning uncertainty by 77\% and
collision rates by up to 70\%, demonstrating effectiveness in making LLM-driven
path planning more safer.

Abstract: Surrogate regret bounds bridge the gap between the convergence rates of
surrogate and target losses, with linear bounds favorable for their lossless
regret transfer. While convex smooth surrogate losses are appealing in
particular due to the efficient estimation and optimization, the existence of a
trade-off between the smoothness and linear regret bound has been believed in
the community. That being said, the better optimization and estimation
properties of convex smooth surrogate losses may inevitably deteriorate after
undergoing the regret transfer onto a target loss. We overcome this dilemma for
arbitrary discrete target losses by constructing a convex smooth surrogate
loss, which entails a linear surrogate regret bound composed with a tailored
prediction link. The construction is based on Fenchel-Young losses generated by
the convolutional negentropy, which are equivalent to the infimal convolution
of a generalized negentropy and the target Bayes risk. Consequently, the
infimal convolution enables us to derive a smooth loss while maintaining the
surrogate regret bound linear. We additionally benefit from the infimal
convolution to have a consistent estimator of the underlying class probability.
Our results are overall a novel demonstration of how convex analysis penetrates
into optimization and statistical efficiency in risk minimization.

Abstract: Deterministic Rank Reduction Autoencoders (RRAEs) enforce by construction a
regularization on the latent space by applying a truncated SVD. While this
regularization makes Autoencoders more powerful, using them for generative
purposes is counter-intuitive due to their deterministic nature. On the other
hand, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are well known for their generative
abilities by learning a probabilistic latent space. In this paper, we present
Variational Rank Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs), a model that leverages the
advantages of both RRAEs and VAEs. Our claims and results show that when
carefully sampling the latent space of RRAEs and further regularizing with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (similarly to VAEs), VRRAEs outperform RRAEs
and VAEs. Additionally, we show that the regularization induced by the SVD not
only makes VRRAEs better generators than VAEs, but also reduces the possibility
of posterior collapse. Our results include a synthetic dataset of a small size
that showcases the robustness of VRRAEs against collapse, and three real-world
datasets; the MNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR-10, over which VRRAEs are shown to
outperform both VAEs and RRAEs on many random generation and interpolation
tasks based on the FID score.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在非稳态问题中容易丧失塑性，影响增量学习能力。AdaLin旨在通过自适应线性化解决这一问题。

Method: AdaLin为每个神经元引入可学习参数和门控机制，动态调整激活函数的线性部分，确保梯度信号充足。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试（如MNIST、CIFAR-10/100）和复杂场景（如增量学习和强化学习）中，AdaLin显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: AdaLin通过神经元级别的自适应调整，有效缓解塑性损失，且无需额外超参数或任务边界，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Loss of plasticity in deep neural networks is the gradual reduction in a
model's capacity to incrementally learn and has been identified as a key
obstacle to learning in non-stationary problem settings. Recent work has shown
that deep linear networks tend to be resilient towards loss of plasticity.
Motivated by this observation, we propose Adaptive Linearization (AdaLin), a
general approach that dynamically adapts each neuron's activation function to
mitigate plasticity loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on regularization or
periodic resets, AdaLin equips every neuron with a learnable parameter and a
gating mechanism that injects linearity into the activation function based on
its gradient flow. This adaptive modulation ensures sufficient gradient signal
and sustains continual learning without introducing additional hyperparameters
or requiring explicit task boundaries. When used with conventional activation
functions like ReLU, Tanh, and GeLU, we demonstrate that AdaLin can
significantly improve performance on standard benchmarks, including Random
Label and Permuted MNIST, Random Label and Shuffled CIFAR-10, and Class-Split
CIFAR-100. Furthermore, its efficacy is shown in more complex scenarios, such
as class-incremental learning on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-18 backbone, and in
mitigating plasticity loss in off-policy reinforcement learning agents. We
perform a systematic set of ablations that show that neuron-level adaptation is
crucial for good performance and analyze a number of metrics in the network
that might be correlated to loss of plasticity.

Motivation: 探究后训练方法对语言模型行为的修改及其脆弱性，尤其是这些修改容易被提示工程或再学习绕过的问题。

Method: 设计了分层遗忘算法（LU），通过分阶段遗忘数据子集来抑制再学习恢复完整数据的能力。

Result: 实验表明，LU提高了多种遗忘方法对对抗性再学习的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LU为机器遗忘领域提供了新方法，并揭示了后训练更新的影响。

Abstract: Our goal is to understand how post-training methods, such as fine-tuning,
alignment, and unlearning, modify language model behavior and representations.
We are particularly interested in the brittle nature of these modifications
that makes them easy to bypass through prompt engineering or relearning. Recent
results suggest that post-training induces shallow context-dependent
``circuits'' that suppress specific response patterns. This could be one
explanation for the brittleness of post-training. To test this hypothesis, we
design an unlearning algorithm, Layered Unlearning (LU), that creates distinct
inhibitory mechanisms for a growing subset of the data. By unlearning the first
$i$ folds while retaining the remaining $k - i$ at the $i$th of $k$ stages, LU
limits the ability of relearning on a subset of data to recover the full
dataset. We evaluate LU through a combination of synthetic and large language
model (LLM) experiments. We find that LU improves robustness to adversarial
relearning for several different unlearning methods. Our results contribute to
the state-of-the-art of machine unlearning and provide insight into the effect
of post-training updates.

Method: 论文提出了三种预处理策略：相关性移除、群体平衡演示选择和基于不确定性的演示选择，以解决偏见问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，基于不确定性的演示选择能有效提升群体公平性。

Conclusion: 基于不确定性的演示选择是提升表格ICL公平性的有效方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Tabular foundational models have exhibited strong in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities on structured data, allowing them to make accurate predictions on
test sets without parameter updates, using training examples as context. This
emerging approach positions itself as a competitive alternative to traditional
gradient-boosted tree methods. However, while biases in conventional machine
learning models are well documented, it remains unclear how these biases
manifest in tabular ICL. The paper investigates the fairness implications of
tabular ICL and explores three preprocessing strategies--correlation removal,
group-balanced demonstration selection, and uncertainty-based demonstration
selection--to address bias. Comprehensive experiments indicate that
uncertainty-based demonstration selection consistently enhances group fairness
of in-context predictions. The source code for reproducing the results of this
work can be found at https://github.com/patrikken/Fair-TabICL.

Result: 梯度流在足够好的初始化下会发散到无穷大，损失趋于渐近临界值。

Conclusion: 理论结果在数值实验和实际场景中得到验证，揭示了梯度流行为的普遍性。

Abstract: We study gradient flows for loss landscapes of fully connected feed forward
neural networks with commonly used continuously differentiable activation
functions such as the logistic, hyperbolic tangent, softplus or GELU function.
We prove that the gradient flow either converges to a critical point or
diverges to infinity while the loss converges to an asymptotic critical value.
Moreover, we prove the existence of a threshold $\varepsilon>0$ such that the
loss value of any gradient flow initialized at most $\varepsilon$ above the
optimal level converges to it. For polynomial target functions and sufficiently
big architecture and data set, we prove that the optimal loss value is zero and
can only be realized asymptotically. From this setting, we deduce our main
result that any gradient flow with sufficiently good initialization diverges to
infinity. Our proof heavily relies on the geometry of o-minimal structures. We
confirm these theoretical findings with numerical experiments and extend our
investigation to real-world scenarios, where we observe an analogous behavior.

Result: 在7个基准数据集上，RTPool模型性能优于21种现有方法。

Conclusion: RT聚类和RTPool模型有效提取了高阶几何结构，提升了图分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective for learning from
graph-structured data through their neighborhood-based message passing
framework. Many hierarchical graph clustering pooling methods modify this
framework by introducing clustering-based strategies, enabling the construction
of more expressive and powerful models. However, all of these message passing
framework heavily rely on the connectivity structure of graphs, limiting their
ability to capture the rich geometric features inherent in geometric graphs. To
address this, we propose Rhomboid Tiling (RT) clustering, a novel clustering
method based on the rhomboid tiling structure, which performs clustering by
leveraging the complex geometric information of the data and effectively
extracts its higher-order geometric structures. Moreover, we design RTPool, a
hierarchical graph clustering pooling model based on RT clustering for graph
classification tasks. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance,
outperforming 21 state-of-the-art competitors on all the 7 benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Online-iForest在需要快速识别异常的应用（如网络安全、欺诈检测）中具有潜力。

Abstract: The anomaly detection literature is abundant with offline methods, which
require repeated access to data in memory, and impose impractical assumptions
when applied to a streaming context. Existing online anomaly detection methods
also generally fail to address these constraints, resorting to periodic
retraining to adapt to the online context. We propose Online-iForest, a novel
method explicitly designed for streaming conditions that seamlessly tracks the
data generating process as it evolves over time. Experimental validation on
real-world datasets demonstrated that Online-iForest is on par with online
alternatives and closely rivals state-of-the-art offline anomaly detection
techniques that undergo periodic retraining. Notably, Online-iForest
consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency, making it a
promising solution in applications where fast identification of anomalies is of
primary importance such as cybersecurity, fraud and fault detection.

Motivation: 随着人机协作在教育中的普及，理解并量化这种互动的程度和性质成为挑战。

Method: 研究分为三个阶段：数据集选择与扩展、作者验证方法开发、系统评估。使用了三个数据集，包括公开数据集和学生写作数据，开发了适应性特征向量差异方法。

Result: 增强的作者验证分类器能有效识别风格差异，量化人机协作，并为教育者提供透明工具。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了作者验证技术，为AI时代的学术写作动态提供了实用见解。

Abstract: As human-AI collaboration becomes increasingly prevalent in educational
contexts, understanding and measuring the extent and nature of such
interactions pose significant challenges. This research investigates the use of
authorship verification (AV) techniques not as a punitive measure, but as a
means to quantify AI assistance in academic writing, with a focus on promoting
transparency, interpretability, and student development. Building on prior
work, we structured our investigation into three stages: dataset selection and
expansion, AV method development, and systematic evaluation. Using three
datasets - including a public dataset (PAN-14) and two from University of
Melbourne students from various courses - we expanded the data to include
LLM-generated texts, totalling 1,889 documents and 540 authorship problems from
506 students. We developed an adapted Feature Vector Difference AV methodology
to construct robust academic writing profiles for students, designed to capture
meaningful, individual characteristics of their writing. The method's
effectiveness was evaluated across multiple scenarios, including distinguishing
between student-authored and LLM-generated texts and testing resilience against
LLMs' attempts to mimic student writing styles. Results demonstrate the
enhanced AV classifier's ability to identify stylometric discrepancies and
measure human-AI collaboration at word and sentence levels while providing
educators with a transparent tool to support academic integrity investigations.
This work advances AV technology, offering actionable insights into the
dynamics of academic writing in an AI-driven era.

Conclusion: AI驱动的动态叙事在教育游戏中具有潜力，但需进一步优化设计。

Abstract: Motivation is an important factor underlying successful learning. Previous
research has demonstrated the positive effects that static interactive
narrative games can have on motivation. Concurrently, advances in AI have made
dynamic and adaptive approaches to interactive narrative increasingly
accessible. However, limited work has explored the impact that dynamic
narratives can have on learner motivation. In this paper, we compare two
versions of Academical, a choice-based educational interactive narrative game
about research ethics. One version employs a traditional hand-authored
branching plot (i.e., static narrative) while the other dynamically sequences
plots during play (i.e., dynamic narrative). Results highlight the importance
of responsive content and a variety of choices for player engagement, while
also illustrating the challenge of balancing pedagogical goals with the dynamic
aspects of narrative. We also discuss design implications that arise from these
findings. Ultimately, this work provides initial steps to illuminate the
emerging potential of AI-driven dynamic narrative in educational games.

Motivation: 重新评估人类与大型语言模型在语言理解任务中的表现，指出原始研究可能高估人类能力并低估模型能力。

Method: 采用预注册研究，比较人类在允许重读和限制重读两种条件下的表现，并与多个语言模型（如Falcon-180B-Chat、GPT-4、GPT-o1）进行对比。

Result: 人类在限制重读条件下的准确率（73%）低于Falcon-180B-Chat（76%）和GPT-4（81%），GPT-o1达到100%准确率。模型和人类在涉及互惠动作的查询中表现相似。

Conclusion: 实验设计和编码方法对评估结果至关重要，当前模型的语言理解能力可能被低估，且不一定弱于人类。

Abstract: Recent claims suggest that large language models (LMs) underperform humans in
comprehending minimally complex English statements (Dentella et al., 2024).
Here, we revisit those findings and argue that human performance was
overestimated, while LLM abilities were underestimated. Using the same stimuli,
we report a preregistered study comparing human responses in two conditions:
one allowed rereading (replicating the original study), and one that restricted
rereading (a more naturalistic comprehension test). Human accuracy dropped
significantly when rereading was restricted (73%), falling below that of
Falcon-180B-Chat (76%) and GPT-4 (81%). The newer GPT-o1 model achieves perfect
accuracy. Results further show that both humans and models are
disproportionately challenged by queries involving potentially reciprocal
actions (e.g., kissing), suggesting shared pragmatic sensitivities rather than
model-specific deficits. Additional analyses using Llama-2-70B log
probabilities, a recoding of open-ended model responses, and grammaticality
ratings of other sentences reveal systematic underestimation of model
performance. We find that GPT-4o can align with either naive or expert
grammaticality judgments, depending on prompt framing. These findings
underscore the need for more careful experimental design and coding practices
in LLM evaluation, and they challenge the assumption that current models are
inherently weaker than humans at language comprehension.

Method: 通过人类任务和新扩展任务对GPT-4进行零样本测试，研究其对信息结构和可接受性任务的元语言能力。

Result: GPT-4在信息结构和可接受性任务上表现出可靠的元语言能力，并复制了人类研究中两者之间的显著交互作用。

Conclusion: GPT-4与自然英语之间存在紧密关系，信息结构与句法之间的关联值得进一步探索。

Abstract: It remains debated how well any LM understands natural language or generates
reliable metalinguistic judgments. Moreover, relatively little work has
demonstrated that LMs can represent and respect subtle relationships between
form and function proposed by linguists. We here focus on a particular such
relationship established in recent work: English speakers' judgments about the
information structure of canonical sentences predicts independently collected
acceptability ratings on corresponding 'long distance dependency' [LDD]
constructions, across a wide array of base constructions and multiple types of
LDDs. To determine whether any LM captures this relationship, we probe GPT-4 on
the same tasks used with humans and new extensions.Results reveal reliable
metalinguistic skill on the information structure and acceptability tasks,
replicating a striking interaction between the two, despite the zero-shot,
explicit nature of the tasks, and little to no chance of contamination [Studies
1a, 1b]. Study 2 manipulates the information structure of base sentences and
confirms a causal relationship: increasing the prominence of a constituent in a
context sentence increases the subsequent acceptability ratings on an LDD
construction. The findings suggest a tight relationship between natural and
GPT-4 generated English, and between information structure and syntax, which
begs for further exploration.

Motivation: 解决LLMs生成事实性错误的问题，避免依赖外部模型或知识库。

Method: 提出ACPO方法，利用多个随机响应中的原子一致性信号识别高质量数据对。

Result: ACPO在LongFact和BioGen数据集上比FactAlign基线高出1.95分。

Conclusion: ACPO是一种高效、可扩展的方法，显著提升了事实可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce factoid hallucinations -
plausible yet incorrect answers. A common mitigation strategy is model
alignment, which improves factual accuracy by training on curated factual and
non-factual pairs. However, this approach often relies on a stronger model
(e.g., GPT-4) or an external knowledge base to assess factual correctness,
which may not always be accessible. To address this, we propose Atomic
Consistency Preference Optimization (ACPO), a self-supervised preference-tuning
method that enhances factual accuracy without external supervision. ACPO
leverages atomic consistency signals, i.e., the agreement of individual facts
across multiple stochastic responses, to identify high- and low-quality data
pairs for model alignment. By eliminating the need for costly GPT calls, ACPO
provides a scalable and efficient approach to improving factoid
question-answering. Despite being self-supervised, empirical results
demonstrate that ACPO outperforms FactAlign, a strong supervised alignment
baseline, by 1.95 points on the LongFact and BioGen datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing factual reliability without relying on external
models or knowledge bases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a major step toward artificial general
intelligence, significantly advancing our ability to interact with technology.
While LLMs perform well on Natural Language Processing tasks -- such as
translation, generation, code writing, and summarization -- questions remain
about their output similarity, variability, and ethical implications. For
instance, how similar are texts generated by the same model? How does this
compare across different models? And which models best uphold ethical
standards? To investigate, we used 5{,}000 prompts spanning diverse tasks like
generation, explanation, and rewriting. This resulted in approximately 3
million texts from 12 LLMs, including proprietary and open-source systems from
OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Mistral. Key findings include: (1) outputs
from the same LLM are more similar to each other than to human-written texts;
(2) models like WizardLM-2-8x22b generate highly similar outputs, while GPT-4
produces more varied responses; (3) LLM writing styles differ significantly,
with Llama 3 and Mistral showing higher similarity, and GPT-4 standing out for
distinctiveness; (4) differences in vocabulary and tone underscore the
linguistic uniqueness of LLM-generated content; (5) some LLMs demonstrate
greater gender balance and reduced bias. These results offer new insights into
the behavior and diversity of LLM outputs, helping guide future development and
ethical evaluation.

Abstract: This paper introduces S-DAT (Synthetic-Divergent Association Task), a
scalable, multilingual framework for automated assessment of divergent thinking
(DT) -a core component of human creativity. Traditional creativity assessments
are often labor-intensive, language-specific, and reliant on subjective human
ratings, limiting their scalability and cross-cultural applicability. In
contrast, S-DAT leverages large language models and advanced multilingual
embeddings to compute semantic distance -- a language-agnostic proxy for DT. We
evaluate S-DAT across eleven diverse languages, including English, Spanish,
German, Russian, Hindi, and Japanese (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana), demonstrating
robust and consistent scoring across linguistic contexts. Unlike prior DAT
approaches, the S-DAT shows convergent validity with other DT measures and
correct discriminant validity with convergent thinking. This cross-linguistic
flexibility allows for more inclusive, global-scale creativity research,
addressing key limitations of earlier approaches. S-DAT provides a powerful
tool for fairer, more comprehensive evaluation of cognitive flexibility in
diverse populations and can be freely assessed online:

Abstract: Effectively analyzing online review data is essential across industries.
However, many existing studies are limited to specific domains and languages or
depend on supervised learning approaches that require large-scale labeled
datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a multilingual, scalable,
and unsupervised framework for cross-domain aspect detection. This framework is
designed for multi-aspect labeling of multilingual and multi-domain review
data. In this study, we apply automatic labeling to Korean and English review
datasets spanning various domains and assess the quality of the generated
labels through extensive experiments. Aspect category candidates are first
extracted through clustering, and each review is then represented as an
aspect-aware embedding vector using negative sampling. To evaluate the
framework, we conduct multi-aspect labeling and fine-tune several pretrained
language models to measure the effectiveness of the automatically generated
labels. Results show that these models achieve high performance, demonstrating
that the labels are suitable for training. Furthermore, comparisons with
publicly available large language models highlight the framework's superior
consistency and scalability when processing large-scale data. A human
evaluation also confirms that the quality of the automatic labels is comparable
to those created manually. This study demonstrates the potential of a robust
multi-aspect labeling approach that overcomes limitations of supervised methods
and is adaptable to multilingual, multi-domain environments. Future research
will explore automatic review summarization and the integration of artificial
intelligence agents to further improve the efficiency and depth of review
analysis.

TLDR: InForage是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过动态信息检索增强LLM的能力，优于传统静态检索方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统静态检索方法在复杂任务中的不足，利用动态检索适应模糊、多步或变化的信息需求。

Method: 基于信息觅食理论（IFT），设计强化学习框架InForage，通过奖励中间检索质量实现动态检索。

Result: 在通用问答、多跳推理和实时网络问答任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: InForage能构建高效、自适应且鲁棒的推理代理。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval has become a
standard method to address their inherent knowledge cutoff limitations.
However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods employ static,
pre-inference retrieval strategies, making them inadequate for complex tasks
involving ambiguous, multi-step, or evolving information needs. Recent advances
in test-time scaling techniques have demonstrated significant potential in
enabling LLMs to dynamically interact with external tools, motivating the shift
toward adaptive inference-time retrieval. Inspired by Information Foraging
Theory (IFT), we propose InForage, a reinforcement learning framework that
formalizes retrieval-augmented reasoning as a dynamic information-seeking
process. Unlike existing approaches, InForage explicitly rewards intermediate
retrieval quality, encouraging LLMs to iteratively gather and integrate
information through adaptive search behaviors. To facilitate training, we
construct a human-guided dataset capturing iterative search and reasoning
trajectories for complex, real-world web tasks. Extensive evaluations across
general question answering, multi-hop reasoning tasks, and a newly developed
real-time web QA dataset demonstrate InForage's superior performance over
baseline methods. These results highlight InForage's effectiveness in building
robust, adaptive, and efficient reasoning agents.

TLDR: 研究发现语言模型存在一种新现象——上下文牵引，即模型会受输入提示中无关信息干扰，表现为对之前出现过的词赋予更高概率。研究发现语义因素会影响牵引强度，并通过一种新方法识别了相关注意力头（牵引头），关闭这些头可显著减弱牵引效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型如何受输入提示中无关信息干扰，揭示其机制并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过统计分析和可微分掩码方法识别牵引头，并实验验证关闭这些头的效果。

Result: 发现上下文牵引是一种机制性现象，语义因素会调节其强度；关闭牵引头可显著减弱牵引效应。

Conclusion: 上下文牵引现象的发现为语言模型分心问题的机制分析和缓解提供了关键进展。

Abstract: We observe a novel phenomenon, contextual entrainment, across a wide range of
language models (LMs) and prompt settings, providing a new mechanistic
perspective on how LMs become distracted by ``irrelevant'' contextual
information in the input prompt. Specifically, LMs assign significantly higher
logits (or probabilities) to any tokens that have previously appeared in the
context prompt, even for random tokens. This suggests that contextual
entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the
relevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the
sentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of
contextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual
prompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while
contextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic
factors.
  We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads -- the entrainment
heads -- that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon. Using a
novel entrainment head discovery method based on differentiable masking, we
identify these heads across various settings. When we ``turn off'' these heads,
i.e., set their outputs to zero, the effect of contextual entrainment is
significantly attenuated, causing the model to generate output that capitulates
to what it would produce if no distracting context were provided. Our discovery
of contextual entrainment, along with our investigation into LM distraction via
the entrainment heads, marks a key step towards the mechanistic analysis and
mitigation of the distraction problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升语言模型的性能、效率和多语言能力，同时减少计算资源需求。

Method: 采用密集和MoE架构，引入思维模式与非思维模式的统一框架，动态切换和计算资源分配机制。

Result: 在代码生成、数学推理等任务中达到SOTA，支持119种语言，计算资源需求显著降低。

Conclusion: Qwen3通过创新设计和资源优化，在多语言和任务性能上取得突破，开源以促进社区研究。

Abstract: In this work, we present Qwen3, the latest version of the Qwen model family.
Qwen3 comprises a series of large language models (LLMs) designed to advance
performance, efficiency, and multilingual capabilities. The Qwen3 series
includes models of both dense and Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architectures, with
parameter scales ranging from 0.6 to 235 billion. A key innovation in Qwen3 is
the integration of thinking mode (for complex, multi-step reasoning) and
non-thinking mode (for rapid, context-driven responses) into a unified
framework. This eliminates the need to switch between different models--such as
chat-optimized models (e.g., GPT-4o) and dedicated reasoning models (e.g.,
QwQ-32B)--and enables dynamic mode switching based on user queries or chat
templates. Meanwhile, Qwen3 introduces a thinking budget mechanism, allowing
users to allocate computational resources adaptively during inference, thereby
balancing latency and performance based on task complexity. Moreover, by
leveraging the knowledge from the flagship models, we significantly reduce the
computational resources required to build smaller-scale models, while ensuring
their highly competitive performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
Qwen3 achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks, including
tasks in code generation, mathematical reasoning, agent tasks, etc.,
competitive against larger MoE models and proprietary models. Compared to its
predecessor Qwen2.5, Qwen3 expands multilingual support from 29 to 119
languages and dialects, enhancing global accessibility through improved
cross-lingual understanding and generation capabilities. To facilitate
reproducibility and community-driven research and development, all Qwen3 models
are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

Conclusion: QEDACVC展示了量子计算在多语言翻译中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cloud-based multilingual translation services like Google Translate and
Microsoft Translator achieve state-of-the-art translation capabilities. These
services inherently use large multilingual language models such as GRU, LSTM,
BERT, GPT, T5, or similar encoder-decoder architectures with attention
mechanisms as the backbone. Also, new age natural language systems, for
instance ChatGPT and DeepSeek, have established huge potential in multiple
tasks in natural language processing. At the same time, they also possess
outstanding multilingual translation capabilities. However, these models use
the classical computing realm as a backend. QEDACVC (Quantum Encoder Decoder
Attention-based Convolutional Variational Circuits) is an alternate solution
that explores the quantum computing realm instead of the classical computing
realm to study and demonstrate multilingual machine translation. QEDACVC
introduces the quantum encoder-decoder architecture that simulates and runs on
quantum computing hardware via quantum convolution, quantum pooling, quantum
variational circuit, and quantum attention as software alterations. QEDACVC
achieves an Accuracy of 82% when trained on the OPUS dataset for English,
French, German, and Hindi corpora for multilingual translations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法存在矛盾现象，如路由器集成提升训练效率但性能不普适，矩阵分解在特定领域有效。基于PT的模块化特性，提出PT-MoE。

Method: PT-MoE整合矩阵分解与MoE路由，实现高效参数共享和动态适应。

Result: 在17个数据集上，PT-MoE在QA和数学任务中性能最优，参数比LoRA少25%。

Conclusion: PT-MoE展示了互补优势，为未来PEFT方法提供新思路。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have shown promise in adapting
large language models, yet existing approaches exhibit counter-intuitive
phenomena: integrating router into prompt tuning (PT) increases training
efficiency yet does not improve performance universally; parameter reduction
through matrix decomposition can improve performance in specific domains.
Motivated by these observations and the modular nature of PT, we propose
PT-MoE, a novel framework that integrates matrix decomposition with
mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing for efficient PT. Results across 17 datasets
demonstrate that PT-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both question
answering (QA) and mathematical problem solving tasks, improving F1 score by
1.49 points over PT and 2.13 points over LoRA in QA tasks, while enhancing
mathematical accuracy by 10.75 points over PT and 0.44 points over LoRA, all
while using 25% fewer parameters than LoRA. Our analysis reveals that while PT
methods generally excel in QA tasks and LoRA-based methods in math datasets,
the integration of matrix decomposition and MoE in PT-MoE yields complementary
benefits: decomposition enables efficient parameter sharing across experts
while MoE provides dynamic adaptation, collectively enabling PT-MoE to
demonstrate cross-task consistency and generalization abilities. These
findings, along with ablation studies on routing mechanisms and architectural
components, provide insights for future PEFT methods.

TLDR: 论文提出WorldView-Bench基准，评估大语言模型（LLMs）的全球文化包容性（GCI），通过多视角干预策略显著提升文化多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs训练和评估框架偏向西方中心主义，导致文化同质化，无法反映全球文明多样性。

Method: 基于Multiplex Worldview理论，设计WorldView-Bench，采用自由生成评估和两种干预策略（上下文嵌入和多智能体系统）。

Result: 多智能体系统干预使视角分布熵从13%提升至94%，情感倾向转为67.7%正面，文化平衡性增强。

Conclusion: 多视角评估方法能有效减少LLMs的文化偏见，推动更具包容性和伦理对齐的AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly trained and aligned in ways
that reinforce Western-centric epistemologies and socio-cultural norms, leading
to cultural homogenization and limiting their ability to reflect global
civilizational plurality. Existing benchmarking frameworks fail to adequately
capture this bias, as they rely on rigid, closed-form assessments that overlook
the complexity of cultural inclusivity. To address this, we introduce
WorldView-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Global Cultural Inclusivity
(GCI) in LLMs by analyzing their ability to accommodate diverse worldviews. Our
approach is grounded in the Multiplex Worldview proposed by Senturk et al.,
which distinguishes between Uniplex models, reinforcing cultural
homogenization, and Multiplex models, which integrate diverse perspectives.
WorldView-Bench measures Cultural Polarization, the exclusion of alternative
perspectives, through free-form generative evaluation rather than conventional
categorical benchmarks. We implement applied multiplexity through two
intervention strategies: (1) Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where
system prompts embed multiplexity principles, and (2) Multi-Agent System
(MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where multiple LLM agents representing
distinct cultural perspectives collaboratively generate responses. Our results
demonstrate a significant increase in Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS)
entropy from 13% at baseline to 94% with MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs,
alongside a shift toward positive sentiment (67.7%) and enhanced cultural
balance. These findings highlight the potential of multiplex-aware AI
evaluation in mitigating cultural bias in LLMs, paving the way for more
inclusive and ethically aligned AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号交叉口的复杂决策过程使得自动驾驶车辆控制具有挑战性，研究旨在通过DRL优化车辆控制策略。

Method: 设计了综合奖励函数，结合DDPG和SAC算法，利用真实和模拟轨迹数据进行训练和测试。

Result: RL模型在保持较低车距和抖动的同时，优于人类驾驶车辆，且在安全关键场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: DRL策略能有效提升信号交叉口的交通效率、安全性和舒适性。

Abstract: Developing an autonomous vehicle control strategy for signalised
intersections (SI) is one of the challenging tasks due to its inherently
complex decision-making process. This study proposes a Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) based longitudinal vehicle control strategy at SI. A
comprehensive reward function has been formulated with a particular focus on
(i) distance headway-based efficiency reward, (ii) decision-making criteria
during amber light, and (iii) asymmetric acceleration/ deceleration response,
along with the traditional safety and comfort criteria. This reward function
has been incorporated with two popular DRL algorithms, Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft-Actor Critic (SAC), which can handle the
continuous action space of acceleration/deceleration. The proposed models have
been trained on the combination of real-world leader vehicle (LV) trajectories
and simulated trajectories generated using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process.
The overall performance of the proposed models has been tested using Cumulative
Distribution Function (CDF) plots and compared with the real-world trajectory
data. The results show that the RL models successfully maintain lower distance
headway (i.e., higher efficiency) and jerk compared to human-driven vehicles
without compromising safety. Further, to assess the robustness of the proposed
models, we evaluated the model performance on diverse safety-critical
scenarios, in terms of car-following and traffic signal compliance. Both DDPG
and SAC models successfully handled the critical scenarios, while the DDPG
model showed smoother action profiles compared to the SAC model. Overall, the
results confirm that DRL-based longitudinal vehicle control strategy at SI can
help to improve traffic safety, efficiency, and comfort.

Result: 合成数据评估与人工评估相关性高（Spearman 0.96，Pearson 0.79），Gemma3模型表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可靠，为语言模型评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) continue to advance, improving response quality and
coherence. Given Internet-scale training datasets, LMs have likely encountered
much of what users might ask them to generate in some form during their
training. A plethora of evaluation benchmarks have been constructed to assess
model quality, response appropriateness, and reasoning capabilities. However,
the human effort required for benchmark construction is limited and being
rapidly outpaced by the size and scope of the models under evaluation.
Additionally, having humans build a benchmark for every possible domain of
interest is impractical. Therefore, we propose a methodology for automating the
construction of fact-based synthetic data model evaluations grounded in
document populations. This work leverages those very same LMs to evaluate
domain-specific knowledge automatically, using only grounding documents (e.g.,
a textbook) as input. This synthetic data benchmarking approach corresponds
well with human curated questions with a Spearman ranking correlation of 0.96
and a benchmark evaluation Pearson accuracy correlation of 0.79. This novel
tool supports generating both multiple choice and open-ended synthetic data
questions to gain diagnostic insight of LM capability. We apply this
methodology to evaluate model performance on a recent relevant arXiv preprint,
discovering a surprisingly strong performance from Gemma3 models.

Result: 研究表明，该方法能在理论不可解环境中实现接近最优策略，但存在过度泛化问题。

Conclusion: 通过奖励不确定性优化策略，为Mon-MDP理论与实际应用的结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) typically models the interaction between the
agent and environment as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the rewards
that guide the agent's behavior are always observable. However, in many
real-world scenarios, rewards are not always observable, which can be modeled
as a monitored Markov decision process (Mon-MDP). Prior work on Mon-MDPs have
been limited to simple, tabular cases, restricting their applicability to
real-world problems. This work explores Mon-MDPs using function approximation
(FA) and investigates the challenges involved. We show that combining function
approximation with a learned reward model enables agents to generalize from
monitored states with observable rewards, to unmonitored environment states
with unobservable rewards. Therefore, we demonstrate that such generalization
with a reward model achieves near-optimal policies in environments formally
defined as unsolvable. However, we identify a critical limitation of such
function approximation, where agents incorrectly extrapolate rewards due to
overgeneralization, resulting in undesirable behaviors. To mitigate
overgeneralization, we propose a cautious police optimization method leveraging
reward uncertainty. This work serves as a step towards bridging this gap
between Mon-MDP theory and real-world applications.

Abstract: This work presents a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
framework for analyzing simulated air combat scenarios involving heterogeneous
agents. The objective is to identify effective Courses of Action that lead to
mission success within preset simulations, thereby enabling the exploration of
real-world defense scenarios at low cost and in a safe-to-fail setting.
Applying deep Reinforcement Learning in this context poses specific challenges,
such as complex flight dynamics, the exponential size of the state and action
spaces in multi-agent systems, and the capability to integrate real-time
control of individual units with look-ahead planning. To address these
challenges, the decision-making process is split into two levels of
abstraction: low-level policies control individual units, while a high-level
commander policy issues macro commands aligned with the overall mission
targets. This hierarchical structure facilitates the training process by
exploiting policy symmetries of individual agents and by separating control
from command tasks. The low-level policies are trained for individual combat
control in a curriculum of increasing complexity. The high-level commander is
then trained on mission targets given pre-trained control policies. The
empirical validation confirms the advantages of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Cascading failures in power grids can lead to grid collapse, causing severe
disruptions to social operations and economic activities. In certain cases,
multi-stage cascading failures can occur. However, existing
cascading-failure-mitigation strategies are usually single-stage-based,
overlooking the complexity of the multi-stage scenario. This paper treats the
multi-stage cascading failure problem as a reinforcement learning task and
develops a simulation environment. The reinforcement learning agent is then
trained via the deterministic policy gradient algorithm to achieve continuous
actions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on
the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems.

Abstract: We introduce a method of meta-prompting that jointly produces fluent text for
complex tasks while optimizing the similarity of neural states between a
human's mental expectation and a Large Language Model's (LLM) neural
processing. A technique of agentic reinforcement learning is applied, in which
an LLM as a Judge (LLMaaJ) teaches another LLM, through in-context learning,
how to produce content by interpreting the intended and unintended generated
text traits. To measure human mental beliefs around content production, users
modify long form AI-generated text articles before publication at the US Open
2024 tennis Grand Slam. Now, an LLMaaJ can solve the Theory of Mind (ToM)
alignment problem by anticipating and including human edits within the creation
of text from an LLM. Throughout experimentation and by interpreting the results
of a live production system, the expectations of human content reviewers had
100% of alignment with AI 53.8% of the time with an average iteration count of
4.38. The geometric interpretation of content traits such as factualness,
novelty, repetitiveness, and relevancy over a Hilbert vector space combines
spatial volume (all trait importance) with vertices alignment (individual trait
relevance) enabled the LLMaaJ to optimize on Human ToM. This resulted in an
increase in content quality by extending the coverage of tennis action. Our
work that was deployed at the US Open 2024 has been used across other live
events within sports and entertainment.

Result: 在多个连续控制任务中，MCBS表现优于TD3、SAC、PPO和A2C，收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: MCBS通过结构化前瞻搜索提升策略学习，同时保持计算效率，适用于复杂控制任务。

Abstract: Actor-critic methods, like Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(TD3), depend on basic noise-based exploration, which can result in less than
optimal policy convergence. In this study, we introduce Monte Carlo Beam Search
(MCBS), a new hybrid method that combines beam search and Monte Carlo rollouts
with TD3 to improve exploration and action selection. MCBS produces several
candidate actions around the policy's output and assesses them through
short-horizon rollouts, enabling the agent to make better-informed choices. We
test MCBS across various continuous-control benchmarks, including
HalfCheetah-v4, Walker2d-v5, and Swimmer-v5, showing enhanced sample efficiency
and performance compared to standard TD3 and other baseline methods like SAC,
PPO, and A2C. Our findings emphasize MCBS's capability to enhance policy
learning through structured look-ahead search while ensuring computational
efficiency. Additionally, we offer a detailed analysis of crucial
hyperparameters, such as beam width and rollout depth, and explore adaptive
strategies to optimize MCBS for complex control tasks. Our method shows a
higher convergence rate across different environments compared to TD3, SAC,
PPO, and A2C. For instance, we achieved 90% of the maximum achievable reward
within around 200 thousand timesteps compared to 400 thousand timesteps for the

Abstract: Hallucination, where large language models (LLMs) generate confident but
incorrect or irrelevant information, remains a key limitation in their
application to complex, open-ended tasks. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has
emerged as a promising method for improving multistep reasoning by guiding
models through intermediate steps. However, CoT alone does not fully address
the hallucination problem. In this work, we investigate how combining CoT with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), as well as applying self-consistency and
self-verification strategies, can reduce hallucinations and improve factual
accuracy. By incorporating external knowledge sources during reasoning and

TLDR: CRDT通过反事实推理增强决策变换器（DT），在不修改架构的情况下提升决策能力和泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，离线数据集质量不足和最优行为稀缺限制了DT的性能，需要一种方法来利用次优数据提升决策能力。

Method: 提出反事实推理决策变换器（CRDT），通过生成和利用反事实经验增强DT的推理能力。

Result: 在Atari和D4RL基准测试中，CRDT在数据有限和动态变化场景下优于传统DT，并具备轨迹拼接能力。

Conclusion: 反事实推理能显著提升强化学习代理的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Decision Transformers (DT) play a crucial role in modern reinforcement
learning, leveraging offline datasets to achieve impressive results across
various domains. However, DT requires high-quality, comprehensive data to
perform optimally. In real-world applications, the lack of training data and
the scarcity of optimal behaviours make training on offline datasets
challenging, as suboptimal data can hinder performance. To address this, we
propose the Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer (CRDT), a novel
framework inspired by counterfactual reasoning. CRDT enhances DT ability to
reason beyond known data by generating and utilizing counterfactual
experiences, enabling improved decision-making in unseen scenarios. Experiments
across Atari and D4RL benchmarks, including scenarios with limited data and
altered dynamics, demonstrate that CRDT outperforms conventional DT approaches.
Additionally, reasoning counterfactually allows the DT agent to obtain
stitching abilities, combining suboptimal trajectories, without architectural
modifications. These results highlight the potential of counterfactual
reasoning to enhance reinforcement learning agents' performance and
generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 验证和扩展GovSim框架，以评估LLM在资源分配任务中的合作能力，并探索其在不同模型、场景和语言中的适用性。

Method: 通过复制关键实验并引入新模型（如DeepSeek-V3和GPT-4o-mini）和新场景（如异构多智能体环境、日语指令场景和逆向环境）来测试框架的扩展性。

Conclusion: GovSim框架具有广泛适用性，为开发更高效的协作AI系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This study evaluates and extends the findings made by Piatti et al., who
introduced GovSim, a simulation framework designed to assess the cooperative
decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
resource-sharing scenarios. By replicating key experiments, we validate claims
regarding the performance of large models, such as GPT-4-turbo, compared to
smaller models. The impact of the universalization principle is also examined,
with results showing that large models can achieve sustainable cooperation,
with or without the principle, while smaller models fail without it. In
addition, we provide multiple extensions to explore the applicability of the
framework to new settings. We evaluate additional models, such as DeepSeek-V3
and GPT-4o-mini, to test whether cooperative behavior generalizes across
different architectures and model sizes. Furthermore, we introduce new
settings: we create a heterogeneous multi-agent environment, study a scenario
using Japanese instructions, and explore an "inverse environment" where agents
must cooperate to mitigate harmful resource distributions. Our results confirm
that the benchmark can be applied to new models, scenarios, and languages,
offering valuable insights into the adaptability of LLMs in complex cooperative
tasks. Moreover, the experiment involving heterogeneous multi-agent systems
demonstrates that high-performing models can influence lower-performing ones to
adopt similar behaviors. This finding has significant implications for other
agent-based applications, potentially enabling more efficient use of
computational resources and contributing to the development of more effective
cooperative AI systems.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于用户凭证和风险分类的访问控制框架，以解决AI安全系统的双重用途困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI安全系统面临双重用途困境，即同一请求可能无害或有害，取决于请求者和目的。仅基于内容决策会导致误判。

Method: 提出基于用户凭证和风险分类的访问控制框架，结合小规模专家模块和梯度路由训练，实现高效风险检测。

Result: 框架初步实现了对AI能力的细粒度治理，合法用户可获取专业知识，而恶意用户被阻止。

Conclusion: 该上下文方法平衡了模型效用与安全性，解决了双重用途困境，但仍需进一步研究验证机制和技术实现。

Abstract: AI safety systems face a dual-use dilemma. Since the same request can be
either harmless or harmful depending on who made it and why, if the system
makes decisions based solely on the request's content, it will refuse some
legitimate queries and let pass harmful ones. To address this, we propose a
conceptual access control framework, based on verified user credentials (such
as institutional affiliation) and classifiers that assign model outputs to risk
categories (such as advanced virology). The system permits responses only when
the user's verified credentials match the category's requirements. For
implementation of the model output classifiers, we introduce a theoretical
approach utilizing small, gated expert modules integrated into the generator
model, trained with gradient routing, that enable efficient risk detection
without the capability gap problems of external monitors. While open questions
remain about the verification mechanisms, risk categories, and the technical
implementation, our framework makes the first step toward enabling granular
governance of AI capabilities: verified users gain access to specialized
knowledge without arbitrary restrictions, while adversaries are blocked from
it. This contextual approach reconciles model utility with robust safety,
addressing the dual-use dilemma.

Conclusion: LLM代理在模拟人类策略推理方面有潜力，但需进一步优化设计，单纯架构增强效果有限。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has shifted artificial
intelligence (AI) research toward agentic systems, motivating the use of weaker
and more flexible notions of agency. However, this shift raises key questions
about the extent to which LLM-based agents replicate human strategic reasoning,
particularly in game-theoretic settings. In this context, we examine the role
of agentic sophistication in shaping artificial reasoners' performance by
evaluating three agent designs: a simple game-theoretic model, an unstructured
LLM-as-agent model, and an LLM integrated into a traditional agentic framework.
Using guessing games as a testbed, we benchmarked these agents against human
participants across general reasoning patterns and individual role-based
objectives. Furthermore, we introduced obfuscated game scenarios to assess
agents' ability to generalise beyond training distributions. Our analysis,
covering over 2000 reasoning samples across 25 agent configurations, shows that
human-inspired cognitive structures can enhance LLM agents' alignment with
human strategic behaviour. Still, the relationship between agentic design
complexity and human-likeness is non-linear, highlighting a critical dependence
on underlying LLM capabilities and suggesting limits to simple architectural
augmentation.

Conclusion: 该方法为序列决策任务提供了有效的反事实策略生成工具。

Abstract: Counterfactuals are widely used in AI to explain how minimal changes to a
model's input can lead to a different output. However, established methods for
computing counterfactuals typically focus on one-step decision-making, and are
not directly applicable to sequential decision-making tasks. This paper fills
this gap by introducing counterfactual strategies for Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). During MDP execution, a strategy decides which of the enabled actions
(with known probabilistic effects) to execute next. Given an initial strategy
that reaches an undesired outcome with a probability above some limit, we
identify minimal changes to the initial strategy to reduce that probability
below the limit. We encode such counterfactual strategies as solutions to
non-linear optimization problems, and further extend our encoding to synthesize
diverse counterfactual strategies. We evaluate our approach on four real-world
datasets and demonstrate its practical viability in sophisticated sequential
decision-making tasks.

Motivation: POMDP的最优策略在环境扰动下可能不鲁棒，HM-POMDP通过捕捉一组潜在环境模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 结合形式化验证（计算最坏情况POMDP）和次梯度上升（优化策略），生成鲁棒策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的策略更鲁棒且泛化性更强，可扩展到包含数十万环境的HM-POMDP。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了HM-POMDP的鲁棒策略生成问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) model specific
environments in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Critically,
optimal policies for POMDPs may not be robust against perturbations in the
environment. Hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs) capture sets of different
environment models, that is, POMDPs with a shared action and observation space.
The intuition is that the true model is hidden among a set of potential models,
and it is unknown which model will be the environment at execution time. A
policy is robust for a given HM-POMDP if it achieves sufficient performance for
each of its POMDPs. We compute such robust policies by combining two orthogonal
techniques: (1) a deductive formal verification technique that supports
tractable robust policy evaluation by computing a worst-case POMDP within the
HM-POMDP and (2) subgradient ascent to optimize the candidate policy for a
worst-case POMDP. The empirical evaluation shows that, compared to various
baselines, our approach (1) produces policies that are more robust and
generalize better to unseen POMDPs and (2) scales to HM-POMDPs that consist of
over a hundred thousand environments.

Result: LM在析取关系中表现良好，但在合取关系中存在偏见，且与人类成人相似。

Conclusion: 提出一种采样方法显著减少偏见，推动LM实现更科学的因果推理。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents are increasingly used as autonomous
decision-makers who need to actively gather information to guide their
decisions. A crucial cognitive skill for such agents is the efficient
exploration and understanding of the causal structure of the world -- key to
robust, scientifically grounded reasoning. Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs
possess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous
conclusions. In this work, we examine LMs' ability to explore and infer causal
relationships, using the well-established "Blicket Test" paradigm from
developmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive
disjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual,
yet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones. This
"disjunctive bias" persists across model families, sizes, and prompting
strategies, and performance further declines as task complexity increases.
Interestingly, an analogous bias appears in human adults, suggesting that LMs
may have inherited deep-seated reasoning heuristics from their training data.
To this end, we quantify similarities between LMs and humans, finding that LMs
exhibit adult-like inference profiles (but not children-like). Finally, we
propose a test-time sampling method which explicitly samples and eliminates
hypotheses about causal relationships from the LM. This scalable approach
significantly reduces the disjunctive bias and moves LMs closer to the goal of
scientific, causally rigorous reasoning.

Abstract: Driver fatigue poses a significant challenge to railway safety, with
traditional systems like the dead-man switch offering limited and basic
alertness checks. This study presents an online behavior-based monitoring
system utilizing a customised Directed-Graph Neural Network (DGNN) to classify
train driver's states into three categories: alert, not alert, and
pathological. To optimize input representations for the model, an ablation
study was performed, comparing three feature configurations: skeletal-only,
facial-only, and a combination of both. Experimental results show that
combining facial and skeletal features yields the highest accuracy (80.88%) in
the three-class model, outperforming models using only facial or skeletal
features. Furthermore, this combination achieves over 99% accuracy in the
binary alertness classification. Additionally, we introduced a novel dataset
that, for the first time, incorporates simulated pathological conditions into
train driver monitoring, broadening the scope for assessing risks related to
fatigue and health. This work represents a step forward in enhancing railway
safety through advanced online monitoring using vision-based technologies.

Abstract: Gait recognition, known for its ability to identify individuals from a
distance, has gained significant attention in recent times due to its
non-intrusive verification. While video-based gait identification systems
perform well on large public datasets, their performance drops when applied to
real-world, unconstrained gait data due to various factors. Among these,
uncontrolled outdoor environments, non-overlapping camera views, varying
illumination, and computational efficiency are core challenges in gait-based
authentication. Currently, no dataset addresses all these challenges
simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an OptiGait-LGBM model capable of
recognizing person re-identification under these constraints using a skeletal
model approach, which helps mitigate inconsistencies in a person's appearance.
The model constructs a dataset from landmark positions, minimizing memory usage
by using non-sequential data. A benchmark dataset, RUET-GAIT, is introduced to
represent uncontrolled gait sequences in complex outdoor environments. The
process involves extracting skeletal joint landmarks, generating numerical
datasets, and developing an OptiGait-LGBM gait classification model. Our aim is
to address the aforementioned challenges with minimal computational cost
compared to existing methods. A comparative analysis with ensemble techniques
such as Random Forest and CatBoost demonstrates that the proposed approach
outperforms them in terms of accuracy, memory usage, and training time. This
method provides a novel, low-cost, and memory-efficient video-based gait
recognition solution for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in high-definition \emph{HD} map construction have
demonstrated the effectiveness of dense representations, which heavily rely on
computationally intensive bird's-eye view \emph{BEV} features. While sparse
representations offer a more efficient alternative by avoiding dense BEV
processing, existing methods often lag behind due to the lack of tailored
designs. These limitations have hindered the competitiveness of sparse
representations in online HD map construction. In this work, we systematically
revisit and enhance sparse representation techniques, identifying key
architectural and algorithmic improvements that bridge the gap with--and
ultimately surpass--dense approaches. We introduce a dedicated network
architecture optimized for sparse map feature extraction, a sparse-dense
segmentation auxiliary task to better leverage geometric and semantic cues, and
a denoising module guided by physical priors to refine predictions. Through
these enhancements, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
nuScenes dataset, significantly advancing HD map construction and centerline
detection. Specifically, SparseMeXt-Tiny reaches a mean average precision
\emph{mAP} of 55.5% at 32 frames per second \emph{fps}, while SparseMeXt-Base
attains 65.2% mAP. Scaling the backbone and decoder further, SparseMeXt-Large
achieves an mAP of 68.9% at over 20 fps, establishing a new benchmark for
sparse representations in HD map construction. These results underscore the
untapped potential of sparse methods, challenging the conventional reliance on
dense representations and redefining efficiency-performance trade-offs in the
field.

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction is crucial for undewater robotic
perception and navigation. However, the task is significantly challenged by the
complex interplay between light propagation, water medium, and object surfaces,
with existing methods unable to model their interactions accurately.
Additionally, expensive training and rendering costs limit their practical
application in underwater robotic systems. Therefore, we propose Tensorized
Underwater Gaussian Splatting (TUGS), which can effectively solve the modeling
challenges of the complex interactions between object geometries and water
media while achieving significant parameter reduction. TUGS employs lightweight
tensorized higher-order Gaussians with a physics-based underwater Adaptive
Medium Estimation (AME) module, enabling accurate simulation of both light
attenuation and backscatter effects in underwater environments. Compared to
other NeRF-based and GS-based methods designed for underwater, TUGS is able to
render high-quality underwater images with faster rendering speeds and less
memory usage. Extensive experiments on real-world underwater datasets have
demonstrated that TUGS can efficiently achieve superior reconstruction quality
using a limited number of parameters, making it particularly suitable for

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a crucial role in the field of artificial
intelligence, and their security-related testing has been a prominent research
focus. By inputting test cases, the behavior of models is examined for
anomalies, and coverage metrics are utilized to determine the extent of neurons
covered by these test cases. With the widespread application and advancement of
DNNs, different types of neural behaviors have garnered attention, leading to
the emergence of various coverage metrics for neural networks. However, there
is currently a lack of empirical research on these coverage metrics,
specifically in analyzing the relationships and patterns between model depth,
configuration information, and neural network coverage. This paper aims to
investigate the relationships and patterns of four coverage metrics: primary
functionality, boundary, hierarchy, and structural coverage. A series of
empirical experiments were conducted, selecting LeNet, VGG, and ResNet as
different DNN architectures, along with 10 models of varying depths ranging
from 5 to 54 layers, to compare and study the relationships between different
depths, configuration information, and various neural network coverage metrics.
Additionally, an investigation was carried out on the relationships between
modified decision/condition coverage and dataset size. Finally, three potential

Motivation: 尽管SBM在图像合成方面表现卓越，但存在生成不安全内容的风险，现有方法多依赖模型自身知识或微调，本文探索利用外部资源确保安全输出。

Method: 通过Conditional Trajectory Correction步骤和多模态模型（如CLIP）引导样本远离不安全区域，支持用户自定义NSFW类别。

Result: 实验验证SFW采样器有效减少不安全内容生成，且对图像质量影响较小，未需修正的样本几乎不受影响。

Conclusion: SFW采样器适用于对齐的SBM模型，展示了模型无关条件在防止不良图像生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Score-based generative models (SBM), also known as diffusion models, are the
de facto state of the art for image synthesis. Despite their unparalleled
performance, SBMs have recently been in the spotlight for being tricked into
creating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as violent images and
non-consensual nudity. Current approaches that prevent unsafe generation are
based on the models' own knowledge, and the majority of them require
fine-tuning. This article explores the use of external sources for ensuring
safe outputs in SBMs. Our safe-for-work (SFW) sampler implements a Conditional
Trajectory Correction step that guides the samples away from undesired regions
in the ambient space using multimodal models as the source of conditioning.
Furthermore, using Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP), our method
admits user-defined NSFW classes, which can vary in different settings. Our
experiments on the text-to-image SBM Stable Diffusion validate that the
proposed SFW sampler effectively reduces the generation of explicit content
while being competitive with other fine-tuning-based approaches, as assessed
via independent NSFW detectors. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of the SFW
sampler on image quality and show that the proposed correction scheme comes at
a minor cost with negligible effect on samples not needing correction. Our
study confirms the suitability of the SFW sampler towards aligned SBM models
and the potential of using model-agnostic conditioning for the prevention of
unwanted images.

Abstract: Generative AI offers new opportunities for automating urban planning by
creating site-specific urban layouts and enabling flexible design exploration.
However, existing approaches often struggle to produce realistic and practical
designs at scale. Therefore, we adapt a state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion
model, extended with ControlNet, to generate high-fidelity satellite imagery
conditioned on land use descriptions, infrastructure, and natural environments.
To overcome data availability limitations, we spatially link satellite imagery
with structured land use and constraint information from OpenStreetMap. Using
data from three major U.S. cities, we demonstrate that the proposed diffusion
model generates realistic and diverse urban landscapes by varying land-use
configurations, road networks, and water bodies, facilitating cross-city
learning and design diversity. We also systematically evaluate the impacts of
varying language prompts and control imagery on the quality of satellite
imagery generation. Our model achieves high FID and KID scores and demonstrates
robustness across diverse urban contexts. Qualitative assessments from urban
planners and the general public show that generated images align closely with
design descriptions and constraints, and are often preferred over real images.
This work establishes a benchmark for controlled urban imagery generation and
highlights the potential of generative AI as a tool for enhancing planning

Abstract: Our research is focused on two main applications of crowd scene analysis
crowd counting and anomaly detection In recent years a large number of
researches have been presented in the domain of crowd counting We addressed two
main challenges in this domain 1 Deep learning models are datahungry paradigms
and always need a large amount of annotated data for the training of algorithm
It is timeconsuming and costly task to annotate such large amount of data
Selfsupervised training is proposed to deal with this challenge 2 MCNN consists
of multicolumns of CNN with different sizes of filters by presenting a novel
approach based on a combination of selfsupervised training and MultiColumn CNN
This enables the model to learn features at different levels and makes it
effective in dealing with challenges of occluded scenes nonuniform density
complex backgrounds and scale invariation The proposed model was evaluated on
publicly available data sets such as ShanghaiTech and UCFQNRF by means of MAE
and MSE A spatiotemporal model based on VGG19 is proposed for crowd anomaly
detection addressing challenges like lighting environmental conditions
unexpected objects and scalability The model extracts spatial and temporal
features allowing it to be generalized to realworld scenes Spatial features are
learned using CNN while temporal features are learned using LSTM blocks The
model works on binary classification and can detect normal or abnormal behavior
The models performance is improved by replacing fully connected layers with
dense residual blocks Experiments on the Hockey Fight dataset and SCVD dataset
show our models outperform other stateoftheart approaches

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) constitutes a transformative
technological wave that reconfigures industries through its unparalleled
capabilities for content creation, reasoning, planning, and multimodal
understanding. This revolutionary force offers the most promising path yet
toward solving one of engineering's grandest challenges: achieving reliable,
fully autonomous driving, particularly the pursuit of Level 5 autonomy. This
survey delivers a comprehensive and critical synthesis of the emerging role of
GenAI across the autonomous driving stack. We begin by distilling the
principles and trade-offs of modern generative modeling, encompassing VAEs,
GANs, Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models (LLMs). We then map their
frontier applications in image, LiDAR, trajectory, occupancy, video generation
as well as LLM-guided reasoning and decision making. We categorize practical
applications, such as synthetic data workflows, end-to-end driving strategies,
high-fidelity digital twin systems, smart transportation networks, and
cross-domain transfer to embodied AI. We identify key obstacles and
possibilities such as comprehensive generalization across rare cases,
evaluation and safety checks, budget-limited implementation, regulatory
compliance, ethical concerns, and environmental effects, while proposing
research plans across theoretical assurances, trust metrics, transport
integration, and socio-technical influence. By unifying these threads, the
survey provides a forward-looking reference for researchers, engineers, and
policymakers navigating the convergence of generative AI and advanced
autonomous mobility. An actively maintained repository of cited works is

Abstract: This study aims to improve transportation safety, especially traffic safety.
Road damage anomalies such as potholes and cracks have emerged as a significant
and recurring cause for accidents. To tackle this problem and improve road
safety, a comprehensive system has been developed to detect potholes, cracks
(e.g. alligator, transverse, longitudinal), classify their sizes, and transmit
this data to the cloud for appropriate action by authorities. The system also
broadcasts warning signals to nearby vehicles warning them if a severe anomaly
is detected on the road. Moreover, the system can count road anomalies in
real-time. It is emulated through the utilization of Raspberry Pi, a camera
module, deep learning model, laptop, and cloud service. Deploying this
innovative solution aims to proactively enhance road safety by notifying
relevant authorities and drivers about the presence of potholes and cracks to
take actions, thereby mitigating potential accidents arising from this
prevalent road hazard leading to safer road conditions for the whole community.

Abstract: The rising incidence of skin cancer, coupled with limited public awareness
and a shortfall in clinical expertise, underscores an urgent need for advanced
diagnostic aids. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool
in this domain, particularly for distinguishing malignant from benign skin
lesions. Leveraging publicly available datasets of skin lesions, researchers

such computer systems in clinical settings is still nascent. This study aims to
bridge this gap by employing a fusion of image processing techniques and
machine learning algorithms, specifically neuro-fuzzy and colonial competition
approaches. Applied to dermoscopic images from the ISIC database, our method
achieved a notable accuracy of 94% on a dataset of 560 images. These results
underscore the potential of our approach in aiding clinicians in the early

TLDR: 提出了一种名为CoCo的扩张性去噪器，解决了Poisson逆问题中传统PnP方法的局限性，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PnP方法在Poisson逆问题中因假设条件不满足而失效，且非扩张性去噪器可能限制性能。

Method: 提出CoCo去噪器，结合Hamiltonian正则化和谱正则化训练策略，确保其保守性和共轭性。

Result: CoCo去噪器是弱凸函数的邻近算子，PnP方法全局收敛到恢复模型的稳定点，实验表现优于相关方法。

Conclusion: CoCo去噪器在视觉质量和定量指标上优于现有方法，为Poisson逆问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Plug-and-play (PnP) methods with deep denoisers have shown impressive results
in imaging problems. They typically require strong convexity or smoothness of
the fidelity term and a (residual) non-expansive denoiser for convergence.
These assumptions, however, are violated in Poisson inverse problems, and
non-expansiveness can hinder denoising performance. To address these
challenges, we propose a cocoercive conservative (CoCo) denoiser, which may be
(residual) expansive, leading to improved denoising. By leveraging the
generalized Helmholtz decomposition, we introduce a novel training strategy
that combines Hamiltonian regularization to promote conservativeness and
spectral regularization to ensure cocoerciveness. We prove that CoCo denoiser
is a proximal operator of a weakly convex function, enabling a restoration
model with an implicit weakly convex prior. The global convergence of PnP
methods to a stationary point of this restoration model is established.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
closely related methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于信息瓶颈（IB）原理，提出一种可微分通道选择方法，以优化特征提取并提升Re-ID任务的性能。

Method: 设计了DCS-Attention模块，支持固定或可学习的主干网络（DCS-FB和DCS-DNAS），并推导了IB损失的变分上界以优化训练。

Result: 在多个Re-ID基准测试中，DCS-Attention显著提升了模型预测精度，证明了其在学习判别性特征上的有效性。

Conclusion: DCS-Attention通过可微分通道选择和信息瓶颈优化，显著提升了Re-ID任务的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel attention module termed the Differentiable
Channel Selection Attention module, or the DCS-Attention module. In contrast
with conventional self-attention, the DCS-Attention module features selection
of informative channels in the computation of the attention weights. The
selection of the feature channels is performed in a differentiable manner,
enabling seamless integration with DNN training. Our DCS-Attention is
compatible with either fixed neural network backbones or learnable backbones
with Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS), leading to DCS with
Fixed Backbone (DCS-FB) and DCS-DNAS, respectively. Importantly, our
DCS-Attention is motivated by the principle of Information Bottleneck (IB), and
a novel variational upper bound for the IB loss, which can be optimized by SGD,
is derived and incorporated into the training loss of the networks with the
DCS-Attention modules. In this manner, a neural network with DCS-Attention
modules is capable of selecting the most informative channels for feature
extraction so that it enjoys state-of-the-art performance for the Re-ID task.
Extensive experiments on multiple person Re-ID benchmarks using both DCS-FB and
DCS-DNAS show that DCS-Attention significantly enhances the prediction accuracy
of DNNs for person Re-ID, which demonstrates the effectiveness of DCS-Attention
in learning discriminative features critical to identifying person identities.

*Yangyi Chen,Hao Peng,Tong Zhang,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: PRIOR是一种视觉语言预训练方法，通过差异加权优先处理与图像相关的标记，减少噪声拟合和幻觉风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准视觉语言模型预训练中，仅少数标记与视觉内容直接相关，朴素的下一个标记预测（NTP）会拟合噪声并增加幻觉风险。

Method: PRIOR引入基于重要性采样的差异加权方法，使用仅文本的参考LLM为每个标记分配权重，调整损失函数。

Result: 在多个视觉语言基准测试中，PRIOR比NTP分别提高了19%和8%的性能，并表现出更优的扩展性。

Conclusion: PRIOR通过优先处理视觉相关标记，显著提升了模型性能，并具有更强的扩展潜力。

Abstract: In standard large vision-language models (LVLMs) pre-training, the model
typically maximizes the joint probability of the caption conditioned on the
image via next-token prediction (NTP); however, since only a small subset of
caption tokens directly relates to the visual content, this naive NTP
unintentionally fits the model to noise and increases the risk of
hallucination. We present PRIOR, a simple vision-language pre-training approach
that addresses this issue by prioritizing image-related tokens through
differential weighting in the NTP loss, drawing from the importance sampling
framework. PRIOR introduces a reference model-a text-only large language model
(LLM) trained on the captions without image inputs, to weight each token based
on its probability for LVLMs training. Intuitively, tokens that are directly
related to the visual inputs are harder to predict without the image and thus
receive lower probabilities from the text-only reference LLM. During training,
we implement a token-specific re-weighting term based on the importance scores
to adjust each token's loss. We implement PRIOR in two distinct settings: LVLMs
with visual encoders and LVLMs without visual encoders. We observe 19% and 8%
average relative improvement, respectively, on several vision-language
benchmarks compared to NTP. In addition, PRIOR exhibits superior scaling
properties, as demonstrated by significantly higher scaling coefficients,
indicating greater potential for performance gains compared to NTP given
increasing compute and data.

Motivation: 深度学习模型的安全问题影响了视觉跟踪方法的可靠应用，需通过有效对抗攻击揭示其漏洞。

Method: 结合多模型集成和元学习策略，利用动量机制和高斯平滑，优化梯度方向，缩小白盒与黑盒攻击差距。

Result: 在OTB2015、LaSOT和GOT-10k等数据集上，AMGA显著提升了攻击性能和迁移性。

Conclusion: AMGA方法在对抗攻击中表现出色，为视觉跟踪器的安全性研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In recent years, visual tracking methods based on convolutional neural
networks and Transformers have achieved remarkable performance and have been
successfully applied in fields such as autonomous driving. However, the
numerous security issues exposed by deep learning models have gradually
affected the reliable application of visual tracking methods in real-world
scenarios. Therefore, how to reveal the security vulnerabilities of existing
visual trackers through effective adversarial attacks has become a critical
problem that needs to be addressed. To this end, we propose an adaptive
meta-gradient adversarial attack (AMGA) method for visual tracking. This method
integrates multi-model ensembles and meta-learning strategies, combining
momentum mechanisms and Gaussian smoothing, which can significantly enhance the
transferability and attack effectiveness of adversarial examples. AMGA randomly
selects models from a large model repository, constructs diverse tracking
scenarios, and iteratively performs both white- and black-box adversarial
attacks in each scenario, optimizing the gradient directions of each model.
This paradigm minimizes the gap between white- and black-box adversarial
attacks, thus achieving excellent attack performance in black-box scenarios.
Extensive experimental results on large-scale datasets such as OTB2015, LaSOT,
and GOT-10k demonstrate that AMGA significantly improves the attack
performance, transferability, and deception of adversarial examples. Codes and
data are available at https://github.com/pgao-lab/AMGA.

Motivation: 准确估计热量摄入对管理2型糖尿病至关重要，但现有方法（如CGM）因个体和餐食差异而受限。

Method: 采用注意力编码和卷积特征提取处理食物图像，多层感知器处理CGM和微生物组数据，并通过后期融合策略联合推理。

Result: 在40多名参与者的数据集上，模型RMSRE为0.2544，比基线模型提升50%以上。

Conclusion: 多模态传感技术有望改进慢性病管理的自动化饮食评估工具。

Abstract: Effective dietary monitoring is critical for managing Type 2 diabetes, yet
accurately estimating caloric intake remains a major challenge. While
continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) offer valuable physiological data, they
often fall short in capturing the full nutritional profile of meals due to
inter-individual and meal-specific variability. In this work, we introduce a
multimodal deep learning framework that jointly leverages CGM time-series data,
Demographic/Microbiome, and pre-meal food images to enhance caloric estimation.
Our model utilizes attention based encoding and a convolutional feature
extraction for meal imagery, multi-layer perceptrons for CGM and Microbiome
data followed by a late fusion strategy for joint reasoning. We evaluate our
approach on a curated dataset of over 40 participants, incorporating
synchronized CGM, Demographic and Microbiome data and meal photographs with
standardized caloric labels. Our model achieves a Root Mean Squared Relative
Error (RMSRE) of 0.2544, outperforming the baselines models by over 50%. These
findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal sensing to improve automated
dietary assessment tools for chronic disease management.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in facial recognition, there remains a fundamental

representations. Specifically, our proposed framework achieves better pose
invariance by using (1) a shared (joint) attention mapping to emphasize common
patterns that are most correlated between 2D facial images and 3D facial data
and (2) a joint entropy regularizing loss to promote better
consistency$\unicode{x2014}$enhancing correlations among the intersecting 2D
and 3D representations$\unicode{x2014}$by leveraging both attention maps. This
framework is evaluated on FaceScape and ARL-VTF datasets, where it outperforms

Motivation: 传统场景图主要关注空间关系，限制了VLMs对复杂交互的推理能力。现有方法存在关系集不相关和缺乏持久记忆的问题。

Method: ISGR框架包括双流图构造器（结合空间关系和交互感知描述）、交互查询激活VLMs功能知识、长期记忆强化学习策略。

Result: 实验表明，ISGR在交互密集型推理任务上显著优于基线方法，尤其在复杂场景理解任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: ISGR通过增强交互推理能力，为VLMs在复杂场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional scene graphs primarily focus on spatial relationships, limiting
vision-language models' (VLMs) ability to reason about complex interactions in
visual scenes. This paper addresses two key challenges: (1) conventional
detection-to-construction methods produce unfocused, contextually irrelevant
relationship sets, and (2) existing approaches fail to form persistent memories
for generalizing interaction reasoning to new scenes. We propose
Interaction-augmented Scene Graph Reasoning (ISGR), a framework that enhances
VLMs' interactional reasoning through three complementary components. First,
our dual-stream graph constructor combines SAM-powered spatial relation
extraction with interaction-aware captioning to generate functionally salient
scene graphs with spatial grounding. Second, we employ targeted interaction
queries to activate VLMs' latent knowledge of object functionalities,
converting passive recognition into active reasoning about how objects work
together. Finally, we introduce a lone-term memory reinforcement learning
strategy with a specialized interaction-focused reward function that transforms
transient patterns into long-term reasoning heuristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods on
interaction-heavy reasoning benchmarks, with particularly strong improvements
on complex scene understanding tasks. The source code can be accessed at

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过合理提示，SAM可用于COD任务，提供了一种即插即用的解决方案，优于传统专业模型设计。

Abstract: Big model has emerged as a new research paradigm that can be applied to
various down-stream tasks with only minor effort for domain adaption.
Correspondingly, this study tackles Camouflaged Object Detection (COD)
leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The previous studies declared that
SAM is not workable for COD but this study reveals that SAM works if promoted
properly, for which we devise a new framework to render point promotions:
First, we develop the Promotion Point Targeting Network (PPT-net) to leverage
multi-scale features in predicting the probabilities of camouflaged objects'
presences at given candidate points over the image. Then, we develop a key
point selection (KPS) algorithm to deploy both positive and negative point
promotions contrastively to SAM to guide the segmentation. It is the first work
to facilitate big model for COD and achieves plausible results experimentally
over the existing methods on 3 data sets under 6 metrics. This study
demonstrates an off-the-shelf methodology for COD by leveraging SAM, which
gains advantage over designing professional models from scratch, not only in
performance, but also in turning the problem to a less challenging task, that
is, seeking informative but not exactly precise promotions.

conditions. The method fuses unsupervised KMeans clustering with RGB channel
histogram modeling to achieve composite detection of structural anomalies and
color mutation signals in key frames. The experiment takes an operation
surveillance video occurring in an African country as a research sample, and
successfully identifies multiple highly anomalous frames related to high-energy
light sources, target presence, and reflective interference under the condition
of no access to the original data. The results show that this method can be
effectively used for tactical assassination warning, suspicious object
screening and environmental drastic change monitoring with strong deployability
and tactical interpretation value. The study emphasizes the importance of color
features as low semantic battlefield signal carriers, and its battlefield
intelligent perception capability will be further extended by combining graph
neural networks and temporal modeling in the future.

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练或标注数据，为VLM检测系统提供了一种可扩展的提示优化方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) offer flexible object detection through natural
language prompts but suffer from performance variability depending on prompt
phrasing. In this paper, we introduce a method for automated prompt refinement
using a novel metric called the Contrastive Class Alignment Score (CCAS), which
ranks prompts based on their semantic alignment with a target object class
while penalizing similarity to confounding classes. Our method generates
diverse prompt candidates via a large language model and filters them through
CCAS, computed using prompt embeddings from a sentence transformer. We evaluate
our approach on challenging object categories, demonstrating that our automatic
selection of high-precision prompts improves object detection accuracy without
the need for additional model training or labeled data. This scalable and
model-agnostic pipeline offers a principled alternative to manual prompt
engineering for VLM-based detection systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models have significantly
improved 3D point cloud generation. However, existing methods primarily focus
on local feature extraction while overlooking global topological information,
such as voids, which are crucial for maintaining shape consistency and
capturing complex geometries. To address this limitation, we propose
TopoDiT-3D, a Topology-Aware Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck structure
for 3D point cloud generation. Specifically, we design the bottleneck structure
utilizing Perceiver Resampler, which not only offers a mode to integrate
topological information extracted through persistent homology into feature
learning, but also adaptively filters out redundant local features to improve
training efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TopoDiT-3D
outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual quality, diversity, and training
efficiency. Furthermore, TopoDiT-3D demonstrates the importance of rich
topological information for 3D point cloud generation and its synergy with
conventional local feature learning. Videos and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如AMSnet依赖硬编码启发式规则，难以处理复杂或噪声电路图，因此需要更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出基于分割的网络检测机制，恢复位置信息以实现电路图的数字重建，并扩展AMSnet数据集为AMSnet 2.0。

Result: AMSnet 2.0包含2,686个电路，提供更丰富的标注数据，而原AMSnet仅含792个电路且无数字电路图。

Conclusion: 新方法提高了电路图理解的鲁棒性，扩展的数据集为未来研究提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to understand
circuit schematics due to their limited recognition capabilities. This could be
attributed to the lack of high-quality schematic-netlist training data.
Existing work such as AMSnet applies schematic parsing to generate netlists.
However, these methods rely on hard-coded heuristics and are difficult to apply
to complex or noisy schematics in this paper. We therefore propose a novel net
detection mechanism based on segmentation with high robustness. The proposed
method also recovers positional information, allowing digital reconstruction of
schematics. We then expand AMSnet dataset with schematic images from various
sources and create AMSnet 2.0. AMSnet 2.0 contains 2,686 circuits with
schematic images, Spectre-formatted netlists, OpenAccess digital schematics,
and positional information for circuit components and nets, whereas AMSnet only
includes 792 circuits with SPICE netlists but no digital schematics.

TLDR: DRRNet提出了一种四阶段架构，通过全局与局部特征融合及逆向细化，显著提升了伪装目标检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪装目标检测中目标与背景在颜色、纹理和形状上的高度相似性导致现有方法难以平衡全局语义与局部细节。

Method: 采用四阶段流程，包括全局上下文特征提取、局部细节补充、双表征融合及逆向细化模块。

Result: 在基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DRRNet通过多尺度特征融合和逆向细化，有效解决了伪装目标检测中的挑战。

Abstract: The core challenge in Camouflage Object Detection (COD) lies in the
indistinguishable similarity between targets and backgrounds in terms of color,
texture, and shape. This causes existing methods to either lose edge details
(such as hair-like fine structures) due to over-reliance on global semantic
information or be disturbed by similar backgrounds (such as vegetation
patterns) when relying solely on local features. We propose DRRNet, a
four-stage architecture characterized by a "context-detail-fusion-refinement"
pipeline to address these issues. Specifically, we introduce an Omni-Context
Feature Extraction Module to capture global camouflage patterns and a Local
Detail Extraction Module to supplement microstructural information for the
full-scene context module. We then design a module for forming dual
representations of scene understanding and structural awareness, which fuses
panoramic features and local features across various scales. In the decoder, we
also introduce a reverse refinement module that leverages spatial edge priors
and frequency-domain noise suppression to perform a two-stage inverse
refinement of the output. By applying two successive rounds of inverse
refinement, the model effectively suppresses background interference and
enhances the continuity of object boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate
that DRRNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark
datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/jerrySunning/DRRNet.

Abstract: The growing complexity and scale of visual model pre-training have made
developing and deploying multi-task computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems
increasingly challenging and resource-intensive. Furthermore, the medical
imaging community lacks an open-source CAD platform to enable the rapid
creation of efficient and extendable diagnostic models. To address these
issues, we propose UniCAD, a unified architecture that leverages the robust
capabilities of pre-trained vision foundation models to seamlessly handle both

introducing only 0.17% trainable parameters. (2) Plug-and-Play: A modular
architecture that combines a frozen foundation model with multiple
plug-and-play experts, enabling diverse tasks and seamless functionality
expansion. Building on this unified CAD architecture, we establish an
open-source platform where researchers can share and access lightweight CAD
experts, fostering a more equitable and efficient research ecosystem.

Abstract: Network quantization has proven to be a powerful approach to reduce the
memory and computational demands of deep learning models for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. However, traditional quantization methods often
rely on access to training data, which is impractical in many real-world

Conclusion: PDE能有效缓解“基因效应”，提升低光图像增强性能。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental task in computational
photography, aiming to improve illumination, reduce noise, and enhance image
quality. While recent advancements focus on designing increasingly complex
neural network models, we observe a peculiar phenomenon: resetting certain
parameters to random values unexpectedly improves enhancement performance for
some images. Drawing inspiration from biological genes, we term this phenomenon
the gene effect. The gene effect limits enhancement performance, as even random
parameters can sometimes outperform learned ones, preventing models from fully
utilizing their capacity. In this paper, we investigate the reason and propose
a solution. Based on our observations, we attribute the gene effect to static
parameters, analogous to how fixed genetic configurations become maladaptive
when environments change. Inspired by biological evolution, where adaptation to
new environments relies on gene mutation and recombination, we propose
parameter dynamic evolution (PDE) to adapt to different images and mitigate the
gene effect. PDE employs a parameter orthogonal generation technique and the
corresponding generated parameters to simulate gene recombination and gene
mutation, separately. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our techniques.
The code will be released to the public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖全波仿真工具设计超表面RAS，计算量大且耗时，需探索大设计空间。

Method: 采用基于CNN的架构和Huber损失函数，预测RAS的反射特性。

Result: 模型在1000次训练周期内达到99.9%的余弦相似度和0.001的均方误差，仿真和实验验证了其高效性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该代理模型显著提升了设计效率，同时保持了高预测精度。

Abstract: Metasurface-based radar absorbing structures (RAS) are highly preferred for
applications like stealth technology, electromagnetic (EM) shielding, etc. due
to their capability to achieve frequency selective absorption characteristics
with minimal thickness and reduced weight penalty. However, the conventional
approach for the EM design and optimization of these structures relies on
forward simulations, using full wave simulation tools, to predict the
electromagnetic (EM) response of candidate meta atoms. This process is
computationally intensive, extremely time consuming and requires exploration of
large design spaces. To overcome this challenge, we propose a surrogate model
that significantly accelerates the prediction of EM responses of multi-layered
metasurface-based RAS. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture
with Huber loss function has been employed to estimate the reflection
characteristics of the RAS model. The proposed model achieved a cosine
similarity of 99.9% and a mean square error of 0.001 within 1000 epochs of
training. The efficiency of the model has been established via full wave
simulations as well as experiment where it demonstrated significant reduction
in computational time while maintaining high predictive accuracy.

Result: 传统模型在ICH二分类和亚型分类任务中均优于MLLMs，Gemini 2.0 Flash的宏平均精确度为0.41，F1得分为0.31。

Conclusion: 尽管MLLMs在交互性上表现优异，但其在ICH亚型识别中的准确性不及传统模型，未来需优化模型以提高三维医学图像处理性能。

Abstract: Introduction: Timely identification of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) subtypes
on non-contrast computed tomography is critical for prognosis prediction and
therapeutic decision-making, yet remains challenging due to low contrast and
blurring boundaries. This study evaluates the performance of zero-shot
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) compared to traditional deep learning
methods in ICH binary classification and subtyping. Methods: We utilized a
dataset provided by RSNA, comprising 192 NCCT volumes. The study compares
various MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2,
with conventional deep learning models, including ResNet50 and Vision
Transformer. Carefully crafted prompts were used to guide MLLMs in tasks such
as ICH presence, subtype classification, localization, and volume estimation.
Results: The results indicate that in the ICH binary classification task,
traditional deep learning models outperform MLLMs comprehensively. For subtype
classification, MLLMs also exhibit inferior performance compared to traditional
deep learning models, with Gemini 2.0 Flash achieving an macro-averaged
precision of 0.41 and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.31. Conclusion: While
MLLMs excel in interactive capabilities, their overall accuracy in ICH
subtyping is inferior to deep networks. However, MLLMs enhance interpretability
through language interactions, indicating potential in medical imaging
analysis. Future efforts will focus on model refinement and developing more
precise MLLMs to improve performance in three-dimensional medical image
processing.

Conclusion: Pose-TTA方法简单易用，可直接集成到现有人脸识别流程中，无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to enhance face recognition performance by
augmenting head poses during the testing phase. Existing methods often rely on
training on frontalised images or learning pose-invariant representations, yet
both approaches typically require re-training and testing for each dataset,
involving a substantial amount of effort. In contrast, this study proposes
Pose-TTA, a novel approach that aligns faces at inference time without
additional training. To achieve this, we employ a portrait animator that
transfers the source image identity into the pose of a driving image. Instead
of frontalising a side-profile face -- which can introduce distortion --
Pose-TTA generates matching side-profile images for comparison, thereby
reducing identity information loss. Furthermore, we propose a weighted feature
aggregation strategy to address any distortions or biases arising from the
synthetic data, thus enhancing the reliability of the augmented images.
Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and with various pre-trained face
recognition models demonstrate that Pose-TTA consistently improves inference
performance. Moreover, our method is straightforward to integrate into existing
face recognition pipelines, as it requires no retraining or fine-tuning of the
underlying recognition models.

Conclusion: AnoGen能有效生成真实异常数据，显著提升异常检测模型的分类和分割性能。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a practical and challenging task due to the scarcity of
anomaly samples in industrial inspection. Some existing anomaly detection
methods address this issue by synthesizing anomalies with noise or external
data. However, there is always a large semantic gap between synthetic and
real-world anomalies, resulting in weak performance in anomaly detection. To
solve the problem, we propose a few-shot Anomaly-driven Generation (AnoGen)
method, which guides the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse
anomalies with only a few real anomalies, thereby benefiting training anomaly
detection models. Specifically, our work is divided into three stages. In the
first stage, we learn the anomaly distribution based on a few given real
anomalies and inject the learned knowledge into an embedding. In the second
stage, we use the embedding and given bounding boxes to guide the diffusion
model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies on specific objects (or
textures). In the final stage, we propose a weakly-supervised anomaly detection
method to train a more powerful model with generated anomalies. Our method
builds upon DRAEM and DesTSeg as the foundation model and conducts experiments
on the commonly used industrial anomaly detection dataset, MVTec. The
experiments demonstrate that our generated anomalies effectively improve the
model performance of both anomaly classification and segmentation tasks
simultaneously, \eg, DRAEM and DseTSeg achieved a 5.8\% and 1.5\% improvement
in AU-PR metric on segmentation task, respectively. The code and generated
anomalous data are available at https://github.com/gaobb/AnoGen.

Conclusion: OneNIP方法简单有效，显著提升了统一异常检测的性能和分割精度。

Abstract: Unsupervised reconstruction networks using self-attention transformers have
achieved state-of-the-art performance for multi-class (unified) anomaly
detection with a single model. However, these self-attention reconstruction
models primarily operate on target features, which may result in perfect
reconstruction for both normal and anomaly features due to high consistency
with context, leading to failure in detecting anomalies. Additionally, these
models often produce inaccurate anomaly segmentation due to performing
reconstruction in a low spatial resolution latent space. To enable
reconstruction models enjoying high efficiency while enhancing their
generalization for unified anomaly detection, we propose a simple yet effective
method that reconstructs normal features and restores anomaly features with
just One Normal Image Prompt (OneNIP). In contrast to previous work, OneNIP
allows for the first time to reconstruct or restore anomalies with just one
normal image prompt, effectively boosting unified anomaly detection
performance. Furthermore, we propose a supervised refiner that regresses
reconstruction errors by using both real normal and synthesized anomalous
images, which significantly improves pixel-level anomaly segmentation. OneNIP
outperforms previous methods on three industry anomaly detection benchmarks:
MVTec, BTAD, and VisA. The code and pre-trained models are available at

Abstract: Zero- and few-shot visual anomaly segmentation relies on powerful
vision-language models that detect unseen anomalies using manually designed
textual prompts. However, visual representations are inherently independent of
language. In this paper, we explore the potential of a pure visual foundation
model as an alternative to widely used vision-language models for universal
visual anomaly segmentation. We present a novel paradigm that unifies anomaly
segmentation into change segmentation. This paradigm enables us to leverage
large-scale synthetic image pairs, featuring object-level and local region
changes, derived from existing image datasets, which are independent of target
anomaly datasets. We propose a one-prompt Meta-learning framework for Universal
Anomaly Segmentation (MetaUAS) that is trained on this synthetic dataset and
then generalizes well to segment any novel or unseen visual anomalies in the
real world. To handle geometrical variations between prompt and query images,
we propose a soft feature alignment module that bridges paired-image change
perception and single-image semantic segmentation. This is the first work to
achieve universal anomaly segmentation using a pure vision model without
relying on special anomaly detection datasets and pre-trained visual-language
models. Our method effectively and efficiently segments any anomalies with only
one normal image prompt and enjoys training-free without guidance from
language. Our MetaUAS significantly outperforms previous zero-shot, few-shot,
and even full-shot anomaly segmentation methods. The code and pre-trained
models are available at https://github.com/gaobb/MetaUAS.

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable biodiversity monitoring methods has fuelled
interest in remote sensing data, due to its widespread availability and
extensive coverage. Traditionally, the application of remote sensing to
biodiversity research has focused on mapping and monitoring habitats, but with
increasing availability of large-scale citizen-science wildlife observation
data, recent methods have started to explore predicting multi-species presence
directly from satellite images. This paper presents a new data set for
predicting butterfly species presence from satellite data in the United
Kingdom. We experimentally optimise a Resnet-based model to predict
multi-species presence from 4-band satellite images, and find that this model
especially outperforms the mean rate baseline for locations with high species
biodiversity. To improve performance, we develop a soft, supervised contrastive
regularisation loss that is tailored to probabilistic labels (such as

In summary, our new data set and contrastive regularisation method contribute
to the open challenge of accurately predicting species biodiversity from remote

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频编解码器依赖手工特征，而神经视频编解码器（NVC）能学习内容感知压缩策略，但高计算需求限制了实时应用。

Method: 采用2D高斯泼溅技术，结合内容感知初始化和帧间冗余减少机制，优化编码速度。

Result: 编码时间比之前基于高斯泼溅的图像编解码器快88%，首次实现高斯泼溅在神经视频编解码中的应用。

Abstract: The computer vision and image processing research community has been involved
in standardizing video data communications for the past many decades, leading
to standards such as AVC, HEVC, VVC, AV1, AV2, etc. However, recent
groundbreaking works have focused on employing deep learning-based techniques
to replace the traditional video codec pipeline to a greater affect. Neural
video codecs (NVC) create an end-to-end ML-based solution that does not rely on
any handcrafted features (motion or edge-based) and have the ability to learn
content-aware compression strategies, offering better adaptability and higher
compression efficiency than traditional methods. This holds a great potential
not only for hardware design, but also for various video streaming platforms
and applications, especially video conferencing applications such as MS-Teams
or Zoom that have found extensive usage in classrooms and workplaces. However,
their high computational demands currently limit their use in real-time
applications like video conferencing. To address this, we propose a
region-of-interest (ROI) based neural video compression model that leverages 2D
Gaussian Splatting. Unlike traditional codecs, 2D Gaussian Splatting is capable
of real-time decoding and can be optimized using fewer data points, requiring
only thousands of Gaussians for decent quality outputs as opposed to millions
in 3D scenes. In this work, we designed a video pipeline that speeds up the
encoding time of the previous Gaussian splatting-based image codec by 88% by
using a content-aware initialization strategy paired with a novel Gaussian
inter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism, enabling Gaussian splatting to be
used for a video-codec solution, the first of its kind solution in this neural
video codec space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像与自然数据差异显著，目前缺乏对医学领域扩展行为的深入理解，阻碍了医学视觉基础模型的开发。

Method: 通过自监督学习，探索了模型大小、训练算法、数据规模和成像模态的扩展行为，并提出了BioVFM-21M数据集。

Result: 扩展确实带来性能提升，但效果因任务而异。BioVFM模型在12个医学基准测试中优于现有最佳模型。

Conclusion: 扩展虽有益，但任务特性、数据多样性、预训练方法和计算效率仍是开发可扩展医学基础模型的关键因素。

Abstract: Scaling up model and data size have demonstrated impressive performance
improvement over a wide range of tasks. Despite extensive studies on scaling
behaviors for general-purpose tasks, medical images exhibit substantial
differences from natural data. It remains unclear the key factors in developing
medical vision foundation models at scale due to the absence of an extensive
understanding of scaling behavior in the medical domain. In this paper, we
explored the scaling behavior across model sizes, training algorithms, data
sizes, and imaging modalities in developing scalable medical vision foundation
models by self-supervised learning. To support scalable pretraining, we
introduce BioVFM-21M, a large-scale biomedical image dataset encompassing a
wide range of biomedical image modalities and anatomies. We observed that
scaling up does provide benefits but varies across tasks. Additional analysis
reveals several factors correlated with scaling benefits. Finally, we propose
BioVFM, a large-scale medical vision foundation model pretrained on 21 million
biomedical images, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation
models across 12 medical benchmarks. Our results highlight that while scaling
up is beneficial for pursuing better performance, task characteristics, data
diversity, pretraining methods, and computational efficiency remain critical
considerations for developing scalable medical foundation models.

through a novel multiview contrastive learning strategy that leverages stable
positive-negative pair sampling. A gradient-friendly loss function is
introduced to promote smoother and more stable convergence, and the model is
optimized for distributed training to ensure scalability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MultiviewVLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and
can be easily adapted to various real-world applications with minimal
modifications.

Conclusion: Marigold展示了从生成模型中提取知识用于密集图像分析任务的潜力，为数据稀缺场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The success of deep learning in computer vision over the past decade has
hinged on large labeled datasets and strong pretrained models. In data-scarce
settings, the quality of these pretrained models becomes crucial for effective
transfer learning. Image classification and self-supervised learning have
traditionally been the primary methods for pretraining CNNs and
transformer-based architectures. Recently, the rise of text-to-image generative
models, particularly those using denoising diffusion in a latent space, has
introduced a new class of foundational models trained on massive, captioned
image datasets. These models' ability to generate realistic images of unseen
content suggests they possess a deep understanding of the visual world. In this
work, we present Marigold, a family of conditional generative models and a
fine-tuning protocol that extracts the knowledge from pretrained latent
diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and adapts them for dense image analysis
tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normals prediction, and
intrinsic decomposition. Marigold requires minimal modification of the
pre-trained latent diffusion model's architecture, trains with small synthetic
datasets on a single GPU over a few days, and demonstrates state-of-the-art
zero-shot generalization. Project page:

TLDR: RobustSpring是一个用于评估光流、场景流和立体视觉模型对图像损坏（如噪声或雨）鲁棒性的数据集和基准。它包含20种不同的图像损坏，生成20,000张损坏图像，并提供新的鲁棒性度量标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注模型准确性，而忽略了对现实世界中图像损坏的鲁棒性。RobustSpring旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 在Spring数据集上应用20种时间、立体和深度一致的图像损坏，生成20,000张损坏图像，并设计新的鲁棒性度量标准。

Result: 实验表明，准确性高的模型不一定鲁棒，且鲁棒性因损坏类型而异。

Conclusion: RobustSpring将鲁棒性作为首要目标，推动兼具准确性和鲁棒性的模型发展。

Abstract: Standard benchmarks for optical flow, scene flow, and stereo vision
algorithms generally focus on model accuracy rather than robustness to image
corruptions like noise or rain. Hence, the resilience of models to such
real-world perturbations is largely unquantified. To address this, we present
RobustSpring, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for evaluating robustness
to image corruptions for optical flow, scene flow, and stereo models.
RobustSpring applies 20 different image corruptions, including noise, blur,
color changes, quality degradations, and weather distortions, in a time-,
stereo-, and depth-consistent manner to the high-resolution Spring dataset,
creating a suite of 20,000 corrupted images that reflect challenging
conditions. RobustSpring enables comparisons of model robustness via a new
corruption robustness metric. Integration with the Spring benchmark enables
public two-axis evaluations of both accuracy and robustness. We benchmark a
curated selection of initial models, observing that accurate models are not
necessarily robust and that robustness varies widely by corruption type.
RobustSpring is a new computer vision benchmark that treats robustness as a
first-class citizen to foster models that combine accuracy with resilience. It
will be available at https://spring-benchmark.org.

Conclusion: MAKE通过多知识增强和细粒度对齐，有效提升了皮肤病诊断任务的性能。

Abstract: Dermatological diagnosis represents a complex multimodal challenge that
requires integrating visual features with specialized clinical knowledge. While
vision-language pretraining (VLP) has advanced medical AI, its effectiveness in
dermatology is limited by text length constraints and the lack of structured
texts. In this paper, we introduce MAKE, a Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced
vision-language pretraining framework for zero-shot dermatological tasks.
Recognizing that comprehensive dermatological descriptions require multiple
knowledge aspects that exceed standard text constraints, our framework
introduces: (1) a multi-aspect contrastive learning strategy that decomposes
clinical narratives into knowledge-enhanced sub-texts through large language
models, (2) a fine-grained alignment mechanism that connects subcaptions with
diagnostically relevant image features, and (3) a diagnosis-guided weighting
scheme that adaptively prioritizes different sub-captions based on clinical
significance prior. Through pretraining on 403,563 dermatological image-text
pairs collected from education resources, MAKE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art VLP models on eight datasets across zero-shot skin disease
classification, concept annotation, and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Our code
will be made publicly available at https: //github.com/SiyuanYan1/MAKE.

Result: 总结了当前领域的研究现状、关键挑战和局限性，并提出了未来探索的方向。

Conclusion: 本文为语言驱动的人体运动合成研究提供了有价值的起点，旨在推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation offers a powerful and intuitive way to create
human movements directly from natural language. By removing the need for
predefined motion inputs, it provides a flexible and accessible approach to
controlling animated characters. This makes it especially useful in areas like
virtual reality, gaming, human-computer interaction, and robotics. In this
review, we first revisit the traditional perspective on motion synthesis, where
models focused on predicting future poses from observed initial sequences,
often conditioned on action labels. We then provide a comprehensive and
structured survey of modern text-to-motion generation approaches, categorizing
them from two complementary perspectives: (i) architectural, dividing methods
into VAE-based, diffusion-based, and hybrid models; and (ii) motion
representation, distinguishing between discrete and continuous motion
generation strategies. In addition, we explore the most widely used datasets,
evaluation methods, and recent benchmarks that have shaped progress in this
area. With this survey, we aim to capture where the field currently stands,
bring attention to its key challenges and limitations, and highlight promising
directions for future exploration. We hope this work offers a valuable starting
point for researchers and practitioners working to push the boundaries of
language-driven human motion synthesis.

Abstract: Background: There are many challenges and opportunities in the clinical
deployment of AI tools in radiology. The current study describes a radiology
software platform called NeoMedSys that can enable efficient deployment and
refinements of AI models. We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of
running NeoMedSys for three months in real-world clinical settings and focused
on improvement performance of an in-house developed AI model (VIOLA-AI)
designed for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) detection.
  Methods: NeoMedSys integrates tools for deploying, testing, and optimizing AI
models with a web-based medical image viewer, annotation system, and
hospital-wide radiology information systems. A pragmatic investigation was
deployed using clinical cases of patients presenting to the largest Emergency
Department in Norway (site-1) with suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI) or
patients with suspected stroke (site-2). We assessed ICH classification
performance as VIOLA-AI encountered new data and underwent pre-planned model
retraining. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy,
and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
  Results: NeoMedSys facilitated iterative improvements in the AI model,
significantly enhancing its diagnostic accuracy. Automated bleed detection and
segmentation were reviewed in near real-time to facilitate re-training
VIOLA-AI. The iterative refinement process yielded a marked improvement in
classification sensitivity, rising to 90.3% (from 79.2%), and specificity that
reached 89.3% (from 80.7%). The bleed detection ROC analysis for the entire
sample demonstrated a high area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.949 (from 0.873).
Model refinement stages were associated with notable gains, highlighting the
value of real-time radiologist feedback.

Motivation: 现有研究在处理异构问题（如域偏移）时忽视了语义空间中的细粒度类关系，导致类表示模糊。

Method: 引入类样本作为局部和全局类表示的标准，服务器端建模类原型监督客户端全局分支，客户端通过对抗机制协调全局和局部分支，并使用多级对比损失。

Result: 在多个驾驶场景分割数据集上表现优异，显著提高平均分割精度并有效解决类一致性问题。

Conclusion: FedSaaS框架通过类样本和对比损失成功解决了联邦语义分割中的类一致性问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Federated semantic segmentation enables pixel-level classification in images
through collaborative learning while maintaining data privacy. However,
existing research commonly overlooks the fine-grained class relationships
within the semantic space when addressing heterogeneous problems, particularly
domain shift. This oversight results in ambiguities between class
representation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel federated
segmentation framework that strikes class consistency, termed FedSaaS.
Specifically, we introduce class exemplars as a criterion for both local- and
global-level class representations. On the server side, the uploaded class
exemplars are leveraged to model class prototypes, which supervise global
branch of clients, ensuring alignment with global-level representation. On the
client side, we incorporate an adversarial mechanism to harmonize contributions
of global and local branches, leading to consistent output. Moreover,
multilevel contrastive losses are employed on both sides to enforce consistency
between two-level representations in the same semantic space. Extensive
experiments on several driving scene segmentation datasets demonstrate that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving average
segmentation accuracy and effectively addressing the class-consistency
representation problem.

Result: 在KITTI和Waymo数据集上验证了方法在动态场景建模中的优越性能。

Conclusion: FreeDriveRF为自动驾驶动态场景重建提供了一种高效且低复杂度的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction for autonomous driving enables vehicles to
perceive and interpret complex scene changes more precisely. Dynamic Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have recently shown promising capability in scene
modeling. However, many existing methods rely heavily on accurate poses inputs
and multi-sensor data, leading to increased system complexity. To address this,
we propose FreeDriveRF, which reconstructs dynamic driving scenes using only
sequential RGB images without requiring poses inputs. We innovatively decouple
dynamic and static parts at the early sampling level using semantic
supervision, mitigating image blurring and artifacts. To overcome the
challenges posed by object motion and occlusion in monocular camera, we
introduce a warped ray-guided dynamic object rendering consistency loss,
utilizing optical flow to better constrain the dynamic modeling process.
Additionally, we incorporate estimated dynamic flow to constrain the pose
optimization process, improving the stability and accuracy of unbounded scene
reconstruction. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI and Waymo datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our method in dynamic scene modeling
for autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 该方法高效、泛化能力强，无需额外优化即可直接渲染，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Current learning-based methods predict NeRF or 3D Gaussians from point clouds
to achieve photo-realistic rendering but still depend on categorical priors,
dense point clouds, or additional refinements. Hence, we introduce a novel
point cloud rendering method by predicting 2D Gaussians from point clouds. Our
method incorporates two identical modules with an entire-patch architecture
enabling the network to be generalized to multiple datasets. The module
normalizes and initializes the Gaussians utilizing the point cloud information
including normals, colors and distances. Then, splitting decoders are employed
to refine the initial Gaussians by duplicating them and predicting more
accurate results, making our methodology effectively accommodate sparse point
clouds as well. Once trained, our approach exhibits direct generalization to
point clouds across different categories. The predicted Gaussians are employed
directly for rendering without additional refinement on the rendered images,
retaining the benefits of 2D Gaussians. We conduct extensive experiments on
various datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and
generalization of our method, which achieves SOTA performance. The code is

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for protecting facial recognition systems
from presentation attacks. Previous methods approached this task as a
classification problem, lacking interpretability and reasoning behind the
predicted results. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
shown strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and decision-making in
visual tasks. However, there is currently no universal and comprehensive MLLM
and dataset specifically designed for FAS task. To address this gap, we propose
FaceShield, a MLLM for FAS, along with the corresponding pre-training and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, FaceShield-pre10K and FaceShield-sft45K.
FaceShield is capable of determining the authenticity of faces, identifying
types of spoofing attacks, providing reasoning for its judgments, and detecting
attack areas. Specifically, we employ spoof-aware vision perception (SAVP) that
incorporates both the original image and auxiliary information based on prior
knowledge. We then use an prompt-guided vision token masking (PVTM) strategy to
random mask vision tokens, thereby improving the model's generalization
ability. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets,
demonstrating that FaceShield significantly outperforms previous deep learning
models and general MLLMs on four FAS tasks, i.e., coarse-grained
classification, fine-grained classification, reasoning, and attack
localization. Our instruction datasets, protocols, and codes will be released
soon.

Conclusion: MoRAL通过运动感知和动态信息融合，显著提升了3D物体检测性能，尤其在动态目标检测上表现突出。

Abstract: Reliable autonomous driving systems require accurate detection of traffic
participants. To this end, multi-modal fusion has emerged as an effective
strategy. In particular, 4D radar and LiDAR fusion methods based on multi-frame
radar point clouds have demonstrated the effectiveness in bridging the point
density gap. However, they often neglect radar point clouds' inter-frame
misalignment caused by object movement during accumulation and do not fully
exploit the object dynamic information from 4D radar. In this paper, we propose
MoRAL, a motion-aware multi-frame 4D radar and LiDAR fusion framework for
robust 3D object detection. First, a Motion-aware Radar Encoder (MRE) is
designed to compensate for inter-frame radar misalignment from moving objects.
Later, a Motion Attention Gated Fusion (MAGF) module integrate radar motion
features to guide LiDAR features to focus on dynamic foreground objects.
Extensive evaluations on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset demonstrate that MoRAL
outperforms existing methods, achieving the highest mAP of 73.30% in the entire
area and 88.68% in the driving corridor. Notably, our method also achieves the
best AP of 69.67% for pedestrians in the entire area and 96.25% for cyclists in

TLDR: SerLiC是一种基于序列化的神经压缩框架，专注于LiDAR反射率数据的压缩，通过1D序列化和Mamba模型实现高效压缩，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR点云中的反射率属性对下游任务至关重要，但在神经压缩方法中尚未充分探索。

Method: 将3D LiDAR点云通过扫描顺序序列化为1D序列，结合传感器扫描索引、径向距离和先验反射率进行上下文表示，并采用Mamba模型进行高效序列建模。

Result: SerLiC实现了超过2倍的体积压缩，压缩比特数比现有方法减少22%，且仅使用其2%的参数；轻量版SerLiC达到>10 fps，仅需111K参数。

Conclusion: SerLiC在LiDAR反射率压缩中表现出色，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Reflectance attributes in LiDAR point clouds provide essential information
for downstream tasks but remain underexplored in neural compression methods. To
address this, we introduce SerLiC, a serialization-based neural compression
framework to fully exploit the intrinsic characteristics of LiDAR reflectance.
SerLiC first transforms 3D LiDAR point clouds into 1D sequences via scan-order
serialization, offering a device-centric perspective for reflectance analysis.
Each point is then tokenized into a contextual representation comprising its
sensor scanning index, radial distance, and prior reflectance, for effective
dependencies exploration. For efficient sequential modeling, Mamba is
incorporated with a dual parallelization scheme, enabling simultaneous
autoregressive dependency capture and fast processing. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SerLiC attains over 2x volume reduction against the original
reflectance data, outperforming the state-of-the-art method by up to 22%

TLDR: Endo-CLIP是一个自监督框架，通过三阶段处理（清洗、调整、统一）改进内窥镜图像分析，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决内窥镜图像分析中的背景干扰、复杂术语和多病灶描述模糊问题。

Method: 三阶段框架：清洗（去背景）、调整（提取临床属性）、统一（患者级交叉注意力）。

Result: 在零样本和小样本息肉检测与分类中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Endo-CLIP为更准确和临床相关的内窥镜分析铺平了道路。

Abstract: Pre-training on image-text colonoscopy records offers substantial potential
for improving endoscopic image analysis, but faces challenges including
non-informative background images, complex medical terminology, and ambiguous
multi-lesion descriptions. We introduce Endo-CLIP, a novel self-supervised
framework that enhances Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) for this
domain. Endo-CLIP's three-stage framework--cleansing, attunement, and
unification--addresses these challenges by (1) removing background frames, (2)
leveraging large language models to extract clinical attributes for
fine-grained contrastive learning, and (3) employing patient-level
cross-attention to resolve multi-polyp ambiguities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Endo-CLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
pre-training methods in zero-shot and few-shot polyp detection and
classification, paving the way for more accurate and clinically relevant
endoscopic analysis.

TLDR: MrTrack是一种基于Mamba的超声引导细针抽吸活检针跟踪器，通过全局上下文提取和时序提示检索，解决了快速往复运动导致的视觉特征不可用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声引导细针抽吸活检（FNA）是一种常见的微创诊断方法，但目前缺乏能够应对快速往复运动的活检针跟踪器。

Method: MrTrack采用基于Mamba的寄存器机制，包括寄存器提取器和检索器，从历史搜索图中提取全局上下文并存储时序提示，同时提出自监督寄存器多样化损失以避免特征崩溃。

Result: 在自动和手动抽吸数据集上的实验表明，MrTrack在准确性、鲁棒性和推理效率上均优于现有跟踪器。

Conclusion: MrTrack为解决快速往复运动导致的跟踪问题提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is a common minimally
invasive diagnostic procedure. However, an aspiration needle tracker addressing
rapid reciprocating motion is still missing. MrTrack, an aspiration needle
tracker with a mamba-based register mechanism, is proposed. MrTrack leverages a
Mamba-based register extractor to sequentially distill global context from each
historical search map, storing these temporal cues in a register bank. The
Mamba-based register retriever then retrieves temporal prompts from the
register bank to provide external cues when current vision features are
temporarily unusable due to rapid reciprocating motion and imaging degradation.
A self-supervised register diversify loss is proposed to encourage feature
diversity and dimension independence within the learned register, mitigating
feature collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both motorized and
manual aspiration datasets demonstrate that MrTrack not only outperforms
state-of-the-art trackers in accuracy and robustness but also achieves superior
inference efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的编码器-解码器模型，通过结合游戏状态信息和上下文推理，改进时空动作检测（STAD）方法，减少假阳性并提高低置信度下的精度和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有STAD方法在高召回率、低精度要求下缺乏上下文理解，导致假阳性较多，需通过更广泛的动作序列和游戏状态信息解决。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器-解码器模型处理噪声预测序列和游戏状态信息，联合建模团队动态和战术规律。

Result: 方法在低置信度下提高了精度和召回率，实现了更可靠的广播视频事件提取。

Conclusion: 通过上下文推理和团队动态建模，该方法有效提升了STAD性能，补充了现有像素级方法。

Abstract: State-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) methods show
promising results for extracting soccer events from broadcast videos. However,
when operated in the high-recall, low-precision regime required for exhaustive
event coverage in soccer analytics, their lack of contextual understanding
becomes apparent: many false positives could be resolved by considering a
broader sequence of actions and game-state information. In this work, we
address this limitation by reasoning at the game level and improving STAD
through the addition of a denoising sequence transduction task. Sequences of
noisy, context-free player-centric predictions are processed alongside clean
game state information using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. By
modeling extended temporal context and reasoning jointly over team-level
dynamics, our method leverages the "language of soccer" - its tactical
regularities and inter-player dependencies - to generate "denoised" sequences
of actions. This approach improves both precision and recall in low-confidence
regimes, enabling more reliable event extraction from broadcast video and
complementing existing pixel-based methods.

TLDR: 提出了一种新的2D语义感知位置编码方法（SaPE²），解决了传统位置编码在视觉任务中的局限性，提升了模型的泛化能力和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的位置编码方法主要来自自然语言处理，无法有效捕捉图像块间的语义关系，限制了模型的泛化能力和翻译等变性。

Method: 提出SaPE²方法，动态调整位置表示，利用局部内容而非固定线性关系或空间坐标，增强语义感知。

Result: SaPE²提升了模型在不同图像分辨率和尺度下的泛化能力，改善了翻译等变性，并更好地聚合了视觉相似但空间距离远的图像块特征。

Conclusion: SaPE²通过结合位置编码与感知相似性，显著提升了视觉Transformer在计算机视觉任务中的性能。

Abstract: Vision transformers have demonstrated significant advantages in computer
vision tasks due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and
contextual relationships through self-attention. However, existing position
encoding techniques, which are largely borrowed from natural language
processing, fail to effectively capture semantic-aware positional relationships
between image patches. Traditional approaches like absolute position encoding
and relative position encoding primarily focus on 1D linear position
relationship, often neglecting the semantic similarity between distant yet
contextually related patches. These limitations hinder model generalization,
translation equivariance, and the ability to effectively handle repetitive or
structured patterns in images. In this paper, we propose 2-Dimensional
Semantic-Aware Position Encoding ($\text{SaPE}^2$), a novel position encoding
method with semantic awareness that dynamically adapts position representations
by leveraging local content instead of fixed linear position relationship or
spatial coordinates. Our method enhances the model's ability to generalize
across varying image resolutions and scales, improves translation equivariance,
and better aggregates features for visually similar but spatially distant
patches. By integrating $\text{SaPE}^2$ into vision transformers, we bridge the
gap between position encoding and perceptual similarity, thereby improving
performance on computer vision tasks.

Motivation: 当前多模态FAS方法因模态特定偏差和域偏移导致泛化能力不足，需解决这些问题以提高系统安全性。

Method: 引入MMDA框架，包含MD2A模块（减少域和模态噪声）、RS2对齐策略（利用CLIP对齐数据）和U-DSA模块（增强表示适应性）。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，MMDA在跨域泛化和多模态检测精度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMDA框架通过创新模块显著提升了FAS的泛化能力和检测精度，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is essential for the security of facial recognition
systems in diverse scenarios such as payment processing and surveillance.
Current multimodal FAS methods often struggle with effective generalization,
mainly due to modality-specific biases and domain shifts. To address these
challenges, we introduce the \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{m}odal \textbf{D}enoising
and \textbf{A}lignment (\textbf{MMDA}) framework. By leveraging the zero-shot
generalization capability of CLIP, the MMDA framework effectively suppresses
noise in multimodal data through denoising and alignment mechanisms, thereby
significantly enhancing the generalization performance of cross-modal
alignment. The \textbf{M}odality-\textbf{D}omain Joint \textbf{D}ifferential
\textbf{A}ttention (\textbf{MD2A}) module in MMDA concurrently mitigates the
impacts of domain and modality noise by refining the attention mechanism based
on extracted common noise features. Furthermore, the \textbf{R}epresentation
\textbf{S}pace \textbf{S}oft (\textbf{RS2}) Alignment strategy utilizes the
pre-trained CLIP model to align multi-domain multimodal data into a generalized
representation space in a flexible manner, preserving intricate representations
and enhancing the model's adaptability to various unseen conditions. We also
design a \textbf{U}-shaped \textbf{D}ual \textbf{S}pace \textbf{A}daptation
(\textbf{U-DSA}) module to enhance the adaptability of representations while
maintaining generalization performance. These improvements not only enhance the
framework's generalization capabilities but also boost its ability to represent
complex representations. Our experimental results on four benchmark datasets
under different evaluation protocols demonstrate that the MMDA framework
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of cross-domain
generalization and multimodal detection accuracy. The code will be released
soon.

standard VLM benchmarks, we demonstrate that Flash-VL 2B achieves
state-of-the-art results in both speed and accuracy, making it a promising
solution for deployment in resource-constrained environments and large-scale

Method: 结合保形预测和近似后验采样，构建对FRIQ指标的统计边界，确保其在一定误差概率内成立。

Result: 在图像去噪和加速磁共振成像（MRI）问题上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为FRIQ指标提供了可靠的统计边界，适用于安全关键领域。

Abstract: In imaging inverse problems, we would like to know how close the recovered
image is to the true image in terms of full-reference image quality (FRIQ)
metrics like PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, etc. This is especially important in
safety-critical applications like medical imaging, where knowing that, say, the
SSIM was poor could potentially avoid a costly misdiagnosis. But since we don't
know the true image, computing FRIQ is non-trivial. In this work, we combine
conformal prediction with approximate posterior sampling to construct bounds on
FRIQ that are guaranteed to hold up to a user-specified error probability. We
demonstrate our approach on image denoising and accelerated magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) problems. Code is available at

Conclusion: 事件相机能有效捕捉面部生理信息，适用于远程心率监测，性能随帧率提升而优化。

Abstract: Time event cameras are a novel technology for recording scene information at
extremely low latency and with low power consumption. Event cameras output a
stream of events that encapsulate pixel-level light intensity changes within
the scene, capturing information with a higher dynamic range and temporal
resolution than traditional cameras. This study investigates the contact-free
reconstruction of an individual's cardiac pulse signal from time event
recording of their face using a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN)
model. An end-to-end model is trained to extract the cardiac signal from a
two-dimensional representation of the event stream, with model performance
evaluated based on the accuracy of the calculated heart rate. The experimental
results confirm that physiological cardiac information in the facial region is
effectively preserved within the event stream, showcasing the potential of this
novel sensor for remote heart rate monitoring. The model trained on event
frames achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.32 beats per minute (bpm)
compared to the RMSE of 2.92 bpm achieved by the baseline model trained on
standard camera frames. Furthermore, models trained on event frames generated
at 60 and 120 FPS outperformed the 30 FPS standard camera results, achieving an
RMSE of 2.54 and 2.13 bpm, respectively.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles need a complete map of their surroundings to plan and
act. This has sparked research into the tasks of 3D occupancy prediction, 3D
scene completion, and 3D panoptic scene completion, which predict a dense map
of the ego vehicle's surroundings as a voxel grid. Scene completion extends
occupancy prediction by predicting occluded regions of the voxel grid, and
panoptic scene completion further extends this task by also distinguishing
object instances within the same class; both aspects are crucial for path
planning and decision-making. However, 3D panoptic scene completion is
currently underexplored. This work introduces a novel framework for 3D panoptic
scene completion that extends existing 3D semantic scene completion models. We
propose an Object Module and Panoptic Module that can easily be integrated with
3D occupancy and scene completion methods presented in the literature. Our
approach leverages the available annotations in occupancy benchmarks, allowing
individual object shapes to be learned as a differentiable problem. The code is

Abstract: Cardiac image segmentation is an important step in many cardiac image
analysis and modeling tasks such as motion tracking or simulations of cardiac
mechanics. While deep learning has greatly advanced segmentation in clinical
settings, there is limited work on pre-clinical imaging, notably in porcine
models, which are often used due to their anatomical and physiological
similarity to humans. However, differences between species create a domain
shift that complicates direct model transfer from human to pig data.
  Recently, foundation models trained on large human datasets have shown
promise for robust medical image segmentation; yet their applicability to
porcine data remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can generate sufficiently accurate pseudo-labels for pig
cardiac CT and propose a simple self-training approach to iteratively refine
these labels. Our method requires no manually annotated pig data, relying
instead on iterative updates to improve segmentation quality. We demonstrate
that this self-training process not only enhances segmentation accuracy but
also smooths out temporal inconsistencies across consecutive frames. Although
our results are encouraging, there remains room for improvement, for example by
incorporating more sophisticated self-training strategies and by exploring
additional foundation models and other cardiac imaging technologies.

Abstract: Unifying image understanding and generation has gained growing attention in
recent research on multimodal models. Although design choices for image
understanding have been extensively studied, the optimal model architecture and
training recipe for a unified framework with image generation remain
underexplored. Motivated by the strong potential of autoregressive and
diffusion models for high-quality generation and scalability, we conduct a
comprehensive study of their use in unified multimodal settings, with emphasis
on image representations, modeling objectives, and training strategies.
Grounded in these investigations, we introduce a novel approach that employs a
diffusion transformer to generate semantically rich CLIP image features, in
contrast to conventional VAE-based representations. This design yields both
higher training efficiency and improved generative quality. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that a sequential pretraining strategy for unified models-first
training on image understanding and subsequently on image generation-offers
practical advantages by preserving image understanding capability while
developing strong image generation ability. Finally, we carefully curate a
high-quality instruction-tuning dataset BLIP3o-60k for image generation by
prompting GPT-4o with a diverse set of captions covering various scenes,
objects, human gestures, and more. Building on our innovative model design,
training recipe, and datasets, we develop BLIP3-o, a suite of state-of-the-art
unified multimodal models. BLIP3-o achieves superior performance across most of
the popular benchmarks spanning both image understanding and generation tasks.
To facilitate future research, we fully open-source our models, including code,
model weights, training scripts, and pretraining and instruction tuning
datasets.

Conclusion: SAGE有效解决了图像编辑中的关键挑战，成为当前最优方法。

Abstract: The field of text-to-image generation has undergone significant advancements
with the introduction of diffusion models. Nevertheless, the challenge of
editing real images persists, as most methods are either computationally
intensive or produce poor reconstructions. This paper introduces SAGE
(Self-Attention Guidance for image Editing) - a novel technique leveraging
pre-trained diffusion models for image editing. SAGE builds upon the DDIM
algorithm and incorporates a novel guidance mechanism utilizing the
self-attention layers of the diffusion U-Net. This mechanism computes a
reconstruction objective based on attention maps generated during the inverse
DDIM process, enabling efficient reconstruction of unedited regions without the
need to precisely reconstruct the entire input image. Thus, SAGE directly
addresses the key challenges in image editing. The superiority of SAGE over
other methods is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations
and confirmed by a statistically validated comprehensive user study, in which
all 47 surveyed users preferred SAGE over competing methods. Additionally, SAGE
ranks as the top-performing method in seven out of 10 quantitative analyses and
secures second and third places in the remaining three.

Motivation: 尽管多模态模型在视觉问答（VQA）中取得了显著进展，但其在分布外（OOD）场景中的可靠性和校准性仍存在问题。目前针对单模态模型的研究较多，但多模态模型的可靠性研究较少。

Method: 提出了一种变分VQA方法（IVON），通过生成模型参数的后验分布来替代传统的AdamW微调方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不牺牲AdamW准确性的情况下，显著降低了预期校准误差（超过50%）并提高了覆盖率（4% vs. SOTA）。在分布偏移情况下，性能提升更显著（覆盖率提高8% vs. SOTA）。

Conclusion: 变分学习是提升多模态模型可靠性的一种可行方法。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in multimodal models for Visual Question
Answering (VQA), there remain major reliability concerns because the models can
often be overconfident and miscalibrated, especially in out-of-distribution
(OOD) settings. Plenty has been done to address such issues for unimodal
models, but little work exists for multimodal cases. Here, we address
unreliability in multimodal models by proposing a Variational VQA approach.
Specifically, instead of fine-tuning vision-language models by using AdamW, we
employ a recently proposed variational algorithm called IVON, which yields a
posterior distribution over model parameters. Through extensive experiments, we
show that our approach improves calibration and abstentions without sacrificing
the accuracy of AdamW. For instance, compared to AdamW fine-tuning, we reduce
Expected Calibration Error by more than 50% compared to the AdamW baseline and
raise Coverage by 4% vs. SOTA (for a fixed risk of 1%). In the presence of
distribution shifts, the performance gain is even higher, achieving 8% Coverage
(@ 1% risk) improvement vs. SOTA when 50% of test cases are OOD. Overall, we
present variational learning as a viable option to enhance the reliability of
multimodal models.

Abstract: We present a simple, yet effective diffusion-based method for fine-grained,
parametric control over light sources in an image. Existing relighting methods
either rely on multiple input views to perform inverse rendering at inference
time, or fail to provide explicit control over light changes. Our method
fine-tunes a diffusion model on a small set of real raw photograph pairs,
supplemented by synthetically rendered images at scale, to elicit its
photorealistic prior for relighting. We leverage the linearity of light to
synthesize image pairs depicting controlled light changes of either a target
light source or ambient illumination. Using this data and an appropriate
fine-tuning scheme, we train a model for precise illumination changes with
explicit control over light intensity and color. Lastly, we show how our method
can achieve compelling light editing results, and outperforms existing methods
based on user preference.

Conclusion: UWAV通过改进伪标签生成和训练策略，显著提升了弱监督AVVP任务的性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) entails the challenging task of localizing
both uni-modal events (i.e., those occurring exclusively in either the visual
or acoustic modality of a video) and multi-modal events (i.e., those occurring
in both modalities concurrently). Moreover, the prohibitive cost of annotating
training data with the class labels of all these events, along with their start
and end times, imposes constraints on the scalability of AVVP techniques unless
they can be trained in a weakly-supervised setting, where only
modality-agnostic, video-level labels are available in the training data. To
this end, recently proposed approaches seek to generate segment-level
pseudo-labels to better guide model training. However, the absence of
inter-segment dependencies when generating these pseudo-labels and the general
bias towards predicting labels that are absent in a segment limit their
performance. This work proposes a novel approach towards overcoming these
weaknesses called Uncertainty-weighted Weakly-supervised Audio-visual Video
Parsing (UWAV). Additionally, our innovative approach factors in the

TLDR: 论文分析了RNA语言模型（LMs）在二级结构预测和功能分类中的表现，发现模型在不同任务上的表现不平衡，需更均衡的无监督训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNA LMs在近年来受到关注，但缺乏统一标准进行比较，因此研究旨在评估不同RNA LMs的性能。

Method: 将RNA LMs分为三类（多RNA类型预训练、特定用途RNA、统一RNA与DNA/蛋白质的LMs），并与DNA和蛋白质LMs对比，进行零样本预测任务。

Result: 结果显示，在二级结构预测和功能分类任务中表现优异的模型往往在另一任务上表现较差。

Conclusion: 需要更均衡的无监督训练以提升模型的多任务性能。

Abstract: Given usefulness of protein language models (LMs) in structure and functional
inference, RNA LMs have received increased attentions in the last few years.
However, these RNA models are often not compared against the same standard.
Here, we divided RNA LMs into three classes (pretrained on multiple RNA types
(especially noncoding RNAs), specific-purpose RNAs, and LMs that unify RNA with
DNA or proteins or both) and compared 13 RNA LMs along with 3 DNA and 1 protein
LMs as controls in zero-shot prediction of RNA secondary structure and
functional classification. Results shows that the models doing well on
secondary structure prediction often perform worse in function classification
or vice versa, suggesting that more balanced unsupervised training is needed.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种针对视觉语言模型（VLM）研究的标准化报告协议，强调在医疗等高风险领域需明确报告标准，并提出了分类框架和检查清单以确保研究的一致性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于VLM研究的多样性和复杂性，传统机器学习报告标准无法满足需求，尤其是在医疗等高风险领域，亟需建立清晰的报告标准。

Method: 提出了一种分类框架，将VLM研究分为不同阶段，并针对每类研究制定了详细的报告标准，包括性能评估、数据报告和论文撰写建议。

Result: 设计了一套全面的报告标准和检查清单，旨在提高VLM研究的可重复性和一致性。

Conclusion: 通过标准化报告协议和分类框架，本文为VLM研究提供了实用工具，有助于提升研究质量和社区采纳度。

Abstract: The intricate and multifaceted nature of vision language model (VLM)
development, adaptation, and application necessitates the establishment of
clear and standardized reporting protocols, particularly within the high-stakes
context of healthcare. Defining these reporting standards is inherently
challenging due to the diverse nature of studies involving VLMs, which vary
significantly from the development of all new VLMs or finetuning for domain
alignment to off-the-shelf use of VLM for targeted diagnosis and prediction
tasks. In this position paper, we argue that traditional machine learning
reporting standards and evaluation guidelines must be restructured to
accommodate multiphase VLM studies; it also has to be organized for intuitive
understanding of developers while maintaining rigorous standards for
reproducibility. To facilitate community adoption, we propose a categorization
framework for VLM studies and outline corresponding reporting standards that
comprehensively address performance evaluation, data reporting protocols, and
recommendations for manuscript composition. These guidelines are organized
according to the proposed categorization scheme. Lastly, we present a checklist
that consolidates reporting standards, offering a standardized tool to ensure
consistency and quality in the publication of VLM-related research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能和机器人技术重塑全球劳动力市场，了解公众对这些技术的看法变得至关重要。

Method: 利用2017、2018、2020和2023年的Latinobarómetro调查数据，对16个国家的48,000多名受访者进行统计建模和潜在类别分析。

Result: 教育水平和政治倾向是最一致的预测因素，2018年恐惧情绪显著上升，且不同国家间存在明显差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了新兴经济体中AI焦虑的社会和结构维度，为理解全球南方对自动化的公众态度提供了新视角。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence and robotics increasingly reshape the global labor
market, understanding public perceptions of these technologies becomes
critical. We examine how these perceptions have evolved across Latin America,
using survey data from the 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2023 waves of the
Latinobar\'ometro. Drawing on responses from over 48,000 individuals across 16
countries, we analyze fear of job loss due to artificial intelligence and
robotics. Using statistical modeling and latent class analysis, we identify key
structural and ideological predictors of concern, with education level and
political orientation emerging as the most consistent drivers. Our findings
reveal substantial temporal and cross-country variation, with a notable peak in
fear during 2018 and distinct attitudinal profiles emerging from latent
segmentation. These results offer new insights into the social and structural
dimensions of AI anxiety in emerging economies and contribute to a broader
understanding of public attitudes toward automation beyond the Global North.

Motivation: 网约车司机被平台算法突然停用会导致严重的经济问题，而现有的申诉流程和工资补偿机制缺乏有效工具支持。

Method: 通过与华盛顿州最大的网约车工会合作，设计了FareShare工具，自动化计算停用期间的工资损失。

Result: FareShare工具将工资计算时间减少了95%以上，消除了手动数据输入错误，并提高了法律团队生成仲裁报告的效率。

Conclusion: FareShare工具在提高效率的同时，也揭示了在高风险劳动环境中信任、同意和工具采用的社会技术挑战。

Abstract: What happens when a rideshare driver is suddenly locked out of the platform
connecting them to riders, wages, and daily work? Deactivation-the abrupt
removal of gig workers' platform access-typically occurs through arbitrary AI
and algorithmic decisions with little explanation or recourse. This represents
one of the most severe forms of algorithmic control and often devastates
workers' financial stability. Recent U.S. state policies now mandate appeals
processes and recovering compensation during the period of wrongful
deactivation based on past earnings. Yet, labor organizers still lack effective
tools to support these complex, error-prone workflows. We designed FareShare, a
computational tool automating lost wage estimation for deactivated drivers,
through a 6 month partnership with the State of Washington's largest rideshare
labor union. Over the following 3 months, our field deployment of FareShare
registered 178 account signups. We observed that the tool could reduce lost
wage calculation time by over 95%, eliminate manual data entry errors, and
enable legal teams to generate arbitration-ready reports more efficiently.
Beyond these gains, the deployment also surfaced important socio-technical
challenges around trust, consent, and tool adoption in high-stakes labor
contexts.

Motivation: 在医疗等高风险领域，人工智能模型可能因数据不平衡和人口统计偏差加剧现有不平等。联邦学习虽保护隐私，但仍面临算法偏见和子群不平衡的挑战。

Method: 提出FedIDA，结合公平感知正则化和组条件过采样，支持多敏感属性和异构数据分布，不影响联邦学习的收敛性。

Result: 理论分析证明FedIDA能改善公平性，实验结果表明其在基准和真实临床数据集上均能提升公平性且保持预测性能。

Conclusion: FedIDA在医疗领域实现了公平且隐私保护的建模，代码已开源。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness is critical when applying artificial intelligence to
high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where predictive models trained on
imbalanced and demographically skewed data risk exacerbating existing
disparities. Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaboration
across institutions, but remains vulnerable to both algorithmic bias and
subgroup imbalance - particularly when multiple sensitive attributes intersect.
We propose FedIDA (Fed erated Learning for Imbalance and D isparity A
wareness), a framework-agnostic method that combines fairness-aware
regularization with group-conditional oversampling. FedIDA supports multiple
sensitive attributes and heterogeneous data distributions without altering the
convergence behavior of the underlying FL algorithm. We provide theoretical
analysis establishing fairness improvement bounds using Lipschitz continuity
and concentration inequalities, and show that FedIDA reduces the variance of
fairness metrics across test sets. Empirical results on both benchmark and
real-world clinical datasets confirm that FedIDA consistently improves fairness
while maintaining competitive predictive performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness for equitable and privacy-preserving modeling in healthcare. The
source code is available on GitHub.

Motivation: 研究RLHF技术对生成式AI聊天机器人的影响，特别是其在语言规范、信息搜索和社会关系方面的重塑作用。

Method: 采用修辞分析，尤其是Ian Bogost的程序修辞理论，从内容分析转向RLHF增强的LLMs的底层说服机制。

Result: 揭示了RLHF技术可能强化霸权语言使用、延续偏见、去语境化学习及侵蚀人际关系。

Conclusion: 为AI伦理研究开辟了新方向，对教育者、研究者和生成式AI用户具有重要启示。

Abstract: Since 2022, versions of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude
have been trained using a specialized technique called Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune language model output using feedback
from human annotators. As a result, the integration of RLHF has greatly
enhanced the outputs of these large language models (LLMs) and made the
interactions and responses appear more "human-like" than those of previous
versions using only supervised learning. The increasing convergence of human
and machine-written text has potentially severe ethical, sociotechnical, and
pedagogical implications relating to transparency, trust, bias, and
interpersonal relations. To highlight these implications, this paper presents a
rhetorical analysis of some of the central procedures and processes currently
being reshaped by RLHF-enhanced generative AI chatbots: upholding language
conventions, information seeking practices, and expectations for social
relationships. Rhetorical investigations of generative AI and LLMs have, to
this point, focused largely on the persuasiveness of the content generated.
Using Ian Bogost's concept of procedural rhetoric, this paper shifts the site
of rhetorical investigation from content analysis to the underlying mechanisms
of persuasion built into RLHF-enhanced LLMs. In doing so, this theoretical
investigation opens a new direction for further inquiry in AI ethics that
considers how procedures rerouted through AI-driven technologies might
reinforce hegemonic language use, perpetuate biases, decontextualize learning,
and encroach upon human relationships. It will therefore be of interest to
educators, researchers, scholars, and the growing number of users of generative
AI chatbots.

TLDR: 该论文提出了一个基础设施感知的基准框架，用于量化30种最先进LLM在商业数据中心中的推理环境足迹，揭示了不同模型的能耗差异及其大规模部署的环境影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在各行业的广泛应用，了解其推理阶段的环境足迹变得至关重要，但现有研究多忽略专有模型、基础设施差异或仅关注训练阶段。

Method: 结合公共API性能数据、区域环境乘数和硬件配置统计推断，采用交叉效率数据包络分析（DEA）对模型进行能效排名。

Result: 研究发现o3和DeepSeek-R1能耗最高，Claude-3.7 Sonnet能效最佳；GPT-4o单次查询能耗虽低，但大规模部署仍导致显著环境影响。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM部署的可持续性提供了标准化评估方法，为未来AI开发的环境责任和可持续标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) spread across industries, understanding their
environmental footprint at the inference level is no longer optional; it is
essential. However, most existing studies exclude proprietary models, overlook
infrastructural variability and overhead, or focus solely on training, even as
inference increasingly dominates AI's environmental impact. To bridge this gap,
this paper introduces a novel infrastructure-aware benchmarking framework for
quantifying the environmental footprint of LLM inference across 30
state-of-the-art models as deployed in commercial data centers. Our framework
combines public API performance data with region-specific environmental
multipliers and statistical inference of hardware configurations. We
additionally utilize cross-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank
models by performance relative to environmental cost. Our results show that o3
and DeepSeek-R1 emerge as the most energy-intensive models, consuming over 33
Wh per long prompt, more than 70 times the consumption of GPT-4.1 nano, and
that Claude-3.7 Sonnet ranks highest in eco-efficiency. While a single short
GPT-4o query consumes 0.43 Wh, scaling this to 700 million queries/day results
in substantial annual environmental impacts. These include electricity use
comparable to 35,000 U.S. homes, freshwater evaporation matching the annual
drinking needs of 1.2 million people, and carbon emissions requiring a
Chicago-sized forest to offset. These findings illustrate a growing paradox:
although individual queries are efficient, their global scale drives
disproportionate resource consumption. Our study provides a standardized,
empirically grounded methodology for benchmarking the sustainability of LLM
deployments, laying a foundation for future environmental accountability in AI
development and sustainability standards.

Motivation: 工业灾难（如博帕尔灾难和阿利索峡谷气体泄漏）凸显了快速可靠的羽流追踪算法的紧迫性，传统方法在湍流条件下效果不佳。

Method: 采用部分可观察马尔可夫博弈（POMG）建模，结合LSTM和ADDRQN网络，利用历史动作-观察序列近似潜在状态，并在高斯羽流模型（GPM）模拟环境中验证。

Result: 算法仅需探索环境的1.29%即可成功定位污染源，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂、部分可观察环境中表现出色，为污染源定位提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial catastrophes like the Bhopal disaster (1984) and the Aliso Canyon
gas leak (2015) demonstrate the urgent need for rapid and reliable plume
tracing algorithms to protect public health and the environment. Traditional
methods, such as gradient-based or biologically inspired approaches, often fail
in realistic, turbulent conditions. To address these challenges, we present a
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm designed for localizing
multiple airborne pollution sources using a swarm of small uncrewed aerial
systems (sUAS). Our method models the problem as a Partially Observable Markov
Game (POMG), employing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Action-specific
Double Deep Recurrent Q-Network (ADDRQN) that uses full sequences of historical
action-observation pairs, effectively approximating latent states. Unlike prior
work, we use a general-purpose simulation environment based on the Gaussian
Plume Model (GPM), incorporating realistic elements such as a three-dimensional
environment, sensor noise, multiple interacting agents, and multiple plume
sources. The incorporation of action histories as part of the inputs further
enhances the adaptability of our model in complex, partially observable
environments. Extensive simulations show that our algorithm significantly
outperforms conventional approaches. Specifically, our model allows agents to
explore only 1.29\% of the environment to successfully locate pollution
sources.

Method: 框架结合了基于向量相似性搜索的实体检索、LLM生成的Cypher查询、成对重排序等技术，利用LLM提取关系事实和实体属性，并通过节点集连接和向量相似性搜索优化候选答案。

Result: 在STaRK基准测试的三个数据集上，FocusedRetriever的平均首次命中率比次优方法高出25.7%。

Conclusion: FocusedRetriever展示了SKB在多跳问答中的潜力，并为进一步优化（如微调）提供了机会。源代码已公开。

Abstract: In many real-world settings, machine learning models and interactive systems
have access to both structured knowledge, e.g., knowledge graphs or tables, and
unstructured content, e.g., natural language documents. However, most rely on
either. Semi-Structured Knowledge Bases (SKBs) bridge this gap by linking
unstructured content to nodes within structured data, thereby enabling new
strategies for knowledge access and use. In this work, we present
FocusedRetriever, a modular SKB-based framework for multi-hop question
answering. It integrates components (VSS-based entity search, LLM-based
generation of Cypher queries and pairwise re-ranking) in a way that enables it
to outperform state-of-the-art methods across all three STaRK benchmark test
sets, covering diverse domains and multiple performance metrics. The average
first-hit rate exceeds that of the second-best method by 25.7%.
FocusedRetriever leverages (1) the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
extract relational facts and entity attributes from unstructured text, (2) node
set joins to filter answer candidates based on these extracted triplets and
constraints, (3) vector similarity search to retrieve and rank relevant
unstructured content, and (4) the contextual capabilities of LLMs to finally
rank the top-k answers. For generality, we only incorporate base LLMs in
FocusedRetriever in our evaluation. However, our analysis of intermediate
results highlights several opportunities for further upgrades including
finetuning. The source code is publicly available at

Abstract: Countless new machine learning models are published every year and are
reported to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in \emph{top-n}
recommendation. However, earlier reproducibility studies indicate that progress
in this area may be quite limited. Specifically, various widespread
methodological issues, e.g., comparisons with untuned baseline models, have led
to an \emph{illusion of progress}. In this work, our goal is to examine whether
these problems persist in today's research. To this end, we aim to reproduce
the latest advancements reported from applying modern Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models to recommender systems, focusing on four models published
at the top-ranked SIGIR conference in 2023 and 2024. Our findings are
concerning, revealing persistent methodological problems. Alarmingly, through
experiments, we find that the latest recommendation techniques based on
diffusion models, despite their computational complexity and substantial carbon
footprint, are consistently outperformed by simpler existing models.
Furthermore, we identify key mismatches between the characteristics of
diffusion models and those of the traditional \emph{top-n} recommendation task,
raising doubts about their suitability for recommendation. We also note that,
in the papers we analyze, the generative capabilities of these models are
constrained to a minimum. Overall, our results and continued methodological
issues call for greater scientific rigor and a disruptive change in the
research and publication culture in this area.

TLDR: 论文介绍了EDBench，一个大规模、高质量的电子密度数据集，旨在推动基于电子尺度的学习研究，并展示了其在高精度计算和降低计算成本方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子机器学习力场（MLFFs）通常忽略电子密度（ED）的重要性，而ED对准确理解分子力场至关重要。传统ED计算依赖耗时的一阶原理密度泛函理论（DFT），导致缺乏大规模ED数据。

Method: 基于PCQM4Mv2构建EDBench数据集，包含330万分子的精确ED数据，并设计了一套以ED为中心的基准任务（预测、检索和生成）。

Result: 评估表明，基于EDBench的学习不仅可行，还能实现高精度。学习型方法能高效计算ED，精度与传统DFT相当，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: EDBench为电子密度驱动的药物发现和材料科学奠定了坚实基础，所有数据和基准将免费提供。

Abstract: Existing molecular machine learning force fields (MLFFs) generally focus on
the learning of atoms, molecules, and simple quantum chemical properties (such
as energy and force), but ignore the importance of electron density (ED)
$\rho(r)$ in accurately understanding molecular force fields (MFFs). ED
describes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around
atoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such
as energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems
according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies
on the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which
leads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs.
In this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED
designed to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon
the PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million
molecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and
utilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks
spanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several
state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only
feasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based
method can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while
significantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT
calculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available,
laying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.

Main category: cs.DC

TLDR: ELIS是一个用于大型语言模型（LLM）的服务系统，采用迭代最短剩余时间优先（ISRTF）调度器，通过预测剩余令牌数优化任务调度，解决传统FCFS策略的“队头阻塞”问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统采用FCFS调度策略，易导致“队头阻塞”，需通过预测推理时间并应用最短作业优先策略来优化。

Method: ELIS使用BGE模型训练响应长度预测器，并设计ISRTF调度策略，结合LLM迭代批处理优化。

Result: 实验表明，ISRTF将平均任务完成时间降低19.6%。

Conclusion: ELIS通过ISRTF调度器和BGE预测器，显著提升了LLM服务效率。

Abstract: We propose ELIS, a serving system for Large Language Models (LLMs) featuring
an Iterative Shortest Remaining Time First (ISRTF) scheduler designed to
efficiently manage inference tasks with the shortest remaining tokens. Current
LLM serving systems often employ a first-come-first-served scheduling strategy,
which can lead to the "head-of-line blocking" problem. To overcome this
limitation, it is necessary to predict LLM inference times and apply a shortest
job first scheduling strategy. However, due to the auto-regressive nature of
LLMs, predicting the inference latency is challenging. ELIS addresses this
challenge by training a response length predictor for LLMs using the BGE model,
an encoder-based state-of-the-art model. Additionally, we have devised the
ISRTF scheduling strategy, an optimization of shortest remaining time first
tailored to existing LLM iteration batching. To evaluate our work in an
industrial setting, we simulate streams of requests based on our study of

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has unveiled critical
limitations in current hardware architectures, including constraints in memory
capacity, computational efficiency, and interconnection bandwidth. DeepSeek-V3,
trained on 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs, demonstrates how hardware-aware model
co-design can effectively address these challenges, enabling cost-efficient

the DeepSeek-V3/R1 model architecture and its AI infrastructure, highlighting
key innovations such as Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) for enhanced memory
efficiency, Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures for optimized
computation-communication trade-offs, FP8 mixed-precision training to unlock
the full potential of hardware capabilities, and a Multi-Plane Network Topology
to minimize cluster-level network overhead. Building on the hardware
bottlenecks encountered during DeepSeek-V3's development, we engage in a
broader discussion with academic and industry peers on potential future
hardware directions, including precise low-precision computation units,
scale-up and scale-out convergence, and innovations in low-latency
communication fabrics. These insights underscore the critical role of hardware
and model co-design in meeting the escalating demands of AI workloads, offering
a practical blueprint for innovation in next-generation AI systems.

Motivation: 研究动机源于VHDL在行业中的持续流行及其在高性能处理器设计中的重要性，但现有LLMs对VHDL的关注不足。

Method: 通过扩展预训练（EPT）和专家评估开发专门用于VHDL代码解释的LLM，并引入LLM-as-a-judge方法评估模型性能。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in hardware design has taken off in
recent years, principally through its incorporation in tools that increase chip
designer productivity. There has been considerable discussion about the use of
LLMs in RTL specifications of chip designs, for which the two most popular
languages are Verilog and VHDL. LLMs and their use in Verilog design has
received significant attention due to the higher popularity of the language,
but little attention so far has been given to VHDL despite its continued
popularity in the industry. There has also been little discussion about the
unique needs of organizations that engage in high-performance processor design,
and techniques to deploy AI solutions in these settings. In this paper, we
describe our journey in developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically
for the purpose of explaining VHDL code, a task that has particular importance
in an organization with decades of experience and assets in high-performance
processor design. We show how we developed test sets specific to our needs and
used them for evaluating models as we performed extended pretraining (EPT) of a
base LLM. Expert evaluation of the code explanations produced by the EPT model
increased to 69% compared to a base model rating of 43%. We further show how we
developed an LLM-as-a-judge to gauge models similar to expert evaluators. This
led us to deriving and evaluating a host of new models, including an
instruction-tuned version of the EPT model with an expected expert evaluator
rating of 71%. Our experiments also indicate that with the potential use of
newer base models, this rating can be pushed to 85% and beyond. We conclude
with a discussion on further improving the quality of hardware design LLMs
using exciting new developments in the Generative AI world.

Abstract: This paper describes an approach to improve code comments along different

grounded theory qualitative analysis to determine the quality axes to improve.
Then we propose a procedure using a Large Language Model (LLM) to rewrite
existing code comments along the quality axes. We implement our procedure using
GPT-4o, then distil the results into a smaller model capable of being run
in-house, so users can maintain data custody. We evaluate both our approach
using GPT-4o and the distilled model versions. We show in an evaluation how our
procedure improves code comments along the quality axes. We release all data
and source code in an online repository for reproducibility.

Abstract: We introduce WebApp1K, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) in test-driven development (TDD) tasks, where test cases serve as both
prompt and verification for code generation. Unlike traditional approaches
relying on natural language prompts, our benchmark emphasizes the ability of
LLMs to interpret and implement functionality directly from test cases,
reflecting real-world software development practices. Comprising 1000 diverse
challenges across 20 application domains, the benchmark evaluates LLMs on their
ability to generate compact, functional code under the constraints of context
length and multi-feature complexity. Our findings highlight instruction
following and in-context learning as critical capabilities for TDD success,

knowledge. Through comprehensive evaluation of 19 frontier models, we reveal
performance bottlenecks, such as instruction loss in long prompts, and provide
a detailed error analysis spanning multiple root causes. This work underscores
the practical value of TDD-specific benchmarks and lays the foundation for
advancing LLM capabilities in rigorous, application-driven coding scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码摘要生成方法通常只生成单一摘要，无法满足用户对多样选择的需求。

Result: 实验证明VPT方法在多样性和准确性上表现优异，且适用于多种预训练模型。

Conclusion: VPT是一种高效且灵活的方法，能够生成多样且高质量的代码摘要，满足用户需求。

Abstract: Recent advancements in source code summarization have leveraged
transformer-based pre-trained models, including Large Language Models of Code
(LLMCs), to automate and improve the generation of code summaries. However,
existing methods often focus on generating a single high-quality summary for a
given source code, neglecting scenarios where the generated summary might be
inadequate and alternative options are needed. In this paper, we introduce
Variational Prefix Tuning (VPT), a novel approach that enhances pre-trained
models' ability to generate diverse yet accurate sets of summaries, allowing
the user to choose the most suitable one for the given source code. Our method
integrates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) framework as a modular
component into pre-trained models, enabling us to model the distribution of
observed target summaries and sample continuous embeddings to be used as
prefixes to steer the generation of diverse outputs during decoding.
Importantly, we construct our method in a parameter-efficient manner,
eliminating the need for expensive model retraining, especially when using
LLMCs. Furthermore, we employ a bi-criteria reranking method to select a subset
of generated summaries, optimizing both the diversity and the accuracy of the
options presented to users. We present extensive experimental evaluations using
widely used datasets and current state-of-the-art pre-trained code
summarization models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its
adaptability across models.

Conclusion: 提出的方法高效且精确，为肺段重建提供了新工具，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: High-quality 3D reconstruction of pulmonary segments plays a crucial role in
segmentectomy and surgical treatment planning for lung cancer. Due to the
resolution requirement of the target reconstruction, conventional deep
learning-based methods often suffer from computational resource constraints or
limited granularity. Conversely, implicit modeling is favored due to its
computational efficiency and continuous representation at any resolution. We
propose a neural implicit function-based method to learn a 3D surface to
achieve anatomy-aware, precise pulmonary segment reconstruction, represented as
a shape by deforming a learnable template. Additionally, we introduce two
clinically relevant evaluation metrics to assess the reconstruction
comprehensively. Further, due to the absence of publicly available shape
datasets to benchmark reconstruction algorithms, we developed a shape dataset
named Lung3D, including the 3D models of 800 labeled pulmonary segments and the
corresponding airways, arteries, veins, and intersegmental veins. We
demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, providing
a new perspective for pulmonary segment reconstruction. Code and data will be
available at https://github.com/M3DV/ImPulSe.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have advanced image editing with high-quality
results and intuitive interfaces such as prompts and semantic drawing. However,
these interfaces lack precise control, and the associated methods typically
specialize on a single editing task. We introduce a versatile, generative
workflow that operates in an intrinsic-image latent space, enabling semantic,
local manipulation with pixel precision for a range of editing operations.
Building atop the RGB-X diffusion framework, we address key challenges of
identity preservation and intrinsic-channel entanglement. By incorporating
exact diffusion inversion and disentangled channel manipulation, we enable
precise, efficient editing with automatic resolution of global illumination
effects -- all without additional data collection or model fine-tuning. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks on complex
images, including color and texture adjustments, object insertion and removal,
global relighting, and their combinations.

Abstract: Neural bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) have emerged
as popular material representations for enhancing realism in physically-based
rendering. Yet their importance sampling remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a reparameterization-based formulation of neural BRDF
importance sampling that seamlessly integrates into the standard rendering
pipeline with precise generation of BRDF samples. The reparameterization-based
formulation transfers the distribution learning task to a problem of
identifying BRDF integral substitutions. In contrast to previous methods that
rely on invertible networks and multi-step inference to reconstruct BRDF
distributions, our model removes these constraints, which offers greater
flexibility and efficiency. Our variance and performance analysis demonstrates
that our reparameterization method achieves the best variance reduction in
neural BRDF renderings while maintaining high inference speeds compared to
existing baselines.

Abstract: Sparse wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) have gained popularity for
estimating 3D human motion. However, challenges such as pose ambiguity, data
drift, and limited adaptability to diverse bodies persist. To address these
issues, we propose UMotion, an uncertainty-driven, online fusing-all state
estimation framework for 3D human shape and pose estimation, supported by six
integrated, body-worn ultra-wideband (UWB) distance sensors with IMUs. UWB
sensors measure inter-node distances to infer spatial relationships, aiding in
resolving pose ambiguities and body shape variations when combined with
anthropometric data. Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors
are affected by body occlusions. Consequently, we develop a tightly coupled
Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework that fuses uncertainties from sensor
data and estimated human motion based on individual body shape. The UKF
iteratively refines IMU and UWB measurements by aligning them with uncertain
human motion constraints in real-time, producing optimal estimates for each.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of UMotion in stabilizing sensor data and the improvement over
state of the art in pose accuracy.

Result: 提出了针对不同特征关系的封闭形式下界，并通过实验验证框架的实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架在理论和实践中均有效，适用于敏感特征推断的对抗评估。

Abstract: We propose an adversarial evaluation framework for sensitive feature
inference based on minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation with a finite
sample size and linear predictive models. Our approach establishes theoretical
lower bounds on the true MMSE of inferring sensitive features from noisy
observations of other correlated features. These bounds are expressed in terms
of the empirical MMSE under a restricted hypothesis class and a non-negative
error term. The error term captures both the estimation error due to finite
number of samples and the approximation error from using a restricted
hypothesis class. For linear predictive models, we derive closed-form bounds,
which are order optimal in terms of the noise variance, on the approximation
error for several classes of relationships between the sensitive and
non-sensitive features, including linear mappings, binary symmetric channels,
and class-conditional multi-variate Gaussian distributions. We also present a
new lower bound that relies on the MSE computed on a hold-out validation
dataset of the MMSE estimator learned on finite-samples and a restricted
hypothesis class. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our
framework serves as an effective tool for MMSE-based adversarial evaluation of
sensitive feature inference that balances theoretical guarantees with practical
efficiency.

Abstract: This work examines risk bounds for nonparametric distributional regression

bounds are established for the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and
the worst-case mean squared error (MSE) across the domain. These theoretical
results are applied to isotonic and trend filtering distributional regression,
yielding convergence rates consistent with those for mean estimation.
Furthermore, a general upper bound is derived for distributional regression

network-based estimators. Comprehensive experiments on both simulated and real

effectiveness.

Abstract: We study online learning of feedforward neural networks with the sign
activation function that implement functions from the unit ball in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ to a finite label set $\{1, \ldots, Y\}$.
  First, we characterize a margin condition that is sufficient and in some
cases necessary for online learnability of a neural network: Every neuron in
the first hidden layer classifies all instances with some margin $\gamma$
bounded away from zero. Quantitatively, we prove that for any net, the optimal
mistake bound is at most approximately $\mathtt{TS}(d,\gamma)$, which is the
$(d,\gamma)$-totally-separable-packing number, a more restricted variation of
the standard $(d,\gamma)$-packing number. We complement this result by
constructing a net on which any learner makes $\mathtt{TS}(d,\gamma)$ many
mistakes. We also give a quantitative lower bound of approximately
$\mathtt{TS}(d,\gamma) \geq \max\{1/(\gamma \sqrt{d})^d, d\}$ when $\gamma \geq
1/2$, implying that for some nets and input sequences every learner will err
for $\exp(d)$ many times, and that a dimension-free mistake bound is almost
always impossible.
  To remedy this inevitable dependence on $d$, it is natural to seek additional
natural restrictions to be placed on the network, so that the dependence on $d$
is removed. We study two such restrictions. The first is the multi-index model,
in which the function computed by the net depends only on $k \ll d$ orthonormal
directions. We prove a mistake bound of approximately $(1.5/\gamma)^{k + 2}$ in
this model. The second is the extended margin assumption. In this setting, we
assume that all neurons (in all layers) in the network classify every ingoing
input from previous layer with margin $\gamma$ bounded away from zero. In this
model, we prove a mistake bound of approximately $(\log Y)/ \gamma^{O(L)}$,
where L is the depth of the network.

Conclusion: 该方法在目标域数据稀疏时特别有效，为基于OT的几何变换模型适应提供了理论和实践见解。

Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) has proven effective for domain adaptation (DA) by
aligning distributions across domains with differing statistical properties.
Building on the approach of Courty et al. (2016), who mapped source data to the
target domain for improved model transfer, we focus on a supervised DA problem
involving linear regression models under rotational shifts. This ongoing work
considers cases where source and target domains are related by a
rotation-common in applications like sensor calibration or image orientation.
We show that in $\mathbb{R}^2$ , when using a p-norm cost with $p $\ge$ 2$, the
optimal transport map recovers the underlying rotation. Based on this, we
propose an algorithm that combines K-means clustering, OT, and singular value
decomposition (SVD) to estimate the rotation angle and adapt the regression
model. This method is particularly effective when the target domain is sparsely
sampled, leveraging abundant source data for improved generalization. Our
contributions offer both theoretical and practical insights into OT-based model
adaptation under geometric transformations.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has become a central topic in machine learning, and
mitigating disparities across different subpopulations has emerged as a rapidly
growing research area. In this paper, we systematically study the
classification of functional data under fairness constraints, ensuring the
disparity level of the classifier is controlled below a pre-specified
threshold. We propose a unified framework for fairness-aware functional
classification, tackling an infinite-dimensional functional space, addressing
key challenges from the absence of density ratios and intractability of
posterior probabilities, and discussing unique phenomena in functional
classification. We further design a post-processing algorithm, Fair Functional
Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier (Fair-FLDA), which targets at
homoscedastic Gaussian processes and achieves fairness via group-wise
thresholding. Under weak structural assumptions on eigenspace, theoretical
guarantees on fairness and excess risk controls are established. As a
byproduct, our results cover the excess risk control of the standard FLDA as a
special case, which, to the best of our knowledge, is first time seen. Our
theoretical findings are complemented by extensive numerical experiments on
synthetic and real datasets, highlighting the practicality of our designed
algorithm.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find optimal policies in dynamic
environments in order to maximize the expected total rewards by leveraging
pre-collected data. Learning from heterogeneous data is one of the fundamental
challenges in offline RL. Traditional methods focus on learning an optimal
policy for all individuals with pre-collected data from a single episode or
homogeneous batch episodes, and thus, may result in a suboptimal policy for a
heterogeneous population. In this paper, we propose an individualized offline
policy optimization framework for heterogeneous time-stationary Markov decision
processes (MDPs). The proposed heterogeneous model with individual latent
variables enables us to efficiently estimate the individual Q-functions, and
our Penalized Pessimistic Personalized Policy Learning (P4L) algorithm
guarantees a fast rate on the average regret under a weak partial coverage
assumption on behavior policies. In addition, our simulation studies and a real
data application demonstrate the superior numerical performance of the proposed
method compared with existing methods.

Conclusion: Deep-SITAR为生长轨迹预测提供了高效且可解释的方法，结合了深度学习和传统模型的优势。

Abstract: Several approaches have been developed to capture the complexity and
nonlinearity of human growth. One widely used is the Super Imposition by
Translation and Rotation (SITAR) model, which has become popular in studies of
adolescent growth. SITAR is a shape-invariant mixed-effects model that
represents the shared growth pattern of a population using a natural cubic
spline mean curve while incorporating three subject-specific random effects --
timing, size, and growth intensity -- to account for variations among
individuals. In this work, we introduce a supervised deep learning framework
based on an autoencoder architecture that integrates a deep neural network
(neural network) with a B-spline model to estimate the SITAR model. In this
approach, the encoder estimates the random effects for each individual, while
the decoder performs a fitting based on B-splines similar to the classic SITAR
model. We refer to this method as the Deep-SITAR model. This innovative
approach enables the prediction of the random effects of new individuals
entering a population without requiring a full model re-estimation. As a
result, Deep-SITAR offers a powerful approach to predicting growth
trajectories, combining the flexibility and efficiency of deep learning with
the interpretability of traditional mixed-effects models.

### [209] [Adaptively-weighted Nearest Neighbors for Matrix Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09612)
*Tathagata Sadhukhan,Manit Paul,Raaz Dwivedi*

Main category: stat.ML

TLDR: AWNN是一种自适应加权的最近邻方法，用于矩阵补全，解决了传统最近邻方法中半径和权重选择缺乏系统性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最近邻方法在缺失数据问题中广泛应用，但其性能依赖于半径和权重的选择，缺乏系统性方法。AWNN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: AWNN通过平衡加权最近邻回归中的偏差-方差权衡，自适应选择半径和权重，无需依赖交叉验证。

Result: 理论分析和合成实验验证了AWNN在最小假设下的有效性。

Conclusion: AWNN提供了一种无需交叉验证的系统性方法，改进了传统最近邻方法的性能。

Abstract: In this technical note, we introduce and analyze AWNN: an adaptively weighted
nearest neighbor method for performing matrix completion. Nearest neighbor (NN)
methods are widely used in missing data problems across multiple disciplines
such as in recommender systems and for performing counterfactual inference in
panel data settings. Prior works have shown that in addition to being very
intuitive and easy to implement, NN methods enjoy nice theoretical guarantees.
However, the performance of majority of the NN methods rely on the appropriate
choice of the radii and the weights assigned to each member in the nearest
neighbor set and despite several works on nearest neighbor methods in the past
two decades, there does not exist a systematic approach of choosing the radii
and the weights without relying on methods like cross-validation. AWNN
addresses this challenge by judiciously balancing the bias variance trade off
inherent in weighted nearest-neighbor regression. We provide theoretical
guarantees for the proposed method under minimal assumptions and support the
theory via synthetic experiments.

*Domniki Ladopoulou,Dat Minh Hong,Petros Dellaportas*

Main category: stat.AP

TLDR: 提出了一种基于非平稳高斯过程（GP）和广义谱混合（GSM）核的风电功率概率预测方法，显著优于传统方法，尤其在短期预测中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电功率的概率预测对电网稳定和可再生能源高效整合至关重要，但传统基于平稳核的高斯过程方法无法有效建模风电数据的非平稳特性。

Method: 采用非平稳高斯过程框架，结合广义谱混合（GSM）核，以捕捉风速和风电功率的时变模式和异方差行为。

Result: 在真实SCADA数据上验证，GSM核模型在短、中、长期预测中均优于传统径向基函数和谱混合核方法，短期预测效果尤为显著。

Conclusion: 非平稳性建模对风电功率预测至关重要，非平稳高斯过程模型在实际应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Accurate probabilistic forecasting of wind power is essential for maintaining
grid stability and enabling efficient integration of renewable energy sources.
Gaussian Process (GP) models offer a principled framework for quantifying
uncertainty; however, conventional approaches rely on stationary kernels, which
are inadequate for modeling the inherently non-stationary nature of wind speed
and power output. We propose a non-stationary GP framework that incorporates
the generalized spectral mixture (GSM) kernel, enabling the model to capture
time-varying patterns and heteroscedastic behaviors in wind speed and wind
power data. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on real-world
SCADA data across short\mbox{-,} medium-, and long-term forecasting horizons.
Compared to standard radial basis function and spectral mixture kernels, the
GSM-based model outperforms, particularly in short-term forecasts. These
results highlight the necessity of modeling non-stationarity in wind power
forecasting and demonstrate the practical value of non-stationary GP models in
operational settings.

### [211] [A New Tractable Description Logic under Categorical Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08916)
*Chan Le Duc,Ludovic Brieulle*

Main category: cs.LO

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的扩展EL逻辑的方法，通过引入弱化否定，以在保持可处理性的同时表示负知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学本体中常使用负知识（如lacks_part、absence_of），但现有逻辑构造器无法直接解释这些概念为否定形式。扩展EL逻辑以支持负知识并保持可处理性是研究动机。

Method: 引入SH逻辑的范畴语义，识别并弱化导致不可处理性的独立范畴属性，从而保留可处理性。

Result: 提出的弱化语义逻辑比带有底部概念、传递角色和角色包含的EL更具表达力。

Conclusion: 通过弱化语义，成功扩展了EL逻辑以支持负知识，同时保持了可处理性。

Abstract: Biomedical ontologies contain numerous concept or role names involving
negative knowledge such as lacks_part, absence_of. Such a representation with
labels rather than logical constructors would not allow a reasoner to interpret
lacks_part as a kind of negation of has_part. It is known that adding negation
to the tractable Description Logic (DL) EL allowing for conjunction,
existential restriction and concept inclusion makes it intractable since the
obtained logic includes implicitly disjunction and universal restriction which
interact with other constructors. In this paper, we propose a new extension of
EL with a weakened negation allowing to represent negative knowledge while
retaining tractability. To this end, we introduce categorical semantics of all
logical constructors of the DL SH including EL with disjunction, negation,
universal restriction, role inclusion and transitive roles. The categorical
semantics of a logical constructor is usually described as a set of categorical
properties referring to several objects without using set membership. To
restore tractability, we have to weaken semantics of disjunction and universal
restriction by identifying \emph{independent} categorical properties that are
responsible for intractability, and dropping them from the set of categorical
properties. We show that the logic resulting from weakening semantics is more
expressive than EL with the bottom concept, transitive roles and role
inclusion.

Main category: math.ST

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的下界方法，用于描述Neyman-Pearson区域的边界，并通过$f$-散度改进现有结果，如Pinsker不等式。同时，给出了基于Chernoff系数的上界，并提供了构建分布对的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Neyman-Pearson区域的边界特性，改进现有边界估计方法，并探索其实际应用。

Method: 利用$f$-散度建立下界，分析KL散度的改进效果，并通过Chernoff系数推导上界。同时提出构建分布对的方法。

Result: 证明了$f$-散度下界的最优性，改进了Pinsker不等式，并给出了封闭形式的上界。

Conclusion: 论文为Neyman-Pearson边界提供了新的理论工具和实用方法，扩展了其在假设检验中的应用。

Abstract: The Neyman-Pearson region of a simple binary hypothesis testing is the set of
points whose coordinates represent the false positive rate and false negative
rate of some test. The lower boundary of this region is given by the
Neyman-Pearson lemma, and is up to a coordinate change, equivalent to the
optimal ROC curve. We establish a novel lower bound for the boundary in terms
of any $f$-divergence. Since the bound generated by hockey-stick
$f$-divergences characterizes the Neyman-Pearson boundary, this bound is best
possible. In the case of KL divergence, this bound improves Pinsker's
inequality. Furthermore, we obtain a closed-form refined upper bound for the
Neyman-Pearson boundary in terms of the Chernoff $\alpha$-coefficient. Finally,
we present methods for constructing pairs of distributions that can
approximately or exactly realize any given Neyman-Pearson boundary.

*Benedikt Koch,Kosuke Imai*

Main category: math.ST

TLDR: 论文扩展了经典统计决策理论，引入反事实损失以评估决策质量，解决了仅依赖观察结果的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典决策理论仅基于观察结果评估决策，无法衡量决策相对于可行替代方案的质量。

Method: 通过引入反事实损失，扩展标准决策理论，并在强可忽略性假设下识别反事实风险。

Result: 反事实风险在反事实损失函数对潜在结果可加时是可识别的，且在多治疗选项下可能产生不同推荐。

Conclusion: 反事实损失扩展了决策评估的维度，为复杂决策问题提供了新视角。

Abstract: Classical statistical decision theory evaluates treatment choices based
solely on observed outcomes. However, by ignoring counterfactual outcomes, it
cannot assess the quality of decisions relative to feasible alternatives. For
example, the quality of a physician's decision may depend not only on patient
survival, but also on whether a less invasive treatment could have produced a
similar result. To address this limitation, we extend standard decision theory
to incorporate counterfactual losses--criteria that evaluate decisions using
all potential outcomes. The central challenge in this generalization is
identification: because only one potential outcome is observed for each unit,
the associated risk under a counterfactual loss is generally not identifiable.
We show that under the assumption of strong ignorability, a counterfactual risk
is identifiable if and only if the counterfactual loss function is additive in
the potential outcomes. Moreover, we demonstrate that additive counterfactual
losses can yield treatment recommendations that differ from those based on
standard loss functions, provided that the decision problem involves more than
two treatment options.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在间接观测和信道传输限制下的统计均值估计问题，以优化估计精度。

Method: 采用大偏差机制下的极小极大估计误差方法，针对伯努利源和二进制对称信道，后推广至亚高斯、重尾分布及任意离散无记忆信道。

Result: 在广泛参数范围内，提出的方法实现了最优误差指数，而两种基线方法表现次优。

Conclusion: 间接观测和信道传输下的统计均值估计问题可通过优化方法实现更优性能。

Abstract: We consider a problem of statistical mean estimation in which the samples are
not observed directly, but are instead observed by a relay (``teacher'') that
transmits information through a memoryless channel to the decoder
(``student''), who then produces the final estimate. We consider the minimax
estimation error in the large deviations regime, and establish achievable error
exponents that are tight in broad regimes of the estimation accuracy and
channel quality. In contrast, two natural baseline methods are shown to yield
strictly suboptimal error exponents. We initially focus on Bernoulli sources
and binary symmetric channels, and then generalize to sub-Gaussian and
heavy-tailed settings along with arbitrary discrete memoryless channels.

TLDR: 论文比较了多种基于Transformer的架构在血糖预测中的表现，发现Patch-wise方法在短期和长期预测中均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过精准的血糖预测，可以为1型糖尿病治疗提供个性化干预措施，如胰岛素和饮食调整。

Method: 使用公开数据集DCLP3和OhioT1DM，比较了点状、块状、序列状和混合嵌入的Transformer模型，评估其在多时间范围内的血糖预测表现。

Result: Crossformer在30分钟预测中表现最佳（RMSE 15.6 mg/dL），PatchTST在长期预测（1h、2h、4h）中表现最优（RMSE分别为24.6、36.1、46.5 mg/dL）。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的架构，尤其是块状嵌入方法，能够有效捕捉多变量时间序列数据的季节性模式，显著提升血糖预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate blood glucose prediction can enable novel interventions for type 1
diabetes treatment, including personalized insulin and dietary adjustments.
Although recent advances in transformer-based architectures have demonstrated
the power of attention mechanisms in complex multivariate time series
prediction, their potential for blood glucose (BG) prediction remains
underexplored. We present a comparative analysis of transformer models for
multi-horizon BG prediction, examining forecasts up to 4 hours and input
history up to 1 week. The publicly available DCLP3 dataset (n=112) was split
(80%-10%-10%) for training, validation, and testing, and the OhioT1DM dataset
(n=12) served as an external test set. We trained networks with point-wise,
patch-wise, series-wise, and hybrid embeddings, using CGM, insulin, and meal
data. For short-term blood glucose prediction, Crossformer, a patch-wise
transformer architecture, achieved a superior 30-minute prediction of RMSE
(15.6 mg / dL on OhioT1DM). For longer-term predictions (1h, 2h, and 4h),
PatchTST, another path-wise transformer, prevailed with the lowest RMSE (24.6
mg/dL, 36.1 mg/dL, and 46.5 mg/dL on OhioT1DM). In general, models that used
tokenization through patches demonstrated improved accuracy with larger input
sizes, with the best results obtained with a one-week history. These findings
highlight the promise of transformer-based architectures for BG prediction by
capturing and leveraging seasonal patterns in multivariate time-series data to
improve accuracy.

*Gaurav Koley*

Main category: cs.SI

TLDR: SALM框架通过语言模型（LMs）提升社交网络模拟的稳定性，实现长期动态建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的代理建模（ABM）无法捕捉社交互动的细微动态，需要更灵活的上下文理解能力。

Method: 提出SALM框架，包括分层提示架构、基于注意力的记忆系统和人格稳定性边界。

Result: 实现4000时间步以上的稳定模拟，减少73%的token使用，记忆系统缓存命中率达80%。

Conclusion: SALM是首个能长期建模社交现象并保持行为保真度的LLM框架。

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to agent-based modeling (ABM) of social systems have
traditionally emphasized rule-based behaviors, limiting their ability to
capture nuanced dynamics by moving beyond predefined rules and leveraging
contextual understanding from LMs of human social interaction. This paper
presents SALM (Social Agent LM Framework), a novel approach for integrating
language models (LMs) into social network simulation that achieves
unprecedented temporal stability in multi-agent scenarios. Our primary
contributions include: (1) a hierarchical prompting architecture enabling
stable simulation beyond 4,000 timesteps while reducing token usage by 73%, (2)
an attention-based memory system achieving 80% cache hit rates (95% CI [78%,
82%]) with sub-linear memory growth of 9.5%, and (3) formal bounds on
personality stability. Through extensive validation against SNAP ego networks,
we demonstrate the first LLM-based framework capable of modeling long-term
social phenomena while maintaining empirically validated behavioral fidelity.

TLDR: 论文呼吁停止将LLM与人类专家直接比较，转而研究如何安全地在临床环境中使用LLM，以实现人机协同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究常将LLM与人类专家比较，但‘专家’定义模糊，且LLM快速更新可能威胁患者安全。

Method: 提出需开发策略，使人类与LLM高效协同工作，而非直接对比。

Result: 强调研究重点应转向LLM在临床环境中的安全使用。

Conclusion: 未来研究应聚焦人机协同策略，而非简单比较。

Abstract: Currently, a considerable research effort is devoted to comparing LLMs to a
group of human experts, where the term "expert" is often ill-defined or
variable, at best, in a state of constantly updating LLM releases. Without
proper safeguards in place, LLMs will threaten to cause harm to the established
structure of safe delivery of patient care which has been carefully developed
throughout history to keep the safety of the patient at the forefront. A key
driver of LLM innovation is founded on community research efforts which, if
continuing to operate under "humans versus LLMs" principles, will expedite this
trend. Therefore, research efforts moving forward must focus on effectively
characterizing the safe use of LLMs in clinical settings that persist across
the rapid development of novel LLM models. In this communication, we
demonstrate that rather than comparing LLMs to humans, there is a need to
develop strategies enabling efficient work of humans with LLMs in an almost
symbiotic manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展中地区数字鸿沟导致生成式AI（如ChatGPT）访问受限，WaLLM通过WhatsApp这一普及平台填补这一空白。

Method: 开发WaLLM，集成每日热门问题、建议跟进问题、趋势查询和排行榜奖励系统，并分析6个月的用户日志。

Result: 55%的查询为事实信息，健康与福祉是最热门话题（28%），使用排行榜的用户互动量是其他用户的3倍。

Conclusion: 需关注文化定制、界面设计和用户对AI系统的信任校准，以优化发展中地区的AI服务。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, such as ChatGPT, have transformed access to
information in education, knowledge-seeking, and everyday decision-making.
However, in many developing regions, access remains a challenge due to the
persistent digital divide. To help bridge this gap, we developed WaLLM - a
custom AI chatbot over WhatsApp, a widely used communication platform in
developing regions. Beyond answering queries, WaLLM offers several features to
enhance user engagement: a daily top question, suggested follow-up questions,
trending and recent queries, and a leaderboard-based reward system. Our service
has been operational for over 6 months, amassing over 14.7K queries from
approximately 100 users. In this paper, we present WaLLM's design and a
systematic analysis of logs to understand user interactions. Our results show
that 55% of user queries seek factual information. "Health and well-being" was
the most popular topic (28%), including queries about nutrition and disease,
suggesting users view WaLLM as a reliable source. Two-thirds of users' activity
occurred within 24 hours of the daily top question. Users who accessed the
"Leaderboard" interacted with WaLLM 3x as those who did not. We conclude by
discussing implications for culture-based customization, user interface design,
and appropriate calibration of users' trust in AI systems for developing
regions.

Abstract: As generative AI tools become integrated into design workflows, students
increasingly engage with these tools not just as aids, but as collaborators.
This study analyzes reflections from 33 student teams in an HCI design course
to examine the kinds of judgments students make when using AI tools. We found
both established forms of design judgment (e.g., instrumental, appreciative,
quality) and emergent types: agency-distribution judgment and reliability
judgment. These new forms capture how students negotiate creative
responsibility with AI and assess the trustworthiness of its outputs. Our
findings suggest that generative AI introduces new layers of complexity into
design reasoning, prompting students to reflect not only on what AI produces,
but also on how and when to rely on it. By foregrounding these judgments, we
offer a conceptual lens for understanding how students engage in co-creative
sensemaking with AI in design contexts.

Motivation: 在线ACP虽便捷但缺乏临床咨询的个性化价值探索和即时澄清决策后果的优势。

Method: 通过两项形成性研究（观察ACP团队和访谈ACP网站用户）设计PreCare，并对其进行了可用性和比较评估。

Result: PreCare在可用性测试中表现优秀（SUS评分高），显著提升用户价值探索、知识和决策信心，92%用户偏好。

Conclusion: PreCare通过AI助手有效弥补了在线ACP的不足，提升了用户体验和决策质量。

Abstract: Advance Care Planning (ACP) allows individuals to specify their preferred
end-of-life life-sustaining treatments before they become incapacitated by
injury or terminal illness (e.g., coma, cancer, dementia). While online ACP
offers high accessibility, it lacks key benefits of clinical consultations,
including personalized value exploration, immediate clarification of decision
consequences. To bridge this gap, we conducted two formative studies: 1)
shadowed and interviewed 3 ACP teams consisting of physicians, nurses, and
social workers (18 patients total), and 2) interviewed 14 users of ACP
websites. Building on these insights, we designed PreCare in collaboration with
6 ACP professionals. PreCare is a website with 3 AI-driven assistants designed
to guide users through exploring personal values, gaining ACP knowledge, and
supporting informed decision-making. A usability study (n=12) showed that
PreCare achieved a System Usability Scale (SUS) rating of excellent. A
comparative evaluation (n=12) showed that PreCare's AI assistants significantly
improved exploration of personal values, knowledge, and decisional confidence,

Result: 研究发现默认图像在TTI中普遍存在，并影响用户满意度。

Conclusion: 论文为理解TTI中的默认图像奠定了基础，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: In the creative practice of text-to-image generation (TTI), images are
generated from text prompts. However, TTI models are trained to always yield an
output, even if the prompt contains unknown terms. In this case, the model may
generate what we call "default images": images that closely resemble each other
across many unrelated prompts. We argue studying default images is valuable for
designing better solutions for TTI and prompt engineering. In this paper, we
provide the first investigation into default images on Midjourney, a popular
image generator. We describe our systematic approach to create input prompts
triggering default images, and present the results of our initial experiments
and several small-scale ablation studies. We also report on a survey study
investigating how default images affect user satisfaction. Our work lays the
foundation for understanding default images in TTI and highlights challenges

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence(AI), its
potential applications in higher education have attracted significant
attention. This study investigated how 148 students from diverse engineering
disciplines and regions across China used generative AI, focusing on its impact
on their learning experience and the opportunities and challenges it poses in
engineering education. Based on the surveyed data, we explored four key areas:
the frequency and application scenarios of AI use among engineering students,
its impact on students' learning and performance, commonly encountered
challenges in using generative AI, and future prospects for its adoption in
engineering education. The results showed that more than half of the
participants reported a positive impact of generative AI on their learning
efficiency, initiative, and creativity, with nearly half believing it also
enhanced their independent thinking. However, despite acknowledging improved
study efficiency, many felt their actual academic performance remained largely
unchanged and expressed concerns about the accuracy and domain-specific
reliability of generative AI. Our findings provide a first-hand insight into
the current benefits and challenges generative AI brings to students,
particularly Chinese engineering students, while offering several
recommendations, especially from the students' perspective, for effectively
integrating generative AI into engineering education.

Motivation: 随着直播视频的普及，内容审核的需求增加，但直播的实时性限制了传统离线分析方法的适用性。

Method: 扩展了Media Over QUIC Transport协议，支持实时内容审核，并允许分析任务透明分布到客户端设备。

Result: 实验表明，系统仅增加了一组图像（GOP）的延迟，适用于光敏观众的光闪移除场景。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了直播内容审核的实时性问题，同时保持了低延迟和分布式处理的优势。

Abstract: Live video streaming is increasingly popular on social media platforms. With
the growth of live streaming comes an increased need for robust content
moderation to remove dangerous, illegal, or otherwise objectionable content.
Whereas video on demand distribution enables offline content analysis, live
streaming imposes restrictions on latency for both analysis and distribution.
In this paper, we present extensions to the in-progress Media Over QUIC
Transport protocol that enable real-time content moderation in one-to-many
video live streams. Importantly, our solution removes only the video segments
that contain objectionable content, allowing playback resumption as soon as the
stream conforms to content policies again. Content analysis tasks may be
transparently distributed to arbitrary client devices. We implement and
evaluate our system in the context of light strobe removal for photosensitive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个透明、可解释且易于非专家使用的文本分类系统，减少幻觉风险，并适用于其他文本分类问题。

Method: 使用“分类学引导推理”，结合人类编写的决策树指导大型语言模型。

Result: Ornithologist对RBA沟通的鹰派和鸽派倾向测量能够预测未来现金利率路径和市场预期。

Conclusion: Ornithologist是一种高效、透明的文本分类工具，适用于央行文本分析，并具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: I develop Ornithologist, a weakly-supervised textual classification system
and measure the hawkishness and dovishness of central bank text. Ornithologist
uses ``taxonomy-guided reasoning'', guiding a large language model with
human-authored decision trees. This increases the transparency and
explainability of the system and makes it accessible to non-experts. It also
reduces hallucination risk. Since it requires less supervision than traditional
classification systems, it can more easily be applied to other problems or
sources of text (e.g. news) without much modification. Ornithologist
measurements of hawkishness and dovishness of RBA communication carry
information about the future of the cash rate path and of market expectations.

*H. T. Rüdisser,G. Nguyen,J. Le Louëdec,C. Möstl*

Main category: physics.space-ph

TLDR: ARCANE框架首次实现实时太阳风数据中的ICME早期检测，机器学习模型显著优于基线方法，性能接近科学数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICME对空间天气有重大影响，自动检测对预警系统至关重要，但实时检测仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出ARCANE框架，结合ResUNet++模型与阈值基线方法，评估实时太阳风数据下的检测性能。

Result: ResUNet++显著优于基线，F1分数0.53，检测延迟为事件时长的21.5%，性能随数据增加提升。

Conclusion: ARCANE为自动化空间天气监测迈出重要一步，为实时预报奠定基础。

Abstract: Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are major drivers of space
weather disturbances, posing risks to both technological infrastructure and
human activities. Automatic detection of ICMEs in solar wind in situ data is
essential for early warning systems. While several methods have been proposed
to identify these structures in time series data, robust real-time detection
remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present ARCANE - the first
framework explicitly designed for early ICME detection in streaming solar wind
data under realistic operational constraints, enabling event identification
without requiring observation of the full structure. Our approach evaluates the
strengths and limitations of detection models by comparing a machine
learning-based method to a threshold-based baseline. The ResUNet++ model,
previously validated on science data, significantly outperforms the baseline,
particularly in detecting high-impact events, while retaining solid performance
on lower-impact cases. Notably, we find that using real-time solar wind (RTSW)
data instead of high-resolution science data leads to only minimal performance
degradation. Despite the challenges of operational settings, our detection
pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.53, with an average detection delay of 21.5%
of the event's duration while only seeing a minimal amount of data. As more
data becomes available, the performance increases significantly. These results
mark a substantial step forward in automated space weather monitoring and lay
the groundwork for enhanced real-time forecasting capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展平衡传播方法至动态轨迹训练，适用于周期性边界条件或固定初始/终止状态的系统。

Method: 通过轻微调整轨迹至目标状态，测量参数共轭变量的响应，无需时间反向传播。

Result: 方法适用于周期性边界条件系统，并可推广至耗散系统。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态系统训练提供了一种高效的新途径，尤其在周期性边界条件下表现优异。

Abstract: We propose a method for training dynamical systems governed by Lagrangian
mechanics using Equilibrium Propagation. Our approach extends Equilibrium
Propagation -- initially developed for energy-based models -- to dynamical
trajectories by leveraging the principle of action extremization. Training is
achieved by gently nudging trajectories toward desired targets and measuring
how the variables conjugate to the parameters to be trained respond. This
method is particularly suited to systems with periodic boundary conditions or
fixed initial and final states, enabling efficient parameter updates without
requiring explicit backpropagation through time. In the case of periodic
boundary conditions, this approach yields the semiclassical limit of Quantum
Equilibrium Propagation. Applications to systems with dissipation are also
discussed.

TLDR: TensorRL-QAS结合张量网络和强化学习，提出了一种可扩展的量子架构搜索框架，显著降低了计算成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决变分量子算法中量子电路设计面临的设备限制和计算成本问题。

Method: 结合张量网络（TN）和强化学习（RL），通过矩阵乘积状态近似目标解来缩小搜索空间。

Result: 在12量子比特的量子化学问题中，CNOT数量和电路深度减少10倍，训练速度提升98%，成功率高达50%。

Conclusion: TensorRL-QAS是一种高效且可扩展的量子电路设计方法，适用于近期量子硬件。

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms hold the promise to address meaningful quantum
problems already on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, but they face
the challenge of designing quantum circuits that both solve the target problem
and comply with device limitations. Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates
this design process, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a promising
approach. Yet, RL-based QAS methods encounter significant scalability issues,
as computational and training costs grow rapidly with the number of qubits,
circuit depth, and noise, severely impacting performance. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textit{TensorRL-QAS}$, a scalable framework that
combines tensor network (TN) methods with RL for designing quantum circuits. By
warm-starting the architecture search with a matrix product state approximation
of the target solution, TensorRL-QAS effectively narrows the search space to
physically meaningful circuits, accelerating convergence to the desired
solution. Tested on several quantum chemistry problems of up to 12-qubit,
TensorRL-QAS achieves up to a 10-fold reduction in CNOT count and circuit depth
compared to baseline methods, while maintaining or surpassing chemical
accuracy. It reduces function evaluations by up to 100-fold, accelerates
training episodes by up to $98\%$, and achieves up to $50\%$ success
probability for 10-qubit systems-far exceeding the $<1\%$ rates of baseline
approaches. Robustness and versatility are demonstrated both in the noiseless
and noisy scenarios, where we report a simulation of up to 8-qubit. These
advancements establish TensorRL-QAS as a promising candidate for a scalable and
efficient quantum circuit discovery protocol on near-term quantum hardware.

Conclusion: 该研究首次将量子机器学习应用于大规模台风轨迹预测，展示了混合量子-经典学习在气候建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Typhoon trajectory forecasting is essential for disaster preparedness but
remains computationally demanding due to the complexity of atmospheric dynamics
and the resource requirements of deep learning models. Quantum-Train (QT), a
hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages quantum neural networks
(QNNs) to generate trainable parameters exclusively during training,
eliminating the need for quantum hardware at inference time. Building on QT's
success across multiple domains, including image classification, reinforcement
learning, flood prediction, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, we
introduce Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) for efficient typhoon forecasting
model learning. Integrated with an Attention-based Multi-ConvGRU model, QPA
enables parameter-efficient training while maintaining predictive accuracy.
This work represents the first application of quantum machine learning (QML) to
large-scale typhoon trajectory prediction, offering a scalable and
energy-efficient approach to climate modeling. Our results demonstrate that QPA
significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving
performance, making high-performance forecasting more accessible and
sustainable through hybrid quantum-classical learning.

Abstract: We investigate work extraction protocols designed to transfer the maximum

trade-off in reinforcement learning to develop adaptive strategies achieving
energy dissipation that scales only poly-logarithmically in $N$. This
represents an exponential improvement over current protocols based on full

TLDR: 研究比较了通用大语言模型（GPT-4o）和推理优化模型（o1-preview）与德国物理奥林匹克竞赛参与者在解决物理问题上的表现，发现LLMs在平均表现上优于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在教育中的普及，需了解其在物理问题解决中的能力，以指导其在教学和评估中的合理使用。

Method: 通过比较GPT-4o和o1-preview与人类参与者在解决奥林匹克物理问题上的表现，分析LLMs的解题能力。

Result: LLMs（尤其是o1-preview）在解决物理问题上表现优于人类，且提示技术对GPT-4o影响较小。

Conclusion: 研究为物理教育中的评估设计提供了启示，强调需维护评估完整性并引导学生批判性使用LLMs。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely accessible, reaching learners at
all educational levels. This development has raised concerns that their use may
circumvent essential learning processes and compromise the integrity of
established assessment formats. In physics education, where problem solving
plays a central role in instruction and assessment, it is therefore essential
to understand the physics-specific problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Such
understanding is key to informing responsible and pedagogically sound
approaches to integrating LLMs into instruction and assessment. This study
therefore compares the problem-solving performance of a general-purpose LLM
(GPT-4o, using varying prompting techniques) and a reasoning-optimized model
(o1-preview) with that of participants of the German Physics Olympiad, based on
a set of well-defined Olympiad problems. In addition to evaluating the
correctness of the generated solutions, the study analyzes characteristic
strengths and limitations of LLM-generated solutions. The findings of this
study indicate that both tested LLMs (GPT-4o and o1-preview) demonstrate
advanced problem-solving capabilities on Olympiad-type physics problems, on
average outperforming the human participants. Prompting techniques had little
effect on GPT-4o's performance, while o1-preview almost consistently
outperformed both GPT-4o and the human benchmark. Based on these findings, the
study discusses implications for the design of summative and formative
assessment in physics education, including how to uphold assessment integrity
and support students in critically engaging with LLMs.

Motivation: 传统ICA方法对异常值不鲁棒，需要一种更稳健的方法。

Method: 使用距离相关性（dCor）作为依赖度量，并引入bowl变换处理异常值，通过顺序估计独立成分。

Result: RICA在模拟研究中表现优于其他方法，具有强一致性和参数收敛速率。

Conclusion: RICA是一种鲁棒且有效的ICA方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a powerful tool for decomposing a
multivariate signal or distribution into fully independent sources, not just
uncorrelated ones. Unfortunately, most approaches to ICA are not robust against
outliers. Here we propose a robust ICA method called RICA, which estimates the
components by minimizing a robust measure of dependence between multivariate
random variables. The dependence measure used is the distance correlation
(dCor). In order to make it more robust we first apply a new transformation
called the bowl transform, which is bounded, one-to-one, continuous, and maps
far outliers to points close to the origin. This preserves the crucial property
that a zero dCor implies independence. RICA estimates the independent sources
sequentially, by looking for the component that has the smallest dCor with the
remainder. RICA is strongly consistent and has the usual parametric rate of
convergence. Its robustness is investigated by a simulation study, in which it
generally outperforms its competitors. The method is illustrated on three
applications, including the well-known cocktail party problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音对话模型的评估方法主要依赖文本，忽略了非文本信息的重要性，导致评估不全面。

Method: 1) 基于音频语言模型设计WavReward，结合深度推理和非线性奖励机制；2) 引入ChatReward-30K数据集，涵盖多种语音对话任务。

Result: WavReward在客观准确率上从55.1%提升至91.5%，主观A/B测试中领先83%。

Conclusion: WavReward有效填补了语音对话模型评估的空白，各组件均被证明必要。

Abstract: End-to-end spoken dialogue models such as GPT-4o-audio have recently garnered
significant attention in the speech domain. However, the evaluation of spoken
dialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This
is primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual
information which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models
like ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback
model based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of
spoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio
language models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the
nonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample
feedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized
evaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a
preference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both
comprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios
span various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of
instruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous
state-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios,
achieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy
from 55.1$\%$ to 91.5$\%$. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a
margin of 83$\%$. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each
component of WavReward. All data and code will be publicly at

Abstract: How do we enable artificial intelligence models to improve themselves? This
is central to exponentially improving generalized artificial intelligence
models, which can improve their own architecture to handle new problem domains
in an efficient manner that leverages the latest hardware. However, current
automated compilation methods are poor, and efficient algorithms require years
of human development. In this paper, we use neural circuit diagrams, based in
category theory, to prove a general theorem related to deep learning
algorithms, guide the development of a novel attention algorithm catered to the
domain of gene regulatory networks, and produce a corresponding efficient
kernel. The algorithm we propose, spherical attention, shows that neural
circuit diagrams enable a principled and systematic method for reasoning about
deep learning architectures and providing high-performance code. By replacing
SoftMax with an $L^2$ norm as suggested by diagrams, it overcomes the special
function unit bottleneck of standard attention while retaining the streaming
property essential to high-performance. Our diagrammatically derived
\textit{FlashSign} kernel achieves comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art, fine-tuned FlashAttention algorithm on an A100, and
$3.6\times$ the performance of PyTorch. Overall, this investigation shows
neural circuit diagrams' suitability as a high-level framework for the

Abstract: Photonic chip design has seen significant advancements with the adoption of
inverse design methodologies, offering flexibility and efficiency in optimizing
device performance. However, the black-box nature of the optimization
approaches, such as those used in inverse design in order to minimize a loss
function or maximize coupling efficiency, poses challenges in understanding the
outputs. This challenge is prevalent in machine learning-based optimization
methods, which can suffer from the same lack of transparency. To this end,
interpretability techniques address the opacity of optimization models. In this
work, we apply interpretability techniques from machine learning, with the aim
of gaining understanding of inverse design optimization used in designing
photonic components, specifically two-mode multiplexers. We base our
methodology on the widespread interpretability technique known as local
interpretable model-agnostic explanations, or LIME. As a result, LIME-informed
insights point us to more effective initial conditions, directly improving
device performance. This demonstrates that interpretability methods can do more
than explain models -- they can actively guide and enhance the inverse-designed
photonic components. Our results demonstrate the ability of interpretable
techniques to reveal underlying patterns in the inverse design process, leading
to the development of better-performing components.

Conclusion: InvDesFlow-AL框架在材料逆向设计中表现出高效性和实用性，为材料科学提供了新工具。

Abstract: Developing inverse design methods for functional materials with specific
properties is critical to advancing fields like renewable energy, catalysis,
energy storage, and carbon capture. Generative models based on diffusion
principles can directly produce new materials that meet performance
constraints, thereby significantly accelerating the material design process.
However, existing methods for generating and predicting crystal structures
often remain limited by low success rates. In this work, we propose a novel
inverse material design generative framework called InvDesFlow-AL, which is
based on active learning strategies. This framework can iteratively optimize
the material generation process to gradually guide it towards desired
performance characteristics. In terms of crystal structure prediction, the
InvDesFlow-AL model achieves an RMSE of 0.0423 {\AA}, representing an 32.96%
improvement in performance compared to exsisting generative models.
Additionally, InvDesFlow-AL has been successfully validated in the design of
low-formation-energy and low-Ehull materials. It can systematically generate
materials with progressively lower formation energies while continuously
expanding the exploration across diverse chemical spaces. These results fully
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning-driven generative
model in accelerating material discovery and inverse design. To further prove
the effectiveness of this method, we took the search for BCS superconductors
under ambient pressure as an example explored by InvDesFlow-AL. As a result, we
successfully identified Li\(_2\)AuH\(_6\) as a conventional BCS superconductor
with an ultra-high transition temperature of 140 K. This discovery provides
strong empirical support for the application of inverse design in materials
science.

Abstract: Even though thermodynamic energy-based crystal structure prediction (CSP) has
revolutionized materials discovery, the energy-driven CSP approaches often
struggle to identify experimentally realizable metastable materials synthesized
through kinetically controlled pathways, creating a critical gap between
theoretical predictions and experimental synthesis. Here, we propose a
synthesizability-driven CSP framework that integrates symmetry-guided structure
derivation with a Wyckoff encode-based machine-learning model, allowing for the
efficient localization of subspaces likely to yield highly synthesizable
structures. Within the identified promising subspaces, a structure-based
synthesizability evaluation model, fine-tuned using recently synthesized
structures to enhance predictive accuracy, is employed in conjunction with ab
initio calculations to systematically identify synthesizable candidates. The
framework successfully reproduces 13 experimentally known XSe (X = Sc, Ti, Mn,
Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) structures, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting
synthesizable structures. Notably, 92,310 structures are filtered from the
554,054 candidates predicted by GNoME, exhibiting great potential for promising
synthesizability. Additionally, eight thermodynamically favorable Hf-X-O (X =
Ti, V, and Mn) structures have been identified, among which three HfV$_2$O$_7$
candidates exhibit high synthesizability, presenting viable candidates for
experimental realization and potentially associated with experimentally
observed temperature-induced phase transitions. This work establishes a
data-driven paradigm for machine-learning-assisted inorganic materials
synthesis, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between computational
predictions and experimental realization while unlocking new opportunities for
the targeted discovery of novel functional materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GAN在音频生成中依赖带宽受限的梅尔频谱，导致分辨率受限和模式崩溃问题。

Method: 采用基于核的周期性ReLU激活函数和可变形卷积操作，设计了DPN模块用于多分辨率生成，并改进了判别器网络。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了DPN-GAN的优越性能，尤其在噪声数据和分布外数据上表现出色。

Conclusion: DPN-GAN在音频生成任务中超越了现有最佳GAN架构，展现了更高的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made significant
progress in generating audio sequences. However, these models typically rely on
bandwidth-limited mel-spectrograms, which constrain the resolution of generated
audio sequences, and lead to mode collapse during conditional generation. To
address this issue, we propose Deformable Periodic Network based GAN (DPN-GAN),
a novel GAN architecture that incorporates a kernel-based periodic ReLU
activation function to induce periodic bias in audio generation. This
innovative approach enhances the model's ability to capture and reproduce
intricate audio patterns. In particular, our proposed model features a DPN
module for multi-resolution generation utilizing deformable convolution
operations, allowing for adaptive receptive fields that improve the quality and
fidelity of the synthetic audio. Additionally, we enhance the discriminator
network using deformable convolution to better distinguish between real and
generated samples, further refining the audio quality. We trained two versions
of the model: DPN-GAN small (38.67M parameters) and DPN-GAN large (124M
parameters). For evaluation, we use five different datasets, covering both
speech synthesis and music generation tasks, to demonstrate the efficiency of
the DPN-GAN. The experimental results demonstrate that DPN-GAN delivers
superior performance on both out-of-distribution and noisy data, showcasing its
robustness and adaptability. Trained across various datasets, DPN-GAN
outperforms state-of-the-art GAN architectures on standard evaluation metrics,

*Luciano Sebastian Martinez-Rau,Quynh Nguyen Phuong Vu,Yuxuan Zhang,Bengt Oelmann,Sebastian Bader*

Main category: cs.SD

TLDR: 论文提出了一种低计算成本的噪声适应方法，用于关键词识别（KWS）系统，仅需单次学习和一个训练周期，显著提升了在低信噪比环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 嵌入式设备上的标准KWS系统在现实环境中性能下降，需要一种轻量级且能动态适应噪声的方法。

Method: 采用1-shot学习和单周期训练，对预训练神经网络进行连续噪声适应。

Result: 在信噪比24至-3 dB范围内，适应后的模型性能优于预训练模型，尤其在低信噪比（≤18 dB）时准确率提升4.9%至46.0%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且轻量，适合资源受限设备部署。

Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is a key component of smart devices, enabling
efficient and intuitive audio interaction. However, standard KWS systems
deployed on embedded devices often suffer performance degradation under
real-world operating conditions. Resilient KWS systems address this issue by
enabling dynamic adaptation, with applications such as adding or replacing
keywords, adjusting to specific users, and improving noise robustness. However,
deploying resilient, standalone KWS systems with low latency on
resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to limited memory and
computational resources. This study proposes a low computational approach for
continuous noise adaptation of pretrained neural networks used for KWS
classification, requiring only 1-shot learning and one epoch. The proposed
method was assessed using two pretrained models and three real-world noise
sources at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from 24 to -3 dB. The adapted
models consistently outperformed the pretrained models across all scenarios,
especially at SNR $\leq$ 18 dB, achieving accuracy improvements of 4.9% to
46.0%. These results highlight the efficacy of the proposed methodology while
being lightweight enough for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

*Owen Kwon,Abraham George,Alison Bartsch,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.RO

TLDR: RT-cache通过存储和检索成功轨迹，显著降低机器人推理延迟，提升任务完成速度和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉-语言-动作模型在多样化任务中表现良好，但推理成本高，导致延迟问题。RT-cache旨在通过大数据检索和学习经验解决这一问题。

Method: RT-cache结合Memory Builder和Trajectory Retrieval，存储大规模成功轨迹并检索相关动作片段，减少推理开销。

Result: 实验表明，RT-cache在Open-X Embodiment数据集上比无检索的基线更快且更成功地完成任务。

Conclusion: RT-cache为实时操作提供了一种实用的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces RT-cache, a novel trajectorymemory pipeline that
accelerates real-world robot inference by leveraging big-data retrieval and
learning from experience. While modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can
handle diverse robotic tasks, they often incur high per-step inference costs,
resulting in significant latency, sometimes minutes per task. In contrast,
RT-cache stores a large-scale Memory of previously successful robot
trajectories and retrieves relevant multistep motion snippets, drastically
reducing inference overhead. By integrating a Memory Builder with a Trajectory
Retrieval, we develop an efficient retrieval process that remains tractable
even for extremely large datasets. RT-cache flexibly accumulates real-world
experiences and replays them whenever the current scene matches past states,
adapting quickly to new or unseen environments with only a few additional
samples. Experiments on the Open-X Embodiment Dataset and other real-world data
demonstrate that RT-cache completes tasks both faster and more successfully
than a baseline lacking retrieval, suggesting a practical, data-driven solution
for real-time manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主机器人系统的发展，用户希望通过自然语言指定任务意图而非低层细节，但实现这一目标需解决语义推理、异构机器人协调及间歇通信等技术挑战。

Method: 系统采用LLM支持的规划器，结合在线构建的语义-度量地图，实现无人机与地面车的协作任务执行，支持动态任务调整。

Result: 在城乡环境中，系统成功完成了7种不同自然语言任务，导航范围达公里级。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了自然语言指导的异构机器人团队在动态环境中的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: As autonomous robotic systems become increasingly mature, users will want to
specify missions at the level of intent rather than in low-level detail.
Language is an expressive and intuitive medium for such mission specification.
However, realizing language-guided robotic teams requires overcoming
significant technical hurdles. Interpreting and realizing language-specified
missions requires advanced semantic reasoning. Successful heterogeneous robots
must effectively coordinate actions and share information across varying
viewpoints. Additionally, communication between robots is typically
intermittent, necessitating robust strategies that leverage communication
opportunities to maintain coordination and achieve mission objectives. In this
work, we present a first-of-its-kind system where an unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) are able to collaboratively
accomplish missions specified in natural language while reacting to changes in
specification on the fly. We leverage a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled
planner to reason over semantic-metric maps that are built online and
opportunistically shared between an aerial and a ground robot. We consider
task-driven navigation in urban and rural areas. Our system must infer
mission-relevant semantics and actively acquire information via semantic
mapping. In both ground and air-ground teaming experiments, we demonstrate our
system on seven different natural-language specifications at up to
kilometer-scale navigation.

Conclusion: ChicGrasp展示了模仿学习在农业工程和机器人学习中的潜力，并提供了公开数据集和基准。

Abstract: Automated poultry processing lines still rely on humans to lift slippery,
easily bruised carcasses onto a shackle conveyor. Deformability, anatomical
variance, and strict hygiene rules make conventional suction and scripted
motions unreliable. We present ChicGrasp, an end--to--end hardware--software
co-design for this task. An independently actuated dual-jaw pneumatic gripper
clamps both chicken legs, while a conditional diffusion-policy controller,
trained from only 50 multi--view teleoperation demonstrations (RGB +
proprioception), plans 5 DoF end--effector motion, which includes jaw commands
in one shot. On individually presented raw broiler carcasses, our system
achieves a 40.6\% grasp--and--lift success rate and completes the pick to
shackle cycle in 38 s, whereas state--of--the--art implicit behaviour cloning
(IBC) and LSTM-GMM baselines fail entirely. All CAD, code, and datasets will be
open-source. ChicGrasp shows that imitation learning can bridge the gap between
rigid hardware and variable bio--products, offering a reproducible benchmark
and a public dataset for researchers in agricultural engineering and robot
learning.

Motivation: 森林地面的详细理解因高自然变异性、快速变化的环境参数和模糊注释而具有挑战性，需要一种高效的分割方法。

Method: 采用参数高效微调(PEFT)技术，调整SAM的掩码解码器以生成与数据集类别对应的掩码，实现无需手动提示的自动分割。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了森林地面分割问题，为无人机在森林监测中的应用提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for reforestation and
forest monitoring, including seed dispersal in hard-to-reach terrains. However,
a detailed understanding of the forest floor remains a challenge due to high
natural variability, quickly changing environmental parameters, and ambiguous
annotations due to unclear definitions. To address this issue, we adapt the
Segment Anything Model (SAM), a vision foundation model with strong
generalization capabilities, to segment forest floor objects such as tree
stumps, vegetation, and woody debris. To this end, we employ
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to fine-tune a small subset of
additional model parameters while keeping the original weights fixed. We adjust
SAM's mask decoder to generate masks corresponding to our dataset categories,
allowing for automatic segmentation without manual prompting. Our results show
that the adapter-based PEFT method achieves the highest mean intersection over
union (mIoU), while Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA), with fewer parameters, offers a
lightweight alternative for resource-constrained UAV platforms.

Motivation: 通过教学视频指导机器人完成复杂多步任务，解决传统规划算法在顺序依赖任务中的局限性。

Method: 扩展RRT规划器，结合视频中的接触状态和3D物体位姿，同时设计轨迹优化方法（OCP）实现真实机器人部署。

Result: 在多个机器人平台上验证了方法的有效性，包括Franka Emika Panda和KUKA KMR iiwa。

Conclusion: 视频引导的规划方法能有效解决复杂任务，并具备泛化能力。

Abstract: This work aims to leverage instructional video to solve complex multi-step
task-and-motion planning tasks in robotics. Towards this goal, we propose an
extension of the well-established Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner,
which simultaneously grows multiple trees around grasp and release states
extracted from the guiding video. Our key novelty lies in combining contact
states and 3D object poses extracted from the guiding video with a traditional
planning algorithm that allows us to solve tasks with sequential dependencies,
for example, if an object needs to be placed at a specific location to be
grasped later. We also investigate the generalization capabilities of our
approach to go beyond the scene depicted in the instructional video. To
demonstrate the benefits of the proposed video-guided planning approach, we
design a new benchmark with three challenging tasks: (I) 3D re-arrangement of
multiple objects between a table and a shelf, (ii) multi-step transfer of an
object through a tunnel, and (iii) transferring objects using a tray similar to
a waiter transfers dishes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our planning
algorithm on several robots, including the Franka Emika Panda and the KUKA KMR
iiwa. For a seamless transfer of the obtained plans to the real robot, we
develop a trajectory refinement approach formulated as an optimal control
problem (OCP).

Abstract: Due to the deformability of garments, generating a large amount of
high-quality data for robotic garment manipulation tasks is highly challenging.
In this paper, we present a synthetic garment dataset that can be used for
robotic garment folding. We begin by constructing geometric garment templates
based on keypoints and applying generative models to generate realistic texture
patterns. Leveraging these keypoint annotations, we generate folding
demonstrations in simulation and train folding policies via closed-loop
imitation learning. To improve robustness, we propose KG-DAgger, which uses a
keypoint-based strategy to generate demonstration data for recovering from
failures. KG-DAgger significantly improves the model performance, boosting the
real-world success rate by 25\%. After training with 15K trajectories (about 2M
image-action pairs), the model achieves a 75\% success rate in the real world.
Experiments in both simulation and real-world settings validate the
effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Abstract: The use of wearable robots has been widely adopted in rehabilitation training
for patients with hand motor impairments. However, the uniqueness of patients'
muscle loss is often overlooked. Leveraging reinforcement learning and a
biologically accurate musculoskeletal model in simulation, we propose a
customized wearable robotic controller that is able to address specific muscle
deficits and to provide compensation for hand-object manipulation tasks. Video
data of a same subject performing human grasping tasks is used to train a
manipulation model through learning from demonstration. This manipulation model
is subsequently fine-tuned to perform object-specific interaction tasks. The
muscle forces in the musculoskeletal manipulation model are then weakened to
simulate neurological motor impairments, which are later compensated by the
actuation of a virtual wearable robotics glove. Results shows that integrating
the virtual wearable robotic glove provides shared assistance to support the
hand manipulator with weakened muscle forces. The learned exoglove controller
achieved an average of 90.5\% of the original manipulation proficiency.

Result: 在Radar Oxford Robot-Car、DeepLoc和自定义APR-BeIntelli数据集上达到最优性能，并在实际自动驾驶车辆中验证了可靠性。

Conclusion: APR-Transformer在复杂环境中具有实用性和高效性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Precise initialization plays a critical role in the performance of
localization algorithms, especially in the context of robotics, autonomous
driving, and computer vision. Poor localization accuracy is often a consequence
of inaccurate initial poses, particularly noticeable in GNSS-denied
environments where GPS signals are primarily relied upon for initialization.
Recent advances in leveraging deep neural networks for pose regression have led
to significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness, especially in
estimating complex spatial relationships and orientations. In this paper, we
introduce APR-Transformer, a model architecture inspired by state-of-the-art
methods, which predicts absolute pose (3D position and 3D orientation) using
either image or LiDAR data. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on established benchmark datasets such as the
Radar Oxford Robot-Car and DeepLoc datasets. Furthermore, we extend our
experiments to include our custom complex APR-BeIntelli dataset. Additionally,
we validate the reliability of our approach in GNSS-denied environments by
deploying the model in real-time on an autonomous test vehicle. This showcases
the practical feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. The source code is

Conclusion: 论文提出了未来研究的多个方向，强调了在非结构化环境中部署FM机器人的潜力。

Abstract: The integration of foundation models (FMs) into robotics has enabled robots
to understand natural language and reason about the semantics in their
environments. However, existing FM-enabled robots primary operate in
closed-world settings, where the robot is given a full prior map or has a full
view of its workspace. This paper addresses the deployment of FM-enabled robots
in the field, where missions often require a robot to operate in large-scale
and unstructured environments. To effectively accomplish these missions, robots
must actively explore their environments, navigate obstacle-cluttered terrain,
handle unexpected sensor inputs, and operate with compute constraints. We
discuss recent deployments of SPINE, our LLM-enabled autonomy framework, in
field robotic settings. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first
demonstration of large-scale LLM-enabled robot planning in unstructured
environments with several kilometers of missions. SPINE is agnostic to a
particular LLM, which allows us to distill small language models capable of
running onboard size, weight and power (SWaP) limited platforms. Via
preliminary model distillation work, we then present the first language-driven
UAV planner using on-device language models. We conclude our paper by proposing
several promising directions for future research.

Motivation: 长上下文策略学习面临内存需求高和性能下降的问题，现有方法通常通过截断上下文长度来规避，但可能丢失关键历史信息。

Method: 提出PTP辅助任务，结合多阶段训练策略（先预训练视觉编码器，再微调策略头）和自验证机制。

Result: 在真实和模拟任务中，长上下文扩散策略性能提升3倍，训练速度加快10倍以上。

Conclusion: PTP和多阶段训练策略有效解决了长上下文策略学习中的挑战，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Reasoning over long sequences of observations and actions is essential for
many robotic tasks. Yet, learning effective long-context policies from
demonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training
becomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy
performance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods
typically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding
historical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this
paper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the
retention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in
imitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion
policies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture
essential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we
introduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy
learns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization
significantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal
reliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further
introduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with
short contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context
embeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing
memory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a
self-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and
select candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments
across four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed
method improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and
accelerates policy training by more than 10x.

Result: 在RLBench仿真中，Mini-Diffuser达到最先进性能的95%，同时仅需5%的训练时间和7%的内存。

Conclusion: Mini-Diffuser在保持扩散策略优势的同时，显著提升了训练效率，适用于实际机器人任务。

Abstract: We present a method for training multi-task vision-language robotic diffusion
policies that reduces training time and memory usage by an order of magnitude.
This improvement arises from a previously underexplored distinction between
action diffusion and the image diffusion techniques that inspired it: image
generation targets are high-dimensional, while robot actions lie in a much
lower-dimensional space. Meanwhile, the vision-language conditions for action
generation remain high-dimensional. Our approach, Mini-Diffuser, exploits this
asymmetry by introducing Level-2 minibatching, which pairs multiple noised
action samples with each vision-language condition, instead of the conventional
one-to-one sampling strategy. To support this batching scheme, we introduce
architectural adaptations to the diffusion transformer that prevent information
leakage across samples while maintaining full conditioning access. In RLBench
simulations, Mini-Diffuser achieves 95\% of the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-task diffusion policies, while using only 5\% of the training time and
7\% of the memory. Real-world experiments further validate that Mini-Diffuser
preserves the key strengths of diffusion-based policies, including the ability
to model multimodal action distributions and produce behavior conditioned on
diverse perceptual inputs. Code available at

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人任务中验证，显著提升训练效率和最终性能。

Conclusion: 通过战略交互和高效探索，解决了信息不对称问题，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: We study policy distillation under privileged information, where a student
policy with only partial observations must learn from a teacher with full-state
access. A key challenge is information asymmetry: the student cannot directly
access the teacher's state space, leading to distributional shifts and policy
degradation. Existing approaches either modify the teacher to produce
realizable but sub-optimal demonstrations or rely on the student to explore
missing information independently, both of which are inefficient. Our key
insight is that the student should strategically interact with the teacher
--querying only when necessary and resetting from recovery states --to stay on
a recoverable path within its own observation space. We introduce two methods:
(i) an imitation learning approach that adaptively determines when the student
should query the teacher for corrections, and (ii) a reinforcement learning
approach that selects where to initialize training for efficient exploration.
We validate our methods in both simulated and real-world robotic tasks,
demonstrating significant improvements over standard teacher-student baselines
in training efficiency and final performance. The project website is available

TLDR: DataMIL是一种基于策略的数据选择框架，通过端到端优化数据选择，提升机器人策略在特定任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用机器人策略在多样化任务上表现良好，但在特定任务上表现不佳，需要进一步调整。数据选择不当可能损害性能。

Method: 引入DataMIL框架，利用策略自身优化数据选择，避免昂贵的环境测试，使用替代损失函数。

Result: 在60多个仿真和真实世界任务中验证，性能优于基线方法，成功从Open X-Embodiment数据集中选择数据。

Conclusion: 端到端、性能感知的数据选择对释放大型数据集潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Recently, the robotics community has amassed ever larger and more diverse
datasets to train generalist robot policies. However, while these policies
achieve strong mean performance across a variety of tasks, they often
underperform on individual, specialized tasks and require further tuning on
newly acquired task-specific data. Combining task-specific data with carefully
curated subsets of large prior datasets via co-training can produce better
specialized policies, but selecting data naively may actually harm downstream
performance. To address this, we introduce DataMIL, a policy-driven data
selection framework built on the datamodels paradigm that reasons about data
selection in an end-to-end manner, using the policy itself to identify which
data points will most improve performance. Unlike standard practices that
filter data using human notions of quality (e.g., based on semantic or visual
similarity), DataMIL directly optimizes data selection for task success,
allowing us to select data that enhance the policy while dropping data that
degrade it. To avoid performing expensive rollouts in the environment during
selection, we use a novel surrogate loss function on task-specific data,
allowing us to use DataMIL in the real world without degrading performance. We
validate our approach on a suite of more than 60 simulation and real-world
manipulation tasks - most notably showing successful data selection from the
Open X-Embodiment datasets-demonstrating consistent gains in success rates and
superior performance over multiple baselines. Our results underscore the
importance of end-to-end, performance-aware data selection for unlocking the
potential of large prior datasets in robotics. More information at

*Siyi Wang,Alexandre Leblanc,Paul D. McNicholas*

Main category: stat.ME

TLDR: 提出了一种基于数据深度的局部中心聚类方法（DLCC），通过局部数据深度识别多模态数据的中心与形状各异的簇，并引入新的内部评估指标，克服传统聚类方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有聚类方法通常针对特定场景设计，存在局限性，无法有效处理多模态数据和非凸簇。

Method: 利用局部数据深度识别局部中心和形状各异的簇，提出基于密度的内部评估指标。

Result: DLCC方法能够灵活处理多模态数据和非凸簇，优于传统聚类方法。

Conclusion: DLCC是一种灵活的聚类方法，扩展了数据分析的应用范围。

Abstract: Cluster analysis, or clustering, plays a crucial role across numerous
scientific and engineering domains. Despite the wealth of clustering methods
proposed over the past decades, each method is typically designed for specific
scenarios and presents certain limitations in practical applications. In this
paper, we propose depth-based local center clustering (DLCC). This novel method
makes use of data depth, which is known to produce a center-outward ordering of
sample points in a multivariate space. However, data depth typically fails to
capture the multimodal characteristics of {data}, something of the utmost
importance in the context of clustering. To overcome this, DLCC makes use of a
local version of data depth that is based on subsets of {data}. From this,
local centers can be identified as well as clusters of varying shapes.
Furthermore, we propose a new internal metric based on density-based clustering
to evaluate clustering performance on {non-convex clusters}. Overall, DLCC is a
flexible clustering approach that seems to overcome some limitations of
traditional clustering methods, thereby enhancing data analysis capabilities
across a wide range of application scenarios.

Main category: stat.ME

TLDR: 提出基于Krylov子空间的新方法，显著提升高维交叉随机效应混合模型的运算效率，比现有方法快约100倍，软件实现比lme4和glmmTMB快10000倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维交叉随机效应的混合效应模型计算效率低，现有方法（如Cholesky分解）速度慢。

Method: 开发Krylov子空间方法，分析预条件共轭梯度和随机Lanczos求积法，提出高效预测方差计算。

Result: 实验显示新方法比Cholesky快约100倍，软件实现比lme4和glmmTMB快10000倍。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升计算效率，适用于高维交叉随机效应模型，已在GPBoost库中实现。

Abstract: Mixed effects models are widely used for modeling data with hierarchically
grouped structures and high-cardinality categorical predictor variables.
However, for high-dimensional crossed random effects, current standard
computations relying on Cholesky decompositions can become prohibitively slow.
In this work, we present novel Krylov subspace-based methods that address
several existing computational bottlenecks. Among other things, we
theoretically analyze and empirically evaluate various preconditioners for the
conjugate gradient and stochastic Lanczos quadrature methods, derive new
convergence results, and develop computationally efficient methods for
calculating predictive variances. Extensive experiments using simulated and
real-world data sets show that our proposed methods scale much better than
Cholesky-based computations, for instance, achieving a runtime reduction of
approximately two orders of magnitudes for both estimation and prediction.
Moreover, our software implementation is up to 10'000 times faster and more
stable than state-of-the-art implementations such as lme4 and glmmTMB when
using default settings. Our methods are implemented in the free C++ software
library GPBoost with high-level Python and R packages.

*Marina Popova,Iaroslav Chelombitko,Aleksey Komissarov*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TLDR: 研究探索了Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)在T2T灵长类基因组中的应用，发现共享词汇量随基因组比较增加而快速减少，且BPE对高拷贝重复序列敏感，限制了其在比较基因组学中的通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2T基因组组装的兴起为比较基因组学提供了新机会，但基因组序列的有效标记化策略尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用自定义工具dnaBPE对9个T2T灵长类基因组（包括3个人类组装）应用BPE标记化，固定词汇量为512,000个标记。

Result: 仅11,569个标记在所有组装中共享，991,854个标记为单一基因组特有；基于标记重叠的系统发育树未能反映已知灵长类关系。

Conclusion: BPE标记化在压缩重复序列方面有效，但对高拷贝元素敏感，需结合混合策略和重复屏蔽方法优化基因组标记化。

Abstract: The emergence of telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assemblies has opened new
avenues for comparative genomics, yet effective tokenization strategies for
genomic sequences remain underexplored. In this pilot study, we apply Byte Pair
Encoding (BPE) to nine T2T primate genomes including three human assemblies by
training independent BPE tokenizers with a fixed vocabulary of 512,000 tokens
using our custom tool, dnaBPE. Our analysis reveals that only 11,569 tokens are
shared across all assemblies, while nearly 991,854 tokens are unique to a
single genome, indicating a rapid decline in shared vocabulary with increasing
assembly comparisons. Moreover, phylogenetic trees derived from token overlap
failed to recapitulate established primate relationships, a discrepancy
attributed to the disproportionate influence of species-specific high-copy
repetitive elements. These findings underscore the dual nature of BPE
tokenization: while it effectively compresses repetitive sequences, its
sensitivity to high-copy elements limits its utility as a universal tool for
comparative genomics. We discuss potential hybrid strategies and repeat-masking
approaches to refine genomic tokenization, emphasizing the need for
domain-specific adaptations in the development of large-scale genomic language
models. The dnaBPE tool used in this study is open-source and available at
https://github.com/aglabx/dnaBPE.

*Mobina Shrestha,Bishwas Mandal,Vishal Mandal,Asis Shrestha*

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: 论文探讨了在肿瘤学中应用上下文学习（ICL）作为模型重新训练的替代方案，通过少量标注样本实现任务适应，并在多种视觉语言模型（VLMs）上验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在肿瘤学中的应用受限于对大量标注数据和模型重新训练的需求，因此研究ICL作为一种无需重新训练的实用替代方案。

Method: 使用四种视觉语言模型（Paligemma、CLIP、ALIGN和GPT-4o）在三个肿瘤学数据集（MHIST、PatchCamelyon和HAM10000）上评估ICL性能。

Result: 所有模型在少量样本提示下表现显著提升，GPT-4o在二元和多类分类中分别达到F1分数0.81和0.60。开源模型如Paligemma和CLIP也表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: ICL在肿瘤学中具有潜力，特别是在资源有限或罕见癌症场景下，可作为无法进行微调时的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The application of AI in oncology has been limited by its reliance on large,
annotated datasets and the need for retraining models for domain-specific
diagnostic tasks. Taking heed of these limitations, we investigated in-context
learning as a pragmatic alternative to model retraining by allowing models to
adapt to new diagnostic tasks using only a few labeled examples at inference,
without the need for retraining. Using four vision-language models
(VLMs)-Paligemma, CLIP, ALIGN and GPT-4o, we evaluated the performance across
three oncology datasets: MHIST, PatchCamelyon and HAM10000. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to compare the performance of multiple VLMs
on different oncology classification tasks. Without any parameter updates, all
models showed significant gains with few-shot prompting, with GPT-4o reaching
an F1 score of 0.81 in binary classification and 0.60 in multi-class
classification settings. While these results remain below the ceiling of fully
fine-tuned systems, they highlight the potential of ICL to approximate
task-specific behavior using only a handful of examples, reflecting how
clinicians often reason from prior cases. Notably, open-source models like
Paligemma and CLIP demonstrated competitive gains despite their smaller size,
suggesting feasibility for deployment in computing constrained clinical
environments. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of ICL as a
practical solution in oncology, particularly for rare cancers and
resource-limited contexts where fine-tuning is infeasible and annotated data is
difficult to obtain.

TLDR: 提出了一种多器官和多语言的超声报告生成统一框架，通过片段化多语言训练和标准化报告生成，显著提升了生成报告的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声报告生成因图像变异性、操作依赖性和标准化文本需求而具有挑战性，缺乏一致性数据集。

Method: 整合片段化多语言训练，利用标准化报告特性，通过双语数据集和选择性解冻视觉变换器（ViT）优化文本-图像对齐。

Result: 相比KMVE方法，BLEU提升约2%，ROUGE-L提升约3%，CIDEr提升约15%，显著减少错误内容。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在临床工作流中统一多器官和多语言报告生成的潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) report generation is a challenging task due to the
variability of US images, operator dependence, and the need for standardized
text. Unlike X-ray and CT, US imaging lacks consistent datasets, making
automation difficult. In this study, we propose a unified framework for
multi-organ and multilingual US report generation, integrating fragment-based
multilingual training and leveraging the standardized nature of US reports. By
aligning modular text fragments with diverse imaging data and curating a
bilingual English-Chinese dataset, the method achieves consistent and
clinically accurate text generation across organ sites and languages.
Fine-tuning with selective unfreezing of the vision transformer (ViT) further
improves text-image alignment. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art KMVE
method, our approach achieves relative gains of about 2\% in BLEU scores,
approximately 3\% in ROUGE-L, and about 15\% in CIDEr, while significantly
reducing errors such as missing or incorrect content. By unifying multi-organ
and multi-language report generation into a single, scalable framework, this
work demonstrates strong potential for real-world clinical workflows.

Conclusion: 共形预测方法需进一步改进以生成更符合人类预期的预测集，提高其在临床应用中的实用性。

Abstract: Deep learning based cervical cancer classification can potentially increase
access to screening in low-resource regions. However, deep learning models are
often overconfident and do not reliably reflect diagnostic uncertainty.
Moreover, they are typically optimized to generate maximum-likelihood
predictions, which fail to convey uncertainty or ambiguity in their results.
Such challenges can be addressed using conformal prediction, a model-agnostic
framework for generating prediction sets that contain likely classes for
trained deep-learning models. The size of these prediction sets indicates model
uncertainty, contracting as model confidence increases. However, existing
conformal prediction evaluation primarily focuses on whether the prediction set
includes or covers the true class, often overlooking the presence of extraneous
classes. We argue that prediction sets should be truthful and valuable to end
users, ensuring that the listed likely classes align with human expectations
rather than being overly relaxed and including false positives or unlikely
classes. In this study, we comprehensively validate conformal prediction sets
using expert annotation sets collected from multiple annotators. We evaluate
three conformal prediction approaches applied to three deep-learning models
trained for cervical atypia classification. Our expert annotation-based
analysis reveals that conventional coverage-based evaluations overestimate
performance and that current conformal prediction methods often produce
prediction sets that are not well aligned with human labels. Additionally, we
explore the capabilities of the conformal prediction methods in identifying
ambiguous and out-of-distribution data.

Motivation: 显微镜图像常受噪声和无关信号影响，现代去噪和恢复方法需求增加。

Result: Huber-ROF最灵活，TGV-$L^1$最适合去噪，方法适用于多种显微镜技术。

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性，Python代码已公开，便于集成到实验流程中。

Abstract: Experimentally acquired microscopy images are unavoidably affected by the
presence of noise and other unwanted signals, which degrade their quality and
might hide relevant features. With the recent increase in image acquisition
rate, modern denoising and restoration solutions become necessary. This study
focuses on image decomposition and denoising of microscopy images through a
workflow based on total variation (TV), addressing images obtained from various
microscopy techniques, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our
approach consists in restoring an image by extracting its unwanted signal
components and subtracting them from the raw one, or by denoising it. We
evaluate the performance of TV-$L^1$, Huber-ROF, and TGV-$L^1$ in achieving
this goal in distinct study cases. Huber-ROF proved to be the most flexible
one, while TGV-$L^1$ is the most suitable for denoising. Our results suggest a
wider applicability of this method in microscopy, restricted not only to STM,
AFM, and SEM images. The Python code used for this study is publicly available
as part of AiSurf. It is designed to be integrated into experimental workflows
for image acquisition or can be used to denoise previously acquired images.

TLDR: BiECVC是一种双向视频压缩框架，通过多样化上下文建模和自适应门控机制，显著提升了性能，首次在随机访问配置下超越VTM 13.2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双向视频压缩方法在上下文提取和动态适应性方面表现不足，导致性能落后于单向方法。

Method: BiECVC结合局部和非局部上下文建模，重用高质量特征并采用线性注意力机制，引入双向上下文门控动态过滤信息。

Result: BiECVC在随机访问配置下比特率分别降低13.4%和15.7%，首次在所有标准测试数据集上超越VTM 13.2。

Conclusion: BiECVC通过创新设计显著提升了双向视频压缩性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent forward prediction-based learned video compression (LVC) methods have
achieved impressive results, even surpassing VVC reference software VTM under
the Low Delay B (LDB) configuration. In contrast, learned bidirectional video
compression (BVC) remains underexplored and still lags behind its forward-only
counterparts. This performance gap is mainly due to the limited ability to
extract diverse and accurate contexts: most existing BVCs primarily exploit
temporal motion while neglecting non-local correlations across frames.
Moreover, they lack the adaptability to dynamically suppress harmful contexts
arising from fast motion or occlusion. To tackle these challenges, we propose
BiECVC, a BVC framework that incorporates diversified local and non-local
context modeling along with adaptive context gating. For local context
enhancement, BiECVC reuses high-quality features from lower layers and aligns
them using decoded motion vectors without introducing extra motion overhead.To
model non-local dependencies efficiently, we adopt a linear attention mechanism
that balances performance and complexity. To further mitigate the impact of
inaccurate context prediction, we introduce Bidirectional Context Gating,
inspired by data-dependent decay in recent autoregressive language models, to
dynamically filter contextual information based on conditional coding results.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiECVC achieves state-of-the-art
performance, reducing the bit-rate by 13.4% and 15.7% compared to VTM 13.2
under the Random Access (RA) configuration with intra periods of 32 and 64,
respectively. To our knowledge, BiECVC is the first learned video codec to
surpass VTM 13.2 RA across all standard test datasets. Code will be available
at https://github.com/JiangWeibeta/ECVC.

Result: 在HCP数据集上，Q-CATN在定量和定性上均优于现有方法（如1D-qDL、2D-qDL等），并能适应灵活的q空间采样。

Conclusion: Q-CATN是一种有潜力的工具，适用于临床和研究应用。

Abstract: This study, we propose a novel Q-space Guided Collaborative Attention
Translation Networks (Q-CATN) for multi-shell, high-angular resolution DWI
(MS-HARDI) synthesis from flexible q-space sampling, leveraging the commonly
acquired structural MRI data. Q-CATN employs a collaborative attention
mechanism to effectively extract complementary information from multiple
modalities and dynamically adjust its internal representations based on
flexible q-space information, eliminating the need for fixed sampling schemes.
Additionally, we introduce a range of task-specific constraints to preserve
anatomical fidelity in DWI, enabling Q-CATN to accurately learn the intrinsic
relationships between directional DWI signal distributions and q-space.
Extensive experiments on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate
that Q-CATN outperforms existing methods, including 1D-qDL, 2D-qDL, MESC-SD,
and QGAN, in estimating parameter maps and fiber tracts both quantitatively and
qualitatively, while preserving fine-grained details. Notably, its ability to
accommodate flexible q-space sampling highlights its potential as a promising
toolkit for clinical and research applications. Our code is available at

Motivation: 肺癌是全球癌症相关死亡的主要原因，早期检测和准确诊断对提高生存率至关重要。然而，深度学习模型（如CNN）在医疗领域的应用面临计算资源消耗大和缺乏透明度的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗领域提供了一种高效、透明的AI驱动诊断工具，有助于推动深度学习在肺癌检测中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, where early
detection and accurate diagnosis are critical for improving survival rates.
While deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has
revolutionized medical image analysis by detecting subtle patterns indicative
of early-stage lung cancer, its adoption faces challenges. These models are
often computationally expensive and require significant resources, making them
unsuitable for resource constrained environments. Additionally, their lack of
transparency hinders trust and broader adoption in sensitive fields like
healthcare. Knowledge distillation addresses these challenges by transferring
knowledge from large, complex models (teachers) to smaller, lightweight models
(students). We propose a knowledge distillation-based approach for lung cancer
detection, incorporating explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance model
transparency. Eight CNNs, including ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3,
and VGG16, are evaluated as teacher models. We developed and trained a
lightweight student model, Distilled Custom Student Network (DCSNet) using
ResNet50 as the teacher. This approach not only ensures high diagnostic
performance in resource-constrained settings but also addresses transparency
concerns, facilitating the adoption of AI-driven diagnostic tools in
healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率fMRI成本高且难以获取，而EEG广泛可用，因此开发一种从EEG生成fMRI的方法可以显著提升神经影像的可及性。

Method: 提出Spec2VolCAMU-Net，采用多方向时间-频率卷积注意力编码器和Vision-Mamba U-Net解码器，结合SSI-MSE损失函数进行端到端训练。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上取得了最佳SSIM和PSNR分数，分别提升了14.5%、14.9%、16.9%和4.6%。

Conclusion: Spec2VolCAMU-Net轻量高效，适合临床和研究中的实时应用。

Abstract: High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for
mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically
challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely
available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would
become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on
plain CNNs that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy
transformer/GAN decoders that strain memory and stability. We propose
Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight spectrogram-to-volume generator that confronts
these issues via a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention
Encoder, stacking temporal, spectral and joint convolutions with
self-attention, and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder whose linear-time state-space
blocks enable efficient long-range spatial modelling. Trained end-to-end with a
hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on
three public benchmarks, recording SSIMs of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball
and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9%
respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves
competitive PSNR scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a
4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in
reconstruction quality. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making
it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings. The
code is available at https://github.com/hdy6438/Spec2VolCAMU-Net.

Abstract: High-resolution slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) from multiple
motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D slices constitutes a critical step in
image-based diagnostics of moving subjects, such as fetal brain Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing solutions struggle with image artifacts and
severe subject motion or require slice pre-alignment to achieve satisfying
reconstruction performance. We propose a novel SVR method to enable fast and
accurate MRI reconstruction even in cases of severe image and motion
corruption. Our approach performs motion correction, outlier handling, and
super-resolution reconstruction with all operations being entirely based on
implicit neural representations. The model can be initialized with
task-specific priors through fully self-supervised meta-learning on either
simulated or real-world data. In extensive experiments including over 480
reconstructions of simulated and clinical MRI brain data from different
centers, we prove the utility of our method in cases of severe subject motion
and image artifacts. Our results demonstrate improvements in reconstruction
quality, especially in the presence of severe motion, compared to
state-of-the-art methods, and up to 50% reduction in reconstruction time.
