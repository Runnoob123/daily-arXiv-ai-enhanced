### [1] [Heterogeneous Graph Backdoor Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00191)
*Jiawei Chen,Lusi Li,Daniel Takabi,Masha Sosonkina,Rui Ning*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文首次研究了异构图神经网络（HGNNs）对后门攻击的脆弱性，并提出了一种新型的异构图后门攻击方法HGBA，通过关系型触发机制实现高效且隐蔽的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HGNNs在多领域复杂关系建模中表现出色，但其对后门攻击的脆弱性尚未被研究，存在攻击预算高、激活效率低和评估不准确等问题。

Method: 提出HGBA方法，采用关系型触发机制和特定的后门元路径，支持两种灵活的激活策略（Self-Node Attack和Indiscriminate Attack），并改进了攻击效果评估协议。

Result: HGBA在低攻击预算下高效攻击HGNNs，优于现有方法，且对节点特征扰动和防御机制表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HGBA不仅威胁HGNNs，还能扩展到同构图任务，对安全关键领域构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) excel in modeling complex,
multi-typed relationships across diverse domains, yet their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks remains unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first
investigation into the susceptibility of HGNNs to existing graph backdoor
attacks, revealing three critical issues: (1) high attack budget required for
effective backdoor injection, (2) inefficient and unreliable backdoor
activation, and (3) inaccurate attack effectiveness evaluation. To tackle these
issues, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Backdoor Attack (HGBA), the first
backdoor attack specifically designed for HGNNs, introducing a novel
relation-based trigger mechanism that establishes specific connections between
a strategically selected trigger node and poisoned nodes via the backdoor
metapath. HGBA achieves efficient and stealthy backdoor injection with minimal
structural modifications and supports easy backdoor activation through two
flexible strategies: Self-Node Attack and Indiscriminate Attack. Additionally,
we improve the ASR measurement protocol, enabling a more accurate assessment of
attack effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HGBA far surpasses
multiple state-of-the-art graph backdoor attacks in black-box settings,
efficiently attacking HGNNs with low attack budgets. Ablation studies show that
the strength of HBGA benefits from our trigger node selection method and
backdoor metapath selection strategy. In addition, HGBA shows superior
robustness against node feature perturbations and multiple types of existing
graph backdoor defense mechanisms. Finally, extension experiments demonstrate
that the relation-based trigger mechanism can effectively extend to tasks in
homogeneous graph scenarios, thereby posing severe threats to broader
security-critical domains.

### [2] [When GPT Spills the Tea: Comprehensive Assessment of Knowledge File Leakage in GPTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00197)
*Xinyue Shen,Yun Shen,Michael Backes,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文全面评估了GPT中知识文件泄露的风险，发现了五种泄露途径，并提出了解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明GPT可能泄露知识文件内容，但其他潜在泄露途径尚不明确，需全面评估风险。

Method: 采用数据安全态势管理（DSPM）的工作流程，分析了大量GPT元数据、数据流和响应。

Result: 识别了五种泄露途径，包括元数据、GPT初始化等，并发现Code Interpreter工具存在权限提升漏洞。

Conclusion: 为GPT构建者和平台提供商提供了可行的解决方案，以保护数据供应链安全。

Abstract: Knowledge files have been widely used in large language model (LLM) agents,
such as GPTs, to improve response quality. However, concerns about the
potential leakage of knowledge files have grown significantly. Existing studies
demonstrate that adversarial prompts can induce GPTs to leak knowledge file
content. Yet, it remains uncertain whether additional leakage vectors exist,
particularly given the complex data flows across clients, servers, and
databases in GPTs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive risk assessment of
knowledge file leakage, leveraging a novel workflow inspired by Data Security
Posture Management (DSPM). Through the analysis of 651,022 GPT metadata, 11,820
flows, and 1,466 responses, we identify five leakage vectors: metadata, GPT
initialization, retrieval, sandboxed execution environments, and prompts. These
vectors enable adversaries to extract sensitive knowledge file data such as
titles, content, types, and sizes. Notably, the activation of the built-in tool
Code Interpreter leads to a privilege escalation vulnerability, enabling
adversaries to directly download original knowledge files with a 95.95% success
rate. Further analysis reveals that 28.80% of leaked files are copyrighted,
including digital copies from major publishers and internal materials from a
listed company. In the end, we provide actionable solutions for GPT builders
and platform providers to secure the GPT data supply chain.

### [3] [Hush! Protecting Secrets During Model Training: An Indistinguishability Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00201)
*Arun Ganesh,Brendan McMahan,Milad Nasr,Thomas Steinke,Abhradeep Thakurta*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的秘密保护定义，替代差分隐私（DP），通过限制秘密重建的后验概率来保护数据，并提出了一种基于线性规划和泊松采样的算法，效果优于DP-SGD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分隐私（DP）在保护秘密信息时可能导致效用损失或需要大数据集，而数据拥有者和数据管理者为同一实体时，这种严格保护可能不必要。

Method: 提出新的秘密保护定义，通过线性规划分配样本权重，并使用泊松采样进行模型训练。

Result: 新算法在秘密保护效果上显著优于传统的DP-SGD方法。

Conclusion: 新方法在保护秘密信息的同时，避免了DP的严格限制，提供了更高的实用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of secret protection, in which a business or
organization wishes to train a model on their own data, while attempting to not
leak secrets potentially contained in that data via the model. The standard
method for training models to avoid memorization of secret information is via
differential privacy (DP). However, DP requires a large loss in utility or a
large dataset to achieve its strict privacy definition, which may be
unnecessary in our setting where the data curator and data owner are the same
entity. We propose an alternate definition of secret protection that instead of
targeting DP, instead targets a bound on the posterior probability of secret
reconstruction. We then propose and empirically evaluate an algorithm for model
training with this secret protection definition. Our algorithm solves a linear
program to assign weights to examples based on the desired per-secret
protections, and then performs Poisson sampling using these weights. We show
our algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline of running DP-SGD on the
whole dataset.

### [4] [Compact and Selective Disclosure for Verifiable Credentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00262)
*Alessandro Buldini,Carlo Mazzocca,Rebecca Montanari,Selcuk Uluagac*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为CSD-JWT的新机制，用于实现Verifiable Credentials（VCs）的紧凑和选择性披露，显著节省内存和网络开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-Sovereign Identity（SSI）模型赋予个人对其数据的完全控制权，但现有技术在隐私保护和资源效率方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 利用密码学累加器将凭证中的声明编码为唯一紧凑表示，并实现为开源解决方案。

Result: CSD-JWT显著减少内存使用（高达46%）和网络开销（VP大小减少27%-93%）。

Conclusion: CSD-JWT特别适合资源受限设备，如硬件钱包，为SSI提供了高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a novel identity model that empowers
individuals with full control over their data, enabling them to choose what
information to disclose, with whom, and when. This paradigm is rapidly gaining
traction worldwide, supported by numerous initiatives such as the European
Digital Identity (EUDI) Regulation or Singapore's National Digital Identity
(NDI). For instance, by 2026, the EUDI Regulation will enable all European
citizens to seamlessly access services across Europe using Verifiable
Credentials (VCs). A key feature of SSI is the ability to selectively disclose
only specific claims within a credential, enhancing privacy protection of the
identity owner. This paper proposes a novel mechanism designed to achieve
Compact and Selective Disclosure for VCs (CSD-JWT). Our method leverages a
cryptographic accumulator to encode claims within a credential to a unique,
compact representation. We implemented CSD-JWT as an open-source solution and
extensively evaluated its performance under various conditions. CSD-JWT
provides significant memory savings, reducing usage by up to 46% compared to
the state-of-the-art. It also minimizes network overhead by producing
remarkably smaller Verifiable Presentations (VPs), reduced in size by 27% to
93%. Such features make CSD-JWT especially well-suited for resource-constrained
devices, including hardware wallets designed for managing credentials.

### [5] [Chances and Challenges of the Model Context Protocol in Digital Forensics and Incident Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00274)
*Jan-Niclas Hilgert,Carlo Jakobs,Michael Külper,Martin Lambertz,Axel Mahr,Elmar Padilla*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文探讨了如何通过新兴的Model Context Protocol（MCP）解决大语言模型（LLMs）在数字取证中的透明度、可解释性和可重复性问题，并分析了其潜在应用和挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数字取证中具有潜力，但缺乏透明度、可解释性和可重复性限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 通过理论分析，探讨MCP如何整合到多种取证场景中，并提出了技术及概念上的部署考虑。

Result: MCP不仅能增强现有取证流程，还能扩展LLMs的应用范围，同时通过推理约束级别提升可审计性和可追溯性。

Conclusion: MCP作为LLM辅助取证的基础组件具有显著潜力，但也面临未来可能的技术和法律挑战。

Abstract: Large language models hold considerable promise for supporting forensic
investigations, but their widespread adoption is hindered by a lack of
transparency, explainability, and reproducibility. This paper explores how the
emerging Model Context Protocol can address these challenges and support the
meaningful use of LLMs in digital forensics. Through a theoretical analysis, we
examine how MCP can be integrated across various forensic scenarios - ranging
from artifact analysis to the generation of interpretable reports. We also
outline both technical and conceptual considerations for deploying an MCP
server in forensic environments. Our analysis reveals a wide range of use cases
in which MCP not only strengthens existing forensic workflows but also
facilitates the application of LLMs to areas of forensics where their use was
previously limited. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the inference
constraint level - a way of characterizing how specific MCP design choices can
deliberately constrain model behavior, thereby enhancing both auditability and
traceability. Our insights demonstrate that MCP has significant potential as a
foundational component for developing LLM-assisted forensic workflows that are
not only more transparent, reproducible, and legally defensible, but also
represent a step toward increased automation in digital forensic analysis.
However, we also highlight potential challenges that the adoption of MCP may
pose for digital forensics in the future.

*Matthew Hull,Haoyang Yang,Pratham Mehta,Mansi Phute,Aeree Cho,Haoran Wang,Matthew Lau,Wenke Lee,Willian T. Lunardi,Martin Andreoni,Polo Chau*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文介绍了两种针对3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的攻击方法：CLOAK和DAGGER，揭示了3DGS在安全关键应用中的潜在漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着3DGS在安全关键应用中的广泛使用，研究其潜在攻击方式以揭示安全漏洞变得至关重要。

Method: CLOAK利用视角依赖的高斯外观嵌入对抗内容；DAGGER直接扰动3D高斯数据，欺骗多阶段目标检测器。

Result: 攻击成功展示了3DGS的未探索漏洞，威胁到自动驾驶等安全关键应用。

Conclusion: 研究强调了3DGS的安全风险，呼吁进一步研究以防范此类攻击。

Abstract: With 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) being increasingly used in safety-critical
applications, how can an adversary manipulate the scene to cause harm? We
introduce CLOAK, the first attack that leverages view-dependent Gaussian
appearances - colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed
adversarial content visible only from specific viewpoints. We further
demonstrate DAGGER, a targeted adversarial attack directly perturbing 3D
Gaussians without access to underlying training data, deceiving multi-stage
object detectors e.g., Faster R-CNN, through established methods such as
projected gradient descent. These attacks highlight underexplored
vulnerabilities in 3DGS, introducing a new potential threat to robotic learning
for autonomous navigation and other safety-critical 3DGS applications.

Motivation: 研究RAG系统的行业应用趋势及其面临的安全威胁。

Method: 识别主要攻击向量（提示注入、数据污染、对抗性查询操纵），并提出风险缓解措施。

Result: 提出包含输入验证、对抗训练和实时监控的优先控制列表。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which integrate Large Language
Models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources, are vulnerable to a range of
adversarial attack vectors. This paper examines the importance of RAG systems
through recent industry adoption trends and identifies the prominent attack
vectors for RAG: prompt injection, data poisoning, and adversarial query
manipulation. We analyze these threats under risk management lens, and propose
robust prioritized control list that includes risk-mitigating actions like
input validation, adversarial training, and real-time monitoring.

### [8] [Data Flows in You: Benchmarking and Improving Static Data-flow Analysis on Binary Executables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00313)
*Nicolaas Weideman,Sima Arasteh,Mukund Raghothaman,Jelena Mirkovic,Christophe Hauser*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文通过引入标记基准数据集评估二进制数据流分析的准确性，发现现有工具精度低，并提出三种模型扩展显著提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二进制数据流分析在理论上不可判定，实践中缺乏对其准确性和局限性的理解。

Method: 创建包含215,072个微基准测试用例的数据集，评估三种工具（angr、Ghidra、Miasm）的准确性，并提出三种模型扩展。

Result: 现有工具精度极低（0.13），模型扩展后召回率接近完美（0.99），精度提升至0.32。

Conclusion: 模型扩展显著提升数据流分析精度，并在漏洞发现中实际改善指令识别。

Abstract: Data-flow analysis is a critical component of security research.
Theoretically, accurate data-flow analysis in binary executables is an
undecidable problem, due to complexities of binary code. Practically, many
binary analysis engines offer some data-flow analysis capability, but we lack
understanding of the accuracy of these analyses, and their limitations. We
address this problem by introducing a labeled benchmark data set, including
215,072 microbenchmark test cases, mapping to 277,072 binary executables,
created specifically to evaluate data-flow analysis implementations.
Additionally, we augment our benchmark set with dynamically-discovered data
flows from 6 real-world executables. Using our benchmark data set, we evaluate
three state of the art data-flow analysis implementations, in angr, Ghidra and
Miasm and discuss their very low accuracy and reasons behind it. We further
propose three model extensions to static data-flow analysis that significantly
improve accuracy, achieving almost perfect recall (0.99) and increasing
precision from 0.13 to 0.32. Finally, we show that leveraging these model
extensions in a vulnerability-discovery context leads to a tangible improvement
in vulnerable instruction identification.

### [9] [Local Frames: Exploiting Inherited Origins to Bypass Content Blockers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00317)
*Alisha Ukani,Hamed Haddadi,Alex C. Snoeren,Peter Snyder*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 研究发现，流行的Web安全和隐私工具在处理本地框架（如非URL源的iframe）时存在漏洞，导致用户仍易受攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨隐私工具在处理本地框架时的漏洞，揭示其未能有效保护用户免受指纹识别、跟踪和数据泄露等问题。

Method: 研究四种隐私工具的核心功能，设计测试方法检测本地框架的规避能力，并应用于六种流行工具。

Result: 发现19个漏洞，56%的网站使用本地框架，73.7%的请求应被拦截但未触发漏洞。

Conclusion: 漏洞源于遗留功能与隐私边界的意外交互，需改进工具设计以提升安全性。

Abstract: We present a study of how local frames (i.e., iframes with non-URL sources
like "about:blank") are mishandled by a wide range of popular Web security and
privacy tools. As a result, users of these tools remain vulnerable to the very
attack techniques they seek to protect against, including browser
fingerprinting, cookie-based tracking, and data exfiltration. The tools we
study are vulnerable in different ways, but all share a root cause: legacy Web
functionality interacting with browser privacy boundaries in unexpected ways,
leading to systemic vulnerabilities in tools developed, maintained, and
recommended by privacy experts and activists.
  We consider four core capabilities supported by most privacy tools and
develop tests to determine whether each can be evaded through the use of local
frames. We apply our tests to six popular Web privacy and security tools,
identifying at least one vulnerability in each for a total of 19, and extract
common patterns regarding their mishandling of local frames. Our measurement of
popular websites finds that 56% employ local frames and that 73.7% of the
requests made by these local frames should be blocked by popular filter lists
but instead trigger the vulnerabilities we identify; from another perspective,
14.3% of all sites that we crawl make requests that should be blocked inside of
local frames. We disclosed the vulnerabilities to the tool authors and discuss
both our experiences working with them to patch their products and the
implications of our findings for other privacy and security research.

TLDR: 论文揭示了基于微调的遗忘技术中的漏洞，提出了一种隐蔽攻击（SA）方法，并提出了范围感知遗忘（SU）解决方案以增强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大型语言模型（LLM）训练中敏感或有害数据的滥用问题，遗忘技术被开发出来，但现有方法存在漏洞，可能被恶意利用。

Method: 通过隐蔽攻击（SA）展示漏洞，并提出范围感知遗忘（SU）方法，通过引入范围项来限制遗忘效果。

Result: 实验验证了SA的有效性，同时SU显著提升了模型对攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SU是一种轻量级增强方法，无需额外数据处理，可无缝集成现有框架，有效应对隐蔽攻击。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, growing concerns have emerged over
the misuse of sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful data during training. To
address these concerns, unlearning techniques have been developed to remove the
influence of specific data without retraining from scratch. However, this paper
reveals a critical vulnerability in fine-tuning-based unlearning: a malicious
user can craft a manipulated forgetting request that stealthily degrades the
model's utility for benign users. We demonstrate this risk through a
red-teaming Stealthy Attack (SA), which is inspired by two key limitations of
existing unlearning (the inability to constrain the scope of unlearning effect
and the failure to distinguish benign tokens from unlearning signals). Prior
work has shown that unlearned models tend to memorize forgetting data as
unlearning signals, and respond with hallucinations or feigned ignorance when
unlearning signals appear in the input. By subtly increasing the presence of
common benign tokens in the forgetting data, SA enhances the connection between
benign tokens and unlearning signals. As a result, when normal users include
such tokens in their prompts, the model exhibits unlearning behaviors, leading
to unintended utility degradation. To address this vulnerability, we propose
Scope-aware Unlearning (SU), a lightweight enhancement that introduces a scope
term into the unlearning objective, encouraging the model to localize the
forgetting effect. Our method requires no additional data processing,
integrates seamlessly with existing fine-tuning frameworks, and significantly
improves robustness against SA. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of both SA and SU.

Abstract: Passwords remain one of the most common methods for securing sensitive data
in the digital age. However, weak password choices continue to pose significant
risks to data security and privacy. This study aims to solve the problem by
focusing on developing robust password strength estimation models using
adversarial machine learning, a technique that trains models on intentionally
crafted deceptive passwords to expose and address vulnerabilities posed by such
passwords. We apply five classification algorithms and use a dataset with more
than 670,000 samples of adversarial passwords to train the models. Results
demonstrate that adversarial training improves password strength classification
accuracy by up to 20% compared to traditional machine learning models. It
highlights the importance of integrating adversarial machine learning into
security systems to enhance their robustness against modern adaptive threats.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised a new
challenge for developers since it is prone to known and unknown cyberattacks
due to its heterogeneity, flexibility, and close connectivity. To defend
against such security breaches, researchers have focused on building
sophisticated intrusion detection systems (IDSs) using machine learning (ML)
techniques. Although these algorithms notably improve detection performance,
they require excessive computing power and resources, which are crucial issues
in IoT networks considering the recent trends of decentralized data processing
and computing systems. Consequently, many optimization techniques have been
incorporated with these ML models. Specifically, a special category of
optimizer adopted from the behavior of living creatures and different aspects
of natural phenomena, known as metaheuristic algorithms, has been a central
focus in recent years and brought about remarkable results. Considering this
vital significance, we present a comprehensive and systematic review of various
applications of metaheuristics algorithms in developing a machine
learning-based IDS, especially for IoT. A significant contribution of this
study is the discovery of hidden correlations between these optimization
techniques and machine learning models integrated with state-of-the-art
IoT-IDSs. In addition, the effectiveness of these metaheuristic algorithms in
different applications, such as feature selection, parameter or hyperparameter
tuning, and hybrid usages are separately analyzed. Moreover, a taxonomy of
existing IoT-IDSs is proposed. Furthermore, we investigate several critical
issues related to such integration. Our extensive exploration ends with a
discussion of promising optimization algorithms and technologies that can
enhance the efficiency of IoT-IDSs.

Abstract: LLM generated code often contains security issues. We address two key
challenges in improving secure code generation. First, obtaining high quality
training data covering a broad set of security issues is critical. To address
this, we introduce a method for distilling a preference dataset of insecure and
secure code pairs from frontier LLMs, along with a security reasoning that
explains the issues and the fix. The key idea here is to make use of security
knowledge sources to devise a systematic prompting strategy that ensures broad
coverage. Second, aligning models to secure code requires focusing on localized
regions of code. Direct preference optimization methods, like SimPO, are not
designed to handle these localized differences and turn out to be ineffective.
We address this with a new localized preference optimization algorithm that
masks the security related tokens in both the winning (secure) and losing
(insecure) responses. To prevent loss in code quality, we also add a
regularizer. Evaluations show that both training on our dataset, DiSCo, and the
new preference optimization algorithm, LPO, yield substantial reductions in
code insecurity while also improving overall code quality. Code and dataset are
available at https://github.com/StonyBrookNLP/disco-lpo.

Conclusion: 建议未来研究自动化管理、多云集成和数据隐私问题。

Abstract: The pervasive use of hybrid cloud computing models has changed enterprise as
well as Information Technology services infrastructure by giving businesses
simple and cost-effective options of combining on-premise IT equipment with
public cloud services. hybrid cloud solutions deploy multifaceted models of
security, performance optimization, and cost efficiency, conventionally
fragmented in the cloud computing milieu. This paper examines how organizations
manage these parameters in hybrid cloud ecosystems while providing solutions to
the challenges they face in operationalizing hybrid cloud adoptions. The study
captures the challenges of achieving a balance in resource distribution between
on-premise and cloud resources (herein referred to as the "resource allocation
challenge"), the complexity of pricing models from cloud providers like AWS,
Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud (herein called the 'pricing complexity problem'),
and the urgency for strong security infrastructure to safeguard sensitive
information (known as 'the information security problem'). This study
demonstrates the security and performance management solutions proposed were
validated in a detailed case study of adoption of AWS and Azure based hybrid
cloud and provides useful guidance. Also, a hybrid cloud security and cost
optimization framework based on zero trust architecture, encryption, hybrid
cloud policies, and others, is proposed.
  The conclusion includes recommendations for research on automation of hybrid
cloud service management, integration of multi-clouds, and the ever-present
question of data privacy, stressing how those matters affect contemporary
enterprises.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件模糊测试在自动化验证中具有潜力，但与工业应用仍存在差距，本文旨在填补这一差距。

Method: 回顾硬件模糊测试方法并分析其工业兼容性，评估现有工具支持，提出原型HwFuzzEnv以解决性能瓶颈。

Result: HwFuzzEnv使硬件模糊测试在工业环境中实现数百倍加速。

Conclusion: 本文为EDA公司提供了参考，鼓励其优化工具以支持工业验证中的硬件模糊测试。

Abstract: As hardware design complexity increases, hardware fuzzing emerges as a
promising tool for automating the verification process. However, a significant
gap still exists before it can be applied in industry. This paper aims to
summarize the current progress of hardware fuzzing from an industry-use
perspective and propose solutions to bridge the gap between hardware fuzzing
and industrial verification. First, we review recent hardware fuzzing methods
and analyze their compatibilities with industrial verification. We establish
criteria to assess whether a hardware fuzzing approach is compatible. Second,
we examine whether current verification tools can efficiently support hardware
fuzzing. We identify the bottlenecks in hardware fuzzing performance caused by
insufficient support from the industrial environment. To overcome the
bottlenecks, we propose a prototype, HwFuzzEnv, providing the necessary support
for hardware fuzzing. With this prototype, the previous hardware fuzzing method
can achieve a several hundred times speedup in industrial settings. Our work
could serve as a reference for EDA companies, encouraging them to enhance their
tools to support hardware fuzzing efficiently in industrial verification.

TLDR: ZK Rollups 能显著提升以太坊的交易处理能力，实验证明每秒可处理71笔交易，远高于以太坊的12笔。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决以太坊的可扩展性问题，促进去中心化应用（dApps）的采用。

Method: 通过构建概念验证（PoC）测试ZK Rollups在去中心化金融（DeFi）中的性能，包括负载均衡器生成代币交换。

Result: ZK Rollups每秒可处理71笔代币交换交易，而以太坊仅能处理12笔普通交易。

Conclusion: ZK Rollups在提升以太坊性能方面具有潜力，但需权衡交易最终性和安全性，未来需进一步整合到以太坊生态中。

Abstract: Ethereum's scalability limitations pose significant challenges for the
adoption of decentralized applications (dApps). Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK
Rollups) present a promising solution, bundling transactions off-chain and
submitting validity proofs on-chain to enhance throughput and efficiency. In
this work, we examine the technical underpinnings of ZK Rollups and stress test
their performance in real-world applications in decentralized finance (DeFi).
We set up a proof-of-concept (PoC) consisting of ZK rollup and decentralized
exchange, and implement load balancer generating token swaps. Our results show
that the rollup can process up to 71 swap transactions per second, compared to
12 general transaction by Ethereum. We further analyze transaction finality
trade-offs with related security concerns, and discuss the future directions
for integrating ZK Rollups into Ethereum's broader ecosystem.

*Tzu-Shen Wang,Jimmy Dani,Juan Garay,Soamar Homsi,Nitesh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种高效的安全多方计算（MPC）协议，支持在多数参与者不诚实的情况下提供强安全性，具备完全可识别性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MPC协议如SPDZ仅支持安全中止，而Cunningham等人的协议虽实现完全可识别性但效率低下。本文旨在设计一个兼具高效性和强安全性的协议。

Method: 基于Rivinius等人的方法，采用基于格的承诺方案提升效率，并引入半诚实第三方实现鲁棒性。

Result: 协议在恶意行为检测后无需重启即可继续计算，且在ML-as-a-service场景中验证了其性能。

Conclusion: 尽管效率略低于SPDZ，但本文协议提供了更强的安全性，适用于需要高安全性的场景。

Abstract: In this work, we present an efficient secure multi-party computation MPC
protocol that provides strong security guarantees in settings with dishonest
majority of participants who may behave arbitrarily. Unlike the popular MPC
implementation known as SPDZ [Crypto '12], which only ensures security with
abort, our protocol achieves both complete identifiability and robustness. With
complete identifiability, honest parties can detect and unanimously agree on
the identity of any malicious party. Robustness allows the protocol to continue
with the computation without requiring a restart, even when malicious behavior
is detected. Additionally, our approach addresses the performance limitations
observed in the protocol by Cunningham et al. [ICITS '17], which, while
achieving complete identifiability, is hindered by the costly exponentiation
operations required by the choice of commitment scheme.
  Our protocol is based on the approach by Rivinius et al. [S&P '22], utilizing
lattice-based commitment for better efficiency. We achieved robustness with the
help of a semi-honest trusted third party. We benchmark our robust protocol,
showing the efficient recovery from parties' malicious behavior.
  Finally, we benchmark our protocol on a ML-as-a-service scenario, wherein
clients off-load the desired computation to the servers, and verify the
computation result. We benchmark on linear ML inference, running on various
datasets. While our efficiency is slightly lower compared to SPDZ's, we offer
stronger security properties that provide distinct advantages.

TLDR: 压缩型视觉语言投影器（VLP）安全性较差，易受攻击；非压缩型VLP安全性强，适合提升视觉语言模型的安全性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究主流VLP（压缩与非压缩型）的安全性差异，为选择更安全的VLP提供依据。

Method: 通过全面评估压缩和非压缩型VLP的安全性能。

Result: 压缩型VLP存在显著漏洞，易被攻击；非压缩型VLP安全性强。

Conclusion: 非压缩型VLP更适合提升视觉语言模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: The choice of a suitable visual language projector (VLP) is critical to the
successful training of large visual language models (LVLMs). Mainstream VLPs
can be broadly categorized into compressed and uncompressed projectors, and
each offering distinct advantages in performance and computational efficiency.
However, their security implications have not been thoroughly examined. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals significant differences in their security
profiles: compressed projectors exhibit substantial vulnerabilities, allowing
adversaries to successfully compromise LVLMs even with minimal knowledge of
structural information. In stark contrast, uncompressed projectors demonstrate
robust security properties and do not introduce additional vulnerabilities.
These findings provide critical guidance for researchers in selecting optimal
VLPs that enhance the security and reliability of visual language models. The
code will be released.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新型攻击方法Con Instruction，通过对抗性图像或音频绕过多模态语言模型的安全机制，无需训练数据或文本预处理，攻击成功率显著提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击多模态语言模型的方法主要通过文本和对抗性图像结合，而本文旨在利用模型对非文本指令的理解能力，揭示其潜在安全漏洞。

Method: 提出Con Instruction方法，优化对抗性示例以在嵌入空间中与目标指令对齐，并引入ARC框架评估攻击效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个模型（如LLaVA-v1.5）上攻击成功率达81.3%和86.6%，显著高于现有方法。

Conclusion: Con Instruction有效揭示了多模态语言模型的安全缺陷，现有防御技术存在明显性能差距。

Abstract: Existing attacks against multimodal language models (MLLMs) primarily
communicate instructions through text accompanied by adversarial images. In
contrast, we exploit the capabilities of MLLMs to interpret non-textual
instructions, specifically, adversarial images or audio generated by our novel
method, Con Instruction. We optimize these adversarial examples to align
closely with target instructions in the embedding space, revealing the
detrimental implications of MLLMs' sophisticated understanding. Unlike prior
work, our method does not require training data or preprocessing of textual
instructions. While these non-textual adversarial examples can effectively
bypass MLLM safety mechanisms, their combination with various text inputs
substantially amplifies attack success. We further introduce a new Attack
Response Categorization (ARC) framework, which evaluates both the quality of
the model's response and its relevance to the malicious instructions.
Experimental results demonstrate that Con Instruction effectively bypasses
safety mechanisms in multiple vision- and audio-language models, including
LLaVA-v1.5, InternVL, Qwen-VL, and Qwen-Audio, evaluated on two standard
benchmarks: AdvBench and SafeBench. Specifically, our method achieves the
highest attack success rates, reaching 81.3% and 86.6% on LLaVA-v1.5 (13B). On
the defense side, we explore various countermeasures against our attacks and
uncover a substantial performance gap among existing techniques. Our
implementation is made publicly available.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于环形拓扑的多方私有集合交集（MPSI）协议，解决了现有星型和网状拓扑协议的高负载和高通信复杂度问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有MPSI协议中，星型拓扑导致领导节点负载高，网状拓扑通信复杂度和开销大，亟需改进。

Method: 提出了一种多点多步顺序伪随机函数（MP-SOPRF），并基于此开发了环形拓扑的MPSI协议。

Result: 协议在半诚实安全模型下被证明有效，实验显示通信减少74.8%，计算效率提升6%至287%。

Conclusion: 环形拓扑MPSI协议在通信和计算效率上显著优于现有协议。

Abstract: Multiparty private set intersection (MPSI) allows multiple participants to
compute the intersection of their locally owned data sets without revealing
them. MPSI protocols can be categorized based on the network topology of nodes,
with the star, mesh, and ring topologies being the primary types, respectively.
Given that star and mesh topologies dominate current implementations, most
existing MPSI protocols are based on these two topologies. However,
star-topology MPSI protocols suffer from high leader node load, while mesh
topology protocols suffer from high communication complexity and overhead. In
this paper, we first propose a multi-point sequential oblivious pseudorandom
function (MP-SOPRF) in a multi-party setting. Based on MP-SOPRF, we then
develop an MPSI protocol with a ring topology, addressing the challenges of
communication and computational overhead in existing protocols. We prove that
our MPSI protocol is semi-honest secure under the Hamming correlation
robustness assumption. Our experiments demonstrate that our MPSI protocol
outperforms state-of-the-art protocols, achieving a reduction of 74.8% in
communication and a 6% to 287% improvement in computational efficiency.

Result: 在公开数据集上，模型在有限数据下表现良好，数据充足时优于现有方法，F1得分为0.76，误报率降低55%。

Conclusion: Amatriciana是一种有效的洗钱检测方法，尤其在减少误报方面表现突出。

Abstract: Money laundering is a financial crime that poses a serious threat to
financial integrity and social security. The growing number of transactions
makes it necessary to use automatic tools that help law enforcement agencies
detect such criminal activity. In this work, we present Amatriciana, a novel
approach based on Graph Neural Networks to detect money launderers inside a
graph of transactions by considering temporal information. Amatriciana uses the
whole graph of transactions without splitting it into several time-based
subgraphs, exploiting all relational information in the dataset. Our
experiments on a public dataset reveal that the model can learn from a limited
amount of data. Furthermore, when more data is available, the model outperforms
other State-of-the-art approaches; in particular, Amatriciana decreases the
number of False Positives (FPs) while detecting many launderers. In summary,
Amatriciana achieves an F1 score of 0.76. In addition, it lowers the FPs by 55%
with respect to other State-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 现有加壳程序识别方法存在灵活性不足、对抗动态规避能力差或需要大量训练数据的问题，亟需一种准确且适应性强的新方法。

Method: 采用图匹配网络和聚类技术，匹配和分组已知加壳程序的调用图。

Result: 在公开数据集上，PackHero仅需10个样本即可达到93.7%的F1分数，100个样本时提升至98.3%，对虚拟化加壳程序（如Themida/Winlicense）召回率达100%。

Conclusion: PackHero在性能和适应性上优于现有方法，为加壳程序识别提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Anti-analysis techniques, particularly packing, challenge malware analysts,
making packer identification fundamental. Existing packer identifiers have
significant limitations: signature-based methods lack flexibility and struggle
against dynamic evasion, while Machine Learning approaches require extensive
training data, limiting scalability and adaptability. Consequently, achieving
accurate and adaptable packer identification remains an open problem. This
paper presents PackHero, a scalable and efficient methodology for identifying
packers using a novel static approach. PackHero employs a Graph Matching
Network and clustering to match and group Call Graphs from programs packed with
known packers. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset of malware and
benign samples packed with various packers, demonstrating its effectiveness and
scalability across varying sample sizes. PackHero achieves a macro-average
F1-score of 93.7% with just 10 samples per packer, improving to 98.3% with 100
samples. Notably, PackHero requires fewer samples to achieve stable performance
compared to other Machine Learning-based tools. Overall, PackHero matches the
performance of State-of-the-art signature-based tools, outperforming them in
handling Virtualization-based packers such as Themida/Winlicense, with a recall
of 100%.

Conclusion: 该区块链-物联网框架有效解决了核数据管理中保密性与透明性的冲突，提升了核废料运输的安全性、透明性和效率。

Abstract: This study addresses critical challenges in managing the transportation of
spent nuclear fuel, including inadequate data transparency, stringent
confidentiality requirements, and a lack of trust among collaborating parties,
issues prevalent in traditional centralized management systems. Given the high
risks involved, balancing data confidentiality with regulatory transparency is
imperative. To overcome these limitations, a prototype system integrating
blockchain technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed, featuring a
multi-tiered consortium chain architecture. This system utilizes IoT sensors
for real-time data collection, which is immutably recorded on the blockchain,
while a hierarchical data structure (operational, supervisory, and public
layers) manages access for diverse stakeholders. The results demonstrate that
this approach significantly enhances data immutability, enables real-time
multi-sensor data integration, improves decentralized transparency, and
increases resilience compared to traditional systems. Ultimately, this
blockchain-IoT framework improves the safety, transparency, and efficiency of
spent fuel transportation, effectively resolving the conflict between
confidentiality and transparency in nuclear data management and offering
significant practical implications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Web客户端指纹识别在欺诈检测和个性化体验中有益，但其持久跟踪和用户画像能力引发了隐私问题。本文旨在开发一种更有效的指纹识别方法。

Method: 利用WebAssembly的计算能力，结合CPU、内存和I/O任务，捕捉浏览器行为的细微差异，实现高精度设备识别。

Result: 在多种平台和环境下验证，误报率低于1%，显著提高了识别准确性。

Conclusion: WebAssembly指纹识别方法高效且准确，同时提出了缓解隐私风险的策略，可能为未来浏览器设计提供参考。

Abstract: Web client fingerprinting has become a widely used technique for uniquely
identifying users, browsers, operating systems, and devices with high accuracy.
While it is beneficial for applications such as fraud detection and
personalized experiences, it also raises privacy concerns by enabling
persistent tracking and detailed user profiling. This paper introduces an
advanced fingerprinting method using WebAssembly (Wasm) - a low-level
programming language that offers near-native execution speed in modern web
browsers. With broad support across major browsers and growing adoption,
WebAssembly provides a strong foundation for developing more effective
fingerprinting methods.
  In this work, we present a new approach that leverages WebAssembly's
computational capabilities to identify returning devices-such as smartphones,
tablets, laptops, and desktops across different browsing sessions. Our method
uses subtle differences in the WebAssembly JavaScript API implementation to
distinguish between Chromium-based browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft
Edge, even when identifiers such as the User-Agent are completely spoofed,
achieving a false-positive rate of less than 1%. The fingerprint is generated
using a combination of CPU-bound operations, memory tasks, and I/O activities
to capture unique browser behaviors. We validate this approach on a variety of
platforms, including Intel, AMD, and ARM CPUs, operating systems such as
Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS, and in environments like VMWare, KVM, and
VirtualBox. Extensive evaluation shows that WebAssembly-based fingerprinting
significantly improves identification accuracy. We also propose mitigation
strategies to reduce the privacy risks associated with this method, which could
be integrated into future browser designs to better protect user privacy.

Motivation: 量子计算机威胁现有加密算法，但移动应用生态尚未准备好过渡到后量子加密（PQC）。

Method: 对4000多个Android应用进行大规模二进制分析，评估加密准备情况，并尝试用LLM辅助迁移。

Result: 应用广泛依赖MD5、SHA-1和RSA等易受攻击算法，PQC采用为零。LLM能完成简单哈希替换，但无法正确升级到PQC。

Conclusion: 需要结构化指导和系统感知工具来支持后量子加密迁移。

Abstract: Quantum computers threaten widely deployed cryptographic primitives such as
RSA, DSA, and ECC. While NIST has released post-quantum cryptographic (PQC)
standards (e.g., Kyber, Dilithium), mobile app ecosystems remain largely
unprepared for this transition. We present a large-scale binary analysis of
over 4,000 Android apps to assess cryptographic readiness. Our results show
widespread reliance on quantum-vulnerable algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, and
RSA, while PQC adoption remains absent in production apps. To bridge the
readiness gap, we explore LLM-assisted migration. We evaluate leading LLMs
(GPT-4o, Gemini Flash, Claude Sonnet, etc.) for automated cryptographic
migration. All models successfully performed simple hash replacements (e.g.,
SHA-1 to SHA-256). However, none produced correct PQC upgrades due to
multi-file changes, missing imports, and lack of context awareness. These
results underscore the need for structured guidance and system-aware tooling
for post-quantum migration

Motivation: 现有GFMs（如ESM）在变异效应预测中表现优异，但其对抗鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用FGSM和软提示攻击两种方法评估GFMs的对抗脆弱性。

Result: 软提示攻击导致ESM1b和ESM1v等大型模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GFMs的安全漏洞，为提升其在高风险基因组应用中的鲁棒性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs), such as Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM),
have demonstrated significant success in variant effect prediction. However,
their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored. To address this gap,
we propose SafeGenes: a framework for Secure analysis of genomic foundation
models, leveraging adversarial attacks to evaluate robustness against both
engineered near-identical adversarial Genes and embedding-space manipulations.
In this study, we assess the adversarial vulnerabilities of GFMs using two
approaches: the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and a soft prompt attack. FGSM
introduces minimal perturbations to input sequences, while the soft prompt
attack optimizes continuous embeddings to manipulate model predictions without
modifying the input tokens. By combining these techniques, SafeGenes provides a
comprehensive assessment of GFM susceptibility to adversarial manipulation.
Targeted soft prompt attacks led to substantial performance degradation, even
in large models such as ESM1b and ESM1v. These findings expose critical
vulnerabilities in current foundation models, opening new research directions
toward improving their security and robustness in high-stakes genomic
applications such as variant effect prediction.

Motivation: 现有交通CPS威胁建模框架范围有限、资源密集且依赖专家知识，TraCR-TMF旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 采用三种LLM方法（RAG、上下文学习、监督微调）和MITRE ATT&CK矩阵识别威胁与对策，并通过定制LLM分析漏洞。

Result: 在两种场景中验证，识别攻击技术的精确度达90%，并成功预测真实网络攻击中的多种利用行为。

Conclusion: TraCR-TMF在CPS威胁建模中表现高效，减少对专家知识的依赖，并具有跨领域适应性。

Abstract: Modern transportation systems rely on cyber-physical systems (CPS), where
cyber systems interact seamlessly with physical systems like
transportation-related sensors and actuators to enhance safety, mobility, and
energy efficiency. However, growing automation and connectivity increase
exposure to cyber vulnerabilities. Existing threat modeling frameworks for
transportation CPS are often limited in scope, resource-intensive, and
dependent on significant cybersecurity expertise. To address these gaps, we
present TraCR-TMF (Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency Threat Modeling
Framework), a large language model (LLM)-based framework that minimizes expert
intervention. TraCR-TMF identifies threats, potential attack techniques, and
corresponding countermeasures by leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK matrix through
three LLM-based approaches: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method
requiring no expert input, (ii) an in-context learning approach requiring low
expert input, and (iii) a supervised fine-tuning method requiring moderate
expert input. TraCR-TMF also maps attack paths to critical assets by analyzing
vulnerabilities using a customized LLM. The framework was evaluated in two
scenarios. First, it identified relevant attack techniques across
transportation CPS applications, with 90% precision as validated by experts.
Second, using a fine-tuned LLM, it successfully predicted multiple
exploitations including lateral movement, data exfiltration, and
ransomware-related encryption that occurred during a major real-world
cyberattack incident. These results demonstrate TraCR-TMF's effectiveness in
CPS threat modeling, its reduced reliance on cybersecurity expertise, and its
adaptability across CPS domains.

Motivation: 现代IC供应链中IP保护复杂，需平衡风险与成本，现有方法难以满足需求。

Method: 提出ARIANNA流程，包括逻辑隐藏选择、定制化配置逻辑设计及两种启发式方法。

Result: ARIANNA使开销降低3.3倍，eFPGA利用率提高4倍，优于现有通用方案。

Conclusion: ARIANNA为IP保护提供了高效定制化解决方案，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: In the modern global Integrated Circuit (IC) supply chain, protecting
intellectual property (IP) is a complex challenge, and balancing IP loss risk
and added cost for theft countermeasures is hard to achieve. Using embedded
configurable logic allows designers to completely hide the functionality of
selected design portions from parties that do not have access to the
configuration string (bitstream). However, the design space of redacted
solutions is huge, with trade-offs between the portions selected for redaction
and the configuration of the configurable embedded logic. We propose ARIANNA, a
complete flow that aids the designer in all the stages, from selecting the
logic to be hidden to tailoring the bespoke fabrics for the configurable logic
used to hide it. We present a security evaluation of the considered fabrics and
introduce two heuristics for the novel bespoke fabric flow. We evaluate the
heuristics against an exhaustive approach. We also evaluate the complete flow
using a selection of benchmarks. Results show that using ARIANNA to customize
the redaction fabrics yields up to 3.3x lower overheads and 4x higher eFPGA
fabric utilization than a one-fits-all fabric as proposed in prior works.

### [30] [Autoregressive Images Watermarking through Lexical Biasing: An Approach Resistant to Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01011)
*Siqi Hui,Yiren Song,Sanping Zhou,Ye Deng,Wenli Huang,Jinjun Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种针对自回归（AR）图像生成模型的Lexical Bias Watermarking（LBW）水印框架，解决了现有水印技术难以适应AR模型和易受扩散模型再生攻击的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成质量上取得突破，但现有水印技术主要针对扩散模型，难以直接应用于AR模型，且易受再生攻击。

Method: LBW通过将水印嵌入到令牌映射中，在生成过程中偏向预定义的绿色列表令牌选择，并随机从绿色列表池中采样以提高安全性。

Result: 实验表明，LBW在抵抗再生攻击方面表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LBW为AR模型提供了一种高效且安全的水印方案，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models have gained increasing attention
for their breakthroughs in synthesis quality, highlighting the need for robust
watermarking to prevent misuse. However, existing in-generation watermarking
techniques are primarily designed for diffusion models, where watermarks are
embedded within diffusion latent states. This design poses significant
challenges for direct adaptation to AR models, which generate images
sequentially through token prediction. Moreover, diffusion-based regeneration
attacks can effectively erase such watermarks by perturbing diffusion latent
states. To address these challenges, we propose Lexical Bias Watermarking
(LBW), a novel framework designed for AR models that resists regeneration
attacks. LBW embeds watermarks directly into token maps by biasing token
selection toward a predefined green list during generation. This approach
ensures seamless integration with existing AR models and extends naturally to
post-hoc watermarking. To increase the security against white-box attacks,
instead of using a single green list, the green list for each image is randomly
sampled from a pool of green lists. Watermark detection is performed via
quantization and statistical analysis of the token distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LBW achieves superior watermark robustness,
particularly in resisting regeneration attacks.

*Meysam Alizadeh,Zeynab Samei,Daria Stetsenko,Fabrizio Gilardi*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文研究了提示注入攻击如何导致工具调用代理泄露个人数据，通过虚构银行代理和AgentDojo基准测试，发现攻击成功率约20%，部分防御措施可降至零。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试对复杂威胁（如数据泄露）的洞察有限，需深入研究提示注入攻击对代理安全的影响。

Method: 开发基于数据流的攻击方法，集成到AgentDojo基准中，并使用合成银行对话数据集进行测试。

Result: 攻击下LLMs效用下降15-50%，平均攻击成功率约20%；部分防御措施有效，但任务类型与防御效果相关。

Conclusion: LLMs在安全对齐下避免泄露高敏感数据，但仍易泄露其他个人信息，需进一步优化防御策略。

Abstract: Previous benchmarks on prompt injection in large language models (LLMs) have
primarily focused on generic tasks and attacks, offering limited insights into
more complex threats like data exfiltration. This paper examines how prompt
injection can cause tool-calling agents to leak personal data observed during
task execution. Using a fictitious banking agent, we develop data flow-based
attacks and integrate them into AgentDojo, a recent benchmark for agentic
security. To enhance its scope, we also create a richer synthetic dataset of
human-AI banking conversations. In 16 user tasks from AgentDojo, LLMs show a
15-50 percentage point drop in utility under attack, with average attack
success rates (ASR) around 20 percent; some defenses reduce ASR to zero. Most
LLMs, even when successfully tricked by the attack, avoid leaking highly
sensitive data like passwords, likely due to safety alignments, but they remain
vulnerable to disclosing other personal data. The likelihood of password
leakage increases when a password is requested along with one or two additional
personal details. In an extended evaluation across 48 tasks, the average ASR is
around 15 percent, with no built-in AgentDojo defense fully preventing leakage.
Tasks involving data extraction or authorization workflows, which closely
resemble the structure of exfiltration attacks, exhibit the highest ASRs,
highlighting the interaction between task type, agent performance, and defense
efficacy.

*Shuyu Chen,Guopeng Lin,Haoyu Niu,Lushan Song,Chengxun Hong,Weili Han*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: IDCloak是一个实用的多安全方数据集连接框架，用于垂直隐私保护机器学习，无需非共谋辅助服务器即可保护ID隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在安全数据集连接中存在不足，如暴露交集ID、依赖强信任假设或仅限于两方设置。

Method: IDCloak包含两个协议：基于电路的多方私有集交集协议（cmPSI）和高效的安全多方特征对齐协议。

Result: 实验表明，IDCloak在两方设置中效率更高，多方设置中性能相当，且cmPSI协议和安全洗牌协议在时间和通信量上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: IDCloak为垂直隐私保护机器学习提供了一种高效且安全的解决方案，适用于多方场景。

Abstract: Vertical privacy-preserving machine learning (vPPML) enables multiple parties
to train models on their vertically distributed datasets while keeping datasets
private. In vPPML, it is critical to perform the secure dataset join, which
aligns features corresponding to intersection IDs across datasets and forms a
secret-shared and joint training dataset. However, existing methods for this
step could be impractical due to: (1) they are insecure when they expose
intersection IDs; or (2) they rely on a strong trust assumption requiring a
non-colluding auxiliary server; or (3) they are limited to the two-party
setting.
  This paper proposes IDCloak, the first practical secure multi-party dataset
join framework for vPPML that keeps IDs private without a non-colluding
auxiliary server. IDCloak consists of two protocols: (1) a circuit-based
multi-party private set intersection protocol (cmPSI), which obtains
secret-shared flags indicating intersection IDs via an optimized communication
structure combining OKVS and OPRF; (2) a secure multi-party feature alignment
protocol, which obtains the secret-shared and joint dataset using secret-shared
flags, via our proposed efficient secure shuffle protocol. Experiments show
that: (1) compared to the state-of-the-art secure two-party dataset join
framework (iPrivjoin), IDCloak demonstrates higher efficiency in the two-party
setting and comparable performance when the party number increases; (2)
compared to the state-of-the-art cmPSI protocol under honest majority, our
proposed cmPSI protocol provides a stronger security guarantee (dishonest
majority) while improving efficiency by up to $7.78\times$ in time and
$8.73\times$ in communication sizes; (3) our proposed secure shuffle protocol
outperforms the state-of-the-art shuffle protocol by up to $138.34\times$ in
time and $132.13\times$ in communication sizes.

*Naoyuki Shimizu,Masaki Hashimoto*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种名为Vulnerability Management Chaining的框架，结合历史利用证据（KEV）、预测威胁建模（EPSS）和技术影响评估（CVSS），显著提高了漏洞管理的效率和覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CVSS漏洞优先级方法效率低下，仅能识别20%被利用漏洞，而需处理60%漏洞。

Method: 采用决策树框架整合KEV、EPSS和CVSS，实现从被动修补到战略驱动的优先级管理。

Result: 实验验证显示效率提升14-18倍，覆盖85%以上实际威胁，紧急修复工作量减少95%。

Conclusion: 该框架为漏洞管理提供了首个经验验证的系统方法，适用于不同组织环境。

Abstract: Cybersecurity teams face an overwhelming vulnerability crisis: with 25,000+
new CVEs disclosed annually, traditional CVSS-based prioritization requires
addressing 60% of all vulnerabilities while correctly identifying only 20% of
those actually exploited. We propose Vulnerability Management Chaining, an
integrated decision tree framework combining historical exploitation evidence
(KEV), predictive threat modeling (EPSS), and technical impact assessment
(CVSS) to transform vulnerability management from reactive patching to
strategic threat-driven prioritization. Experimental validation using 28,377
real-world vulnerabilities demonstrates 14-18 fold efficiency improvements
while maintaining 85%+ coverage of actual threats. Organizations can reduce
urgent remediation workload by 95% (from ~16,000 to ~850 vulnerabilities). The
integration identifies 57 additional exploited vulnerabilities that neither KEV
nor EPSS captures individually. Our framework uses exclusively open-source
data, democratizing advanced vulnerability management regardless of budget or
expertise. This research establishes the first empirically validated
methodology for systematic vulnerability management integration, with immediate
applicability across diverse organizational contexts.

TLDR: SPEAR是一个基于AI规划的形式化框架，用于网络安全态势评估和分析，支持管理员进行假设分析和多样化防御策略选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图框架在网络加固中缺乏对网络连接参数的完整整合、不完全信息下的推理、易理解的建议格式以及假设分析功能。

Method: SPEAR利用AI规划的因果形式化建模网络系统中的漏洞和配置，自动将网络配置和漏洞描述转换为PDDL规划模型。

Result: SPEAR生成多样化的安全加固策略，并以易理解的方式呈现，支持管理员系统化探索解决方案。

Conclusion: SPEAR填补了现有工具的空白，提供了更全面的网络安全态势分析和加固策略支持。

Abstract: Graph-based frameworks are often used in network hardening to help a cyber
defender understand how a network can be attacked and how the best defenses can
be deployed. However, incorporating network connectivity parameters in the
attack graph, reasoning about the attack graph when we do not have access to
complete information, providing system administrator suggestions in an
understandable format, and allowing them to do what-if analysis on various
scenarios and attacker motives is still missing. We fill this gap by presenting
SPEAR, a formal framework with tool support for security posture evaluation and
analysis that keeps human-in-the-loop. SPEAR uses the causal formalism of AI
planning to model vulnerabilities and configurations in a networked system. It
automatically converts network configurations and vulnerability descriptions
into planning models expressed in the Planning Domain Definition Language
(PDDL). SPEAR identifies a set of diverse security hardening strategies that
can be presented in a manner understandable to the domain expert. These allow
the administrator to explore the network hardening solution space in a
systematic fashion and help evaluate the impact and compare the different
solutions.

TLDR: 论文提出系统性框架分析多智能体语言模型系统的漏洞，强调其独特的安全威胁，并指出未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体语言模型系统（LLM-MAS）在高风险应用中部署增多，但其复杂结构带来新的安全威胁，现有研究对单智能体漏洞关注较多，而LLM-MAS的漏洞研究不足。

Method: 提出系统性漏洞分析框架，定义基于实际攻击能力的威胁模型，并通过实际应用案例说明。

Result: 分析表明LLM-MAS因组合效应面临更高风险，个体漏洞可能通过通信传播，形成单智能体系统不存在的威胁。

Conclusion: 未来需开发针对性评估基准、探索多智能体特有攻击方式，并设计信任管理系统以提升LLM-MAS安全性。

Abstract: This paper argues that a comprehensive vulnerability analysis is essential
for building trustworthy Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems
(LLM-MAS). These systems, which consist of multiple LLM-powered agents working
collaboratively, are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications but face
novel security threats due to their complex structures. While single-agent
vulnerabilities are well-studied, LLM-MAS introduces unique attack surfaces
through inter-agent communication, trust relationships, and tool integration
that remain significantly underexplored. We present a systematic framework for
vulnerability analysis of LLM-MAS that unifies diverse research. For each type
of vulnerability, we define formal threat models grounded in practical attacker
capabilities and illustrate them using real-world LLM-MAS applications. This
formulation enables rigorous quantification of vulnerability across different
architectures and provides a foundation for designing meaningful evaluation
benchmarks. Our analysis reveals that LLM-MAS faces elevated risk due to
compositional effects -- vulnerabilities in individual components can cascade
through agent communication, creating threat models not present in single-agent
systems. We conclude by identifying critical open challenges: (1) developing
benchmarks specifically tailored to LLM-MAS vulnerability assessment, (2)
considering new potential attacks specific to multi-agent architectures, and
(3) implementing trust management systems that can enforce security in LLM-MAS.
This research provides essential groundwork for future efforts to enhance
LLM-MAS trustworthiness as these systems continue their expansion into critical
applications.

Conclusion: 强调亟需加强MLLMs的安全措施，呼吁全面审查和增强安全协议以应对多模态能力带来的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), significantly enhancing their capabilities by integrating
visual information and other types, thus aligning more closely with the nature
of human intelligence, which processes a variety of data forms beyond just
text. Despite advancements, the undesirable generation of these models remains
a critical concern, particularly due to vulnerabilities exposed by text-based
jailbreak attacks, which have represented a significant threat by challenging
existing safety protocols. Motivated by the unique security risks posed by the
integration of new and old modalities for MLLMs, we propose a unified
multimodal universal jailbreak attack framework that leverages iterative
image-text interactions and transfer-based strategy to generate a universal
adversarial suffix and image. Our work not only highlights the interaction of
image-text modalities can be used as a critical vulnerability but also
validates that multimodal universal jailbreak attacks can bring higher-quality
undesirable generations across different MLLMs. We evaluate the undesirable
context generation of MLLMs like LLaVA, Yi-VL, MiniGPT4, MiniGPT-v2, and
InstructBLIP, and reveal significant multimodal safety alignment issues,
highlighting the inadequacy of current safety mechanisms against sophisticated
multimodal attacks. This study underscores the urgent need for robust safety
measures in MLLMs, advocating for a comprehensive review and enhancement of
security protocols to mitigate potential risks associated with multimodal
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OIDC兼容的SSO服务（如UppreSSO）虽能防止身份追踪和链接，但其身份转换方法存在未充分研究的问题。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析身份转换与OPRF的关系，提出两种安全变体，并基于OPRF设计新的身份转换方案。

Result: 揭示了身份转换与OPRF的关系，证明了OPRF协议在SSO中的关键特性，并构建了满足不同安全需求的新方案。

Conclusion: 本文首次将身份转换与OPRF关联，为隐私保护的SSO服务提供了理论支持和实用方案。

Abstract: OpenID Connect (OIDC) enables a user with commercial-off-the-shelf browsers
to log into multiple websites, called relying parties (RPs), by her username
and credential set up in another trusted web system, called the identity
provider (IdP). Identity transformations are proposed in UppreSSO to provide
OIDC-compatible SSO services, preventing both IdP-based login tracing and
RP-based identity linkage. While security and privacy of SSO services in
UppreSSO have been proved, several essential issues of this
identity-transformation approach are not well studied. In this paper, we
comprehensively investigate the approach as below. Firstly, several suggestions
for the efficient integration of identity transformations in OIDC-compatible
SSO are explained. Then, we uncover the relationship between
identity-transformations in SSO and oblivious pseudo-random functions (OPRFs),
and present two variations of the properties required for SSO security as well
as the privacy requirements, to analyze existing OPRF protocols. Finally, new
identity transformations different from those designed in UppreSSO, are
constructed based on OPRFs, satisfying different variations of SSO security
requirements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to uncover
the relationship between identity transformations in OIDC-compatible
privacy-preserving SSO services and OPRFs, and prove the SSO-related properties
(i.e., key-identifier freeness, RP designation and user identification) of OPRF
protocols, in addition to the basic properties of correctness, obliviousness
and pseudo-randomness.

Conclusion: ETDI为LLM与外部工具交互提供了更安全、可信的框架。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) plays a crucial role in extending the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling integration with
external tools and data sources. However, the standard MCP specification
presents significant security vulnerabilities, notably Tool Poisoning and Rug
Pull attacks. This paper introduces the Enhanced Tool Definition Interface
(ETDI), a security extension designed to fortify MCP. ETDI incorporates
cryptographic identity verification, immutable versioned tool definitions, and
explicit permission management, often leveraging OAuth 2.0. We further propose
extending MCP with fine-grained, policy-based access control, where tool
capabilities are dynamically evaluated against explicit policies using a
dedicated policy engine, considering runtime context beyond static OAuth
scopes. This layered approach aims to establish a more secure, trustworthy, and
controllable ecosystem for AI applications interacting with LLMs and external
tools.

Motivation: 挑战主流观点，即家庭验证器增强网络安全性，通过形式化分析证明SPV模型的合理性。

Method: 定义安全性指标，建模交易接受、执行能力和分歧概率，结合蒙特卡洛模拟和形式化引理。

Result: SPV客户端在诚实多数假设下密码学足够安全，且比被动全节点更抗攻击。

Conclusion: SPV客户端是非挖矿参与者的理性均衡策略，家庭全节点反而增加系统熵而不提升共识完整性。

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematically rigorous formal analysis of Simplified
Payment Verification (SPV) clients, as specified in Section 8 of the original
Bitcoin white paper, versus non-mining full nodes operated by home users. It
defines security as resistance to divergence from global consensus and models
transaction acceptance, enforcement capability, and divergence probability
under adversarial conditions. The results demonstrate that SPV clients, despite
omitting script verification, are cryptographically sufficient under
honest-majority assumptions and topologically less vulnerable to attack than
structurally passive, non-enforcing full nodes. The paper introduces new axioms
on behavioral divergence and communication topology, proving that home-based
full nodes increase systemic entropy without contributing to consensus
integrity. Using a series of formally defined lemmas, propositions, and Monte
Carlo simulation results, it is shown that SPV clients represent the rational
equilibrium strategy for non-mining participants. This challenges the
prevailing narrative that home validators enhance network security, providing
formal and operational justifications for the sufficiency of SPV models.

Abstract: As malware continues to become more complex and harder to detect, Malware
Analysis needs to continue to evolve to stay one step ahead. One promising key
area approach focuses on using system calls and API Calls, the core
communication between user applications and the operating system and their
kernels. These calls provide valuable insight into how software or programs
behaves, making them an useful tool for spotting suspicious or harmful activity
of programs and software. This chapter takes a deep down look at how system
calls are used in malware detection and classification, covering techniques
like static and dynamic analysis, as well as sandboxing. By combining these
methods with advanced techniques like machine learning, statistical analysis,
and anomaly detection, researchers can analyze system call patterns to tell the
difference between normal and malicious behavior. The chapter also explores how
these techniques are applied across different systems, including Windows,
Linux, and Android, while also looking at the ways sophisticated malware tries
to evade detection.

Motivation: 联邦学习中聚合的模型参数可能泄露隐私，尤其是因数据有限导致的过拟合问题。

Method: CSVAR基于区域方差自适应分区图像，对隐私敏感区域细粒度分区并混洗空间和色彩通道。

Result: 实验表明CSVAR能生成视觉模糊图像，有效抵御重建攻击并平衡隐私与模型性能。

Conclusion: CSVAR在保护视觉隐私和模型实用性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Although federated learning preserves training data within local privacy
domains, the aggregated model parameters may still reveal private
characteristics. This vulnerability stems from clients' limited training data,
which predisposes models to overfitting. Such overfitting enables models to
memorize distinctive patterns from training samples, thereby amplifying the
success probability of privacy attacks like membership inference. To enhance
visual privacy protection in FL, we present CSVAR(Channel-Wise Spatial Image
Shuffling with Variance-Guided Adaptive Region Partitioning), a novel image
shuffling framework to generate obfuscated images for secure data transmission
and each training epoch, addressing both overfitting-induced privacy leaks and
raw image transmission risks. CSVAR adopts region-variance as the metric to
measure visual privacy sensitivity across image regions. Guided by this, CSVAR
adaptively partitions each region into multiple blocks, applying fine-grained
partitioning to privacy-sensitive regions with high region-variances for
enhancing visual privacy protection and coarse-grained partitioning to
privacy-insensitive regions for balancing model utility. In each region, CSVAR
then shuffles between blocks in both the spatial domains and chromatic channels
to hide visual spatial features and disrupt color distribution. Experimental
evaluations conducted on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that CSVAR is
capable of generating visually obfuscated images that exhibit high perceptual
ambiguity to human eyes, simultaneously mitigating the effectiveness of
adversarial data reconstruction attacks and achieving a good trade-off between
visual privacy protection and model utility.

Abstract: Policies are designed to distinguish between correct and incorrect actions;

financial and reputational harm We demonstrate how even the most complex ABAC

Motivation: 探讨快速终局区块链上垃圾交易套利的经济学行为及其对交易结构的影响。

Method: 理论分析结合实证验证，构建执行图以识别交易模式和流动性池目标。

Result: 80%的回滚交易是交换操作，50%针对Uniswap的USDC-WETH池；Dencun升级后模式加剧。

Conclusion: 垃圾交易套利在低gas成本下可行，且交易排序在亚秒级区块时间下脆弱。

Abstract: This research analyzes the economics of spam-based arbitrage strategies on
fast-finality blockchains. We begin by theoretically demonstrating that,
splitting a profitable MEV opportunity into multiple small transactions is the
optimal strategy for CEX-DEX arbitrageurs. We then empirically validate these
findings on major Ethereum rollups. To uncover the structure of reverted
transactions, we construct execution graphs from transaction traces and
systematically search them to identify DEX or router interactions and targeted
liquidity pools. This analysis reveals that 80\% of reverted transactions are
swaps with approximately 50\% targeting USDC-WETH pools on Uniswap v3/v4. These
patterns intensified following the March 2024 Dencun upgrade, which lowered L2
gas costs and made spam-based arbitrage economically viable.
Counterintuitively, we find that these reverted MEV transactions rarely engage
with Priority Fee Auctions (PFAs), preferring to submit duplicate transactions
rather than bid for inclusion. Moreover, reverted transactions cluster at the
very top of blocks on fast rollups like Arbitrum and ZKsync, indicating an
intense latency race and revealing the fragility of fee-based ordering under
sub-second block times.

Abstract: The proliferation of digital carriers that can be exploited to conceal
arbitrary data has greatly increased the number of techniques for implementing
network steganography. As a result, the literature overlaps greatly in terms of
concepts and terminology. Moreover, from a cybersecurity viewpoint, the same
hiding mechanism may be perceived differently, making harder the development of
a unique defensive strategy or the definition of practices to mitigate risks
arising from the use of steganography. To mitigate these drawbacks, several
researchers introduced approaches that aid in the unified description of
steganography methods and network covert channels.
  Understanding and combining all descriptive methods for steganography
techniques is a challenging but important task. For instance, researchers might
want to explain how malware applies a certain steganography technique or
categorize a novel hiding approach. Consequently, this paper aims to provide an
introduction to the concept of descriptive methods for steganography. The paper
is organized in the form of a tutorial, with the main goal of explaining how
existing descriptions and taxonomy objects can be combined to achieve a
detailed categorization and description of hiding methods. To show how this can
effectively help the research community, the paper also contains various
real-world examples.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Predictive-CSM的自适应防御策略，通过轻量级机制追踪节点行为并检查数据包完整性，有效抵御6LoWPAN物联网网络中的碎片攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6LoWPAN物联网网络中碎片化通信易受攻击，现有防御方法效率低且资源消耗大，需一种更轻量、自适应的解决方案。

Method: 结合两种轻量级机制：1) 追踪节点行为并动态调整信任度；2) 使用链式哈希检查数据包完整性。

Result: 在多种攻击模拟中，Predictive-CSM能保持网络传输和能源效率，且无需依赖高开销加密或固定过滤器。

Conclusion: Predictive-CSM为物联网碎片化通信提供了一种实时自适应的安全解决方案。

Abstract: Fragmentation is a routine part of communication in 6LoWPAN-based IoT
networks,
  designed to accommodate small frame sizes on constrained wireless links.
However, this process
  introduces a critical vulnerability fragments are typically stored and
processed before their
  legitimacy is confirmed, allowing attackers to exploit this gap with minimal
effort.
  In this work, we explore a defense strategy that takes a more adaptive,
behavior-aware approach to this problem. Our system, called Predictive-CSM,
introduces a combination of two
  lightweight mechanisms. The first tracks how each node behaves over time,
rewarding consistent
  and successful interactions while quickly penalizing suspicious or failing
patterns. The second
  checks the integrity of packet fragments using a chained hash, allowing
incomplete or manipulated sequences to be caught early, before they can occupy
memory or waste processing time.
  We put this system to the test using a set of targeted attack simulations,
including early fragment injection, replayed headers, and flooding with fake
data. Across all scenarios, Predictive CSM preserved network delivery and
maintained energy efficiency, even under pressure. Rather
  than relying on heavyweight cryptography or rigid filters, this approach
allows constrained de vices to adapt their defenses in real time based on what
they observe, not just what they're
  told. In that way, it offers a step forward for securing fragmented
communication in real world
  IoT systems

TLDR: ReGA是一个基于模型的分析框架，通过表示引导的抽象技术，解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在安全性和可扩展性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在生成有害内容和易受越狱攻击方面存在风险，现有模型分析方法在扩展到LLMs时面临可扩展性问题。

Method: ReGA利用安全关键表示（低维方向）构建抽象模型，以区分安全与有害输入。

Result: ReGA在提示级别和对话级别的AUROC分别达到0.975和0.985，表现出对真实攻击的鲁棒性和跨安全视角的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReGA通过结合表示工程和模型抽象，为LLM安全提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various
tasks, yet concerns about their safety and security have emerged. In
particular, they pose risks in generating harmful content and vulnerability to
jailbreaking attacks. To analyze and monitor machine learning models,
model-based analysis has demonstrated notable potential in stateful deep neural
networks, yet suffers from scalability issues when extending to LLMs due to
their vast feature spaces. In this paper, we propose ReGA, a model-based
analysis framework with representation-guided abstraction, to safeguard LLMs
against harmful prompts and generations. By leveraging safety-critical
representations, which are low-dimensional directions emerging in hidden states
that indicate safety-related concepts, ReGA effectively addresses the
scalability issue when constructing the abstract model for safety modeling. Our
comprehensive evaluation shows that ReGA performs sufficiently well in
distinguishing between safe and harmful inputs, achieving an AUROC of 0.975 at
the prompt level and 0.985 at the conversation level. Additionally, ReGA
exhibits robustness to real-world attacks and generalization across different
safety perspectives, outperforming existing safeguard paradigms in terms of
interpretability and scalability. Overall, ReGA serves as an efficient and
scalable solution to enhance LLM safety by integrating representation
engineering with model-based abstraction, paving the way for new paradigms to
utilize software insights for AI safety. Our code is available at

*Chenyu Wang,Zhou Yang,Yaniv Harel,David Lo*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 该论文研究了影响Code LLMs后门攻击有效性的因素，发现极低毒化率下攻击仍有效，且现有防御措施无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未探索影响Code LLMs后门攻击的其他因素（如训练批次大小、触发设计等），需填补这一空白。

Method: 以代码摘要为例，实证研究数据、模型和推理三类因素对后门攻击的影响。

Result: 发现极低毒化率（0.004%）即可植入后门，小批次训练增加风险，且现有防御无效。

Conclusion: 需针对极低毒化率设计防御机制，并重新评估Code LLMs的脆弱性。

Abstract: Code LLMs are increasingly employed in software development. However, studies
have shown that they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks: when a trigger (a
specific input pattern) appears in the input, the backdoor will be activated
and cause the model to generate malicious outputs. Researchers have designed
various triggers and demonstrated the feasibility of implanting backdoors by
poisoning a fraction of the training data. Some basic conclusions have been
made, such as backdoors becoming easier to implant when more training data are
modified. However, existing research has not explored other factors influencing
backdoor attacks on Code LLMs, such as training batch size, epoch number, and
the broader design space for triggers, e.g., trigger length.
  To bridge this gap, we use code summarization as an example to perform an
empirical study that systematically investigates the factors affecting backdoor
effectiveness and understands the extent of the threat posed. Three categories
of factors are considered: data, model, and inference, revealing previously
overlooked findings. We find that the prevailing consensus -- that attacks are
ineffective at extremely low poisoning rates -- is incorrect. The absolute
number of poisoned samples matters as well. Specifically, poisoning just 20 out
of 454K samples (0.004\% poisoning rate -- far below the minimum setting of
0.1\% in prior studies) successfully implants backdoors! Moreover, the common
defense is incapable of removing even a single poisoned sample from it.
Additionally, small batch sizes increase the risk of backdoor attacks. We also
uncover other critical factors such as trigger types, trigger length, and the
rarity of tokens in the triggers, leading to valuable insights for assessing
Code LLMs' vulnerability to backdoor attacks. Our study highlights the urgent
need for defense mechanisms against extremely low poisoning rate settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大数据时代下，网络威胁情报的收集与分析因数据量庞大而变得困难，现有研究未充分考虑威胁行为者的技术专长，而这对网络犯罪情报至关重要。

Method: 利用CVE和CAPEC分类构建双模网络，结合社区检测、k-means聚类和犯罪学框架，识别网络犯罪论坛中对特定攻击模式感兴趣的群体及其关键专家。

Result: 研究发现：1）CAPEC-actor双模网络存在对相似攻击模式感兴趣的群体；2）关键专家占研究群体的4%；3）约一半参与者为技术能力较低的业余者。

Conclusion: 关键专家是网络威胁情报资源分配的重要稀缺资源，未来研究应关注其技术专长的发展与应用。

Abstract: The advent of Big Data has made the collection and analysis of cyber threat
intelligence challenging due to its volume, leading research to focus on
identifying key threat actors; yet these studies have failed to consider the
technical expertise of these actors. Expertise, especially towards specific
attack patterns, is crucial for cybercrime intelligence, as it focuses on
targeting actors with the knowledge and skills to attack enterprises. Using
CVEs and CAPEC classifications to build a bimodal network, as well as community
detection, k-means and a criminological framework, this study addresses the key
hacker identification problem by identifying communities interested in specific
attack patterns across cybercrime forums and their related key expert actors.
The analyses reveal several key contributions. First, the community structure
of the CAPEC-actor bimodal network shows that there exists groups of actors
interested in similar attack patterns across cybercrime forums. Second, key
actors identified in this study account for about 4% of the study population.
Third, about half of the study population are amateurs who show little
technical expertise. Finally, key actors highlighted in this study represent a
promising scarcity for resources allocation in cyber threat intelligence
production. Further research should look into how they develop and use their
technical expertise in cybercrime forums.

Motivation: 研究伪随机码的伪随机性是否可以通过黑盒归约到通用密码学原语。

Method: 使用布尔函数的超收缩性定理，证明在随机预言模型中的不可能性。

Result: 伪随机码在容忍恒定错误率时无法基于黑盒归约到通用密码学原语。

Conclusion: 结果是最优的，因为已有研究表明在容忍亚恒定错误率时伪随机码可以通过黑盒归约实现。

Abstract: A pseudorandom code is a keyed error-correction scheme with the property that
any polynomial number of encodings appear random to any computationally bounded
adversary. We show that the pseudorandomness of any code tolerating a constant
rate of random errors cannot be based on black-box reductions to almost any
generic cryptographic primitive: for instance, anything that can be built from
random oracles, generic multilinear groups, and virtual black-box obfuscation.
Our result is optimal, as Ghentiyala and Guruswami (2024) observed that
pseudorandom codes tolerating any sub-constant rate of random errors exist
using a black-box reduction from one-way functions.
  The key technical ingredient in our proof is the hypercontractivity theorem
for Boolean functions, which we use to prove our impossibility in the random
oracle model. It turns out that this easily extends to an impossibility in the
presence of ``crypto oracles,'' a notion recently introduced -- and shown to be
capable of implementing all the primitives mentioned above -- by Lin, Mook, and
Wichs (EUROCRYPT 2025).

Motivation: 随着搜索、社交媒体和人工智能重塑集体知识，维护公共信息领域的信任成为关键挑战，需要广泛且多功能的数字身份基础设施。

Method: 采用非标准的数字身份定义，基于Sandia实验室的Synchronic Web技术，构建数字身份的基础设施和应用配置。

Result: 论文提出了数字身份基础设施的理论框架，并计划将其应用于更公开的领域。

Conclusion: 数字身份基础设施是应对公共信息领域信任挑战的关键，未来需进一步发展和应用。

Abstract: As search, social media, and artificial intelligence continue to reshape
collective knowledge, the preservation of trust on the public infosphere has
become a defining challenge of our time. Given the breadth and versatility of
adversarial threats, the best--and perhaps only--defense is an equally broad
and versatile infrastructure for digital identity.
  This document discusses the opportunities and implications of building such
an infrastructure from the perspective of a national laboratory. The technical
foundation for this discussion is the emergence of the Synchronic Web, a
Sandia-developed infrastructure for asserting cryptographic provenance at
Internet scale. As of the writing of this document, there is ongoing work to
develop the underlying technology and apply it to multiple mission-specific
domains within Sandia. The primary objective of this document to extend the
body of existing work toward the more public-facing domain of digital identity.
  Our approach depends on a non-standard, but philosophically defensible notion
of identity: digital identity is an unbroken sequence of states in a
well-defined digital space. From this foundation, we abstractly describe the
infrastructural foundations and applied configurations that we expect to
underpin future notions of digital identity.

Abstract: Smart contracts, the cornerstone of blockchain technology, enable secure,
automated distributed execution. Given their role in handling large transaction
volumes across clients, miners, and validators, exploring concurrency is
critical. This includes concurrent transaction execution or validation within
blocks, block processing across shards, and miner competition to select and
persist transactions. Concurrency and parallelism are a double-edged sword:
while they improve throughput, they also introduce risks like race conditions,
non-determinism, and vulnerabilities such as deadlock and livelock.
  This paper presents the first survey of concurrency in smart contracts,
offering a systematic literature review organized into key dimensions. First,
it establishes a taxonomy of concurrency levels in blockchain systems and
discusses proposed solutions for future adoption. Second, it examines
vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures in concurrent operations,
emphasizing the need for correctness and security. Crucially, we reveal a
flawed concurrency assumption in a major research category, which has led to
widespread misinterpretation. This work aims to correct that and guide future
research toward more accurate models. Finally, we identify gaps in each
category to outline future research directions and support blockchain's
advancement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合中存在模态不平衡问题，主导模态容易掩盖弱势模态，导致学习偏差和次优融合，尤其是在模态不完整的情况下。

Method: 采用Shapley值引导的交替训练框架，自适应调度训练顺序，引入记忆模块优化模态表示，并通过跨模态映射机制对齐特征。

Result: 在四个多模态基准数据集上，提出的方法在平衡性和准确性上均达到SOTA，并在缺失模态条件下表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 交替训练和模态优先级策略能有效平衡和促进多模态学习，为优化多模态训练动态提供了新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is susceptible to modality imbalance, where dominant
modalities overshadow weak ones, easily leading to biased learning and
suboptimal fusion, especially for incomplete modality conditions. To address
this problem, we propose a Shapley-guided alternating training framework that
adaptively prioritizes minor modalities to balance and thus enhance the fusion.
Our method leverages Shapley Value-based scheduling to improve the training
sequence adaptively, ensuring that under-optimized modalities receive
sufficient learning. Additionally, we introduce the memory module to refine and
inherit modality-specific representations with a cross-modal mapping mechanism
to align features at both the feature and sample levels. To further validate
the adaptability of the proposed approach, the encoder module empirically
adopts both conventional and LLM-based backbones. With building up a novel
multimodal equilibrium metric, namely, equilibrium deviation metric (EDM), we
evaluate the performance in both balance and accuracy across four multimodal
benchmark datasets, where our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.
Meanwhile, robustness analysis under missing modalities highlights its strong
generalization capabilities. Accordingly, our findings reveal the untapped
potential of alternating training, demonstrating that strategic modality
prioritization fundamentally balances and promotes multimodal learning,
offering a new paradigm for optimizing multimodal training dynamics.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning (DL) approaches have demonstrated promising
results in decoding hemodynamic responses captured by functional near-infrared
spectroscopy (fNIRS), particularly in the context of brain-computer interface
(BCI) applications. This work introduces AbsoluteNet, a novel deep learning
architecture designed to classify auditory event-related responses recorded
using fNIRS. The proposed network is built upon principles of spatio-temporal
convolution and customized activation functions. Our model was compared against
several models, namely fNIRSNET, MDNN, DeepConvNet, and ShallowConvNet. The
results showed that AbsoluteNet outperforms existing models, reaching 87.0%
accuracy, 84.8% sensitivity, and 89.2% specificity in binary classification,
surpassing fNIRSNET, the second-best model, by 3.8% in accuracy. These findings
underscore the effectiveness of our proposed deep learning model in decoding
hemodynamic responses related to auditory processing and highlight the
importance of spatio-temporal feature aggregation and customized activation
functions to better fit fNIRS dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线RL在部署时面临的两个问题：模拟到现实的延迟差异和交互数据不足导致的分布外状态。

Method: 使用Transformer-based信念预测器生成延迟鲁棒的动作，无需在训练时观察延迟数据。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，DT-CORL在多种延迟设置下均优于历史和信念基线方法。

Conclusion: DT-CORL有效缩小了模拟到现实的延迟差距，同时保持了数据效率。

Abstract: Offline-to-online deployment of reinforcement-learning (RL) agents must
bridge two gaps: (1) the sim-to-real gap, where real systems add latency and
other imperfections not present in simulation, and (2) the interaction gap,
where policies trained purely offline face out-of-distribution states during
online execution because gathering new interaction data is costly or risky.
Agents therefore have to generalize from static, delay-free datasets to
dynamic, delay-prone environments. Standard offline RL learns from delay-free
logs yet must act under delays that break the Markov assumption and hurt
performance. We introduce DT-CORL (Delay-Transformer belief policy Constrained
Offline RL), an offline-RL framework built to cope with delayed dynamics at
deployment. DT-CORL (i) produces delay-robust actions with a transformer-based
belief predictor even though it never sees delayed observations during
training, and (ii) is markedly more sample-efficient than na\"ive
history-augmentation baselines. Experiments on D4RL benchmarks with several
delay settings show that DT-CORL consistently outperforms both
history-augmentation and vanilla belief-based methods, narrowing the
sim-to-real latency gap while preserving data efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: N/A


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study online and transductive online learning when the learner interacts
with the concept class only via Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) or weak
consistency oracles on arbitrary instance subsets. This contrasts with standard
online models, where the learner knows the entire class. The ERM oracle returns
a hypothesis minimizing loss on a given subset, while the weak consistency
oracle returns a binary signal indicating whether the subset is realizable by
some concept. The learner is evaluated by the number of mistakes and oracle
calls. In the standard online setting with ERM access, we prove tight lower
bounds in both realizable and agnostic cases: $\Omega(2^{d_{VC}})$ mistakes and
$\Omega(\sqrt{T 2^{d_{LD}}})$ regret, where $T$ is the number of timesteps and
$d_{LD}$ is the Littlestone dimension. We further show that existing online
learning results with ERM access carry over to the weak consistency setting,
incurring an additional $O(T)$ in oracle calls. We then consider the
transductive online model, where the instance sequence is known but labels are
revealed sequentially. For general Littlestone classes, we show that optimal
realizable and agnostic mistake bounds can be achieved using $O(T^{d_{VC}+1})$
weak consistency oracle calls. On the negative side, we show that limiting the
learner to $\Omega(T)$ weak consistency queries is necessary for transductive
online learnability, and that restricting the learner to $\Omega(T)$ ERM
queries is necessary to avoid exponential dependence on the Littlestone
dimension. Finally, for certain concept classes, we reduce oracle calls via
randomized algorithms while maintaining similar mistake bounds. In particular,
for Thresholds on an unknown ordering, $O(\log T)$ ERM queries suffice; for
$k$-Intervals, $O(T^3 2^{2k})$ weak consistency queries suffice.

Result: DMZ在域迁移等下游任务中表现优异，且生成效率高于标准扩散模型。

Conclusion: DMZ模型结合了两种扩散模型的优点，实现了高效的表示学习和生成。

Abstract: Diffusion autoencoders (DAs) are variants of diffusion generative models that
use an input-dependent latent variable to capture representations alongside the
diffusion process. These representations, to varying extents, can be used for
tasks such as downstream classification, controllable generation, and
interpolation. However, the generative performance of DAs relies heavily on how
well the latent variables can be modelled and subsequently sampled from. Better
generative modelling is also the primary goal of another class of diffusion
models -- those that learn their forward (noising) process. While effective at
adjusting the noise process in an input-dependent manner, they must satisfy
additional constraints derived from the terminal conditions of the diffusion
process. Here, we draw a connection between these two classes of models and
show that certain design decisions (latent variable choice, conditioning
method, etc.) in the DA framework -- leading to a model we term DMZ -- allow us
to obtain the best of both worlds: effective representations as evaluated on
downstream tasks, including domain transfer, as well as more efficient
modelling and generation with fewer denoising steps compared to standard DMs.

Abstract: Large language models are being widely used across industries to generate
content that contributes directly to key performance metrics, such as
conversion rates. Pretrained models, however, often fall short when it comes to
aligning with human preferences or optimizing for business objectives. As a
result, fine-tuning with good-quality labeled data is essential to guide models
to generate content that achieves better results. Controlled experiments, like
A/B tests, can provide such data, but they are often expensive and come with
significant engineering and logistical challenges. Meanwhile, companies have
access to a vast amount of historical (observational) data that remains
underutilized. In this work, we study the challenges and opportunities of
fine-tuning LLMs using observational data. We show that while observational
outcomes can provide valuable supervision, directly fine-tuning models on such
data can lead them to learn spurious correlations. We present empirical
evidence of this issue using various real-world datasets and propose
DeconfoundLM, a method that explicitly removes the effect of known confounders
from reward signals. Using simulation experiments, we demonstrate that
DeconfoundLM improves the recovery of causal relationships and mitigates
failure modes found in fine-tuning methods that ignore or naively incorporate
confounding variables. Our findings highlight that while observational data
presents risks, with the right causal corrections, it can be a powerful source
of signal for LLM alignment. Please refer to the project page for code and

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization has emerged as a promising approach for fine-tuning
large language models on domain-specific data, particularly under differential
privacy (DP) and memory constraints. While first-order methods have been
extensively studied from a privacy perspective, the privacy analysis and
algorithmic design for zeroth-order methods remain significantly underexplored.
A critical open question concerns hidden-state DP analysis: although convergent
privacy bounds are known for first-order methods, it has remained unclear
whether similar guarantees can be established for zeroth-order methods. In this
work, we provide an affirmative answer by proving a convergent DP bound for
zeroth-order optimization. Our analysis generalizes the celebrated privacy
amplification-by-iteration framework to the setting of smooth loss functions in
zeroth-order optimization. Furthermore, it induces better DP zeroth-order
algorithmic designs that are previously unknown to the literature.

base model's internal representations, enabling diverse and flexible safety
functionalities with minimal impact on inference cost. Empirically, DSA-based
safety guardrails substantially outperform comparably sized standalone models,
notably improving hallucination detection (0.88 vs. 0.61 AUC on Summedits) and
also excelling at classifying hate speech (0.98 vs. 0.92 on ToxiGen) and unsafe
model inputs and responses (0.93 vs. 0.90 on AEGIS2.0 & BeaverTails).
Furthermore, DSA-based safety alignment allows dynamic, inference-time
adjustment of alignment strength and a fine-grained trade-off between
instruction following performance and model safety. Importantly, combining the
DSA safety guardrail with DSA safety alignment facilitates context-dependent
alignment strength, boosting safety on StrongReject by 93% while maintaining
98% performance on MTBench -- a total reduction in alignment tax of 8
percentage points compared to standard safety alignment fine-tuning. Overall,
DSA presents a promising path towards more modular, efficient, and adaptable AI
safety and alignment.

TLDR: Breakpoint是一种自动生成代码修复任务的基准测试方法，通过对抗性破坏真实软件仓库中的函数来评估大语言模型的长时推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估短时、局部推理能力，而真实任务（如软件工程或科研）需要动态理解和操作复杂结构，现有方法难以扩展或调整难度。

Method: Breakpoint通过系统性控制代码复杂度和系统级推理难度，自动生成任务。

Result: 在900多个生成任务中，最先进模型的成功率从最简单任务的55%降至最难任务的0%。

Conclusion: Breakpoint能够灵活扩展任务难度，有效评估模型的长时推理能力。

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) have predominantly assessed
short-horizon, localized reasoning. Existing long-horizon suites (e.g.
SWE-bench) rely on manually curated issues, so expanding or tuning difficulty
demands expensive human effort and evaluations quickly saturate. However, many
real-world tasks, such as software engineering or scientific research, require
agents to rapidly comprehend and manipulate novel, complex structures
dynamically; evaluating these capabilities requires the ability to construct
large and varied sets of problems for agents to solve. We introduce Breakpoint,
a benchmarking methodology that automatically generates code-repair tasks by
adversarially corrupting functions within real-world software repositories.
Breakpoint systematically controls task difficulty along two clear dimensions:
local reasoning (characterized by code complexity metrics such as cyclomatic
complexity) and system-level reasoning (characterized by call-graph centrality
and the number of simultaneously corrupted interdependent functions). In
experiments across more than 900 generated tasks we demonstrate that our
methodology can scale to arbitrary difficulty, with state-of-the-art models'
success rates ranging from 55% on the easiest tasks down to 0% on the hardest.

Motivation: 现代AI开发流程涉及多个阶段（预训练、微调、对齐等），但缺乏明确的责任归属机制。论文旨在解决模型行为与训练阶段之间的因果关系问题。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效识别导致特定行为的训练阶段，为模型分析提供实用工具。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI开发提供了更明确的责任追溯机制，推动了更负责任的AI发展。

Abstract: Modern AI development pipelines often involve multiple stages-pretraining,
fine-tuning rounds, and subsequent adaptation or alignment-with numerous model
update steps within each stage. This raises a critical question of
accountability: when a deployed model succeeds or fails, which stage is
responsible, and to what extent? We pose the problem of accountability
attribution, which aims to trace model behavior back to specific stages of the
training process. To address this, we propose a general framework that answers
counterfactual questions about stage effects: how would the model behavior have
changed if the updates from a training stage had not been executed?. Within
this framework, we introduce estimators based on first-order approximations
that efficiently quantify the stage effects without retraining. Our estimators
account for both the training data and key aspects of optimization dynamics,
including learning rate schedules, momentum, and weight decay. Empirically, we
demonstrate that our approach identifies training stages accountable for
specific behaviors, offering a practical tool for model analysis and a step
toward more accountable AI development.

TLDR: 研究通过SDE近似分析了分布式SGD、压缩SGD和SignSGD在(L0,L1)-平滑性和灵活噪声假设下的动态，揭示了批噪声、梯度压缩和自适应性的复杂交互作用。

Motivation: 探索分布式优化方法在现代理论框架下的动态行为，特别是自适应方法在噪声环境中的表现。

Method: 使用随机微分方程（SDE）近似方法，结合模拟验证，分析不同分布式优化算法的收敛性。

Result: 自适应方法（如SignSGD）在标准学习率调度下能收敛，而传统方法需依赖梯度范数的逆调度才能收敛。

Conclusion: 自适应方法在噪声环境下更具鲁棒性，传统方法需调整学习率调度策略以匹配自适应特性。

Abstract: Using stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximations, we study the
dynamics of Distributed SGD, Distributed Compressed SGD, and Distributed
SignSGD under $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness and flexible noise assumptions. Our
analysis provides insights -- which we validate through simulation -- into the
intricate interactions between batch noise, stochastic gradient compression,
and adaptivity in this modern theoretical setup. For instance, we show that
\textit{adaptive} methods such as Distributed SignSGD can successfully converge
under standard assumptions on the learning rate scheduler, even under
heavy-tailed noise. On the contrary, Distributed (Compressed) SGD with
pre-scheduled decaying learning rate fails to achieve convergence, unless such
a schedule also accounts for an inverse dependency on the gradient norm -- de
facto falling back into an adaptive method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期准确检测时间序列异常至关重要，但现有MLP混合模型缺乏因果机制，且多变量时间序列中复杂的通道间相关性难以捕捉。

Result: 在六个公共基准数据集上实验，模型始终表现优异，F1分数显著提升。

Conclusion: 该模型适用于实时异常检测，通过聚类和因果机制有效解决了多变量时间序列的复杂性问题。

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of anomalies in time series data is critical,
given the significant risks associated with false or missed detections. While
MLP-based mixer models have shown promise in time series analysis, they lack a
causality mechanism to preserve temporal dependencies inherent in the system.
Moreover, real-world multivariate time series often contain numerous channels
with diverse inter-channel correlations. A single embedding mechanism for all
channels does not effectively capture these complex relationships. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel cluster-aware causal mixer to effectively
detect anomalies in multivariate time series. Our model groups channels into
clusters based on their correlations, with each cluster processed through a
dedicated embedding layer. In addition, we introduce a causal mixer in our
model, which mixes the information while maintaining causality. Furthermore, we
present an anomaly detection framework that accumulates the anomaly evidence
over time to prevent false positives due to nominal outliers. Our proposed
model operates in an online fashion, making it suitable for real-time
time-series anomaly detection tasks. Experimental evaluations across six public
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves superior F1
scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOFs的设计空间巨大且复杂，传统计算方法效率低，机器学习为加速材料发现提供了新途径。

Method: 开发了MOFid字符串表示法，结合生成GPT模型、MOFormer性质预测器和强化学习模块，优化生成候选MOFs。

Result: 该方法能够生成具有特定功能属性的可合成且拓扑有效的MOFs。

Conclusion: 展示了大型语言模型与强化学习结合在MOF逆向设计中的潜力，为计算材料发现开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The discovery of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with application-specific
properties remains a central challenge in materials chemistry, owing to the
immense size and complexity of their structural design space. Conventional
computational screening techniques such as molecular simulations and density
functional theory (DFT), while accurate, are computationally prohibitive at
scale. Machine learning offers an exciting alternative by leveraging
data-driven approaches to accelerate materials discovery. The complexity of
MOFs, with their extended periodic structures and diverse topologies, creates
both opportunities and challenges for generative modeling approaches. To
address these challenges, we present a reinforcement learning-enhanced,
transformer-based framework for the de novo design of MOFs. Central to our
approach is MOFid, a chemically-informed string representation encoding both
connectivity and topology, enabling scalable generative modeling. Our pipeline
comprises three components: (1) a generative GPT model trained on MOFid
sequences, (2) MOFormer, a transformer-based property predictor, and (3) a
reinforcement learning (RL) module that optimizes generated candidates via
property-guided reward functions. By integrating property feedback into
sequence generation, our method drives the model toward synthesizable,
topologically valid MOFs with desired functional attributes. This work
demonstrates the potential of large language models, when coupled with
reinforcement learning, to accelerate inverse design in reticular chemistry and
unlock new frontiers in computational MOF discovery.

Abstract: Rehearsal-based methods have shown superior performance in addressing
catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) by storing and training on a
subset of past data alongside new data in current task. While such a concurrent
rehearsal strategy is widely used, it remains unclear if this approach is
always optimal. Inspired by human learning, where sequentially revisiting tasks
helps mitigate forgetting, we explore whether sequential rehearsal can offer
greater benefits for CL compared to standard concurrent rehearsal. To address
this question, we conduct a theoretical analysis of rehearsal-based CL in
overparameterized linear models, comparing two strategies: 1) Concurrent
Rehearsal, where past and new data are trained together, and 2) Sequential
Rehearsal, where new data is trained first, followed by revisiting past data
sequentially. By explicitly characterizing forgetting and generalization error,
we show that sequential rehearsal performs better when tasks are less similar.
These insights further motivate a novel Hybrid Rehearsal method, which trains
similar tasks concurrently and revisits dissimilar tasks sequentially. We
characterize its forgetting and generalization performance, and our experiments
with deep neural networks further confirm that the hybrid approach outperforms
standard concurrent rehearsal. This work provides the first comprehensive
theoretical analysis of rehearsal-based CL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有癌症筛查技术昂贵且侵入性强，全球普及性低，导致许多潜在生命无法被挽救。CATCH-FM旨在通过电子健康记录（EHR）识别高风险患者，降低筛查门槛。

Method: 利用数百万份EHR数据预训练医疗基础模型（最高2.4B参数），并在临床癌症风险预测队列上微调。

Result: 在3万患者的回顾性评估中，CATCH-FM表现出高效能（60%灵敏度）和低风险（99%特异性和阴性预测值），显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: CATCH-FM在多种患者分布中表现稳健，能够捕捉非显性癌症风险因素，代码将开源。

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately,
existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical
procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved
lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation
Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients
for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With
millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law
of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain
compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune
them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective
evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong
efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative
Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general
and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant
demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves
state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot
leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site
patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various
patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its
ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）依赖全局低秩结构，可能忽略参数空间中的空间模式。

Method: 提出Localized LoRA框架，将权重更新建模为低秩矩阵的组合，应用于权重矩阵的结构化块。

Result: 在相同参数预算下，Localized LoRA的近似误差更低，实验证明其表达能力和适应性更强。

Conclusion: Localized LoRA是一种更高效、性能更好的微调方法。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, offer compact
and effective alternatives to full model fine-tuning by introducing low-rank
updates to pretrained weights. However, most existing approaches rely on global
low-rank structures, which can overlook spatial patterns spread across the
parameter space. In this work, we propose Localized LoRA, a generalized
framework that models weight updates as a composition of low-rank matrices
applied to structured blocks of the weight matrix. This formulation enables
dense, localized updates throughout the parameter space-without increasing the
total number of trainable parameters. We provide a formal comparison between
global, diagonal-local, and fully localized low-rank approximations, and show
that our method consistently achieves lower approximation error under matched
parameter budgets. Experiments on both synthetic and practical settings
demonstrate that Localized LoRA offers a more expressive and adaptable
alternative to existing methods, enabling efficient fine-tuning with improved
performance.

Result: 实验表明DeGLIF优于基线算法，能有效识别噪声点并提升准确性。

Conclusion: DeGLIF无需噪声先验信息即可实现高效去噪，适用于图数据噪声标签场景。

Abstract: Noisy labelled datasets are generally inexpensive compared to clean labelled
datasets, and the same is true for graph data. In this paper, we propose a
denoising technique DeGLIF: Denoising Graph Data using Leave-One-Out Influence
Function. DeGLIF uses a small set of clean data and the leave-one-out influence
function to make label noise robust node-level prediction on graph data.
Leave-one-out influence function approximates the change in the model
parameters if a training point is removed from the training dataset. Recent
advances propose a way to calculate the leave-one-out influence function for
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We extend that recent work to estimate the change
in validation loss, if a training node is removed from the training dataset. We
use this estimate and a new theoretically motivated relabelling function to
denoise the training dataset. We propose two DeGLIF variants to identify noisy
nodes. Both these variants do not require any information about the noise model
or the noise level in the dataset; DeGLIF also does not estimate these
quantities. For one of these variants, we prove that the noisy points detected
can indeed increase risk. We carry out detailed computational experiments on
different datasets to show the effectiveness of DeGLIF. It achieves better
accuracy than other baseline algorithms

Result: 在Phi3和Llama3模型及问答、摘要、翻译任务中，新方法优于语义熵。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了语义熵的局限性，为LLM不确定性量化提供了更优方案。

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) can be detected by assessing
the uncertainty of model outputs, typically measured using entropy. Semantic
entropy (SE) enhances traditional entropy estimation by quantifying uncertainty
at the semantic cluster level. However, as modern LLMs generate longer
one-sentence responses, SE becomes less effective because it overlooks two
crucial factors: intra-cluster similarity (the spread within a cluster) and
inter-cluster similarity (the distance between clusters). To address these
limitations, we propose a simple black-box uncertainty quantification method
inspired by nearest neighbor estimates of entropy. Our approach can also be
easily extended to white-box settings by incorporating token probabilities.
Additionally, we provide theoretical results showing that our method
generalizes semantic entropy. Extensive empirical results demonstrate its
effectiveness compared to semantic entropy across two recent LLMs (Phi3 and
Llama3) and three common text generation tasks: question answering, text
summarization, and machine translation. Our code is available at

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are pivotal in computer vision and Big
Data analytics but demand significant computational resources when trained on
large-scale datasets. Conventional training via back-propagation (BP) with
losses like Mean Squared Error or Cross-Entropy often requires extensive
iterations and may converge sub-optimally. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative by leveraging superposition, tunneling, and entanglement to search
complex optimization landscapes more efficiently. In this work, we propose a
hybrid optimization method that combines an Unconstrained Binary Quadratic
Programming (UBQP) formulation with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to
accelerate CNN training. Evaluated on the MNIST dataset, our approach achieves
a 10--15\% accuracy improvement over a standard BP-CNN baseline while
maintaining similar execution times. These results illustrate the potential of
hybrid quantum-classical techniques in High-Performance Computing (HPC)
environments for Big Data and Deep Learning. Fully realizing these benefits,
however, requires a careful alignment of algorithmic structures with underlying
quantum mechanisms.

Motivation: 随着Vision Transformer（ViT）在计算机视觉任务中表现出优于CNN的性能，研究者希望探索其在RUL预测中的潜力，但直接应用于多变量传感器数据存在挑战。

Method: 提出PerFormer方法，通过排列多变量时间序列数据以模拟图像数据的空间特性，并设计了一种新的排列损失函数来生成所需的排列矩阵。

Result: 在NASA的C-MAPSS数据集上，PerFormer在RUL预测中表现优于CNN、RNN和其他Transformer模型。

Conclusion: PerFormer展示了其在PHM应用中的有效性和潜力。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) for degradation systems
is crucial in modern prognostic and health management (PHM). Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), initially developed for tasks like image and video
recognition, have proven highly effectively in RUL prediction, demonstrating
remarkable performance. However, with the emergence of the Vision Transformer
(ViT), a Transformer model tailored for computer vision tasks such as image
classification, and its demonstrated superiority over CNNs, there is a natural
inclination to explore its potential in enhancing RUL prediction accuracy.
Nonetheless, applying ViT directly to multivariate sensor data for RUL
prediction poses challenges, primarily due to the ambiguous nature of spatial
information in time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the
PerFormer, a permutation-based vision transformer approach designed to permute
multivariate time series data, mimicking spatial characteristics akin to image
data, thereby making it suitable for ViT. To generate the desired permutation
matrix, we introduce a novel permutation loss function aimed at guiding the
convergence of any matrix towards a permutation matrix. Our experiments on
NASA's C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate the PerFormer's superior performance in RUL
prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods employing CNNs, Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), and various Transformer models. This underscores its
effectiveness and potential in PHM applications.

Conclusion: MB-RS-QVI方法在风险敏感MDP中具有理论上的紧致性，为相关学习问题提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper we analyze the sample complexities of learning the optimal
state-action value function $Q^*$ and an optimal policy $\pi^*$ in a discounted
Markov decision process (MDP) where the agent has recursive entropic
risk-preferences with risk-parameter $\beta\neq 0$ and where a generative model
of the MDP is available. We provide and analyze a simple model based approach
which we call model-based risk-sensitive $Q$-value-iteration (MB-RS-QVI) which
leads to $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC-bounds on $\|Q^*-Q^k\|$, and
$\|V^*-V^{\pi_k}\|$ where $Q_k$ is the output of MB-RS-QVI after k iterations
and $\pi_k$ is the greedy policy with respect to $Q_k$. Both PAC-bounds have
exponential dependence on the effective horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ and the
strength of this dependence grows with the learners risk-sensitivity $|\beta|$.
We also provide two lower bounds which shows that exponential dependence on
$|\beta|\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ is unavoidable in both cases. The lower bounds
reveal that the PAC-bounds are both tight in $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and
that the PAC-bound on $Q$-learning is tight in the number of actions $A$, and
that the PAC-bound on policy-learning is nearly tight in $A$.

Motivation: 现有蛋白质序列设计方法的训练目标是序列恢复，但未能保证设计性（即序列能否折叠成目标结构）。

Method: 引入Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)和Residue-level Designability Preference Optimization (ResiDPO)，利用AlphaFold pLDDT分数作为偏好信号，并在残基级别优化设计性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的酶设计基准测试中，设计成功率从6.56%提升至17.57%。

Conclusion: 通过重新定义训练目标并引入残基级优化，显著提高了蛋白质序列设计的成功率。

Abstract: Protein sequence design methods have demonstrated strong performance in
sequence generation for de novo protein design. However, as the training
objective was sequence recovery, it does not guarantee designability--the
likelihood that a designed sequence folds into the desired structure. To bridge
this gap, we redefine the training objective by steering sequence generation
toward high designability. To do this, we integrate Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), using AlphaFold pLDDT scores as the preference signal,
which significantly improves the in silico design success rate. To further
refine sequence generation at a finer, residue-level granularity, we introduce
Residue-level Designability Preference Optimization (ResiDPO), which applies
residue-level structural rewards and decouples optimization across residues.
This enables direct improvement in designability while preserving regions that
already perform well. Using a curated dataset with residue-level annotations,
we fine-tune LigandMPNN with ResiDPO to obtain EnhancedMPNN, which achieves a
nearly 3-fold increase in in silico design success rate (from 6.56% to 17.57%)
on a challenging enzyme design benchmark.

Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art generative models in various domains,
yet their samples often fail to satisfy downstream objectives such as safety
constraints or domain-specific validity. Existing techniques for alignment
require gradients, internal model access, or large computational budgets. We
introduce an inference-time alignment framework based on evolutionary
algorithms. We treat diffusion models as black-boxes and search their latent
space to maximize alignment objectives. Our method enables efficient
inference-time alignment for both differentiable and non-differentiable
alignment objectives across a range of diffusion models. On the DrawBench and
Open Image Preferences benchmark, our EA methods outperform state-of-the-art
gradient-based and gradient-free inference-time methods. In terms of memory

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统材料科学数据集仅包含原子几何结构，限制了多模态学习和数据分析的应用。

Method: 通过人类参与的流程，结合领域知识和标准化描述符，构建高质量注释的多模态数据集。

Result: 评估显示模态间性能差异显著，注释质量对泛化能力至关重要。

Conclusion: MCS-Set为多模态模型基准测试、注释实践改进和材料科学数据集的可访问性提供了基础。

Abstract: Most materials science datasets are limited to atomic geometries (e.g., XYZ
files), restricting their utility for multimodal learning and comprehensive
data-centric analysis. These constraints have historically impeded the adoption
of advanced machine learning techniques in the field. This work introduces
MultiCrystalSpectrumSet (MCS-Set), a curated framework that expands materials
datasets by integrating atomic structures with 2D projections and structured
textual annotations, including lattice parameters and coordination metrics.
MCS-Set enables two key tasks: (1) multimodal property and summary prediction,
and (2) constrained crystal generation with partial cluster supervision.
Leveraging a human-in-the-loop pipeline, MCS-Set combines domain expertise with
standardized descriptors for high-quality annotation. Evaluations using
state-of-the-art language and vision-language models reveal substantial
modality-specific performance gaps and highlight the importance of annotation
quality for generalization. MCS-Set offers a foundation for benchmarking
multimodal models, advancing annotation practices, and promoting accessible,
versatile materials science datasets. The dataset and implementations are
available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/MultiCrystalSpectrumSet.

TLDR: 提出了一种新的主动学习框架，适用于多类分类，放宽了传统的可实现性假设，适用于更广泛的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代理的主动学习算法依赖可实现性假设，限制了其在实际误设场景中的应用。本文旨在放宽这一假设。

Method: 在模型类为凸的条件下，提出了一种基于代理风险最小化的主动学习算法，通过聚合模型生成非适当分类器。

Result: 在比可实现性更弱的条件下，仍能获得与先前工作相当的标签和样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 新算法在非可实现性场景中表现优于现有方法，扩展了主动学习的适用范围。

Abstract: We present a new active learning framework for multiclass classification
based on surrogate risk minimization that operates beyond the standard
realizability assumption. Existing surrogate-based active learning algorithms
crucially rely on realizability$\unicode{x2014}$the assumption that the optimal
surrogate predictor lies within the model class$\unicode{x2014}$limiting their
applicability in practical, misspecified settings. In this work we show that
under conditions significantly weaker than realizability, as long as the class
of models considered is convex, one can still obtain a label and sample
complexity comparable to prior work. Despite achieving similar rates, the
algorithmic approaches from prior works can be shown to fail in non-realizable
settings where our assumption is satisfied. Our epoch-based active learning
algorithm departs from prior methods by fitting a model from the full class to
the queried data in each epoch and returning an improper classifier obtained by
aggregating these models.

TLDR: Foresight是一种自适应层重用技术，通过减少去噪步骤中的计算冗余，显著提升视频生成效率，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiTs）在视频生成中计算成本高，静态缓存方法无法适应生成动态，导致速度与质量之间的次优权衡。

Method: Foresight动态识别并重用DiT块输出，根据生成参数（如分辨率和去噪计划）优化效率。

Result: 在OpenSora、Latte和CogVideoX上，Foresight实现了最高1.63倍的端到端加速，同时保持视频质量。

Conclusion: Foresight通过自适应层重用，显著提升了视频生成的效率，为计算密集型任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art results in
text-to-image, text-to-video generation, and editing. However, their large
model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple
denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching
mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to
generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and
quality.
  We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces
computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline
performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for
all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution
and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and
CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to 1.63x end-to-end speedup, while maintaining
video quality. The source code of Foresight is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在医疗时间序列分类中表现优异，但其复杂性和不透明性限制了其在临床环境中的可信度。

Method: 提出CIF方法，通过跨通道信息融合增强信噪比，并结合TCN构建分类框架。

Result: 在多个EEG和ECG数据集上，该方法在分类性能和透明度上均优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: CIF与TCN结合为医疗时间序列分类提供了高效且透明的解决方案。

Abstract: The automatic classification of medical time series signals, such as
electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG), plays a pivotal role in
clinical decision support and early detection of diseases. Although Transformer
based models have achieved notable performance by implicitly modeling temporal
dependencies through self-attention mechanisms, their inherently complex
architectures and opaque reasoning processes undermine their trustworthiness in
high stakes clinical settings. In response to these limitations, this study
shifts focus toward a modeling paradigm that emphasizes structural
transparency, aligning more closely with the intrinsic characteristics of
medical data. We propose a novel method, Channel Imposed Fusion (CIF), which
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio through cross-channel information fusion,
effectively reduces redundancy, and improves classification performance.
Furthermore, we integrate CIF with the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN),
known for its structural simplicity and controllable receptive field, to
construct an efficient and explicit classification framework. Experimental
results on multiple publicly available EEG and ECG datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
approaches in terms of various classification metrics, but also significantly
enhances the transparency of the classification process, offering a novel
perspective for medical time series classification.

Result: 实验表明，FSNet在多种优化问题中提供可行解，速度显著快于传统求解器，且解决方案质量相当或更好。

Conclusion: FSNet是一种高效且可靠的约束优化求解方法，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Efficiently solving constrained optimization problems is crucial for numerous
real-world applications, yet traditional solvers are often computationally
prohibitive for real-time use. Machine learning-based approaches have emerged
as a promising alternative to provide approximate solutions at faster speeds,
but they struggle to strictly enforce constraints, leading to infeasible
solutions in practice. To address this, we propose the
Feasibility-Seeking-Integrated Neural Network (FSNet), which integrates a
feasibility-seeking step directly into its solution procedure to ensure
constraint satisfaction. This feasibility-seeking step solves an unconstrained
optimization problem that minimizes constraint violations in a differentiable
manner, enabling end-to-end training and providing guarantees on feasibility
and convergence. Our experiments across a range of different optimization
problems, including both smooth/nonsmooth and convex/nonconvex problems,
demonstrate that FSNet can provide feasible solutions with solution quality
comparable to (or in some cases better than) traditional solvers, at
significantly faster speeds.

Motivation: 理解LLM中特征表示的演变对提高其可解释性和鲁棒性至关重要，但现有方法依赖数据且限于事后分析。

Method: 使用Centered Kernel Alignment（CKA）分析预训练LLM中的表示动态，识别关键层，并通过谱分析揭示其语义转变。

Result: 关键层在微调时受影响最大，且其变化由顶部主成分驱动。应用场景包括高效领域适应和防御后门攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM的改进提供了理论基础，并在实际应用中展示了有效性。

Abstract: Understanding how feature representations evolve across layers in large
language models (LLMs) is key to improving their interpretability and
robustness. While recent studies have identified critical layers linked to
specific functions or behaviors, these efforts typically rely on data-dependent
analyses of fine-tuned models, limiting their use to post-hoc settings. In
contrast, we introduce a data-oblivious approach to identify intrinsic critical
layers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs by analyzing representation dynamics via Centered
Kernel Alignment(CKA). We show that layers with significant shifts in
representation space are also those most affected during fine-tuning--a pattern
that holds consistently across tasks for a given model. Our spectral analysis
further reveals that these shifts are driven by changes in the top principal
components, which encode semantic transitions from rationales to conclusions.
We further apply these findings to two practical scenarios: efficient domain
adaptation, where fine-tuning critical layers leads to greater loss reduction
compared to non-critical layers; and backdoor defense, where freezing them
reduces attack success rates by up to 40%.

Result: 在四个数据密集型工作负载上，FarSight性能优于现有系统最高3.6倍。

Conclusion: 研究表明现代机器学习技术可有效应用于复杂、性能关键的软件运行时问题。

Abstract: Modern software systems face increasing runtime performance demands,
particularly in emerging architectures like far memory, where local-memory
misses incur significant latency. While machine learning (ML) has proven
effective in offline systems optimization, its application to high-frequency,
runtime-level problems remains limited due to strict performance,
generalization, and integration constraints. We present FarSight, a Linux-based
far-memory system that leverages deep learning (DL) to efficiently perform
accurate data prefetching. FarSight separates application semantics from
runtime memory layout, allowing offline-trained DL models to predict access
patterns using a compact vocabulary of ordinal possibilities, resolved at
runtime through lightweight mapping structures. By combining asynchronous
inference, lookahead prediction, and a cache-resident DL model, FarSight
achieves high prediction accuracy with low runtime overhead. Our evaluation of
FarSight on four data-intensive workloads shows that it outperforms the
state-of-the-art far-memory system by up to 3.6 times. Overall, this work
demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of applying modern ML techniques to
complex, performance-critical software runtime problems.

TLDR: CLARIFY是一种基于偏好的强化学习方法，通过对比学习解决模糊反馈问题，提升标签效率和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在标记相似片段时难以明确偏好，导致标签效率低，限制了PbRL的实际应用。

Method: 提出CLARIFY方法，通过学习包含偏好信息的轨迹嵌入空间，区分模糊片段，选择更明确的查询。

Result: 实验表明，CLARIFY在非理想教师和真实人类反馈场景中优于基线方法，并能学习有意义的轨迹嵌入。

Conclusion: CLARIFY通过解决模糊反馈问题，提升了PbRL的标签效率和实用性。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses explicit reward
engineering by inferring reward functions from human preference comparisons,
enabling better alignment with human intentions. However, humans often struggle
to label a clear preference between similar segments, reducing label efficiency
and limiting PbRL's real-world applicability. To address this, we propose an
offline PbRL method: Contrastive LeArning for ResolvIng Ambiguous Feedback
(CLARIFY), which learns a trajectory embedding space that incorporates
preference information, ensuring clearly distinguished segments are spaced
apart, thus facilitating the selection of more unambiguous queries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CLARIFY outperforms baselines in both non-ideal
teachers and real human feedback settings. Our approach not only selects more
distinguished queries but also learns meaningful trajectory embeddings.

Method: 采用ADB框架，在训练中引入受控统计多样性，调整模型的偏差分布。

Result: 实验显示，ADB显著提升OOD泛化，平均误差降低26.8%，且能高效识别高性能训练策略。

Conclusion: ADB不仅提供了一种提升泛化的实用方法，还重新思考了偏差在鲁棒机器学习中的作用。

Abstract: Machine learning models often degrade when deployed on data distributions
different from their training data. Challenging conventional validation
paradigms, we demonstrate that higher in-distribution (ID) bias can lead to
better out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Our Adaptive Distribution
Bridge (ADB) framework implements this insight by introducing controlled
statistical diversity during training, enabling models to develop bias profiles
that effectively generalize across distributions. Empirically, we observe a
robust negative correlation where higher ID bias corresponds to lower OOD
error--a finding that contradicts standard practices focused on minimizing
validation error. Evaluation on multiple datasets shows our approach
significantly improves OOD generalization. ADB achieves robust mean error
reductions of up to 26.8% compared to traditional cross-validation, and
consistently identifies high-performing training strategies, evidenced by
percentile ranks often exceeding 74.4%. Our work provides both a practical
method for improving generalization and a theoretical framework for
reconsidering the role of bias in robust machine learning.

Conclusion: JojoSCL为scRNA-seq数据聚类提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding
of cellular processes by enabling gene expression analysis at the individual
cell level. Clustering allows for the identification of cell types and the
further discovery of intrinsic patterns in single-cell data. However, the high
dimensionality and sparsity of scRNA-seq data continue to challenge existing
clustering models. In this paper, we introduce JojoSCL, a novel self-supervised
contrastive learning framework for scRNA-seq clustering. By incorporating a
shrinkage estimator based on hierarchical Bayesian estimation, which adjusts
gene expression estimates towards more reliable cluster centroids to reduce
intra-cluster dispersion, and optimized using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate
(SURE), JojoSCL refines both instance-level and cluster-level contrastive
learning. Experiments on ten scRNA-seq datasets substantiate that JojoSCL
consistently outperforms prevalent clustering methods, with further validation
of its practicality through robustness analysis and ablation studies. JojoSCL's

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has attracted increasing attention to mitigate
security and privacy challenges in traditional cloud-centric machine learning
models specifically in healthcare ecosystems. FL methodologies enable the
training of global models through localized policies, allowing independent
operations at the edge clients' level. Conventional first-order FL approaches
face several challenges in personalized model training due to heterogeneous
non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data of each edge client.
Recently, second-order FL approaches maintain the stability and consistency of
non-iid datasets while improving personalized model training. This study
proposes and develops a verifiable and auditable optimized second-order FL
framework BFEL (blockchain-enhanced federated edge learning) based on optimized
FedCurv for personalized healthcare systems. FedCurv incorporates information
about the importance of each parameter to each client's task (through Fisher
Information Matrix) which helps to preserve client-specific knowledge and
reduce model drift during aggregation. Moreover, it minimizes communication
rounds required to achieve a target precision convergence for each edge client
while effectively managing personalized training on non-iid and heterogeneous
data. The incorporation of Ethereum-based model aggregation ensures trust,
verifiability, and auditability while public key encryption enhances privacy
and security. Experimental results of federated CNNs and MLPs utilizing Mnist,
Cifar-10, and PathMnist demonstrate the high efficiency and scalability of the
proposed framework.

Result: 在真实公共数据集上，MTAD-RD的F1分数达到90.97%，优于现有监督方法。

Conclusion: MTAD-RD通过改进模型结构和训练策略，显著提升了WSN异常检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in the data collected by WSNs can provide crucial
evidence for assessing the reliability and stability of WSNs. Existing methods
for WSN anomaly detection often face challenges such as the limited extraction
of spatiotemporal correlation features, the absence of sample labels, few
anomaly samples, and an imbalanced sample distribution. To address these
issues, a spatiotemporal correlation detection model (MTAD-RD) considering both
model architecture and a two-stage training strategy perspective is proposed.
In terms of model structure design, the proposed MTAD-RD backbone network
includes a retentive network (RetNet) enhanced by a cross-retention (CR)
module, a multigranular feature fusion module, and a graph attention network
module to extract internode correlation information. This proposed model can
integrate the intermodal correlation features and spatial features of WSN
neighbor nodes while extracting global information from time series data.
Moreover, its serialized inference characteristic can remarkably reduce
inference overhead. For model training, a two-stage training approach was
designed. First, a contrastive learning proxy task was designed for time series
data with graph structure information in WSNs, enabling the backbone network to
learn transferable features from unlabeled data using unsupervised contrastive
learning methods, thereby addressing the issue of missing sample labels in the
dataset. Then, a caching-based sample sampler was designed to divide samples
into few-shot and contrastive learning data. A specific joint loss function was
developed to jointly train the dual-graph discriminator network to address the
problem of sample imbalance effectively. In experiments carried out on real
public datasets, the designed MTAD-RD anomaly detection method achieved an F1
score of 90.97%, outperforming existing supervised WSN anomaly detection
methods.

Conclusion: COGNATE是一种高效框架，显著减少数据需求并提升性能，适用于稀疏张量程序的硬件加速优化。

Abstract: Sparse tensor programs are essential in deep learning and graph analytics,
driving the need for optimized processing. To meet this demand, specialized
hardware accelerators are being developed. Optimizing these programs for
accelerators is challenging for two reasons: program performance is highly
sensitive to variations in sparse inputs, and early-stage accelerators rely on
expensive simulators. Therefore, ML-based cost models used for optimizing such
programs on general-purpose hardware are often ineffective for early-stage
accelerators, as they require large datasets for proper training. To this end,
we introduce COGNATE, a novel framework that leverages inexpensive data samples
from general-purpose hardware (e.g., CPUs) to train cost models, followed by
few-shot fine-tuning on emerging hardware. COGNATE exploits the homogeneity of
input features across hardware platforms while effectively mitigating
heterogeneity, enabling cost model training with just 5% of the data samples
needed by accelerator-specific models to achieve comparable performance. We
conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that COGNATE outperforms existing
techniques, achieving average speedups of 1.47x (up to 5.46x) for SpMM and
1.39x (up to 4.22x) for SDDMM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的动态图神经网络（DGNNs）在捕捉动态图序列演化时效果和效率差异显著，需要更高效且明确的SAM定义。

Method: 提出TIDFormer，利用日历时间分区信息和一阶邻居提取交互嵌入，通过简单分解联合建模时间和交互特征。

Result: 实验表明TIDFormer在多个数据集上优于现有方法，且效率显著提升。

Conclusion: TIDFormer为动态图建模提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to the proficiency of self-attention mechanisms (SAMs) in capturing
dependencies in sequence modeling, several existing dynamic graph neural
networks (DGNNs) utilize Transformer architectures with various encoding
designs to capture sequential evolutions of dynamic graphs. However, the
effectiveness and efficiency of these Transformer-based DGNNs vary
significantly, highlighting the importance of properly defining the SAM on
dynamic graphs and comprehensively encoding temporal and interactive dynamics
without extra complex modules. In this work, we propose TIDFormer, a dynamic
graph TransFormer that fully exploits Temporal and Interactive Dynamics in an
efficient manner. We clarify and verify the interpretability of our proposed
SAM, addressing the open problem of its uninterpretable definitions on dynamic
graphs in previous works. To model the temporal and interactive dynamics,
respectively, we utilize the calendar-based time partitioning information and
extract informative interaction embeddings for both bipartite and non-bipartite
graphs using merely the sampled first-order neighbors. In addition, we jointly
model temporal and interactive features by capturing potential changes in
historical interaction patterns through a simple decomposition. We conduct
extensive experiments on several dynamic graph datasets to verify the
effectiveness and efficiency of TIDFormer. The experimental results demonstrate
that TIDFormer excels, outperforming state-of-the-art models across most
datasets and experimental settings. Furthermore, TIDFormer exhibits significant
efficiency advantages compared to previous Transformer-based methods.

Abstract: Channel identifiability (CID) refers to the ability to distinguish between
individual channels in time series (TS) modeling. The absence of CID often
results in producing identical outputs for identical inputs, disregarding
channel-specific characteristics. In this paper, we highlight the importance of
CID and propose Channel Normalization (CN), a simple yet effective
normalization strategy that enhances CID by assigning distinct affine
transformation parameters to each channel. We further extend CN in two ways: 1)
Adaptive CN (ACN) dynamically adjusts parameters based on the input TS,
improving adaptability in TS models, and 2) Prototypical CN (PCN) introduces a
set of learnable prototypes instead of per-channel parameters, enabling
applicability to datasets with unknown or varying number of channels and
facilitating use in TS foundation models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CN and its variants by applying them to various TS models, achieving
significant performance gains for both non-CID and CID models. In addition, we
analyze the success of our approach from an information theory perspective.

*Masahiro Kato,Yuki Ikeda abd Kentaro Baba,Takashi Imai,Ryo Inokuchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出了一种基于正样本和无标签数据（PU学习）的方法，用于识别目标营销中的潜在客户，重点关注对产品有兴趣但缺乏公司忠诚度的个体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公司希望通过高效营销吸引潜在客户，尤其是那些对产品有兴趣但缺乏忠诚度的个体，以提升营销效率。

Method: 采用双PU学习方法，通过单阶段优化训练分类器，隐式结合两种PU学习损失。

Result: 数值实验验证了算法的有效性，能够准确识别目标客户群体。

Conclusion: 双PU学习方法在目标营销中表现良好，能有效识别潜在客户。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a method for identifying potential customers in
targeted marketing by applying learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU
learning). We consider a scenario in which a company sells a product and can
observe only the customers who purchased it. Decision-makers seek to market
products effectively based on whether people have loyalty to the company.
Individuals with loyalty are those who are likely to remain interested in the
company even without additional advertising. Consequently, those loyal
customers would likely purchase from the company if they are interested in the
product. In contrast, people with lower loyalty may overlook the product or buy
similar products from other companies unless they receive marketing attention.
Therefore, by focusing marketing efforts on individuals who are interested in
the product but do not have strong loyalty, we can achieve more efficient
marketing. To achieve this goal, we consider how to learn, from limited data, a
classifier that identifies potential customers who (i) have interest in the
product and (ii) do not have loyalty to the company. Although our algorithm
comprises a single-stage optimization, its objective function implicitly
contains two losses derived from standard PU learning settings. For this
reason, we refer to our approach as double PU learning. We verify the validity
of the proposed algorithm through numerical experiments, confirming that it
functions appropriately for the problem at hand.

Abstract: Explaining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has garnered significant attention
due to the need for interpretability, enabling users to understand the behavior
of these black-box models better and extract valuable insights from their
predictions. While numerous post-hoc instance-level explanation methods have
been proposed to interpret GNN predictions, the reliability of these
explanations remains uncertain, particularly in the out-of-distribution or
unknown test datasets. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing
an explainer framework with the confidence scoring module ( ConfExplainer),
grounded in theoretical principle, which is generalized graph information
bottleneck with confidence constraint (GIB-CC), that quantifies the reliability
of generated explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
our approach, highlighting the effectiveness of the confidence score in
enhancing the trustworthiness and robustness of GNN explanations.

Motivation: 解决边缘设备因资源有限难以运行深度学习点云应用的问题。

Method: 提出基于MLP块和神经ODE的PointODE架构，通过参数重用和点归一化优化性能。

Result: PointODE-Elite在Xilinx ZCU104上实现4.9倍加速，3.7倍推理速度提升和3.5倍能效提升，且精度接近SOTA。

Conclusion: PointODE-Elite在精度与推理成本间取得了显著平衡，适合边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Embedded edge devices are often used as a computing platform to run
real-world point cloud applications, but recent deep learning-based methods may
not fit on such devices due to limited resources. In this paper, we aim to fill
this gap by introducing PointODE, a parameter-efficient ResNet-like
architecture for point cloud feature extraction based on a stack of MLP blocks
with residual connections. We leverage Neural ODE (Ordinary Differential
Equation), a continuous-depth version of ResNet originally developed for
modeling the dynamics of continuous-time systems, to compress PointODE by
reusing the same parameters across MLP blocks. The point-wise normalization is
proposed for PointODE to handle the non-uniform distribution of feature points.
We introduce PointODE-Elite as a lightweight version with 0.58M trainable
parameters and design its dedicated accelerator for embedded FPGAs. The
accelerator consists of a four-stage pipeline to parallelize the feature
extraction for multiple points and stores the entire parameters on-chip to
eliminate most of the off-chip data transfers. Compared to the ARM Cortex-A53
CPU, the accelerator implemented on a Xilinx ZCU104 board speeds up the feature
extraction by 4.9x, leading to 3.7x faster inference and 3.5x better
energy-efficiency. Despite the simple architecture, PointODE-Elite shows
competitive accuracy to the state-of-the-art models on both synthetic and
real-world classification datasets, greatly improving the trade-off between
accuracy and inference cost.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的动态权重调整框架RLAE，用于优化大语言模型（LLM）的集成效果，显著提升了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM集成方法采用固定权重策略，无法适应动态上下文需求，限制了性能提升。

Method: 通过马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）建模，引入强化学习代理动态调整权重，结合输入上下文和生成状态，训练目标为输出质量。

Result: 在多样化任务中，RLAE比传统方法准确率提升高达3.3%，且泛化能力强、延迟低。

Conclusion: RLAE为LLM集成提供了更高效的动态框架，无需重新训练即可适应多任务。

Abstract: Ensembling large language models (LLMs) can effectively combine diverse
strengths of different models, offering a promising approach to enhance
performance across various tasks. However, existing methods typically rely on
fixed weighting strategies that fail to adapt to the dynamic, context-dependent
characteristics of LLM capabilities. In this work, we propose Reinforcement
Learning-Assisted Ensemble for LLMs (RLAE), a novel framework that reformulates
LLM ensemble through the lens of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach
introduces a RL agent that dynamically adjusts ensemble weights by considering
both input context and intermediate generation states, with the agent being
trained using rewards that directly correspond to the quality of final outputs.
We implement RLAE using both single-agent and multi-agent reinforcement
learning algorithms ($\text{RLAE}_\text{PPO}$ and $\text{RLAE}_\text{MAPPO}$ ),
demonstrating substantial improvements over conventional ensemble methods.
Extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks show that RLAE outperforms
existing approaches by up to $3.3\%$ accuracy points, offering a more effective
framework for LLM ensembling. Furthermore, our method exhibits superior
generalization capabilities across different tasks without the need for
retraining, while simultaneously achieving lower time latency.

Result: 在多种数据模态下，PSI-PFL显著提升全局模型准确性，比现有基线高出10%，同时确保本地性能公平。

Conclusion: PSI-PFL在数据隐私和异构性关键的应用中提升了联邦学习性能，具有实际价值。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning (ML) model
training while preserving data privacy by keeping data localized across
clients. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data
across clients poses a significant challenge, leading to skewed model updates
and performance degradation. Addressing this, we propose PSI-PFL, a novel
client selection framework for Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) that
leverages the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify and mitigate data
heterogeneity (so-called non-IIDness). Our approach selects more homogeneous
clients based on PSI, reducing the impact of label skew, one of the most
detrimental factors in FL performance. Experimental results over multiple data
modalities (tabular, image, text) demonstrate that PSI-PFL significantly
improves global model accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by up
to 10\% under non-IID scenarios while ensuring fairer local performance.
PSI-PFL enhances FL performance and offers practical benefits in applications
where data privacy and heterogeneity are critical.

Result: 实验显示TMetaNet性能优越，对图噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TMetaNet在动态图分析和元学习中具有潜力。

Abstract: Dynamic graphs evolve continuously, presenting challenges for traditional
graph learning due to their changing structures and temporal dependencies.
Recent advancements have shown potential in addressing these challenges by
developing suitable meta-learning-based dynamic graph neural network models.
However, most meta-learning approaches for dynamic graphs rely on fixed weight
update parameters, neglecting the essential intrinsic complex high-order
topological information of dynamically evolving graphs. We have designed Dowker
Zigzag Persistence (DZP), an efficient and stable dynamic graph persistent
homology representation method based on Dowker complex and zigzag persistence,
to capture the high-order features of dynamic graphs. Armed with the DZP ideas,
we propose TMetaNet, a new meta-learning parameter update model based on
dynamic topological features. By utilizing the distances between high-order
topological features, TMetaNet enables more effective adaptation across
snapshots. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate TMetaNet's
state-of-the-art performance and resilience to graph noise, illustrating its
high potential for meta-learning and dynamic graph analysis. Our code is

Result: LLMs在零样本预测中表现较差，对噪声敏感，改进其鲁棒性仍具挑战。

Conclusion: 建议关注LLMs在数值序列处理上的微调，而非零样本预测。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse
tasks without domain-specific training, fueling interest in their potential for
time-series forecasting. While LLMs have shown potential in zero-shot
forecasting through prompting alone, recent studies suggest that LLMs lack
inherent effectiveness in forecasting. Given these conflicting findings, a
rigorous validation is essential for drawing reliable conclusions. In this
paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs as zero-shot forecasters compared
to state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our experiments show that LLM-based
zero-shot forecasters often struggle to achieve high accuracy due to their
sensitivity to noise, underperforming even simple domain-specific models. We
have explored solutions to reduce LLMs' sensitivity to noise in the zero-shot
setting, but improving their robustness remains a significant challenge. Our
findings suggest that rather than emphasizing zero-shot forecasting, a more
promising direction would be to focus on fine-tuning LLMs to better process
numerical sequences. Our experimental code is available at

Conclusion: TD算法在Hanabi中更具优势，尤其是适应性和性能平衡方面。

Abstract: Hanabi has become a popular game for research when it comes to reinforcement
learning (RL) as it is one of the few cooperative card games where you have
incomplete knowledge of the entire environment, thus presenting a challenge for
a RL agent. We explored different tabular and deep reinforcement learning
algorithms to see which had the best performance both against an agent of the
same type and also against other types of agents. We establish that certain
agents played their highest scoring games against specific agents while others
exhibited higher scores on average by adapting to the opposing agent's
behavior. We attempted to quantify the conditions under which each algorithm
provides the best advantage and identified the most interesting interactions
between agents of different types. In the end, we found that temporal
difference (TD) algorithms had better overall performance and balancing of play
types compared to tabular agents. Specifically, tabular Expected SARSA and deep
Q-Learning agents showed the best performance.

Abstract: We aim to better understand the tradeoffs between traditional and

specifically, we wish to better understand the performance loss incurred when
using a generative RL policy instead of using a traditional approach to find
optimal control policies for specific instances. Our comparison is based on a
simplified micro-grid model, that includes a load component, a photovoltaic
source, and a storage device. Based on this model, we examine three use cases
of increasing complexity: ideal storage with convex cost functions, lossy
storage devices, and lossy storage devices with convex transmission losses.
With the aim of promoting the principled use RL based methods in this
challenging and important domain, we provide a detailed formulation of each use
case and a detailed description of the optimization challenges. We then compare
the performance of traditional and RL methods, discuss settings in which it is
beneficial to use each method, and suggest avenues for future investigation.

Motivation: 现实场景中获取高质量标注数据成本高，现有半监督学习方法依赖固定阈值或更新阈值过程耗时，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出SST框架，引入SAT机制，根据模型学习进度自适应调整类别特定阈值，确保伪标签质量。

Conclusion: SST是一种高效、可扩展的半监督学习框架，显著减少对标注数据的依赖，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated exceptional performance in supervised
learning, benefiting from abundant high-quality annotated data. However,
obtaining such data in real-world scenarios is costly and labor-intensive.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to this problem. Recent
studies, such as Semi-ViT and Noisy Student, which employ consistency
regularization or pseudo-labeling, have demonstrated significant achievements.
However, they still face challenges, particularly in accurately selecting
sufficient high-quality pseudo-labels due to their reliance on fixed
thresholds. Recent methods such as FlexMatch and FreeMatch have introduced
flexible or self-adaptive thresholding techniques, greatly advancing SSL
research. Nonetheless, their process of updating thresholds at each iteration
is deemed time-consuming, computationally intensive, and potentially
unnecessary. To address these issues, we propose Self-training with
Self-adaptive Thresholding (SST), a novel, effective, and efficient SSL
framework. SST introduces an innovative Self-Adaptive Thresholding (SAT)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts class-specific thresholds based on the
model's learning progress. SAT ensures the selection of high-quality
pseudo-labeled data, mitigating the risks of inaccurate pseudo-labels and
confirmation bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SST achieves
state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency, generalization, and
scalability across various architectures and datasets. Semi-SST-ViT-Huge
achieves the best results on competitive ImageNet-1K SSL benchmarks, with 80.7%
/ 84.9% Top-1 accuracy using only 1% / 10% labeled data. Compared to the
fully-supervised DeiT-III-ViT-Huge, which achieves 84.8% Top-1 accuracy using
100% labeled data, our method demonstrates superior performance using only 10%
labeled data.

Result: ModelNet成功模拟了真实FL设置，并通过实验验证了其变体在领域转移和聚合策略中的有效性。

Conclusion: ModelNet为经典和基于图的FL研究提供了实用的基准，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training
machine learning models across distributed data sources while preserving data
locality. However, the privacy of local data is always a pivotal concern and
has received a lot of attention in recent research on the FL regime. Moreover,
the lack of domain heterogeneity and client-specific segregation in the
benchmarks remains a critical bottleneck for rigorous evaluation. In this
paper, we introduce ModelNet, a novel image classification dataset constructed
from the embeddings extracted from a pre-trained ResNet50 model. First, we
modify the CIFAR100 dataset into three client-specific variants, considering
three domain heterogeneities (homogeneous, heterogeneous, and random).
Subsequently, we train each client-specific subset of all three variants on the
pre-trained ResNet50 model to save model parameters. In addition to
multi-domain image data, we propose a new hypothesis to define the FL algorithm
that can access the anonymized model parameters to preserve the local privacy
in a more effective manner compared to existing ones. ModelNet is designed to
simulate realistic FL settings by incorporating non-IID data distributions and
client diversity design principles in the mainframe for both conventional and
futuristic graph-driven FL algorithms. The three variants are ModelNet-S,
ModelNet-D, and ModelNet-R, which are based on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and
random data settings, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to propose a cross-environment client-specific FL dataset along with the
graph-based variant. Extensive experiments based on domain shifts and
aggregation strategies show the effectiveness of the above variants, making it
a practical benchmark for classical and graph-based FL research. The dataset
and related code are available online.

Motivation: 解决持续学习中模型在保留旧知识的同时学习新知识的平衡问题。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准上，FL 平均准确率提升达 4.91%（类增量）和 3.51%（任务增量），并在 ImageNet 上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FL 通过双向正则化有效平衡稳定性和可塑性，显著提升持续学习性能。

Abstract: We introduce Flashback Learning (FL), a novel method designed to harmonize
the stability and plasticity of models in Continual Learning (CL). Unlike prior
approaches that primarily focus on regularizing model updates to preserve old
information while learning new concepts, FL explicitly balances this trade-off
through a bidirectional form of regularization. This approach effectively
guides the model to swiftly incorporate new knowledge while actively retaining
its old knowledge. FL operates through a two-phase training process and can be
seamlessly integrated into various CL methods, including replay, parameter
regularization, distillation, and dynamic architecture techniques. In designing
FL, we use two distinct knowledge bases: one to enhance plasticity and another
to improve stability. FL ensures a more balanced model by utilizing both
knowledge bases to regularize model updates. Theoretically, we analyze how the
FL mechanism enhances the stability-plasticity balance. Empirically, FL
demonstrates tangible improvements over baseline methods within the same
training budget. By integrating FL into at least one representative baseline
from each CL category, we observed an average accuracy improvement of up to
4.91% in Class-Incremental and 3.51% in Task-Incremental settings on standard
image classification benchmarks. Additionally, measurements of the
stability-to-plasticity ratio confirm that FL effectively enhances this
balance. FL also outperforms state-of-the-art CL methods on more challenging
datasets like ImageNet.

Motivation: 当前AC-OPF求解器在约束空间和最优解之间的复杂关系建模上存在不足，且缺乏时空信息的整合。

Method: 提出DDA-PIGCN方法，结合多层硬物理约束和动态域适应学习机制，利用电网物理结构捕获时空依赖关系。

Result: 在IEEE标准测试案例中，MAE为0.0011至0.0624，约束满足率为99.6%至100%。

Conclusion: DDA-PIGCN是一种可靠且高效的AC-OPF求解器，能够有效整合时空信息并优化约束建模。

Abstract: Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) aims to optimize generator
power outputs by utilizing the non-linear relationships between voltage
magnitudes and phase angles in a power system. However, current AC-OPF solvers
struggle to effectively represent the complex relationship between variable
distributions in the constraint space and their corresponding optimal
solutions. This limitation in constraint modeling restricts the system's
ability to develop diverse knowledge representations. Additionally, modeling
the power grid solely based on spatial topology further limits the integration
of additional prior knowledge, such as temporal information. To overcome these
challenges, we propose DDA-PIGCN (Dynamic Domain Adaptation-Driven
Physics-Informed Graph Convolutional Network), a new method designed to address
constraint-related issues and build a graph-based learning framework that
incorporates spatiotemporal features. DDA-PIGCN improves consistency
optimization for features with varying long-range dependencies by applying
multi-layer, hard physics-informed constraints. It also uses a dynamic domain
adaptation learning mechanism that iteratively updates and refines key state
variables under predefined constraints, enabling precise constraint
verification. Moreover, it captures spatiotemporal dependencies between
generators and loads by leveraging the physical structure of the power grid,
allowing for deep integration of topological information across time and space.
Extensive comparative and ablation studies show that DDA-PIGCN delivers strong
performance across several IEEE standard test cases (such as case9, case30, and
case300), achieving mean absolute errors (MAE) from 0.0011 to 0.0624 and
constraint satisfaction rates between 99.6% and 100%, establishing it as a
reliable and efficient AC-OPF solver.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the need for up-to-date
and well-organized benchmarks becomes increasingly critical. However, many
existing datasets are scattered, difficult to manage, and make it challenging
to perform evaluations tailored to specific needs or domains, despite the
growing importance of domain-specific models in areas such as math or code. In
this paper, we introduce BenchHub, a dynamic benchmark repository that empowers
researchers and developers to evaluate LLMs more effectively. BenchHub
aggregates and automatically classifies benchmark datasets from diverse
domains, integrating 303K questions across 38 benchmarks. It is designed to
support continuous updates and scalable data management, enabling flexible and
customizable evaluation tailored to various domains or use cases. Through
extensive experiments with various LLM families, we demonstrate that model
performance varies significantly across domain-specific subsets, emphasizing
the importance of domain-aware benchmarking. We believe BenchHub can encourage
better dataset reuse, more transparent model comparisons, and easier
identification of underrepresented areas in existing benchmarks, offering a
critical infrastructure for advancing LLM evaluation research.

Conclusion: 当前图去学习方法存在严重的隐私漏洞，需要更强的防御机制。

Abstract: Graph unlearning methods aim to efficiently remove the impact of sensitive
data from trained GNNs without full retraining, assuming that deleted
information cannot be recovered. In this work, we challenge this assumption by
introducing the graph unlearning inversion attack: given only black-box access
to an unlearned GNN and partial graph knowledge, can an adversary reconstruct
the removed edges? We identify two key challenges: varying
probability-similarity thresholds for unlearned versus retained edges, and the
difficulty of locating unlearned edge endpoints, and address them with
TrendAttack. First, we derive and exploit the confidence pitfall, a theoretical
and empirical pattern showing that nodes adjacent to unlearned edges exhibit a
large drop in model confidence. Second, we design an adaptive prediction
mechanism that applies different similarity thresholds to unlearned and other
membership edges. Our framework flexibly integrates existing membership
inference techniques and extends them with trend features. Experiments on four
real-world datasets demonstrate that TrendAttack significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art GNN membership inference baselines, exposing a critical
privacy vulnerability in current graph unlearning methods.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于广义高斯分布（GG）的统一端到端框架，用于优化大语言模型（LLM），包括初始化方案、后训练正则化方法和硬件高效的8位浮点格式，显著减少了参数数量并提升了性能。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管LLM研究进展迅速，但模型参数的统计分布及其对初始化、训练动态和下游效率的影响研究较少。论文旨在通过统计建模提升LLM的效率和可扩展性。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能显著减少参数（高达90%），同时保持或超越标准训练基线的性能。

Conclusion: 通过统计建模，论文为高效、可扩展且硬件感知的AI系统开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in the research and deployment of large language
models (LLMs), the statistical distribution of model parameters, as well as
their influence on initialization, training dynamics, and downstream
efficiency, has received surprisingly little attention. A recent work
introduced BackSlash, a training-time compression algorithm. It first
demonstrated that pre-trained LLM parameters follow generalized Gaussian
distributions (GGDs) better. By optimizing GG priors during training, BackSlash
can reduce parameters by up to 90\% with minimal performance loss. Building on
this foundational insight, we propose a unified, end-to-end framework for LLM
optimization based on the GG model. Our contributions are threefold: (1)
GG-based initialization scheme that aligns with the statistical structure of
trained models, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy; (2)
DeepShape, a post-training regularization method that reshapes weight
distributions to match a GG profile, improving compressibility with minimized
degradation in performance; and (3) RF8, a compact and hardware-efficient 8-bit
floating-point format designed for GG-distributed-initialized BackSlash
training, enabling low-cost inference without compromising accuracy.
Experiments across diverse model architectures show that our framework
consistently yields smaller and faster models that match or outperform standard
training baselines. By grounding LLM development in principled statistical
modeling, this work forges a new path toward efficient, scalable, and
hardware-aware AI systems. The code is available on our project page:

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: FLoE是一种新型PEFT框架，通过动态识别关键层和自动优化LoRA秩，显著提升模型适应效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法在所有层均匀部署LoRA适配器，忽略了层贡献的异质性和任务需求，导致冗余和效率低下。

Method: FLoE引入Fisher信息评分机制动态识别关键层，并结合贝叶斯优化自动分配LoRA秩。

Result: 实验表明FLoE在多种LLM和基准测试中实现了高效的精度-效率平衡。

Conclusion: FLoE特别适合资源受限环境，能快速适应任务需求。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a widely
adopted strategy for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to
downstream tasks, significantly reducing memory and computational costs.
However, most existing PEFT techniques uniformly deploy LoRA adapters across
all layers, disregarding the intrinsic heterogeneity of layer contributions and
task-specific rank requirements. This uniform paradigm leads to redundant
parameter allocation and suboptimal adaptation efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose FLoE, a novel PEFT framework that introduces two key
innovations: (i) a Fisher information-guided importance scoring mechanism to
dynamically identify task-critical transformer layers for MoE-based low-rank
adaptation, enabling sparse adapter deployment; and (ii) a Bayesian
optimization-driven rank allocator that automatically determines optimal LoRA
ranks on specific datasets without exhaustive grid search. Extensive
experiments across diverse LLMs and benchmarks reveal that FLoE achieves
impressive efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, making FLoE particularly
advantageous in resource-constrained environments that necessitate rapid
adaptation.

*Diogo Landau,Ingeborg de Pater,Mihaela Mitici,Nishant Saurabh*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种协作式联邦学习框架，用于飞机发动机的剩余使用寿命（RUL）预测，解决了数据隐私和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题，航空公司不愿共享运行至故障数据，导致预测维护中数据不足。

Method: 开发了联邦学习框架，提出四种参数聚合方法以增强对噪声数据的鲁棒性，并设计了去中心化验证流程。

Result: 在六家航空公司中，联邦学习框架在五家上表现优于独立模型，且新聚合方法提高了对噪声的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 协作式联邦学习框架能有效提升RUL预测准确性，同时保护数据隐私并应对噪声数据。

Abstract: Complex systems such as aircraft engines are continuously monitored by
sensors. In predictive aircraft maintenance, the collected sensor measurements
are used to estimate the health condition and the Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
of such systems. However, a major challenge when developing prognostics is the
limited number of run-to-failure data samples. This challenge could be overcome
if multiple airlines would share their run-to-failure data samples such that
sufficient learning can be achieved. Due to privacy concerns, however, airlines
are reluctant to share their data in a centralized setting. In this paper, a
collaborative federated learning framework is therefore developed instead.
Here, several airlines cooperate to train a collective RUL prognostic machine
learning model, without the need to centrally share their data. For this, a
decentralized validation procedure is proposed to validate the prognostics
model without sharing any data. Moreover, sensor data is often noisy and of low
quality. This paper therefore proposes four novel methods to aggregate the
parameters of the global prognostic model. These methods enhance the robustness
of the FL framework against noisy data. The proposed framework is illustrated
for training a collaborative RUL prognostic model for aircraft engines, using
the N-CMAPSS dataset. Here, six airlines are considered, that collaborate in
the FL framework to train a collective RUL prognostic model for their
aircraft's engines. When comparing the proposed FL framework with the case
where each airline independently develops their own prognostic model, the
results show that FL leads to more accurate RUL prognostics for five out of the
six airlines. Moreover, the novel robust aggregation methods render the FL
framework robust to noisy data samples.

Motivation: DeFi借贷面临利率优化、坏账管理和资本效率提升的挑战，现有规则模型难以适应动态市场条件。

Method: 利用Aave协议的历史数据，评估了三种离线强化学习方法：CQL、BC和TD3-BC。

Result: TD3-BC在平衡利用率、资本稳定性和风险方面表现最佳，优于现有模型，并能适应历史压力事件。

Conclusion: TD3-BC展示了在DeFi借贷中实现自动化实时治理的潜力。

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending enables permissionless borrowing via
smart contracts. However, it faces challenges in optimizing interest rates,
mitigating bad debt, and improving capital efficiency. Rule-based interest-rate
models struggle to adapt to dynamic market conditions, leading to
inefficiencies. This work applies Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimize interest rate adjustments in DeFi lending protocols. Using historical
data from Aave protocol, we evaluate three RL approaches: Conservative
Q-Learning (CQL), Behavior Cloning (BC), and TD3 with Behavior Cloning
(TD3-BC). TD3-BC demonstrates superior performance in balancing utilization,
capital stability, and risk, outperforming existing models. It adapts
effectively to historical stress events like the May 2021 crash and the March
2023 USDC depeg, showcasing potential for automated, real-time governance.

Conclusion: 有界自适应裁剪能有效缓解差分隐私学习中的不公平问题，显著提升少数群体的模型性能。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has become an essential framework for
privacy-preserving machine learning. Existing DP learning methods, however,
often have disparate impacts on model predictions, e.g., for minority groups.
Gradient clipping, which is often used in DP learning, can suppress larger
gradients from challenging samples. We show that this problem is amplified by
adaptive clipping, which will often shrink the clipping bound to tiny values to
match a well-fitting majority, while significantly reducing the accuracy for
others. We propose bounded adaptive clipping, which introduces a tunable lower
bound to prevent excessive gradient suppression. Our method improves the
accuracy of the worst-performing class on average over 10 percentage points on
skewed MNIST and Fashion MNIST compared to the unbounded adaptive clipping, and
over 5 percentage points over constant clipping.

Result: 该方法显著减少了数据表示大小和比较时间，同时保持了相似性测量的强相关性。

Conclusion: 极端量化方法在节省空间和计算成本的同时，仍能保持较高的准确性，适用于高维向量搜索领域。

Abstract: Many modern search domains comprise high-dimensional vectors of floating
point numbers derived from neural networks, in the form of embeddings. Typical
embeddings range in size from hundreds to thousands of dimensions, making the
size of the embeddings, and the speed of comparison, a significant issue.
  Quantisation is a class of mechanism which replaces the floating point values
with a smaller representation, for example a short integer. This gives an
approximation of the embedding space in return for a smaller data
representation and a faster comparison function.
  Here we take this idea almost to its extreme: we show how vectors of
arbitrary-precision floating point values can be replaced by vectors whose
elements are drawn from the set {-1,0,1}. This yields very significant savings
in space and metric evaluation cost, while maintaining a strong correlation for
similarity measurements.
  This is achieved by way of a class of convex polytopes which exist in the
high-dimensional space. In this article we give an outline description of these
objects, and show how they can be used for the basis of such radical
quantisation while maintaining a surprising degree of accuracy.

Abstract: The integration of wind energy into power grids necessitates accurate
ultra-short-term wind power forecasting to ensure grid stability and optimize
resource allocation. This study introduces M2WLLM, an innovative model that
leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for predicting wind
power output at granular time intervals. M2WLLM overcomes the limitations of
traditional and deep learning methods by seamlessly integrating textual
information and temporal numerical data, significantly improving wind power
forecasting accuracy through multi-modal data. Its architecture features a
Prompt Embedder and a Data Embedder, enabling an effective fusion of textual
prompts and numerical inputs within the LLMs framework. The Semantic Augmenter
within the Data Embedder translates temporal data into a format that the LLMs
can comprehend, enabling it to extract latent features and improve prediction
accuracy. The empirical evaluations conducted on wind farm data from three
Chinese provinces demonstrate that M2WLLM consistently outperforms existing
methods, such as GPT4TS, across various datasets and prediction horizons. The
results highlight LLMs' ability to enhance accuracy and robustness in
ultra-short-term forecasting and showcase their strong few-shot learning
capabilities.

Motivation: 研究训练数据如何导致大语言模型产生毒性行为，现有方法多为被动调整，缺乏主动预防措施。

Method: 提出IF-Guide方法，改进标准影响函数以识别有害标记，结合选择有害文档的技术和学习目标，适用于预训练和微调。

Result: IF-Guide将显性和隐性毒性降低10倍（相比未审查模型）和3倍（相比基线方法），且计算高效。

Conclusion: IF-Guide是一种高效、无需人工偏好数据的主动毒性抑制方法，适用于不同规模的模型。

Abstract: We study how training data contributes to the emergence of toxic behaviors in
large-language models. Most prior work on reducing model toxicity adopts
$reactive$ approaches, such as fine-tuning pre-trained (and potentially toxic)
models to align them with human values. In contrast, we propose a $proactive$
approach$-$IF-Guide$-$which leverages influence functions to identify harmful
tokens within any training data and suppress their impact during training. To
this end, we first show that standard influence functions are ineffective at
discovering harmful training records. We then present a novel adaptation that
measures token-level attributions from training data to model toxicity, along
with techniques for selecting toxic training documents and a learning objective
that can be integrated into both pre-training and fine-tuning. Moreover,
IF-Guide does not rely on human-preference data, which is typically required by
existing alignment methods. In evaluation, we demonstrate that IF-Guide
substantially reduces both explicit and implicit toxicity$-$by up to 10$\times$
compared to uncensored models, and up to 3$\times$ compared to baseline
alignment methods, e.g., DPO and RAD$-$across both pre-training and fine-tuning
scenarios. IF-Guide is computationally efficient: a billion-parameter model is
$not$ $necessary$ for computing influence scores; a million-parameter
model$-$with 7.5$\times$ fewer parameters$-$can effectively serve as a proxy
for identifying harmful data.

Conclusion: RsGCN和Re2Opt的组合架构在泛化能力和训练效率上达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: Neural traveling salesman problem (TSP) solvers face two critical challenges:
poor generalization for scalable TSPs and high training costs. To address these
challenges, we propose a new Rescaling Graph Convolutional Network (RsGCN).
Focusing on the scale-dependent features (i.e., features varied with problem
scales) related to nodes and edges that influence the sensitivity of GCNs to
the problem scales, a Rescaling Mechanism in RsGCN enhances the generalization
capability by (1) rescaling adjacent nodes to construct a subgraph with a
uniform number of adjacent nodes for each node across various scales of TSPs,
which stabilizes the graph message aggregation; (2) rescaling subgraph edges to
adjust the lengths of subgraph edges to the same magnitude, which maintains
numerical consistency. In addition, an efficient training strategy with a
mixed-scale dataset and bidirectional loss is used in RsGCN. To fully exploit
the heatmaps generated by RsGCN, we design an efficient post-search algorithm
termed Re2Opt, in which a reconstruction process based on adaptive weight is
incorporated to help avoid local optima. Based on a combined architecture of
RsGCN and Re2Opt, our solver achieves remarkable generalization and low
training cost: with only 3 epochs of training on the mixed-scale dataset
containing instances with up to 100 nodes, it can be generalized successfully
to 10K-node instances without any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance across uniform distribution
instances of 9 different scales from 20 to 10K nodes and 78 real-world
instances from TSPLIB, while requiring the fewest learnable parameters and
training epochs among neural competitors.

Abstract: This competition hosted on Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/trojan-horse-hunt-in-space) is the first
part of a series of follow-up competitions and hackathons related to the
"Assurance for Space Domain AI Applications" project funded by the European
Space Agency (https://assurance-ai.space-codev.org/). The competition idea is
based on one of the real-life AI security threats identified within the project
-- the adversarial poisoning of continuously fine-tuned satellite telemetry
forecasting models. The task is to develop methods for finding and
reconstructing triggers (trojans) in advanced models for satellite telemetry
forecasting used in safety-critical space operations. Participants are provided
with 1) a large public dataset of real-life multivariate satellite telemetry
(without triggers), 2) a reference model trained on the clean data, 3) a set of
poisoned neural hierarchical interpolation (N-HiTS) models for time series
forecasting trained on the dataset with injected triggers, and 4) Jupyter
notebook with the training pipeline and baseline algorithm (the latter will be
published in the last month of the competition). The main task of the
competition is to reconstruct a set of 45 triggers (i.e., short multivariate
time series segments) injected into the training data of the corresponding set
of 45 poisoned models. The exact characteristics (i.e., shape, amplitude, and
duration) of these triggers must be identified by participants. The popular
Neural Cleanse method is adopted as a baseline, but it is not designed for time
series analysis and new approaches are necessary for the task. The impact of
the competition is not limited to the space domain, but also to many other
safety-critical applications of advanced time series analysis where model
poisoning may lead to serious consequences.

Abstract: Missing data is a relevant issue in time series, especially in biomedical
sequences such as those corresponding to smooth pursuit eye movements, which
often contain gaps due to eye blinks and track losses, complicating the
analysis and extraction of meaningful biomarkers. In this paper, a novel
imputation framework is proposed using Self-Attention-based Imputation networks
for time series, which leverages the power of deep learning and self-attention
mechanisms to impute missing data. We further refine the imputed data using a
custom made autoencoder, tailored to represent smooth pursuit eye movement
sequences. The proposed approach was implemented using 5,504 sequences from 172
Parkinsonian patients and healthy controls. Results show a significant
improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed eye movement sequences with
respect to other state of the art techniques, substantially reducing the values
for common time domain error metrics such as the mean absolute error, mean
relative error, and root mean square error, while also preserving the signal's
frequency domain characteristics. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness when
large intervals of data are missing. This method offers an alternative solution
for robustly handling missing data in time series, enhancing the reliability of
smooth pursuit analysis for the screening and monitoring of neurodegenerative
disorders.

Conclusion: MMedAgent-RL 通过动态协作和课程学习显著提升医疗多模态任务的性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential
in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle
to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance.
Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by
clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact
in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack
flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose
MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that
enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we
train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to
assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician
integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make
final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we
introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively
teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and
correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and
proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns.
Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 18.4% over supervised
fine-tuning baselines.

Motivation: 解决合成数据生成中隐私与实用性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 结合SMOTE和差分隐私技术生成合成数据。

Result: SMOTE-DP在理论和实证中均证明能同时保护隐私和保持实用性。

Conclusion: SMOTE-DP是一种有效的隐私保护数据生成方法。

Abstract: Privacy-preserving data publication, including synthetic data sharing, often
experiences trade-offs between privacy and utility. Synthetic data is generally
more effective than data anonymization in balancing this trade-off, however,
not without its own challenges. Synthetic data produced by generative models
trained on source data may inadvertently reveal information about outliers.
Techniques specifically designed for preserving privacy, such as introducing
noise to satisfy differential privacy, often incur unpredictable and
significant losses in utility. In this work we show that, with the right
mechanism of synthetic data generation, we can achieve strong privacy
protection without significant utility loss. Synthetic data generators
producing contracting data patterns, such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE), can enhance a differentially private data generator,
leveraging the strengths of both. We prove in theory and through empirical
demonstration that this SMOTE-DP technique can produce synthetic data that not
only ensures robust privacy protection but maintains utility in downstream
learning tasks.

Conclusion: 论文为度量学习在深度强化学习中的应用提供了系统性评估和工具支持。

Abstract: A key approach to state abstraction is approximating behavioral metrics
(notably, bisimulation metrics) in the observation space and embedding these
learned distances in the representation space. While promising for robustness
to task-irrelevant noise, as shown in prior work, accurately estimating these
metrics remains challenging, requiring various design choices that create gaps
between theory and practice. Prior evaluations focus mainly on final returns,
leaving the quality of learned metrics and the source of performance gains
unclear. To systematically assess how metric learning works in deep
reinforcement learning (RL), we evaluate five recent approaches, unified
conceptually as isometric embeddings with varying design choices. We benchmark
them with baselines across 20 state-based and 14 pixel-based tasks, spanning
370 task configurations with diverse noise settings. Beyond final returns, we
introduce the evaluation of a denoising factor to quantify the encoder's
ability to filter distractions. To further isolate the effect of metric
learning, we propose and evaluate an isolated metric estimation setting, in
which the encoder is influenced solely by the metric loss. Finally, we release
an open-source, modular codebase to improve reproducibility and support future
research on metric learning in deep RL.

TLDR: 论文提出AutoMixAlign（AMA）算法，通过自适应混合数据集来平衡多任务性能，优于传统对齐方法和模型合并方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵且次优的启发式或人工直觉，难以平衡多任务性能。

Method: AMA训练任务专家模型确定损失，并通过最小最大优化训练通用模型，提出AMA-R和AMA-S两种算法。

Result: AMA在多项任务对齐中优于标准对齐方法和模型合并方法。

Conclusion: AMA为多任务对齐提供了一种高效且理论支持的方法。

Abstract: When aligning large language models (LLMs), their performance on various
tasks (such as being helpful, harmless, and honest) depends heavily on the
composition of their training data. However, selecting a data mixture that
achieves strong performance across all tasks is challenging. Existing
approaches rely on large ablation studies, heuristics, or human intuition, but
these can be prohibitively expensive and suboptimal. We study this problem in
the setting of preference optimization via DPO and introduce AutoMixAlign
(AMA), a theoretically-grounded algorithm that adaptively mixes datasets during
training to balance performance across tasks. AMA first trains
\textit{specialist models} for each task to determine losses that correspond to
strong task performance. Then, it trains a generalist model using a novel
minimax optimization that prioritizes tasks for which generalist model losses
deviate most from specialist model losses. To optimize this problem, we propose
two algorithms: (1) AMA-R, which adaptively reweights the objective to
prioritize tasks, and (2) AMA-S, which adaptively adjusts how much data is
sampled from each task to prioritize tasks. Both algorithms achieve a
convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ in the convex case. AMA-R's convergence
result follows from Sagawa et al. (2019), and we provide a convergence proof
for AMA-S using online learning techniques such as EXP3. We evaluate AMA on
several multitask alignment setups and find that AMA outperforms the standard
alignment approach -- which simply optimizes the total loss across all tasks --
and also outperforms model merging methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: NEMOT提出了一种新的计算框架，通过神经网络和mini-batch训练显著提升了多边际最优传输（MOT）的可扩展性，解决了传统Sinkhorn算法计算复杂度高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多边际最优传输（MOT）的计算复杂度高（$O(n^k)$），限制了其在实际机器学习问题中的应用。

Method: 提出Neural Entropic MOT（NEMOT），利用神经网络和mini-batch训练，将计算复杂度从数据集规模转移到mini-batch规模。

Result: NEMOT在计算速度和可扩展性上显著优于Sinkhorn算法，支持更多样本和边际，并提供了非渐近误差界保证。

Conclusion: NEMOT为大规模机器学习任务提供了高效的多边际最优传输解决方案，扩展了其实际应用范围。

Abstract: Multimarginal optimal transport (MOT) is a powerful framework for modeling
interactions between multiple distributions, yet its applicability is
bottlenecked by a high computational overhead. Entropic regularization provides
computational speedups via the multimarginal Sinkhorn algorithm, whose time
complexity, for a dataset size $n$ and $k$ marginals, generally scales as
$O(n^k)$. However, this dependence on the dataset size $n$ is computationally
prohibitive for many machine learning problems. In this work, we propose a new
computational framework for entropic MOT, dubbed Neural Entropic MOT (NEMOT),
that enjoys significantly improved scalability. NEMOT employs neural networks
trained using mini-batches, which transfers the computational complexity from
the dataset size to the size of the mini-batch, leading to substantial gains.
We provide formal guarantees on the accuracy of NEMOT via non-asymptotic error
bounds. We supplement these with numerical results that demonstrate the
performance gains of NEMOT over Sinkhorn's algorithm, as well as extensions to
neural computation of multimarginal entropic Gromov-Wasserstein alignment. In
particular, orders-of-magnitude speedups are observed relative to the
state-of-the-art, with a notable increase in the feasible number of samples and
marginals. NEMOT seamlessly integrates as a module in large-scale machine
learning pipelines, and can serve to expand the practical applicability of
entropic MOT for tasks involving multimarginal data.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM增强的DRL框架（PA-MRL），通过可学习提示优化语义聚类和RL目标，提升无线网络资源分配的效率和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DRL在动态无线网络环境中难以应对分散和演变的反馈，LLM能够将无序反馈转化为有意义的潜在表示，帮助RL代理更有效地识别模式。

Method: 引入基于上下文的适应方法，通过任务特定提示动态调整LLM增强的DRL框架，避免全模型微调。

Result: 实验表明，PA-MRL框架加速了收敛，并在O-RAN切片中优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合提示增强学习的方法实现了更快、更可扩展和自适应的资源分配。

Abstract: Modern wireless networks must adapt to dynamic conditions while efficiently
managing diverse service demands. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
struggles in these environments, as scattered and evolving feedback makes
optimal decision-making challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a
solution by structuring unorganized network feedback into meaningful latent
representations, helping RL agents recognize patterns more effectively. For
example, in O-RAN slicing, concepts like SNR, power levels and throughput are
semantically related, and LLMs can naturally cluster them, providing a more
interpretable state representation. To leverage this capability, we introduce a
contextualization-based adaptation method that integrates learnable prompts
into an LLM-augmented DRL framework. Instead of relying on full model
fine-tuning, we refine state representations through task-specific prompts that
dynamically adjust to network conditions. Utilizing ORANSight, an LLM trained
on O-RAN knowledge, we develop Prompt-Augmented Multi agent RL (PA-MRL)
framework. Learnable prompts optimize both semantic clustering and RL
objectives, allowing RL agents to achieve higher rewards in fewer iterations
and adapt more efficiently. By incorporating prompt-augmented learning, our
approach enables faster, more scalable, and adaptive resource allocation in
O-RAN slicing. Experimental results show that it accelerates convergence and
outperforms other baselines.

TLDR: ORAN-GUIDE是一个双LLM框架，通过语义丰富的状态表示增强多智能体强化学习（MARL），解决了DRL在处理无线网络动态资源分配时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放无线接入网络（O-RAN）需要灵活支持动态和异构服务需求，但现有DRL方法在处理原始、非结构化输入时效率低下，限制了策略泛化和决策效率。

Method: 提出ORAN-GUIDE框架，结合领域特定语言模型ORANSight和冻结的GPT编码器，生成结构化、上下文感知的语义表示，用于DRL智能体。

Result: 实验表明，ORAN-GUIDE在样本效率、策略收敛和性能泛化方面优于标准MARL和单LLM基线。

Conclusion: ORAN-GUIDE通过语义增强的状态表示，显著提升了DRL在O-RAN环境中的决策效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Advanced wireless networks must support highly dynamic and heterogeneous
service demands. Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables this
flexibility by adopting modular, disaggregated components, such as the RAN
Intelligent Controller (RIC), Centralized Unit (CU), and Distributed Unit (DU),
that can support intelligent control via machine learning (ML). While deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful tool for managing dynamic resource
allocation and slicing, it often struggles to process raw, unstructured input
like RF features, QoS metrics, and traffic trends. These limitations hinder
policy generalization and decision efficiency in partially observable and
evolving environments. To address this, we propose \textit{ORAN-GUIDE}, a
dual-LLM framework that enhances multi-agent RL (MARL) with task-relevant,
semantically enriched state representations. The architecture employs a
domain-specific language model, ORANSight, pretrained on O-RAN control and
configuration data, to generate structured, context-aware prompts. These
prompts are fused with learnable tokens and passed to a frozen GPT-based
encoder that outputs high-level semantic representations for DRL agents. This
design adopts a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style pipeline tailored
for technical decision-making in wireless systems. Experimental results show
that ORAN-GUIDE improves sample efficiency, policy convergence, and performance
generalization over standard MARL and single-LLM baselines.

Motivation: 传统方法仅能从线性高斯状态空间模型中恢复线性SFA，本文旨在放松线性约束，探索非线性SFA的可能性。

Method: 通过变分推理框架，将SFA的慢速目标重新解释为重构损失的正则化项。

Result: 该方法虽未完全等价于非线性SFA，但为慢速优化提供了新的视角，并讨论了潜在的研究方向。

Conclusion: 研究为SFA提供了新的概率解释，并启发了未来在非线性SFA和变分框架下的进一步探索。

Abstract: This work presents a novel probabilistic interpretation of Slow Feature
Analysis (SFA) through the lens of variational inference. Unlike prior
formulations that recover linear SFA from Gaussian state-space models with
linear emissions, this approach relaxes the key constraint of linearity. While
it does not lead to full equivalence to non-linear SFA, it recasts the
classical slowness objective in a variational framework. Specifically, it
allows the slowness objective to be interpreted as a regularizer to a
reconstruction loss. Furthermore, we provide arguments, why -- from the
perspective of slowness optimization -- the reconstruction loss takes on the
role of the constraints that ensure informativeness in SFA. We conclude with a
discussion of potential new research directions.

Abstract: Stress significantly contributes to both mental and physical disorders, yet
traditional self-reported questionnaires are inherently subjective. In this
study, we introduce a novel framework that employs geometric machine learning
to detect stress from raw EEG recordings. Our approach constructs graphs by
integrating structural connectivity (derived from electrode spatial
arrangement) with functional connectivity from pairwise signal correlations. A
spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) processes these graphs to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics. Experiments on the SAM-40 dataset show
that the ST-GCN outperforms standard machine learning models on all key
classification metrics and enhances interpretability, explored through ablation
analyses of key channels and brain regions. These results pave the way for more
objective and accurate stress detection methods.

Abstract: In this pilot study, we propose a neuro-inspired approach that compresses
temporal sequences into context-tagged chunks, where each tag represents a
recurring structural unit or``community'' in the sequence. These tags are
generated during an offline sleep phase and serve as compact references to past
experience, allowing the learner to incorporate information beyond its
immediate input range. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic
environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network
based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing
temporal patterns on multiple timescales. We evaluate this idea in a controlled
synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural
network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when
facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. Our results, while
preliminary, suggest that temporal chunking can significantly enhance learning
efficiency under resource constrained settings. A small-scale human pilot study
using a Serial Reaction Time Task further motivates the idea of structural
abstraction. Although limited to synthetic tasks, this work serves as an early
proof-of-concept, with initial evidence that learned context tags can transfer
across related task, offering potential for future applications in transfer

Result: 减少churn可防止秩崩溃并自适应调整梯度步长，C-CHAIN在多个基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: C-CHAIN能有效提升持续学习性能，为解决塑性丧失问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Plasticity, or the ability of an agent to adapt to new tasks, environments,
or distributions, is crucial for continual learning. In this paper, we study
the loss of plasticity in deep continual RL from the lens of churn: network
output variability for out-of-batch data induced by mini-batch training. We
demonstrate that (1) the loss of plasticity is accompanied by the exacerbation
of churn due to the gradual rank decrease of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
matrix; (2) reducing churn helps prevent rank collapse and adjusts the step
size of regular RL gradients adaptively. Moreover, we introduce Continual Churn
Approximated Reduction (C-CHAIN) and demonstrate it improves learning
performance and outperforms baselines in a diverse range of continual learning
environments on OpenAI Gym Control, ProcGen, DeepMind Control Suite, and
MinAtar benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明GEL在噪声和结构扰动下表现优异，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: GEL通过概率框架有效提升了图异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of
reliable anomaly-labeled datasets, driving the development of unsupervised
methods. Graph autoencoders (GAEs) have emerged as a dominant approach by
reconstructing graph structures and node features while deriving anomaly scores
from reconstruction errors. However, relying solely on reconstruction error for
anomaly detection has limitations, as it increases the sensitivity to noise and
overfitting. To address these issues, we propose Graph Evidential Learning
(GEL), a probabilistic framework that redefines the reconstruction process
through evidential learning. By modeling node features and graph topology using
evidential distributions, GEL quantifies two types of uncertainty: graph
uncertainty and reconstruction uncertainty, incorporating them into the anomaly
scoring mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GEL achieves
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high robustness against noise
and structural perturbations.

Abstract: Real-world multichannel time series prediction faces growing demands for
efficiency across edge and cloud environments, making channel compression a
timely and essential problem. Motivated by success of Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO) methods, we propose a predictability-aware
compression-decompression framework to reduce runtime, lower communication
cost, and maintain prediction accuracy across diverse predictors. The core idea
involves using a circular periodicity key matrix with orthogonality to capture
underlying time series predictability during compression and to mitigate
reconstruction errors during decompression by relaxing oversimplified data
assumptions. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that the proposed
framework is both time-efficient and scalable under a large number of channels.
Extensive experiments on six datasets across various predictors demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior overall performance by jointly
considering prediction accuracy and runtime, while maintaining strong
compatibility with diverse predictors.

offering a promising solution to the challenges of training large models for

computer vision and time-series forecasting, the theoretical foundations of MR
remain underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical
analysis of MR through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework.
We demonstrate that the success of MR is governed by the eigenvalue spectrum of
the NTK matrix on the target dataset and establish the critical role of the
source model's effectiveness in determining reprogramming outcomes. Our
contributions include a novel theoretical framework for MR, insights into the
relationship between source and target models, and extensive experiments

Abstract: Decision-making in building energy systems critically depends on the
predictive accuracy of relevant time-series models. In scenarios lacking
extensive data from a target building, foundation models (FMs) represent a
promising technology that can leverage prior knowledge from vast and diverse
pre-training datasets to construct accurate probabilistic predictors for use in
decision-making tools. This paper investigates the applicability and
fine-tuning strategies of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) in building
energy forecasting. We analyze both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approaches, particularly low-rank adaptation (LoRA), by using
real-world data from a commercial net-zero energy building to capture signals
such as room occupancy, carbon emissions, plug loads, and HVAC energy
consumption. Our analysis reveals that the zero-shot predictive performance of
TSFMs is generally suboptimal. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate that
employing either full fine-tuning or parameter-efficient fine-tuning
significantly enhances forecasting accuracy, even with limited historical data.
Notably, fine-tuning with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) substantially reduces
computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, fine-tuned TSFMs
consistently outperform state-of-the-art deep forecasting models (e.g.,
temporal fusion transformers) in accuracy, robustness, and generalization
across varying building zones and seasonal conditions. These results underline
the efficacy of TSFMs for practical, data-constrained building energy
management systems, enabling improved decision-making in pursuit of energy
efficiency and sustainability.

Conclusion: ST-TTC为时空预测提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in many domains, such as
transportation, meteorology, and energy. However, real-world scenarios
frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and
distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by
modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these
approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for
large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing
paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal
forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic
structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and
perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy.
Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with
phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash
updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time
computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques,
offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility
and efficiency of our proposed method.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved substantial success across various

theoretical analysis demonstrating the fundamental limitations of neural
networks in developing a general matrix inversion model. We expand the class of

Conclusion: LRT假说为跨模型表示对齐提供了新方向，小模型表示对大模型行为有指导意义。

Abstract: It has been hypothesized that neural networks with similar architectures
trained on similar data learn shared representations relevant to the learning
task. We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where
representations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed
as linear combinations of a \emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis
features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models,
regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \textbf{Linear
Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine
transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test
this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models
of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in
hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their
semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the
learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings
can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations
learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and
that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding
representation alignment across model scales.

embeddings and concatenated with signal strength. These are processed by a Set
Transformer, enabling the model to handle variable-length, sparse inputs while
learning attention-based representations over access point relationships. We
evaluate the model on a dataset collected across a campus environment
consisting of six buildings. Results show that the model accurately recovers
fine-grained spatial structure and maintains performance across physically
distinct domains. In our experiments, a simple LSTM consistently outperformed
all other models, achieving the lowest mean localization error across three
tasks (E1 - E3), with average errors as low as 2.23 m. The Set Transformer
performed competitively, ranking second in every experiment and outperforming
the MLP, RNN, and basic attention models, particularly in scenarios involving
multiple buildings (E2) and multiple floors (E3). Performance degraded most in
E2, where signal conditions varied substantially across buildings, highlighting
the importance of architectural robustness to domain diversity. This work
demonstrates that set-based neural models are a natural fit for signal-based
localization, offering a principled approach to handling sparse, unordered
inputs in real-world positioning tasks.

TLDR: 本文综述了差分隐私（DP）在医学深度学习中的应用，重点分析了DP-SGD及其他机制在集中式和联邦式设置中的表现，揭示了隐私保护与模型性能、公平性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医学深度学习对数据的依赖性增强，如何在保护患者隐私的同时保持模型性能和公平性成为关键挑战。

Method: 通过结构化搜索策略筛选了74项研究，分析了不同数据模态、训练设置和下游任务中DP的应用及其效果。

Result: 研究发现，强隐私预算下DP在结构化成像任务中表现良好，但在严格隐私条件下性能下降明显，且对少数群体影响更大。公平性分析较少。

Conclusion: 未来需关注公平性审计、标准化和评估协议，以构建更公平且临床稳健的隐私保护DL系统。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a key technique for protecting sensitive patient
data in medical deep learning (DL). As clinical models grow more
data-dependent, balancing privacy with utility and fairness has become a
critical challenge. This scoping review synthesizes recent developments in
applying DP to medical DL, with a particular focus on DP-SGD and alternative
mechanisms across centralized and federated settings. Using a structured search
strategy, we identified 74 studies published up to March 2025. Our analysis
spans diverse data modalities, training setups, and downstream tasks, and
highlights the tradeoffs between privacy guarantees, model accuracy, and
subgroup fairness. We find that while DP-especially at strong privacy
budgets-can preserve performance in well-structured imaging tasks, severe
degradation often occurs under strict privacy, particularly in underrepresented
or complex modalities. Furthermore, privacy-induced performance gaps
disproportionately affect demographic subgroups, with fairness impacts varying
by data type and task. A small subset of studies explicitly addresses these
tradeoffs through subgroup analysis or fairness metrics, but most omit them
entirely. Beyond DP-SGD, emerging approaches leverage alternative mechanisms,
generative models, and hybrid federated designs, though reporting remains
inconsistent. We conclude by outlining key gaps in fairness auditing,
standardization, and evaluation protocols, offering guidance for future work
toward equitable and clinically robust privacy-preserving DL systems in
medicine.

TLDR: SafeTuneBed是一个统一的基准和工具包，用于评估LLM的微调方法和安全防御，提供多样化的数据集、防御集成和评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM微调和安全防御方法的评估缺乏统一标准，导致难以公平比较。

Method: SafeTuneBed整合了多任务数据集、先进防御方法和评估工具，支持端到端可复现性。

Result: 通过标准化数据和指标，SafeTuneBed实现了对防御方法的全面评估。

Conclusion: SafeTuneBed为安全LLM微调研究提供了首个标准化工具包，加速了严谨和可比较的研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods and safety-first defenses have proliferated rapidly.
However, the number of approaches and their recent increase have resulted in
diverse evaluations-varied datasets, metrics, and inconsistent threat
settings-making it difficult to fairly compare safety, utility, and robustness
across methods. To address this, we introduce SafeTuneBed, a benchmark and
toolkit unifying fine-tuning and defense evaluation. SafeTuneBed (i) curates a
diverse repository of multiple fine-tuning datasets spanning sentiment
analysis, question-answering, multi-step reasoning, and open-ended instruction
tasks, and allows for the generation of harmful-variant splits; (ii) enables
integration of state-of-the-art defenses, including alignment-stage
immunization, in-training safeguards, and post-tuning repair; and (iii)
provides evaluators for safety (attack success rate, refusal consistency) and
utility. Built on Python-first, dataclass-driven configs and plugins,
SafeTuneBed requires minimal additional code to specify any fine-tuning regime,
defense method, and metric suite, while ensuring end-to-end reproducibility. We
showcase its value by benchmarking representative defenses across varied
poisoning scenarios and tasks. By standardizing data, code, and metrics,
SafeTuneBed is the first focused toolkit of its kind to accelerate rigorous and
comparable research in safe LLM fine-tuning. Code is available at:

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove sensitive or undesired data from large
language models. However, recent studies suggest that unlearning is often
shallow, claiming that removed knowledge can easily be recovered. In this work,
we critically examine standard unlearning evaluation practices and uncover key
limitations that shake our trust in those findings. First, we show that some
evaluations introduce substantial new information into the model, potentially
masking true unlearning performance by re-teaching the model during testing.
Second, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes vary significantly across
tasks, undermining the generalizability of current evaluation routines.
Finally, we find that many evaluations rely on spurious correlations, making
their results difficult to trust and interpret. Taken together, these issues
suggest that current evaluation protocols may both overstate and understate
unlearning success. To address this, we propose two principles for future
unlearning evaluations: minimal information injection and downstream task
awareness. We validate these principles through a series of targeted
experiments, showing how violations of each can lead to misleading conclusions.

Conclusion: 非线性注意力机制能有效提升强化学习算法的效率和性能，具有进一步研究的价值。

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents often requires significant
computational resources and extended training times. To address this, we build
upon the foundation laid by Google Brain's Sensory Neuron, which introduced a
novel neural architecture for reinforcement learning tasks that maintained
permutation in-variance in the sensory neuron system. While the baseline model
demonstrated significant performance improvements over traditional approaches,
we identified opportunities to enhance the efficiency of the learning process
further. We propose a modified attention mechanism incorporating a non-linear
transformation of the key vectors (K) using a mapping function, resulting in a
new set of key vectors (K'). This non-linear mapping enhances the
representational capacity of the attention mechanism, allowing the model to
encode more complex feature interactions and accelerating convergence without
compromising performance. Our enhanced model demonstrates significant
improvements in learning efficiency, showcasing the potential for non-linear
attention mechanisms in advancing reinforcement learning algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在约束马尔可夫决策过程中，传统方法认为训练时施加约束会降低最终回报。本文旨在证明约束可以直接融入策略几何，从而在不影响回报的情况下优化策略。

Method: 提出了Central Path Proximal Policy Optimization (C3PO)，通过修改PPO使其策略迭代接近约束优化问题的中心路径。

Result: 与现有方法相比，C3PO在性能提升和约束执行方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 中心路径引导的更新为约束策略优化提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: In constrained Markov decision processes, enforcing constraints during
training is often thought of as decreasing the final return. Recently, it was
shown that constraints can be incorporated directly in the policy geometry,
yielding an optimization trajectory close to the central path of a barrier
method, which does not compromise final return. Building on this idea, we
introduce Central Path Proximal Policy Optimization (C3PO), a simple
modification of PPO that produces policy iterates, which stay close to the
central path of the constrained optimization problem. Compared to existing
on-policy methods, C3PO delivers improved performance with tighter constraint
enforcement, suggesting that central path-guided updates offer a promising
direction for constrained policy optimization.

Result: 在合成数据集上的实验证明，该方法能有效区分成员与非成员数据集，并可检测分布偏移。

Conclusion: 该方法为成员推断提供了一种实用且可解释的替代方案，同时具备检测分布偏移的能力。

Abstract: Determining whether a dataset was part of a machine learning model's training
data pool can reveal privacy vulnerabilities, a challenge often addressed
through membership inference attacks (MIAs). Traditional MIAs typically require
access to model internals or rely on computationally intensive shadow models.
This paper proposes an efficient, interpretable and principled Bayesian
inference method for membership inference. By analyzing post-hoc metrics such
as prediction error, confidence (entropy), perturbation magnitude, and dataset
statistics from a trained ML model, our approach computes posterior
probabilities of membership without requiring extensive model training.
Experimental results on synthetic datasets demonstrate the method's
effectiveness in distinguishing member from non-member datasets. Beyond
membership inference, this method can also detect distribution shifts, offering
a practical and interpretable alternative to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的数据库多为关系型，包含复杂的结构和统计依赖关系，现有方法难以有效捕捉这些复杂性。

Method: RelDiff结合了联合图条件扩散过程（用于属性合成）和基于随机块模型的2K+SBM图生成器（用于结构生成），分解了图结构和关系属性。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上的实验表明，RelDiff在生成真实且一致的关系数据库方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RelDiff通过分解图结构和关系属性，确保了高保真度和引用完整性，为关系数据库生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world databases are predominantly relational, comprising multiple
interlinked tables that contain complex structural and statistical
dependencies. Learning generative models on relational data has shown great
promise in generating synthetic data and imputing missing values. However,
existing methods often struggle to capture this complexity, typically reducing
relational data to conditionally generated flat tables and imposing limiting
structural assumptions. To address these limitations, we introduce RelDiff, a
novel diffusion generative model that synthesizes complete relational databases
by explicitly modeling their foreign key graph structure. RelDiff combines a
joint graph-conditioned diffusion process across all tables for attribute
synthesis, and a $2K+$SBM graph generator based on the Stochastic Block Model
for structure generation. The decomposition of graph structure and relational
attributes ensures both high fidelity and referential integrity, both of which
are crucial aspects of synthetic relational database generation. Experiments on
11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that RelDiff consistently outperforms prior
methods in producing realistic and coherent synthetic relational databases.

Result: DRPO训练使诊断性能平均提升43%（宏F1），在分割任务中IoU比开放模型高10倍。

Conclusion: QoQ-Med在临床多模态推理中表现优异，并开源模型权重、训练管道和推理轨迹以促进研究。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making routinely demands reasoning over heterogeneous data,
yet existing multimodal language models (MLLMs) remain largely vision-centric
and fail to generalize across clinical specialties. To bridge this gap, we
introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model
that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text
reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization
(DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales
normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty,
mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions.
Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains,
we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on
average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training
methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation
data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an
IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI
o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the
full model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all

Conclusion: 呼吁采用更严格的评估方法以可靠评估LLM的预测能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to forecasting tasks,
with some works claiming these systems match or exceed human performance. In
this paper, we argue that, as a community, we should be careful about such
conclusions as evaluating LLM forecasters presents unique challenges. We
identify two broad categories of issues: (1) difficulty in trusting evaluation
results due to many forms of temporal leakage, and (2) difficulty in
extrapolating from evaluation performance to real-world forecasting. Through
systematic analysis and concrete examples from prior work, we demonstrate how
evaluation flaws can raise concerns about current and future performance
claims. We argue that more rigorous evaluation methodologies are needed to
confidently assess the forecasting abilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 在神经常微分方程中，多射击方法由于难以结合一般等式约束而未被广泛使用，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用基于压缩的方法，结合射击等式约束，并使用一阶优化方法（如Adam）训练MS-NODE。

Result: 该方法提高了多射击神经常微分方程的稳定性，尤其适用于高振荡和长轨迹问题。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了多射击神经常微分方程中的等式约束问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple-shooting is a parameter estimation approach for ordinary
differential equations. In this approach, the trajectory is broken into small
intervals, each of which can be integrated independently. Equality constraints
are then applied to eliminate the shooting gap between the end of the previous
trajectory and the start of the next trajectory. Unlike single-shooting,
multiple-shooting is more stable, especially for highly oscillatory and long
trajectories. In the context of neural ordinary differential equations,
multiple-shooting is not widely used due to the challenge of incorporating
general equality constraints. In this work, we propose a condensing-based
approach to incorporate these shooting equality constraints while training a
multiple-shooting neural ordinary differential equation (MS-NODE) using
first-order optimization methods such as Adam.

Conclusion: 该方法具有灵活性和适应性，适用于4D流MRI及其他医学成像应用。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have shown robust results in
plane reformatting tasks. In these methods, an agent sequentially adjusts the
position and orientation of an initial plane towards an objective location.
This process allows accurate plane reformatting, without the need for detailed
landmarks, which makes it suitable for images with limited contrast and
resolution, such as 4D flow MRI. However, current DRL methods require the test
dataset to be in the same position and orientation as the training dataset. In
this paper, we present a novel technique that utilizes a flexible coordinate
system based on the current state, enabling navigation in volumes at any
position or orientation. We adopted the Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic
(A3C) algorithm for reinforcement learning, outperforming Deep Q Network (DQN).
Experimental results in 4D flow MRI demonstrate improved accuracy in plane
reformatting angular and distance errors (6.32 +- 4.15 {\deg} and 3.40 +- 2.75
mm), as well as statistically equivalent flow measurements determined by a
plane reformatting process done by an expert (p=0.21). The method's flexibility
and adaptability make it a promising candidate for other medical imaging
applications beyond 4D flow MRI.

Result: 在Burgers方程和TFMDWE上测试，性能优于标准PINN。

Conclusion: MoPINNEnKF显著提升了PINN在噪声和缺失物理问题中的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for
solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations
(PDEs) by incorporating physical laws into the training process. However, the
performance of PINNs is often hindered in real-world scenarios involving noisy
observational data and missing physics, particularly in inverse problems. In
this work, we propose an iterative multi-objective PINN ensemble Kalman filter
(MoPINNEnKF) framework that improves the robustness and accuracy of PINNs in
both forward and inverse problems by using the \textit{ensemble Kalman filter}
and the \textit{non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm} III (NSGA-III).
Specifically, NSGA-III is used as a multi-objective optimizer that can generate
various ensemble members of PINNs along the optimal Pareto front, while
accounting the model uncertainty in the solution space. These ensemble members
are then utilized within the EnKF to assimilate noisy observational data. The
EnKF's analysis is subsequently used to refine the data loss component for
retraining the PINNs, thereby iteratively updating their parameters. The
iterative procedure generates improved solutions to the PDEs. The proposed
method is tested on two benchmark problems: the one-dimensional viscous Burgers
equation and the time-fractional mixed diffusion-wave equation (TFMDWE). The
numerical results show it outperforms standard PINNs in handling noisy data and
missing physics.

Conclusion: BCRF是一种高效的序列标注模型，适用于需要快速并行推断的场景。

Abstract: We propose a novel discriminative model for sequence labeling called Bregman

Experimentally, our approach delivers comparable results to CRF while being

Conclusion: 设计良好的混合内存系统能结合KV和FW记忆的优势，为神经网络内存设计提供新思路。

Abstract: We develop hybrid memory architectures for general-purpose sequence
processing neural networks, that combine key-value memory using softmax
attention (KV-memory) with dynamic synaptic memory through fast-weight
programming (FW-memory) -- the core principles of quadratic and linear
transformers, respectively. These two memory systems have complementary but
individually limited properties: KV-memory offers precise retrieval but is
constrained by quadratic complexity in sequence length, while FW-memory
supports arbitrarily long sequences and enables more expressive computation but
sacrifices precise recall. We propose and compare three methods to blend these
two systems into a single memory system to leverage the strengths of both. We
conduct experiments on general language modeling and retrieval tasks by
training 340M- and 1.3B-parameter models from scratch, as well as on synthetic
algorithmic tasks designed to precisely illustrate the benefits of certain
hybrid methods over others. We also evaluate our hybrid memory systems on
reinforcement learning in partially observable environments. Overall, we
demonstrate how a well-designed hybrid can overcome the limitations of its
individual components, offering new insights into the design principle of
neural memory systems.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在新环境中性能下降不均匀，现有方法无法详细解释子群性能差异的原因。

Method: 提出SHIFT框架，分两步：识别性能下降的子群（Where?），分析具体变量/子集导致的性能下降（How?）。

Result: 实验表明，SHIFT能识别可解释的子群性能下降，并提供有效的针对性缓解措施。

Conclusion: SHIFT为性能下降提供了详细分析和解决方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models frequently experience performance degradation
when deployed in new contexts. Such degradation is rarely uniform: some
subgroups may suffer large performance decay while others may not.
Understanding where and how large differences in performance arise is critical
for designing targeted corrective actions that mitigate decay for the most
affected subgroups while minimizing any unintended effects. Current approaches
do not provide such detailed insight, as they either (i) explain how average
performance shifts arise or (ii) identify adversely affected subgroups without
insight into how this occurred. To this end, we introduce a Subgroup-scanning
Hierarchical Inference Framework for performance drifT (SHIFT). SHIFT first
asks "Is there any subgroup with unacceptably large performance decay due to
covariate/outcome shifts?" (Where?) and, if so, dives deeper to ask "Can we
explain this using more detailed variable(subset)-specific shifts?" (How?). In
real-world experiments, we find that SHIFT identifies interpretable subgroups
affected by performance decay, and suggests targeted actions that effectively
mitigate the decay.

Abstract: We give an algorithm for learning $O(\log n)$ juntas in polynomial-time with

only the external field has been randomly perturbed. This is a broad
generalization of the work of Kalai and Teng, who gave an algorithm that
succeeded with respect to smoothed product distributions (i.e., MRFs whose
dependency graph has no edges). Our algorithm has two phases: (1) an
unsupervised structure learning phase and (2) a greedy supervised learning
algorithm. This is the first example where algorithms for learning the

Motivation: 传统GAT依赖预定义的邻接结构和动态注意力分数，存在归纳偏差和计算开销问题，影响可解释性。

Method: 提出InterGAT，使用完全可学习的对称节点交互矩阵捕捉潜在空间关系，结合GRU时间解码器构建InterGAT-GRU框架。

Result: 在SZ-Taxi和Los-Loop数据集上，预测精度分别提升21%和6%，训练时间减少60-70%。交互矩阵显示出可解释的稀疏拓扑结构。

Conclusion: InterGAT在动态图领域同时支持预测、计算效率和拓扑可解释性，展示了结构学习的潜力。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is critical in applications such as traffic
prediction, energy demand modeling, and weather monitoring. While Graph
Attention Networks (GATs) are popular for modeling spatial dependencies, they
rely on predefined adjacency structures and dynamic attention scores,
introducing inductive biases and computational overhead that can obscure
interpretability.
  We propose InterGAT, a simplified alternative to GAT that replaces masked
attention with a fully learnable, symmetric node interaction matrix, capturing
latent spatial relationships without relying on fixed graph topologies. Our
framework, InterGAT-GRU, which incorporates a GRU-based temporal decoder,
outperforms the baseline GAT-GRU in forecasting accuracy, achieving at least a
21% improvement on the SZ-Taxi dataset and a 6% improvement on the Los-Loop
dataset across all forecasting horizons (15 to 60 minutes). Additionally, we
observed reduction in training time by 60-70% compared to GAT-GRU baseline.
  Crucially, the learned interaction matrix reveals interpretable structure: it
recovers sparse, topology-aware attention patterns that align with community
structure. Spectral and clustering analyses show that the model captures both
localized and global dynamics, offering insights into the functional topology
driving predictions. This highlights how structure learning can simultaneously
support prediction, computational efficiency, and topological interpretabil-ity
in dynamic graph-based domains.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为MolFLAE的零-shot分子操作方法，通过SE(3)-等变变分自编码器在共享潜在空间中导航，实现分子编辑和优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物化学家在优化药物时需考虑3D结构，而现有深度学习方法多为监督任务，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 使用SE(3)-等变变分自编码器（MolFLAE）学习固定维度的潜在空间，结合贝叶斯流网络重建分子结构。

Result: 在无条件3D分子生成任务中表现优异，并实现零-shot分子编辑（如原子数修改、结构重建）和药物优化。

Conclusion: MolFLAE方法灵活、鲁棒，为分子编辑和优化提供了新途径。

Abstract: Medicinal chemists often optimize drugs considering their 3D structures and
designing structurally distinct molecules that retain key features, such as
shapes, pharmacophores, or chemical properties. Previous deep learning
approaches address this through supervised tasks like molecule inpainting or
property-guided optimization. In this work, we propose a flexible zero-shot
molecule manipulation method by navigating in a shared latent space of 3D
molecules. We introduce a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for 3D molecules, named
MolFLAE, which learns a fixed-dimensional, SE(3)-equivariant latent space
independent of atom counts. MolFLAE encodes 3D molecules using an
SE(3)-equivariant neural network into fixed number of latent nodes,
distinguished by learned embeddings. The latent space is regularized, and
molecular structures are reconstructed via a Bayesian Flow Network (BFN)
conditioned on the encoder's latent output. MolFLAE achieves competitive
performance on standard unconditional 3D molecule generation benchmarks.
Moreover, the latent space of MolFLAE enables zero-shot molecule manipulation,
including atom number editing, structure reconstruction, and coordinated latent
interpolation for both structure and properties. We further demonstrate our
approach on a drug optimization task for the human glucocorticoid receptor,
generating molecules with improved hydrophilicity while preserving key
interactions, under computational evaluations. These results highlight the
flexibility, robustness, and real-world utility of our method, opening new
avenues for molecule editing and optimization.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为LIFT的低秩稀疏微调方法，通过仅更新关键权重（Principal Weights），在保持高效的同时优于全参数微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全参数微调（Full FT）计算成本高且易过拟合，稀疏微调在LLM时代效果不佳。LIFT旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LIFT基于低秩近似识别关键权重（Principal Weights），仅更新前5%的关键权重。

Result: LIFT在推理任务中表现优于Full FT，同时保持内存高效，并保留更多源领域知识。

Conclusion: LIFT是一种高效且有效的微调方法，适用于LLM的推理任务。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that supervised fine-tuning of LLMs on a small
number of high-quality datasets can yield strong reasoning capabilities.
However, full fine-tuning (Full FT), while powerful, is computationally
expensive and susceptible to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting,
particularly when data is limited. Sparse fine-tuning, which previously
achieved notable success by updating only a small subset of model parameters,
offers a promising trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, it has
lagged behind in the LLM era due to the difficulty of identifying parameters
truly critical for reasoning. In this work, we state that weights with the
largest magnitude after low-rank approximation are critical weights for
fine-tuning, which we call Principal Weights. Surprisingly, while
magnitude-based sparse fine-tuning performs poorly as a baseline on LLM
fine-tuning, it becomes highly effective after rank reduction. These insights
motivate our method: Low-rank Informed Sparse Fine-Tuning (LIFT). LIFT only
updates the top 5% Principal Weights throughout training and consistently
achieves better performance on reasoning tasks than Full FT, while maintaining
memory efficiency on par with popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.
In addition to strong performance on target domains such as arithmetic
reasoning, LIFT also retains up to 20% more source-domain knowledge, compared
to Full FT and LoRA. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习方法在离线强化学习中简单高效，但缺乏轨迹缝合能力，无法与基于时间差分（TD）的方法竞争。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出GCReinSL方法，通过CVAE估计Q函数，并结合Q值最大化与期望回归，在数据支持范围内找到最大Q值，从而指导策略选择最优动作。

Result: 实验表明，GCReinSL在离线强化学习数据集上的轨迹缝合能力优于现有SL方法和目标数据增强技术。

Conclusion: GCReinSL成功将SL方法与Q值最大化结合，显著提升了轨迹缝合能力，填补了与TD方法的性能差距。

Abstract: Recently, supervised learning (SL) methodology has emerged as an effective
approach for offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their simplicity,
stability, and efficiency. However, recent studies show that SL methods lack
the trajectory stitching capability, typically associated with temporal
difference (TD)-based approaches. A question naturally surfaces: How can we
endow SL methods with stitching capability and bridge its performance gap with
TD learning? To answer this question, we introduce $Q$-conditioned maximization
supervised learning for offline goal-conditioned RL, which enhances SL with the
stitching capability through $Q$-conditioned policy and $Q$-conditioned
maximization. Concretely, we propose Goal-Conditioned Reinforced Supervised
Learning (GCReinSL), which consists of (1) estimating the $Q$-function by CVAE
from the offline dataset and (2) finding the maximum $Q$-value within the data
support by integrating $Q$-function maximization with Expectile Regression. In
inference time, our policy chooses optimal actions based on such a maximum
$Q$-value. Experimental results from stitching evaluations on offline RL
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior SL approaches with
stitching capabilities and goal data augmentation techniques.

Conclusion: 提出的非自回归动作依赖策略在多智能体强化学习中具有高效性和可扩展性，适用于更广泛的场景。

Abstract: Action-dependent individual policies, which incorporate both environmental
states and the actions of other agents in decision-making, have emerged as a
promising paradigm for achieving global optimality in multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL). However, the existing literature often adopts auto-regressive
action-dependent policies, where each agent's policy depends on the actions of
all preceding agents. This formulation incurs substantial computational
complexity as the number of agents increases, thereby limiting scalability. In
this work, we consider a more generalized class of action-dependent policies,
which do not necessarily follow the auto-regressive form. We propose to use the
`action dependency graph (ADG)' to model the inter-agent action dependencies.
Within the context of MARL problems structured by coordination graphs, we prove
that an action-dependent policy with a sparse ADG can achieve global
optimality, provided the ADG satisfies specific conditions specified by the
coordination graph. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop a
tabular policy iteration algorithm with guaranteed global optimality.
Furthermore, we integrate our framework into several SOTA algorithms and
conduct experiments in complex environments. The empirical results affirm the
robustness and applicability of our approach in more general scenarios,
underscoring its potential for broader MARL challenges.

Motivation: 时空时间序列（STTS）预测因复杂的时空动态相关性而具有挑战性，现有图神经网络在效率和效果上难以平衡。

Method: 引入Stiefel图谱卷积（SGSC）和Stiefel图傅里叶变换（SGFT），提出线性动态图优化（LDGOSM）和多层SGSC（MSGSC）以高效建模动态时空关系。

Result: 在七个时空数据集上的实验表明，DST-SGNN在性能和计算成本上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DST-SGNN通过Stiefel流形上的优化和图谱卷积，显著提升了时空时间序列预测的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal time series (STTS) have been widely used in many
applications. However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to
complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph
neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling
dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the
Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently
process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral
Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix
in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded
as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic
Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn
the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the
computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that
efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive
experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.

TLDR: Uni-LoRA提出了一种统一的低秩适应框架，通过投影矩阵实现参数共享，显著提升参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA变体在参数空间缩减策略上缺乏统一性，限制了跨层参数共享和效率。

Method: 提出Uni-LoRA框架，利用等距投影矩阵从低维子空间重构高维参数空间，仅需单个可训练向量。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Uni-LoRA实现了最优参数效率，且预测性能优于或匹配现有方法。

Conclusion: Uni-LoRA不仅统一了现有LoRA变体，还通过高效设计成为“单向量”解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the de facto parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) method for large language models (LLMs) by constraining
weight updates to low-rank matrices. Recent works such as Tied-LoRA, VeRA, and
VB-LoRA push efficiency further by introducing additional constraints to reduce
the trainable parameter space. In this paper, we show that the parameter space
reduction strategies employed by these LoRA variants can be formulated within a
unified framework, Uni-LoRA, where the LoRA parameter space, flattened as a
high-dimensional vector space $R^D$, can be reconstructed through a projection
from a subspace R^d, with $d \ll D$. We demonstrate that the fundamental
difference among various LoRA methods lies in the choice of the projection
matrix, $P \in R^{D \times d}$.Most existing LoRA variants rely on layer-wise
or structure-specific projections that limit cross-layer parameter sharing,
thereby compromising parameter efficiency. In light of this, we introduce an
efficient and theoretically grounded projection matrix that is isometric,
enabling global parameter sharing and reducing computation overhead.
Furthermore, under the unified view of Uni-LoRA, this design requires only a
single trainable vector to reconstruct LoRA parameters for the entire LLM -
making Uni-LoRA both a unified framework and a "one-vector-only" solution.
Extensive experiments on GLUE, mathematical reasoning, and instruction tuning
benchmarks demonstrate that Uni-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art parameter
efficiency while outperforming or matching prior approaches in predictive
performance.

TLDR: 论文重新评估了LLMs在因果发现中的作用，反对其直接参与确定因果关系，指出其缺乏理论基础并引入不可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献中LLMs在因果发现中的直接应用存在理论缺陷和性能夸大问题，需要重新评估其角色。

Method: 通过实证研究揭示LLM方法的局限性，并限制其仅作为非决策辅助工具（如启发式搜索）。

Result: 实验表明，隔离LLMs的决策功能后，其引导的启发式搜索能加速收敛并优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区转向开发尊重因果发现核心原理的专用模型和方法，而非简单应用LLMs。

Abstract: This paper critically re-evaluates LLMs' role in causal discovery and argues
against their direct involvement in determining causal relationships. We
demonstrate that LLMs' autoregressive, correlation-driven modeling inherently
lacks the theoretical grounding for causal reasoning and introduces
unreliability when used as priors in causal discovery algorithms. Through
empirical studies, we expose the limitations of existing LLM-based methods and
reveal that deliberate prompt engineering (e.g., injecting ground-truth
knowledge) could overstate their performance, helping to explain the
consistently favorable results reported in much of the current literature.
Based on these findings, we strictly confined LLMs' role to a non-decisional
auxiliary capacity: LLMs should not participate in determining the existence or
directionality of causal relationships, but can assist the search process for
causal graphs (e.g., LLM-based heuristic search). Experiments across various
settings confirm that, by strictly isolating LLMs from causal decision-making,
LLM-guided heuristic search can accelerate the convergence and outperform both
traditional and LLM-based methods in causal structure learning. We conclude
with a call for the community to shift focus from naively applying LLMs to
developing specialized models and training method that respect the core
principles of causal discovery.

Result: 在5个数据集上平均提升12.9%，基于过程的奖励表现更优，但组合性和可解释性仍是挑战。

Conclusion: RL方法显著提升LLMs在图任务中的泛化能力，但需进一步解决组合性和中间步骤解释性问题。

Abstract: Previous research has sought to enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of
LLMs by supervised fine-tuning on synthetic graph data. While these led to
specialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs
for shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to
real-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to
unlock generalizable learning of graph synthetic data with reinforcement
learning. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for
synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in
direct fine-tuning, we posit that RL would help LLMs grasp the essentials
underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting. We employ RL algorithms
such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on
synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both
in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit
graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our RL recipe leads to statistically significant
improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9\% over baseline
settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently
outperform solution-based rewards, mixing synthetic and real-world task data
yields potential gains, while compositionality and explainable intermediate
steps remains a critical challenge even after RL.

Motivation: 现有高斯近似理论无法准确描述注意力层行为，尤其是在有限头数或标准缩放条件下。

Method: 利用Tensor Programs框架，推导了单注意力层在标准缩放下的无限宽度极限分布。

Result: 发现极限分布具有非高斯特性，数值实验验证了理论预测的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为无限宽度下的Transformer架构统一理论奠定了基础。

Abstract: In modern theoretical analyses of neural networks, the infinite-width limit
is often invoked to justify Gaussian approximations of neuron preactivations
(e.g., via neural network Gaussian processes or Tensor Programs). However,
these Gaussian-based asymptotic theories have so far been unable to capture the
behavior of attention layers, except under special regimes such as infinitely
many heads or tailored scaling schemes. In this paper, leveraging the Tensor
Programs framework, we rigorously identify the infinite-width limit
distribution of variables within a single attention layer under realistic
architectural dimensionality and standard $1/\sqrt{n}$-scaling with $n$
dimensionality. We derive the exact form of this limit law without resorting to
infinite-head approximations or tailored scalings, demonstrating that it
departs fundamentally from Gaussianity. This limiting distribution exhibits
non-Gaussianity from a hierarchical structure, being Gaussian conditional on
the random similarity scores. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical
predictions, confirming the effectiveness of our theory at finite width and
accurate description of finite-head attentions. Beyond characterizing a
standalone attention layer, our findings lay the groundwork for developing a
unified theory of deep Transformer architectures in the infinite-width regime.

Abstract: We introduce machine unlearning for speech tasks, a novel and underexplored
research problem that aims to efficiently and effectively remove the influence
of specific data from trained speech models without full retraining. This has
important applications in privacy preservation, removal of outdated or noisy
data, and bias mitigation. While machine unlearning has been studied in
computer vision and natural language processing, its application to speech is
largely unexplored due to the high-dimensional, sequential, and
speaker-dependent nature of speech data. We define two fundamental speech
unlearning tasks: sample unlearning, which removes individual data points
(e.g., a voice recording), and class unlearning, which removes an entire
category (e.g., all data from a speaker), while preserving performance on the
remaining data. Experiments on keyword spotting and speaker identification
demonstrate that unlearning speech data is significantly more challenging than
unlearning image or text data. We conclude with key future directions in this
area, including structured training, robust evaluation, feature-level
unlearning, broader applications, scalable methods, and adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of Diffusion Models (DMs) and Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs), their generalization performance remains theoretically
underexplored, especially lacking a full consideration of the shared
encoder-generator structure. Leveraging recent information-theoretic tools, we
propose a unified theoretical framework that provides guarantees for the
generalization of both the encoder and generator by treating them as randomized
mappings. This framework further enables (1) a refined analysis for VAEs,
accounting for the generator's generalization, which was previously overlooked;
(2) illustrating an explicit trade-off in generalization terms for DMs that
depends on the diffusion time $T$; and (3) providing computable bounds for DMs
based solely on the training data, allowing the selection of the optimal $T$
and the integration of such bounds into the optimization process to improve
model performance. Empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets
illustrate the validity of the proposed theory.

Abstract: Modeling complex fluid systems, especially turbulence governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs), remains a fundamental challenge in science and
engineering. Recently, diffusion-based generative models have gained attention
as a powerful approach for these tasks, owing to their capacity to capture
long-range dependencies and recover hierarchical structures. However, we
present both empirical and theoretical evidence showing that generative models
struggle with significant spectral bias and common-mode noise when generating
high-fidelity turbulent flows. Here we propose FourierFlow, a novel generative
turbulence modeling framework that enhances the frequency-aware learning by
both implicitly and explicitly mitigating spectral bias and common-mode noise.
FourierFlow comprises three key innovations. Firstly, we adopt a dual-branch
backbone architecture, consisting of a salient flow attention branch with
local-global awareness to focus on sensitive turbulence areas. Secondly, we
introduce a frequency-guided Fourier mixing branch, which is integrated via an
adaptive fusion strategy to explicitly mitigate spectral bias in the generative
model. Thirdly, we leverage the high-frequency modeling capabilities of the
masked auto-encoder pre-training and implicitly align the features of the
generative model toward high-frequency components. We validate the
effectiveness of FourierFlow on three canonical turbulent flow scenarios,
demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, we show that our model exhibits strong generalization capabilities
in challenging settings such as out-of-distribution domains, long-term temporal
extrapolation, and robustness to noisy inputs. The code can be found at

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative modeling have demonstrated
significant promise in tackling long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks by leveraging
offline datasets. While these approaches have achieved promising results, their
reliability remains inconsistent due to the inherent stochastic risk of
producing infeasible trajectories, limiting their applicability in
safety-critical applications. We identify that the primary cause of these
failures is inaccurate guidance during the sampling procedure, and demonstrate
the existence of manifold deviation by deriving a lower bound on the guidance
gap. To address this challenge, we propose Local Manifold Approximation and
Projection (LoMAP), a training-free method that projects the guided sample onto
a low-rank subspace approximated from offline datasets, preventing infeasible
trajectory generation. We validate our approach on standard offline
reinforcement learning benchmarks that involve challenging long-horizon
planning. Furthermore, we show that, as a standalone module, LoMAP can be
incorporated into the hierarchical diffusion planner, providing further
performance enhancements.

of studies have explored the integration of MRL with LLMs and achieved
promising results. However, the increasing availability of diverse LLMs and
molecular structure encoders has significantly expanded the model space,
presenting major challenges for benchmarking. Currently, there is no LLM
framework that supports both flexible molecular input formats and dynamic
architectural switching. To address these challenges, reduce redundant coding,
and ensure fair model comparison, we propose ModuLM, a framework designed to
support flexible LLM-based model construction and diverse molecular
representations. ModuLM provides a rich suite of modular components, including
8 types of 2D molecular graph encoders, 11 types of 3D molecular conformation
encoders, 7 types of interaction layers, and 7 mainstream LLM backbones. Owing
to its highly flexible model assembly mechanism, ModuLM enables the dynamic
construction of over 50,000 distinct model configurations. In addition, we
provide comprehensive results to demonstrate the effectiveness of ModuLM in
supporting LLM-based MRL tasks.

*Kyowoon Lee,Jaesik Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出了一种名为SCoTS的新方法，通过拼接短轨迹段生成多样化和扩展的轨迹，以提升扩散模型在离线强化学习中的规划和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在离线强化学习中的性能受限于训练数据的质量和多样性，难以泛化到训练分布之外的任务或长时规划。

Method: SCoTS通过学习保留时间距离的潜在表示，并基于方向性探索和新颖性迭代拼接轨迹段，扩展潜在空间。

Result: SCoTS显著提升了扩散模型在需要拼接和长时推理的离线目标条件基准上的性能，并改善了其他离线目标条件强化学习算法的表现。

Conclusion: SCoTS是一种有效的轨迹增强方法，能够提升扩散模型和离线强化学习算法的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for
long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline
datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality
and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to
tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To
overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching
(SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally
stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse
and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving
latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the
environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by
directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent
space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and
generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned
benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore,
augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance
of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: ActiveKD框架将主动学习与知识蒸馏结合，利用视觉语言模型的零样本和少样本能力，提出Probabilistic CoreSet（PCoreSet）选择策略，显著提升样本选择效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏在主动学习中的应用尚未充分探索，主要因为知识蒸馏通常依赖充足标注数据，而主动学习在数据稀缺场景下运行。

Method: 提出ActiveKD框架，利用视觉语言模型的预测结构偏差，设计PCoreSet策略，在概率空间最大化样本覆盖。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明，PCoreSet在ActiveKD框架中优于现有选择方法。

Conclusion: ActiveKD和PCoreSet为主动学习与知识蒸馏的结合提供了新思路，显著提升了样本选择效率。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used framework for training compact,
task-specific models by leveraging the knowledge of teacher models. However,
its application to active learning (AL), which aims to minimize annotation
costs through iterative sample selection, remains underexplored. This gap stems
from the fact that KD typically assumes access to sufficient labeled data,
whereas AL operates in data-scarce scenarios where task-specific teacher models
are often unavailable. In this paper, we introduce ActiveKD, a framework that
integrates AL with KD by leveraging the zero- and few-shot capabilities of
large vision-language models (VLMs). A key aspect of ActiveKD is the structured
prediction bias of VLMs -- i.e., their predictions form clusters in the
probability space. We regard this structure as an inductive bias of the teacher
model, capturing generalizable output patterns beneficial to student learning.
To exploit this bias, we propose Probabilistic CoreSet (PCoreSet), a selection
strategy that maximizes coverage in the probability space rather than the
feature space. PCoreSet strategically selects categorically diverse unlabeled
samples, facilitating more efficient transfer of teacher knowledge under
limited annotation budgets. Evaluations on 11 datasets show that PCoreSet
consistently outperforms existing selection methods within the ActiveKD
framework, advancing research at the intersection of AL and KD.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Bayesian posterior sampling techniques have demonstrated superior empirical
performance in many exploration-exploitation settings. However, their
theoretical analysis remains a challenge, especially in complex settings like
reinforcement learning. In this paper, we introduce Q-Learning with Posterior
Sampling (PSQL), a simple Q-learning-based algorithm that uses Gaussian
posteriors on Q-values for exploration, akin to the popular Thompson Sampling
algorithm in the multi-armed bandit setting. We show that in the tabular
episodic MDP setting, PSQL achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(H^2\sqrt{SAT})$, closely matching the known lower bound of
$\Omega(H\sqrt{SAT})$. Here, S, A denote the number of states and actions in
the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), and $T=KH$ with $K$ being the
number of episodes and $H$ being the planning horizon. Our work provides
several new technical insights into the core challenges in combining posterior
sampling with dynamic programming and TD-learning-based RL algorithms, along
with novel ideas for resolving those difficulties. We hope this will form a
starting point for analyzing this efficient and important algorithmic technique
in even more complex RL settings.

Motivation: 在安全敏感应用中，不确定性量化至关重要，但现成的神经网络常因性能影响而忽略此功能。现有后验方法通常需要模型参数或梯度，限制了实用性。

Method: 基于最大似然估计和顺序参数拟合原理，提出一种后验优化目标，利用辅助数据和冻结模型输出来估计不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法在不依赖基础模型预测的情况下，有效估计输入依赖性不确定性，并在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is critical in safety-sensitive applications but
is often omitted from off-the-shelf neural networks due to adverse effects on
predictive performance. Retrofitting uncertainty estimates post-hoc typically
requires access to model parameters or gradients, limiting feasibility in
practice. We propose a theoretically grounded framework for post-hoc
uncertainty estimation in regression tasks by fitting an auxiliary model to
both original inputs and frozen model outputs. Drawing from principles of
maximum likelihood estimation and sequential parameter fitting, we formalize an
exact post-hoc optimization objective that recovers the canonical MLE of
Gaussian parameters, without requiring sampling or approximation at inference.
While prior work has used model outputs to estimate uncertainty, we explicitly
characterize the conditions under which this is valid and demonstrate the
extent to which structured outputs can support quasi-epistemic inference. We
find that using diverse auxiliary data, such as augmented subsets of the
original training data, significantly enhances OOD detection and metric
performance. Our hypothesis that frozen model outputs contain generalizable
latent information about model error and predictive uncertainty is tested and
confirmed. Finally, we ensure that our method maintains proper estimation of
input-dependent uncertainty without relying exclusively on base model
forecasts. These findings are demonstrated in toy problems and adapted to both
UCI and depth regression benchmarks. Code: https://github.com/biggzlar/IO-CUE.

TLDR: PRISM是一种新型的位置编码机制，通过概率相对位置隐式叠加模型，使Transformer模型能够在训练长度10倍以上的序列中准确推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度序列模型在测试序列长度显著超过训练长度时准确率下降，而许多关键任务（如算法推理、多步算术和组合泛化）需要鲁棒的长度推断能力。

Method: PRISM通过可微分直方图滤波更新学习连续相对位置，采用概率叠加而非确定性嵌入来保留位置不确定性。

Result: PRISM在算法基准测试（如算术、SCAN组合任务和复杂复制变体）中实现了最先进的长度推断能力，成功泛化到之前难以处理的序列长度。

Conclusion: PRISM的随机位置编码保持了清晰且可解释的内部状态，为可靠的长度泛化提供了理论基础，推动了神经网络序列模型在远超训练长度时的算法鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep sequence models typically degrade in accuracy when test sequences
significantly exceed their training lengths, yet many critical tasks--such as
algorithmic reasoning, multi-step arithmetic, and compositional
generalization--require robust length extrapolation. We introduce PRISM, a
Probabilistic Relative-position Implicit Superposition Model, a novel
positional encoding mechanism that enables Transformers to extrapolate
accurately up to 10x beyond their training length. PRISM learns continuous
relative positions through a differentiable histogram-filter update, preserving
position uncertainty via a probabilistic superposition rather than conventional
deterministic embeddings. Empirically, PRISM achieves state-of-the-art length
extrapolation, successfully generalizing to previously intractable sequence
lengths across algorithmic benchmarks--including arithmetic (addition,
multiplication), SCAN compositionality tasks, and complex copy variants derived
from DeepMind's recent datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that PRISM's
stochastic positional encoding maintains sharp and interpretable internal
states, providing a theoretical basis for reliable length generalization. These
results advance the goal of neural sequence models that remain algorithmically
robust at lengths far exceeding their training horizon.

Result: 实验证明LIPS能有效缓解层间惯性，提升聚合效果和整体性能。

Conclusion: LIPS不仅深化了对联邦学习中层间动态的理解，还为资源受限环境提供了更有效的协作策略。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients while preserving data privacy, leveraging aggregated
updates to build robust global models. However, this training paradigm faces
significant challenges due to data heterogeneity and limited local datasets,
which often impede effective collaboration. In such scenarios, we identify the
Layer-wise Inertia Phenomenon in FL, wherein the middle layers of global model
undergo minimal updates after early communication rounds, ultimately limiting
the effectiveness of global aggregation. We demonstrate the presence of this
phenomenon across a wide range of federated settings, spanning diverse datasets
and architectures. To address this issue, we propose LIPS (Layer-wise Inertia
Phenomenon with Sparsity), a simple yet effective method that periodically
introduces transient sparsity to stimulate meaningful updates and empower
global aggregation. Experiments demonstrate that LIPS effectively mitigates
layer-wise inertia, enhances aggregation effectiveness, and improves overall
performance in various FL scenarios. This work not only deepens the
understanding of layer-wise learning dynamics in FL but also paves the way for
more effective collaboration strategies in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: TrustworthyMS通过改进分子建模和不确定性量化，显著提升了代谢稳定性预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular metabolic stability (MS) is critical for
drug research and development but remains challenging due to the complex
interplay of molecular interactions. Despite recent advances in graph neural
networks (GNNs) for MS prediction, current approaches face two critical
limitations: (1) incomplete molecular modeling due to atom-centric
message-passing mechanisms that disregard bond-level topological features, and
(2) prediction frameworks that lack reliable uncertainty quantification. To
address these challenges, we propose TrustworthyMS, a novel contrastive
learning framework designed for uncertainty-aware metabolic stability
prediction. First, a molecular graph topology remapping mechanism synchronizes
atom-bond interactions through edge-induced feature propagation, capturing both
localized electronic effects and global conformational constraints. Second,
contrastive topology-bond alignment enforces consistency between molecular
topology views and bond patterns via feature alignment, enhancing
representation robustness. Third, uncertainty modeling through Beta-Binomial
uncertainty quantification enables simultaneous prediction and confidence
calibration under epistemic uncertainty. Through extensive experiments, our
results demonstrate that TrustworthyMS outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in terms of predictive performance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过聚类视角解决了大规模营销预算分配问题，显著提升了工业场景中的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Marketing optimization, commonly formulated as an online budget allocation
problem, has emerged as a pivotal factor in driving user growth. Most existing
research addresses this problem by following the principle of 'first predict
then optimize' for each individual, which presents challenges related to
large-scale counterfactual prediction and solving complexity trade-offs. Note
that the practical data quality is uncontrollable, and the solving scale tends
to be tens of millions. Therefore, the existing approaches make the robust
budget allocation non-trivial, especially in industrial scenarios with
considerable data noise. To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach that
solves the problem from the cluster perspective. Specifically, we propose a
multi-task representation network to learn the inherent attributes of
individuals and project the original features into high-dimension hidden
representations through the first two layers of the trained network. Then, we
divide these hidden representations into $K$ groups through partitioning-based
clustering, thus reformulating the problem as an integer stochastic programming
problem under different total budgets. Finally, we distill the representation
module and clustering model into a multi-category model to facilitate online
deployment. Offline experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our approach compared to six state-of-the-art marketing optimization
algorithms. Online A/B tests on the Meituan platform indicate that the approach
outperforms the online algorithm by 0.53% and 0.65%, considering order volume
(OV) and gross merchandise volume (GMV), respectively.

Abstract: Decentralized learning has emerged as a powerful approach for handling large
datasets across multiple machines in a communication-efficient manner. However,
such methods often face scalability limitations, as increasing the number of
machines beyond a certain point negatively impacts convergence rates. In this
work, we propose Decentralized Anytime SGD, a novel decentralized learning
algorithm that significantly extends the critical parallelism threshold,
enabling the effective use of more machines without compromising performance.
Within the stochastic convex optimization (SCO) framework, we establish a
theoretical upper bound on parallelism that surpasses the current
state-of-the-art, allowing larger networks to achieve favorable statistical
guarantees and closing the gap with centralized learning in highly connected
topologies.

Conclusion: 新框架为随机停止时间问题提供理论支持，优化效果显著。

Abstract: We extend the standard reinforcement learning framework to random time
horizons. While the classical setting typically assumes finite and
deterministic or infinite runtimes of trajectories, we argue that multiple
real-world applications naturally exhibit random (potentially
trajectory-dependent) stopping times. Since those stopping times typically
depend on the policy, their randomness has an effect on policy gradient
formulas, which we (mostly for the first time) derive rigorously in this work
both for stochastic and deterministic policies. We present two complementary
perspectives, trajectory or state-space based, and establish connections to
optimal control theory. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that using the
proposed formulas can significantly improve optimization convergence compared
to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法为CFmMIMO系统中的功率控制提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimization-based power control algorithms are predominantly iterative with
high computational complexity, making them impractical for real-time
applications in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO)
systems. Learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative, and
among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their excellent
performance in solving power control problems. However, all existing GNN-based
approaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments
(UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available
orthogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based
methods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies
over time in practice. Additionally, supervised training necessitates costly
computational resources for computing the target power control solutions for a
large volume of training samples. To address these issues, we propose a graph
attention network for downlink power control in CFmMIMO systems that operates
in a self-supervised manner while effectively handling pilot contamination and
adapting to a dynamic number of UEs. Experimental results show its
effectiveness, even in comparison to the optimal accelerated projected gradient
method as a baseline.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity plays a pivotal role in determining the performance of
machine learning (ML) systems. Traditional algorithms, which are typically
designed to optimize average performance, often overlook the intrinsic
diversity within datasets. This oversight can lead to a myriad of issues,
including unreliable decision-making, inadequate generalization across
different domains, unfair outcomes, and false scientific inferences. Hence, a
nuanced approach to modeling data heterogeneity is essential for the
development of dependable, data-driven systems. In this survey paper, we
present a thorough exploration of heterogeneity-aware machine learning, a
paradigm that systematically integrates considerations of data heterogeneity
throughout the entire ML pipeline -- from data collection and model training to
model evaluation and deployment. By applying this approach to a variety of
critical fields, including healthcare, agriculture, finance, and recommendation
systems, we demonstrate the substantial benefits and potential of
heterogeneity-aware ML. These applications underscore how a deeper
understanding of data diversity can enhance model robustness, fairness, and
reliability and help model diagnosis and improvements. Moreover, we delve into
future directions and provide research opportunities for the whole data mining
community, aiming to promote the development of heterogeneity-aware ML.

Motivation: Wasserstein度量在机器学习中应用广泛，但计算成本高，现有近似方法牺牲了准确性。本文旨在开发既能高效计算又能提供严格上下界的方法。

Method: 在离散度量上，通过粗网格上的Kantorovich问题求解（使用量化度量与特殊设计的成本矩阵），再进行上采样和校正，从原始或对偶空间获得上下界。

Result: 在DOTmark基准测试中，方法比熵正则化OT快10x-100x，近似误差低于2%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持低误差的同时显著提升了计算效率，为Wasserstein度量的近似提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Wasserstein metric has become increasingly important in many machine
learning applications such as generative modeling, image retrieval and domain
adaptation. Despite its appeal, it is often too costly to compute. This has
motivated approximation methods like entropy-regularized optimal transport,
downsampling, and subsampling, which trade accuracy for computational
efficiency. In this paper, we consider the challenge of computing efficient
approximations to the Wasserstein metric that also serve as strict upper or
lower bounds. Focusing on discrete measures on regular grids, our approach
involves formulating and exactly solving a Kantorovich problem on a coarse grid
using a quantized measure and specially designed cost matrix, followed by an
upscaling and correction stage. This is done either in the primal or dual space
to obtain valid upper and lower bounds on the Wasserstein metric of the
full-resolution inputs. We evaluate our methods on the DOTmark optimal
transport images benchmark, demonstrating a 10x-100x speedup compared to
entropy-regularized OT while keeping the approximation error below 2%.

Motivation: 微调大型语言模型（LLMs）在特定领域任务上表现良好，但可能导致过拟合，使其在分布外（OoD）查询上不可靠。

Method: 提取微调数据的特征向量并聚类，用盒状抽象包围聚类；引入正则化损失以增强特征空间中的鲁棒性。

Result: LoRA-BAM提供了轻量级且可解释的OoD检测，补充了现有防御方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了LLMs在OoD查询上的不可靠问题，同时保持了模型的轻量性和可解释性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) improves performance on
domain-specific tasks but can lead to overfitting, making them unreliable on
out-of-distribution (OoD) queries. We propose LoRA-BAM - a method that adds OoD
detection monitors to the LoRA layer using boxed abstraction to filter
questions beyond the model's competence. Feature vectors from the fine-tuning
data are extracted via the LLM and clustered. Clusters are enclosed in boxes; a
question is flagged as OoD if its feature vector falls outside all boxes. To
improve interpretability and robustness, we introduce a regularization loss
during fine-tuning that encourages paraphrased questions to stay close in the
feature space, and the enlargement of the decision boundary is based on the
feature variance within a cluster. Our method complements existing defenses by
providing lightweight and interpretable OoD detection.

Motivation: 现有视觉重编程方法（VR）在CLIP中训练单一视觉提示，可能无法捕捉描述的多样性或偏向非信息性属性，限制了性能。

Method: 提出解耦视觉提示（DVP），分组优化提示（基于显式原因或聚类），并通过PRM整合其输出。

Result: DVP在11个下游数据集上平均表现优于基线，且PRM提供了对分类决策的透明理解。

Conclusion: DVP-PRM框架不仅提升了性能，还提供了对视觉重编程的透明解释。

Abstract: Model reprogramming adapts pretrained models to downstream tasks by modifying
only the input and output spaces. Visual reprogramming (VR) is one instance for
vision tasks that adds a trainable noise pattern (i.e., a visual prompt) to
input images to facilitate downstream classification. The existing VR
approaches for CLIP train a single visual prompt using all descriptions of
different downstream classes. However, the limited learning capacity may result
in (1) a failure to capture diverse aspects of the descriptions (e.g., shape,
color, and texture), and (2) a possible bias toward less informative attributes
that do not help distinguish between classes. In this paper, we introduce a
decoupling-and-reweighting framework. Our decoupled visual prompts (DVP) are
optimized using descriptions grouped by explicit causes (DVP-cse) or
unsupervised clusters (DVP-cls). Then, we integrate the outputs of these visual
prompts with a probabilistic reweighting matrix (PRM) that measures their
contributions to each downstream class. Theoretically, DVP lowers the empirical
risk bound. Experimentally, DVP outperforms baselines on average across 11
downstream datasets. Notably, the DVP-PRM integration enables insights into how
individual visual prompts influence classification decisions, providing a
probabilistic framework for understanding reprogramming. Our code is available

Method: 通过广泛的实证研究和分析，比较不同架构的性能，并探索缓解值低估的技术。

Result: 较小actor导致性能下降和critic过拟合，值低估是主要原因。

Conclusion: critic在缓解问题中起关键作用，未来可进一步研究非对称actor-critic方法。

Abstract: Actor-critic methods have been central to many of the recent advances in deep
reinforcement learning. The most common approach is to use symmetric
architectures, whereby both actor and critic have the same network topology and
number of parameters. However, recent works have argued for the advantages of
asymmetric setups, specifically with the use of smaller actors. We perform
broad empirical investigations and analyses to better understand the
implications of this and find that, in general, smaller actors result in
performance degradation and overfit critics. Our analyses suggest poor data
collection, due to value underestimation, as one of the main causes for this
behavior, and further highlight the crucial role the critic can play in
alleviating this pathology. We explore techniques to mitigate the observed
value underestimation, which enables further research in asymmetric
actor-critic methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型训练存在梯度变化和参数高效微调技术兼容性问题，现有优化器如AdamW难以有效估计参数级学习率。

Method: SGG通过梯度统计动态分组和组特定缩放校准学习率，实现集体约束和精确参数适应。

Result: 实验表明SGG与现有优化器兼容，在不同模型规模下均表现优越，收敛更快且稳定。

Conclusion: SGG是LLM优化的稳健选择，适用于不同批大小和学习率。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses challenges due to their massive
scale and heterogeneous architectures. While adaptive optimizers like AdamW
help address gradient variations, they still struggle with efficient and
effective parameter-wise learning rate estimation, resulting in training
instability, slow convergence, and poor compatibility with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. This work introduces Scaling with Gradient
Grouping (SGG), an optimizer wrapper that improves adaptive learning rate
estimation by dynamic grouping and group-specific scaling. SGG first groups
gradient statistics in each layer into clusters and then applies
cluster-specific scaling to calibrate learning rates for each parameter, thus
imposing collective group-wise constraints while maintaining precise
per-parameter adaptation. Experiments on diverse (M)LLM benchmarks show that
SGG integrates seamlessly with existing optimizers, and offers consistent gains
and faster convergence over baselines, with various model sizes. Its stability
across varying batch sizes and learning rates establishes SGG as a robust
choice for LLM optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the finite-time convergence properties of Temporal Difference
(TD) learning with linear function approximation, a cornerstone algorithm in
reinforcement learning. While prior work has established convergence
guarantees, these results typically rely on the assumption that each iterate is
projected onto a bounded set or that the learning rate is set according to the
unknown strong convexity constant -- conditions that are both artificial and do
not match the current practice.
  In this paper, we challenge the necessity of such assumptions and present a
refined analysis of TD learning. We show that the simple projection-free
variant converges with a rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{||\theta^*||^2_2}{\sqrt{T}})$, even in the presence
of Markovian noise. Our analysis reveals a novel self-bounding property of the
TD updates and exploits it to guarantee bounded iterates.

Result: 所有测试的验证方法均易受针对部署环境特定特征的攻击，证明其不具备实际严格性。

Conclusion: 实现实际严格性在计算上更具挑战性，现有验证方法需改进以应对部署环境的不确定性。

Abstract: The ultimate goal of verification is to guarantee the safety of deployed
neural networks. Here, we claim that all the state-of-the-art verifiers we are
aware of fail to reach this goal. Our key insight is that theoretical soundness
(bounding the full-precision output while computing with floating point) does
not imply practical soundness (bounding the floating point output in a
potentially stochastic environment). We prove this observation for the
approaches that are currently used to achieve provable theoretical soundness,
such as interval analysis and its variants. We also argue that achieving
practical soundness is significantly harder computationally. We support our
claims empirically as well by evaluating several well-known verification
methods. To mislead the verifiers, we create adversarial networks that detect
and exploit features of the deployment environment, such as the order and
precision of floating point operations. We demonstrate that all the tested
verifiers are vulnerable to our new deployment-specific attacks, which proves
that they are not practically sound.

Abstract: Feature attribution (FA) methods are widely used in explainable AI (XAI) to
help users understand how the inputs of a machine learning model contribute to
its outputs. However, different FA models often provide disagreeing importance
scores for the same model. In the absence of ground truth or in-depth knowledge
about the inner workings of the model, it is often difficult to meaningfully
determine which of the different FA methods produce more suitable explanations
in different contexts. As a step towards addressing this issue, we introduce
the open-source XAI-Units benchmark, specifically designed to evaluate FA
methods against diverse types of model behaviours, such as feature
interactions, cancellations, and discontinuous outputs. Our benchmark provides
a set of paired datasets and models with known internal mechanisms,
establishing clear expectations for desirable attribution scores. Accompanied
by a suite of built-in evaluation metrics, XAI-Units streamlines systematic
experimentation and reveals how FA methods perform against distinct, atomic
kinds of model reasoning, similar to unit tests in software engineering.
Crucially, by using procedurally generated models tied to synthetic datasets,
we pave the way towards an objective and reliable comparison of FA methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Uncertainty Estimation (UE) methods have become a
crucial tool for detecting hallucinations in recent years. While numerous UE
methods have been proposed, most existing studies evaluate them in isolated
short-form QA settings using threshold-independent metrics such as AUROC or
PRR. However, real-world deployment of UE methods introduces several
challenges. In this work, we systematically examine four key aspects of
deploying UE methods in practical settings. Specifically, we assess (1) the
sensitivity of UE methods to decision threshold selection, (2) their robustness
to query transformations such as typos, adversarial prompts, and prior chat
history, (3) their applicability to long-form generation, and (4) strategies
for handling multiple UE scores for a single query. Our evaluations on 19 UE
methods reveal that most of them are highly sensitive to threshold selection
when there is a distribution shift in the calibration dataset. While these
methods generally exhibit robustness against previous chat history and typos,
they are significantly vulnerable to adversarial prompts. Additionally, while
existing UE methods can be adapted for long-form generation through various
strategies, there remains considerable room for improvement. Lastly, ensembling
multiple UE scores at test time provides a notable performance boost, which
highlights its potential as a practical improvement strategy. Code is available

Motivation: 探讨Transformer性能提升中自注意力机制的具体贡献，以及不同组件对任务解决的互补作用。

Method: 通过冻结MLP层或注意力投影器，并引入随机固定注意力的MixiT模型，对比分析Transformer各组件的作用。

Result: MixiT在算术和记忆任务中表现接近完整Transformer，但在检索任务中表现较差；冻结查询和键投影器的注意力仍能形成关键电路并胜任语言建模。

Conclusion: Transformer的架构异质性（不同组件的互补性）对解决多样化任务至关重要。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture is central to the success of modern Large
Language Models (LLMs), in part due to its surprising ability to perform a wide
range of algorithmic tasks -- including mathematical reasoning, memorization,
and retrieval -- using only gradient-based training on next-token prediction.
While the core component of a Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, we
question how much, and which aspects, of the performance gains can be
attributed to it. To this end, we compare standard Transformers to variants in
which either the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers or the attention
projectors (queries and keys) are frozen at initialization. To further isolate
the contribution of attention, we introduce MixiT -- the Mixing Transformer --
a simplified, principled model in which the attention coefficients are entirely
random and fixed at initialization, eliminating any input-dependent computation
or learning in attention. Surprisingly, we find that MixiT matches the
performance of fully trained Transformers on various algorithmic tasks,
especially those involving basic arithmetic or focusing heavily on
memorization. For retrieval-based tasks, we observe that having input-dependent
attention coefficients is consistently beneficial, while MixiT underperforms.
We attribute this failure to its inability to form specialized circuits such as
induction heads -- a specific circuit known to be crucial for learning and
exploiting repeating patterns in input sequences. Even more interestingly, we
find that attention with frozen key and query projectors is not only able to
form induction heads, but can also perform competitively on language modeling.
Our results underscore the importance of architectural heterogeneity, where
distinct components contribute complementary inductive biases crucial for
solving different classes of tasks.

Conclusion: NSD为扩散模型在严格约束条件下的应用提供了新思路，扩展了其在实际场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable generative capabilities of diffusion models, their
integration into safety-critical or scientifically rigorous applications
remains hindered by the need to ensure compliance with stringent physical,
structural, and operational constraints. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces Neuro-Symbolic Diffusion (NSD), a novel framework that interleaves
diffusion steps with symbolic optimization, enabling the generation of
certifiably consistent samples under user-defined functional and logic
constraints. This key feature is provided for both standard and discrete
diffusion models, enabling, for the first time, the generation of both
continuous (e.g., images and trajectories) and discrete (e.g., molecular
structures and natural language) outputs that comply with constraints. This
ability is demonstrated on tasks spanning three key challenges: (1) Safety, in
the context of non-toxic molecular generation and collision-free trajectory
optimization; (2) Data scarcity, in domains such as drug discovery and
materials engineering; and (3) Out-of-domain generalization, where enforcing
symbolic constraints allows adaptation beyond the training distribution.

Conclusion: 目标导向行为会影响慢特征分析的效果，但修正方法可以缓解负面影响。

Abstract: Slow Feature Analysis is a unsupervised representation learning method that
extracts slowly varying features from temporal data and can be used as a basis
for subsequent reinforcement learning. Often, the behavior that generates the
data on which the representation is learned is assumed to be a uniform random
walk. Less research has focused on using samples generated by goal-directed
behavior, as commonly the case in a reinforcement learning setting, to learn a
representation. In a spatial setting, goal-directed behavior typically leads to
significant differences in state occupancy between states that are close to a
reward location and far from a reward location.
  Through the perspective of optimal slow features on ergodic Markov chains,
this work investigates the effects of these differences on value-function
approximation in an idealized setting. Furthermore, three correction routes,
which can potentially alleviate detrimental scaling effects, are evaluated and
discussed. In addition, the special case of goal-averse behavior is considered.

Result: Formatron引擎在结构化生成任务中保持高精度，推理速度提升高达2倍，且适用于多种LLM架构。

Conclusion: ZapFormat和Formatron显著优化了约束解码的性能，开源实现为社区提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet ensuring
their outputs conform to strict structural or grammatical constraints remains
challenging, which is critical in function calls and domain-specific language
(DSL) generation. Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible
approach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically
building a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the
validity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which
often incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To
address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel
$\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that
identifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time,
significantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This
further enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a
large number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding
engine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through
comprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON
generation, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that
Formatron not only $\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant
outputs but also achieves $\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference
speed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations. More importantly,
Formatron is generally applicable across various LLM architectures. We release
Formatron as open source at https://github.com/Dan-wanna-M/formatron.

Conclusion: WARP通过权重轨迹提供模型内部洞察，关键组件验证其必要性，成为自适应机器智能的新范式。

Abstract: We introduce WARP (Weight-space Adaptive Recurrent Prediction), a simple yet
powerful framework that unifies weight-space learning with linear recurrence to
redefine sequence modeling. Unlike conventional recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) which collapse temporal dynamics into fixed-dimensional hidden states,
WARP explicitly parametrizes the hidden state as the weights of a distinct root
neural network. This formulation promotes higher-resolution memory,
gradient-free adaptation at test-time, and seamless integration of
domain-specific physical priors. Empirical validation shows that WARP matches
or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on diverse classification tasks,
spanning synthetic benchmarks to real-world datasets. Furthermore, extensive
experiments across sequential image completion, dynamical system
reconstruction, and multivariate time series forecasting demonstrate its
expressiveness and generalization capabilities. Critically, WARP's weight
trajectories offer valuable insights into the model's inner workings. Ablation
studies confirm the architectural necessity of key components, solidifying
weight-space linear RNNs as a transformative paradigm for adaptive machine
intelligence.

Abstract: Simulation-free training frameworks have been at the forefront of the
generative modelling revolution in continuous spaces, leading to neural
dynamical systems that encompass modern large-scale diffusion and flow matching
models. Despite the scalability of training, the generation of high-quality
samples and their corresponding likelihood under the model requires expensive
numerical simulation -- inhibiting adoption in numerous scientific applications
such as equilibrium sampling of molecular systems. In this paper, we revisit
classical normalizing flows as one-step generative models with exact
likelihoods and propose a novel, scalable training objective that does not
require computing the expensive change of variable formula used in conventional
maximum likelihood training. We propose Forward-Only Regression Training
(FORT), a simple $\ell_2$-regression objective that maps prior samples under
our flow to specifically chosen targets. We demonstrate that FORT supports a
wide class of targets, such as optimal transport targets and targets from
pre-trained continuous-time normalizing flows (CNF). We further demonstrate
that by using CNF targets, our one-step flows allow for larger-scale training
that exceeds the performance and stability of maximum likelihood training,
while unlocking a broader class of architectures that were previously
challenging to train. Empirically, we elucidate that our trained flows can
perform equilibrium conformation sampling in Cartesian coordinates of alanine
dipeptide, alanine tripeptide, and alanine tetrapeptide.

Abstract: To ensure learned controllers comply with safety and reliability requirements
for reinforcement learning in real-world settings remains challenging.
Traditional safety assurance approaches, such as state avoidance and
constrained Markov decision processes, often inadequately capture trajectory
requirements or may result in overly conservative behaviors. To address these
limitations, recent studies advocate the use of formal specification languages
such as linear temporal logic (LTL), enabling the derivation of
correct-by-construction learning objectives from the specified requirements.
However, the sparse rewards associated with LTL specifications make learning
extremely difficult, whereas dense heuristic-based rewards risk compromising
correctness. In this work, we propose the first method, to our knowledge, that
integrates LTL with differentiable simulators, facilitating efficient
gradient-based learning directly from LTL specifications by coupling with
differentiable paradigms. Our approach introduces soft labeling to achieve
differentiable rewards and states, effectively mitigating the sparse-reward
issue intrinsic to LTL without compromising objective correctness. We validate
the efficacy of our method through experiments, demonstrating significant
improvements in both reward attainment and training time compared to the
discrete methods.

favor layering multiple (3-4) shallow (4-8 qubit) quantum circuits

Abstract: This paper studies reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models with human preferences. While RLHF has
demonstrated promising results, many algorithms are highly sensitive to
misspecifications in the underlying preference model (e.g., the Bradley-Terry
model), the reference policy, or the reward function, resulting in undesirable
fine-tuning. To address model misspecification, we propose a doubly robust
preference optimization algorithm that remains consistent when either the
preference model or the reference policy is correctly specified (without
requiring both). Our proposal demonstrates superior and more robust performance
than state-of-the-art algorithms, both in theory and in practice. The code is

Result: 在多种视觉和语言任务中验证，FedRPCA相比基线方法实现更高最终精度和更快收敛。

Conclusion: FedRPCA通过分解和差异化聚合策略有效解决了LoRA联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: LoRA has emerged as one of the most promising fine-tuning techniques,
especially for federated learning (FL), since it significantly reduces
communication and computation costs at resource-constrained clients. However,
data heterogeneity remains a significant challenge for LoRA-based FL, and the
conventional aggregation strategy based on FedAvg suffers from slow convergence
and suboptimal accuracy. Motivated by recent advances in model merging,
particularly Task Arithmetic, we explore the idea of aggregating client LoRA
parameters using scaled averaging. We first observe that a naive application of
Task Arithmetic is ineffective due to the high cosine similarity between client
updates, indicating significant common knowledge in the updates across clients.
To address this issue, we propose decomposing client LoRA updates via Robust
Principal Component Analysis (Robust-PCA) into a common low-rank component and
client-specific sparse components. Our proposed algorithm FedRPCA aggregates
the low-rank components through averaging, consolidating common knowledge, and
applies scaled averaging to the sparse components to amplify client-specific
knowledge. We evaluate our approach across a variety of vision and language
tasks and demonstrate that it achieves higher final accuracy and faster
convergence compared to competing baselines.

Conclusion: ANIE的多分辨率方法在检测结构变化方面优于固定分辨率方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Detecting structural change in dynamic network data has wide-ranging
applications. Existing approaches typically divide the data into time bins,
extract network features within each bin, and then compare these features over
time. This introduces an inherent tradeoff between temporal resolution and the
statistical stability of the extracted features. Despite this tradeoff,
reminiscent of time-frequency tradeoffs in signal processing, most methods rely
on a fixed temporal resolution. Choosing an appropriate resolution parameter is
typically difficult and can be especially problematic in domains like
cybersecurity, where anomalous behavior may emerge at multiple time scales. We
address this challenge by proposing ANIE (Adaptive Network Intensity
Estimation), a multi-resolution framework designed to automatically identify
the time scales at which network structure evolves, enabling the joint
detection of both rapid and gradual changes. Modeling interactions as Poisson
processes, our method proceeds in two steps: (1) estimating a low-dimensional
subspace of node behavior, and (2) deriving a set of novel empirical affinity
coefficients that quantify change in interaction intensity between latent
factors and support statistical testing for structural change across time
scales. We provide theoretical guarantees for subspace estimation and the
asymptotic behavior of the affinity coefficients, enabling model-based change
detection. Experiments on synthetic networks show that ANIE adapts to the
appropriate time resolution and is able to capture sharp structural changes
while remaining robust to noise. Furthermore, applications to real-world data
showcase the practical benefits of ANIE's multiresolution approach to detecting
structural change over fixed resolution methods.

TLDR: 提出一种基于动态模式分解（DMD）的数据驱动时间嵌入方法，用于建模时空预测任务中的长程季节性依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间嵌入方法（如时间指示器或正弦函数）难以捕捉复杂多尺度周期性，需手动设计特征。

Method: 利用DMD从观测数据中直接提取时间模式，无需显式时间戳或手工特征，并将其集成到深度时空预测模型中。

Result: 在多个数据集（城市交通、高速公路流量、气候）上验证，DMD嵌入显著提升长期预测精度、降低残差相关性并增强时间泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量、模型无关，适用于任何需要时间协变量的架构。

Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven time embedding method for modeling
long-range seasonal dependencies in spatiotemporal forecasting tasks. The
proposed approach employs Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to extract temporal
modes directly from observed data, eliminating the need for explicit timestamps
or hand-crafted time features. These temporal modes serve as time
representations that can be seamlessly integrated into deep spatiotemporal
forecasting models. Unlike conventional embeddings such as time-of-day
indicators or sinusoidal functions, our method captures complex multi-scale
periodicity through spectral analysis of spatiotemporal data. Extensive
experiments on urban mobility, highway traffic, and climate datasets
demonstrate that the DMD-based embedding consistently improves long-horizon
forecasting accuracy, reduces residual correlation, and enhances temporal
generalization. The method is lightweight, model-agnostic, and compatible with
any architecture that incorporates time covariates.

Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools
for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across
diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability
of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph
structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and
deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we
study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a
novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that
focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation
characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This
way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on
the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and
perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to
validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing
baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on
downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the
proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data
distribution into stability analysis.

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) allows for predicting all the chemical and
physical properties of molecular systems from first principles by finding an
approximate solution to the many-body Schr\"odinger equation. However, the cost
of these predictions becomes infeasible when increasing the scale of the energy
evaluations, e.g., when calculating the ground-state energy for simulating
molecular dynamics. Recent works have demonstrated that, for substantially
large datasets of molecular conformations, Deep Learning-based models can
predict the outputs of the classical DFT solvers by amortizing the
corresponding optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a novel method
that reduces the dependency of amortized DFT solvers on large pre-collected
datasets by introducing a self-refining training strategy. Namely, we propose
an efficient method that simultaneously trains a deep-learning model to predict
the DFT outputs and samples molecular conformations that are used as training
data for the model. We derive our method as a minimization of the variational
upper bound on the KL-divergence measuring the discrepancy between the
generated samples and the target Boltzmann distribution defined by the ground
state energy. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed scheme, we perform an
extensive empirical study comparing it with the models trained on the
pre-collected datasets. Finally, we open-source our implementation of the
proposed algorithm, optimized with asynchronous training and sampling stages,
which enables simultaneous sampling and training. Code is available at

Motivation: 现实中的数据质量问题（如缺失值、偏见标签）会降低ML管道的可靠性，而现有评估方法过于简单，无法覆盖最坏情况。

Method: SAVAGE通过依赖图和灵活模板建模数据质量问题，并采用双层优化高效识别脆弱子群和调整破坏程度。

Result: 实验表明，SAVAGE发现的少量结构化破坏（约5%）对模型性能影响远超随机或人工错误，且能验证现有技术的核心假设。

Conclusion: SAVAGE为ML管道压力测试、鲁棒性方法评估和设计更健壮的数据流程提供了实用工具和指导。

Abstract: Structured data-quality issues, such as missing values correlated with
demographics, culturally biased labels, or systemic selection biases, routinely
degrade the reliability of machine-learning pipelines. Regulators now
increasingly demand evidence that high-stakes systems can withstand these
realistic, interdependent errors, yet current robustness evaluations typically
use random or overly simplistic corruptions, leaving worst-case scenarios
unexplored. We introduce SAVAGE, a causally inspired framework that (i)
formally models realistic data-quality issues through dependency graphs and
flexible corruption templates, and (ii) systematically discovers corruption
patterns that maximally degrade a target performance metric. SAVAGE employs a
bi-level optimization approach to efficiently identify vulnerable data
subpopulations and fine-tune corruption severity, treating the full ML
pipeline, including preprocessing and potentially non-differentiable models, as
a black box. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and ML tasks (data
cleaning, fairness-aware learning, uncertainty quantification) demonstrate that
even a small fraction (around 5 %) of structured corruptions identified by
SAVAGE severely impacts model performance, far exceeding random or manually
crafted errors, and invalidating core assumptions of existing techniques. Thus,
SAVAGE provides a practical tool for rigorous pipeline stress-testing, a
benchmark for evaluating robustness methods, and actionable guidance for
designing more resilient data workflows.

Result: GC在超网分区质量和时间效率上达到SOTA，UGAS+GC搜索的架构优于手动设计的GNN和现有NAS方法。

Conclusion: GC和UGAS方法有效解决了权重耦合问题，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: To address the weight coupling problem, certain studies introduced few-shot
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which partition the supernet into
multiple sub-supernets. However, these methods often suffer from computational
inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address
this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a
novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding
layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules.
Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method
that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among
modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet
backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions
are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped
together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of
existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to
searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph
Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal
combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality
and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC
outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS
methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all
proposed methods.

Conclusion: 提出的方差感知算法在理论和实际任务中均表现出色，为上下文对决赌博问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the contextual dueling bandit problem by proposing
variance-aware algorithms that leverage neural networks to approximate
nonlinear utility functions. Our approach employs a \textit{variance-aware
exploration strategy}, which adaptively accounts for uncertainty in pairwise
comparisons while relying only on the gradients with respect to the learnable
parameters of the last layer. This design effectively balances the
exploration--exploitation tradeoff under both the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
and Thompson Sampling (TS) frameworks. As a result, under standard assumptions,
we establish theoretical guarantees showing that our algorithms achieve
sublinear cumulative average regret of order $\bigol\lt(d \sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^T
\sigma_t^2} + \sqrt{dT}\rt),$ for sufficiently wide neural networks, where $ d
$ is the contextual dimension, $ \sigma_t^2 $ the variance of comparisons at
round $ t $, and $ T $ the total number of rounds. We also empirically validate
that our approach offers reasonable computational efficiency and achieves
sublinear regret on both synthetic tasks with nonlinear utilities and
real-world tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Result: 实现99%压缩率，通信效率提升100倍，支持低带宽环境训练亿级参数模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在低带宽环境下匹配数据中心性能，扩展了模型训练的可行性。

Abstract: Scaling models has led to significant advancements in deep learning, but
training these models in decentralized settings remains challenging due to
communication bottlenecks. While existing compression techniques are effective
in data-parallel, they do not extend to model parallelism. Unlike data-parallel
training, where weight gradients are exchanged, model-parallel requires
compressing activations and activation gradients as they propagate through
layers, accumulating compression errors. We propose a novel compression
algorithm that compresses both forward and backward passes, enabling up to 99%
compression with no convergence degradation with negligible memory/compute
overhead. By leveraging a recursive structure in transformer networks, we
predefine a low-dimensional subspace to confine the activations and gradients,
allowing full reconstruction in subsequent layers. Our method achieves up to
100x improvement in communication efficiency and enables training
billion-parameter-scale models over low-end GPUs connected via consumer-grade
internet speeds as low as 80Mbps, matching the convergence of centralized
datacenter systems with 100Gbps connections with model parallel.

Motivation: 在FRL中，PPO的更新顺序（先critic后actor）因聚合步骤导致梯度方向异构，阻碍全局最优策略收敛。

Method: 提出FedRAC，反转PPO的更新顺序（先actor后critic），消除不同客户端critic的差异。

Result: 理论分析表明FedRAC的收敛性不受数据异构性影响；实验显示其在多个RL环境和异构自动驾驶场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: FedRAC通过调整更新顺序有效解决了FRL中的数据异构性问题，提升了算法性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: In the context of Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), applying Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) faces challenges related to the update order of its
actor and critic due to the aggregation step occurring between successive
iterations. In particular, when local actors are updated based on local critic
estimations, the algorithm becomes vulnerable to data heterogeneity. As a
result, the conventional update order in PPO (critic first, then actor) may
cause heterogeneous gradient directions among clients, hindering convergence to
a globally optimal policy. To address this issue, we propose FedRAC, which
reverses the update order (actor first, then critic) to eliminate the
divergence of critics from different clients. Theoretical analysis shows that
the convergence bound of FedRAC is immune to data heterogeneity under mild
conditions, i.e., bounded level of heterogeneity and accurate policy
evaluation. Empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm obtains
higher cumulative rewards and converges more rapidly in five experiments,
including three classical RL environments and a highly heterogeneous autonomous
driving scenario using the SUMO traffic simulator.

Result: 在11个基准数据集上，TSRating在准确性、效率和领域适应性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TSRating通过LLMs和元学习实现了跨领域时间序列数据的高效质量评估。

Abstract: High-quality time series (TS) data are essential for ensuring TS model
performance, rendering research on rating TS data quality indispensable.
Existing methods have shown promising rating accuracy within individual
domains, primarily by extending data quality rating techniques such as
influence functions and Shapley values to account for temporal characteristics.
However, they neglect the fact that real-world TS data can span vastly
different domains and exhibit distinct properties, hampering the accurate and
efficient rating of diverse TS data. In this paper, we propose TSRating, a
novel and unified framework for rating the quality of time series data crawled
from diverse domains. TSRating is built on the assumption that LLMs inherit
ample knowledge, acquired during their extensive pretraining, enabling them to
comprehend and discern quality differences in diverse TS data. We verify this
assumption by devising a series of prompts to elicit quality comparisons from
LLMs for pairs of TS samples. We then fit a dedicated rating model, termed
TSRater, to convert the LLMs' judgments into efficient quality predictions via
TSRater's inference on future TS samples. To ensure cross-domain adaptability,
we develop a meta-learning scheme to train TSRater on quality comparisons
collected from nine distinct domains. To improve training efficiency, we employ
signSGD for inner-loop updates, thus circumventing the demanding computation of
hypergradients. Extensive experimental results on eleven benchmark datasets
across three time series tasks, each using both conventional TS models and TS
foundation models, demonstrate that TSRating outperforms baselines in terms of
estimation accuracy, efficiency, and domain adaptability.

Abstract: Episodic memory enables humans to recall past experiences by associating
semantic elements such as objects, locations, and time into coherent event
representations. While large pretrained models have shown remarkable progress
in modeling semantic memory, the mechanisms for forming associative structures
that support episodic memory remain underexplored. Inspired by hippocampal CA3
dynamics and its role in associative memory, we propose the Latent Structured
Hopfield Network (LSHN), a biologically inspired framework that integrates
continuous Hopfield attractor dynamics into an autoencoder architecture. LSHN
mimics the cortical-hippocampal pathway: a semantic encoder extracts compact
latent representations, a latent Hopfield network performs associative
refinement through attractor convergence, and a decoder reconstructs perceptual
input. Unlike traditional Hopfield networks, our model is trained end-to-end
with gradient descent, achieving scalable and robust memory retrieval.
Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a simulated episodic memory task
demonstrate superior performance in recalling corrupted inputs under occlusion
and noise, outperforming existing associative memory models. Our work provides
a computational perspective on how semantic elements can be dynamically bound
into episodic memory traces through biologically grounded attractor mechanisms.

Result: 剪枝和低秩分解对能耗改善不明显，隐写容量缩减在多数情况下显著降低能耗。

Conclusion: 隐写容量缩减是减少模型电力消耗的有效方法，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Increasingly complex neural network architectures have achieved phenomenal
performance. However, these complex models require massive computational
resources that consume substantial amounts of electricity, which highlights the
potential environmental impact of such models. Previous studies have
demonstrated that substantial redundancies exist in large pre-trained models.
However, previous work has primarily focused on compressing models while
retaining comparable model performance, and the direct impact on electricity
consumption appears to have received relatively little attention. By
quantifying the energy usage associated with both uncompressed and compressed
models, we investigate compression as a means of reducing electricity
consumption. We consider nine different pre-trained models, ranging in size
from 8M parameters to 138M parameters. To establish a baseline, we first train
each model without compression and record the electricity usage and time
required during training, along with other relevant statistics. We then apply
three compression techniques: Steganographic capacity reduction, pruning, and
low-rank factorization. In each of the resulting cases, we again measure the
electricity usage, training time, model accuracy, and so on. We find that
pruning and low-rank factorization offer no significant improvements with
respect to energy usage or other related statistics, while steganographic
capacity reduction provides major benefits in almost every case. We discuss the
significance of these findings.

Result: 在仅使用5%原始数据的情况下，模型性能平均提升5.48分，且计算高效（40分钟处理52k样本）。

Conclusion: T-SHIRT在数据选择和模型性能上优于现有方法，具有高效性和成本效益。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to
effectively follow user instructions. To improve training efficiency and reduce
data redundancy, recent works use LLM-based scoring functions, e.g.,
Instruction-Following Difficulty (IFD), to select high-quality
instruction-tuning data with scores above a threshold. While these data
selection methods often lead to models that can match or even exceed the
performance of models trained on the full datasets, we identify two key
limitations: (i) they assess quality at the sample level, ignoring token-level
informativeness; and (ii) they overlook the robustness of the scoring method,
often selecting a sample due to superficial lexical features instead of its
true quality. In this work, we propose Token-Selective HIeRarchical Data
Selection for Instruction Tuning (T-SHIRT), a novel data selection framework
that introduces a new scoring method to include only informative tokens in
quality evaluation and also promotes robust and reliable samples whose
neighbors also show high quality with less local inconsistencies. We
demonstrate that models instruction-tuned on a curated dataset (only 5% of the
original size) using T-SHIRT can outperform those trained on the entire
large-scale dataset by up to 5.48 points on average across eight benchmarks.
Across various LLMs and training set scales, our method consistently surpasses
existing state-of-the-art data selection techniques, while also remaining both
cost-effective and highly efficient. For instance, by using GPT-2 for score
computation, we are able to process a dataset of 52k samples using 40 minutes
on a single GPU.

Method: 提出Spotter方法，结合掩码知识蒸馏惩罚和类内分散损失，抑制过度遗忘并分散遗忘类嵌入。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，Spotter将过度遗忘降至基线0.05倍，遗忘准确率降至0%，保留集准确率差异小于1%，且有效防止再学习攻击。

Conclusion: Spotter是解决机器遗忘盲点的实用方法，无需访问保留数据即可实现高效遗忘。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to expunge a designated forget set from a
trained model without costly retraining, yet the existing techniques overlook
two critical blind spots: "over-unlearning" that deteriorates retained data
near the forget set, and post-hoc "relearning" attacks that aim to resurrect
the forgotten knowledge. We first derive the over-unlearning metric
OU@{\epsilon}, which represents the collateral damage to the nearby region of
the forget set, where the over-unlearning mainly appears. Next, we expose an
unforeseen relearning threat on MU, i.e., the Prototypical Relearning Attack,
which exploits the per-class prototype of the forget class with just a few
samples, and easily restores the pre-unlearning performance. To counter both
blind spots, we introduce Spotter, a plug-and-play objective that combines (i)
a masked knowledge-distillation penalty on the nearby region of forget set to
suppress OU@{\epsilon}, and (ii) an intra-class dispersion loss that scatters
forget-class embeddings, neutralizing prototypical relearning attacks. On
CIFAR-10, as one of validations, Spotter reduces OU@{\epsilon}by below the
0.05X of the baseline, drives forget accuracy to 0%, preserves accuracy of the
retain set within 1% of difference with the original, and denies the
prototype-attack by keeping the forget set accuracy within <1%, without
accessing retained data. It confirms that Spotter is a practical remedy of the

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce $\Psi$-Sampler, an SMC-based framework incorporating pCNL-based
initial particle sampling for effective inference-time reward alignment with a
score-based generative model. Inference-time reward alignment with score-based
generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader
paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of
this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising
process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the
Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results
in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the
reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable
posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the
preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines
dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach
enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves
performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image
generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as
demonstrated in our experiments.

Motivation: 现有FCIL方法在数据异构性下存在时空漂移和高开销问题，限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出STSA框架，聚合跨客户端和跨阶段的特征统计，并引入通信高效的STSA-E变体。

Result: 在三个FCIL数据集上验证，STSA在性能、灵活性和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STSA为FCIL提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案，显著降低了开销并提升了性能。

Abstract: Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) enables Class-Incremental
Learning (CIL) from distributed data. Existing FCIL methods typically integrate
old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods
cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and
often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting
practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a
novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides
a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across
clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are
unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in
closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a
communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar
performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive
experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data
heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods
in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation
efficiency.

Conclusion: NoiseAR提供了一种高效的、可学习的初始噪声生成方法，优于传统随机初始化，适用于复杂优化框架。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks, creating
data samples by progressively denoising an initial random state. Traditionally,
this initial state is sampled from a simple, fixed distribution like isotropic
Gaussian, inherently lacking structure and a direct mechanism for external
control. While recent efforts have explored ways to introduce controllability
into the diffusion process, particularly at the initialization stage, they
often rely on deterministic or heuristic approaches. These methods can be
suboptimal, lack expressiveness, and are difficult to scale or integrate into
more sophisticated optimization frameworks. In this paper, we introduce
NoiseAR, a novel method for AutoRegressive Initial Noise Prior for Diffusion
Models. Instead of a static, unstructured source, NoiseAR learns to generate a
dynamic and controllable prior distribution for the initial noise. We formulate
the generation of the initial noise prior's parameters as an autoregressive
probabilistic modeling task over spatial patches or tokens. This approach
enables NoiseAR to capture complex spatial dependencies and introduce learned
structure into the initial state. Crucially, NoiseAR is designed to be
conditional, allowing text prompts to directly influence the learned prior,
thereby achieving fine-grained control over the diffusion initialization. Our
experiments demonstrate that NoiseAR can generate initial noise priors that
lead to improved sample quality and enhanced consistency with conditional
inputs, offering a powerful, learned alternative to traditional random
initialization. A key advantage of NoiseAR is its probabilistic formulation,
which naturally supports seamless integration into probabilistic frameworks
like Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/HKUST-SAIL/NoiseAR/

Motivation: 解决现有遗忘方法对下游微调敏感、易恢复遗忘信息的问题。

Method: 提出ILU框架，基于IRM原理，通过正则化增强鲁棒性，并支持单数据集训练。

Result: 在WMDP和MUSE基准测试中，ILU显著优于NPO和RMU，并在多样化下游任务中保持性能。

Conclusion: ILU是一种高效、鲁棒的LLM遗忘方法，适用于多样化微调场景。

Abstract: Machine unlearning offers a promising solution to privacy and safety concerns
in large language models (LLMs) by selectively removing targeted knowledge
while preserving utility. However, current methods are highly sensitive to
downstream fine-tuning, which can quickly recover forgotten information-even
from unrelated tasks. To address this, we introduce invariance into unlearning
for the first time, inspired by invariant risk minimization (IRM). Building on
this principle, we propose invariant LLM unlearning (ILU), a
regularization-based framework that enhances robustness. Notably, ILU
generalizes well to diverse fine-tuning tasks, even when trained using a single
dataset. A task vector analysis is also provided to further elucidate the
rationale behind ILU's effectiveness. Extensive experiments on the WMDP and
MUSE benchmark, reveal that ILU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
unlearning methods, including negative preference optimization (NPO) and
representation misdirection for unlearning (RMU). Notably, ILU achieves
superior unlearning robustness across diverse downstream fine-tuning scenarios
(e.g., math, paraphrase detection, and sentiment analysis) while preserving the
fine-tuning performance.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了生存预测的鲁棒性和准确性，适用于复杂数据环境。

Abstract: We introduce an innovative approach that incorporates a Distributionally
Robust Learning (DRL) approach into Cox regression to enhance the robustness
and accuracy of survival predictions. By formulating a DRL framework with a
Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set, we develop a variant Cox model that
is less sensitive to assumptions about the underlying data distribution and
more resilient to model misspecification and data perturbations. By leveraging
Wasserstein duality, we reformulate the original min-max DRL problem into a
tractable regularized empirical risk minimization problem, which can be
computed by exponential conic programming. We provide guarantees on the finite
sample behavior of our DRL-Cox model. Moreover, through extensive simulations
and real world case studies, we demonstrate that our regression model achieves
superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness compared
with traditional methods.

Conclusion: VAND通过统一噪声和dropout，显著提升了RNN的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel stable learning theory for recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), so-called variational adaptive noise and dropout (VAND). As
stabilizing factors for RNNs, noise and dropout on the internal state of RNNs
have been separately confirmed in previous studies. We reinterpret the
optimization problem of RNNs as variational inference, showing that noise and
dropout can be derived simultaneously by transforming the explicit
regularization term arising in the optimization problem into implicit
regularization. Their scale and ratio can also be adjusted appropriately to
optimize the main objective of RNNs, respectively. In an imitation learning
scenario with a mobile manipulator, only VAND is able to imitate sequential and
periodic behaviors as instructed. https://youtu.be/UOho3Xr6A2w

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为TAH-Quant的新型激活量化框架，用于解决分布式训练中网络通信瓶颈问题，通过细粒度量化和自适应比特分配，实现了高效压缩且不牺牲训练收敛性。


<details>

Motivation: 分布式训练大型语言模型时，网络通信瓶颈（尤其是流水线并行设置中的中间激活传输）限制了效率。现有方法如AQ-SGD虽能缓解量化误差，但内存开销大。

Method: TAH-Quant结合了细粒度分块量化、基于熵的自适应比特分配和Hadamard变换，有效抑制量化异常值，并理论证明了其收敛性。

Result: 实验表明，TAH-Quant在3-4比特量化下实现了4.3倍加速，且不影响收敛性，无额外内存开销，泛化性强。

Conclusion: TAH-Quant为流水线并行训练提供了一种高效、低开销的激活量化解决方案，显著提升了分布式训练效率。

Abstract: Decentralized training of large language models offers the opportunity to
pool computational resources across geographically distributed participants but
faces significant network communication bottlenecks, particularly in
pipeline-parallel settings. While pipeline parallelism partitions model layers
across devices to handle large-scale models, it necessitates frequent
communication of intermediate activations, creating challenges when network
bandwidth is limited. Existing activation compression methods, such as AQ-SGD,
mitigate quantization-induced errors through error compensation but impose
prohibitive memory overhead by requiring storage of previous activations. To
address these issues, we introduce TAH-Quant (Tile-wise Adaptive Hadamard
Quantization), a novel activation quantization framework designed specifically
for pipeline parallelism. Our approach integrates fine-grained tile-wise
quantization for precise control, entropy-guided token-level adaptive bit
allocation for optimal bit usage, and a Hadamard-based transform with pivot
element swapping to effectively suppress quantization outliers. We further
provide a theoretical analysis, proving that pipeline parallel training
equipped with TAH-Quant maintains a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, matching that of vanilla stochastic gradient
descent. Extensive experiments on diverse LLM tasks demonstrate that TAH-Quant
achieves aggressive activation quantization (3-4 bits) ratio, which provides up
to 4.3$\times$ end-to-end speedup without compromising training convergence,
matches state-of-the-art methods, incurs no extra memory overhead, and
generalizes well across different training scenarios.

<details>

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了神经网络控制器的稳定性和验证效率，适用于高维非线性系统。

Abstract: Learning-based neural network (NN) control policies have shown impressive
empirical performance. However, obtaining stability guarantees and estimations
of the region of attraction of these learned neural controllers is challenging
due to the lack of stable and scalable training and verification algorithms.
Although previous works in this area have achieved great success, much
conservatism remains in their framework. In this work, we propose a novel
two-stage training framework to jointly synthesize the controller and Lyapunov
function for continuous-time systems. By leveraging a Zubov-inspired region of
attraction characterization to directly estimate stability boundaries, we
propose a novel training data sampling strategy and a domain updating mechanism
that significantly reduces the conservatism in training. Moreover, unlike
existing works on continuous-time systems that rely on an SMT solver to
formally verify the Lyapunov condition, we extend state-of-the-art neural
network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN with the capability of performing
automatic bound propagation through the Jacobian of dynamical systems and a
novel verification scheme that avoids expensive bisection. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, we conduct numerical experiments by synthesizing
and verifying controllers on several challenging nonlinear systems across
multiple dimensions. We show that our training can yield region of attractions
with volume $5 - 1.5\cdot 10^{5}$ times larger compared to the baselines, and
our verification on continuous systems can be up to $40-10000$ times faster
compared to the traditional SMT solver dReal. Our code is available at

Conclusion: RDB2G-Bench为智能关系数据库到图模型转换研究提供了高效、可复现的评估工具，并提供了实用的建模建议。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are composed of interconnected tables, where
relationships between them are defined through foreign keys. Recent research on
applying machine learning to RDBs has explored graph-based representations of
RDBs, where rows of tables are modeled as nodes, and foreign key relationships
are modeled as edges. RDB-to-graph modeling helps capture cross-table
dependencies, ultimately leading to enhanced performance across diverse tasks.
However, there are numerous ways to model RDBs as graphs, and performance
varies significantly depending on the chosen graph model. In our analysis,
applying a common heuristic rule for graph modeling leads to up to a 10% drop
in performance compared to the best-performing graph model, which remains
non-trivial to identify. To foster research on intelligent RDB-to-graph
modeling, we introduce RDB2G-Bench, the first benchmark framework for
evaluating such methods. We construct extensive datasets covering 5 real-world
RDBs and 12 predictive tasks, resulting in around 50k graph-performance pairs
for efficient and reproducible evaluations. Thanks to our precomputed datasets,
we were able to benchmark 9 automatic RDB-to-graph modeling methods on the 12
tasks over 600x faster than on-the-fly evaluation, which requires repeated
model training. Our analysis of the datasets and benchmark results reveals key
structural patterns affecting graph model effectiveness, along with practical
implications for effective graph modeling.

Abstract: Robust causal discovery in time series datasets depends on reliable benchmark
datasets with known ground-truth causal relationships. However, such datasets
remain scarce, and existing synthetic alternatives often overlook critical
temporal properties inherent in real-world data, including nonstationarity
driven by trends and seasonality, irregular sampling intervals, and the
presence of unobserved confounders. To address these challenges, we introduce
TimeGraph, a comprehensive suite of synthetic time-series benchmark datasets
that systematically incorporates both linear and nonlinear dependencies while
modeling key temporal characteristics such as trends, seasonal effects, and
heterogeneous noise patterns. Each dataset is accompanied by a fully specified
causal graph featuring varying densities and diverse noise distributions and is
provided in two versions: one including unobserved confounders and one without,
thereby offering extensive coverage of real-world complexity while preserving
methodological neutrality. We further demonstrate the utility of TimeGraph
through systematic evaluations of state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms
including PCMCI+, LPCMCI, and FGES across a diverse array of configurations and
metrics. Our experiments reveal significant variations in algorithmic
performance under realistic temporal conditions, underscoring the need for
robust synthetic benchmarks in the fair and transparent assessment of causal
discovery methods. The complete TimeGraph suite, including dataset generation
scripts, evaluation metrics, and recommended experimental protocols, is freely
available to facilitate reproducible research and foster community-driven
advancements in time-series causal discovery.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such
data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models
designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use
case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this
issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified
framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation
models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with
spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained
language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and
methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how
foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a
result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains
unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of
previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The
pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal
data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The
pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing
methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and
effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further
illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the
adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a
clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core
elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get
started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as
multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，模型不仅提升了后训练性能，还能有效进行测试时扩展。

Conclusion: 自验证框架解决了分布差异问题，显著提升了LLM在推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in complex
reasoning tasks through both post-training and test-time scaling laws. While
prevalent test-time scaling approaches are often realized by using external
reward models to guide the model generation process, we find only marginal
gains can be acquired when scaling a model post-trained on specific reasoning
tasks. We identify that the limited improvement stems from distribution
discrepancies between the specific post-trained generator and the general
reward model. To address this, we propose a framework that incentivizes LLMs to
self-verify their own answers. By unifying answer generation and verification
within a single reinforcement learning (RL) process, we train models that can
effectively assess the correctness of their own solutions. The trained model
can further scale its performance during inference time by verifying its
generations, without the need for external verifiers. We train our
self-verification models based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, demonstrating its capabilities across varying
reasoning context lengths. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning
benchmarks show that our models can not only improve post-training performance
but also enable effective test-time scaling. Our code is available at

Abstract: While model serving has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, the high cost of
serving large-scale models continues to be a significant barrier to widespread
accessibility and rapid innovation. Compiler optimizations have long driven
substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with
neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space
of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can
be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the
structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate
the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs),
without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of
compiler optimization to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end,
we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed REASONING COMPILER) that
formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process, guided
by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The
LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-aware transformations
that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback.
Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to
balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured,
context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. By
achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural
compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to
transform the landscape of compiler optimization.

Conclusion: GlycanAA填补了糖链全原子建模的空白，为糖链性质研究提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Understanding the various properties of glycans with machine learning has
shown some preliminary promise. However, previous methods mainly focused on
modeling the backbone structure of glycans as graphs of monosaccharides (i.e.,
sugar units), while they neglected the atomic structures underlying each
monosaccharide, which are actually important indicators of glycan properties.
We fill this blank by introducing the GlycanAA model for All-Atom-wise Glycan
modeling. GlycanAA models a glycan as a heterogeneous graph with monosaccharide
nodes representing its global backbone structure and atom nodes representing
its local atomic-level structures. Based on such a graph, GlycanAA performs
hierarchical message passing to capture from local atomic-level interactions to
global monosaccharide-level interactions. To further enhance model capability,
we pre-train GlycanAA on a high-quality unlabeled glycan dataset, deriving the
PreGlycanAA model. We design a multi-scale mask prediction algorithm to endow
the model about different levels of dependencies in a glycan. Extensive
benchmark results show the superiority of GlycanAA over existing glycan
encoders and verify the further improvements achieved by PreGlycanAA. We

misinformation in large language models (LLMs) by enabling updates to knowledge
without the need for retraining from scratch. However, existing editing
techniques often target isolated facts, ignoring ripple effects on related
knowledge, allowing edited facts to remain deducible and compromising broader
contextual integrity. For example, changing Harry Potter's school from Hogwarts
to Ilvermorny requires reassigning his house from Gryffindor to a suitable
alternative while preserving Gryffindor's relationship with Hogwarts. In this
work, we present a new model-editing setting, deep editing, to show: (1) how
editing techniques fail to handle connected facts, evaluating how original
knowledge sneaks through unchanged causal links, and (2) their impact on
broader contextual knowledge. We introduce ThinkEval, a framework to
systematically evaluate model-editing techniques by building model-specific
knowledge graphs to analyze pre- and post-edit effects on fact persistence and
catastrophic forgetting. We present KnowGIC, a benchmark created with
ThinkEval, consisting of sequentially linked queries to measure these effects.
We evaluate five editing techniques: AlphaEdit, RECT, ROME, MEMIT, and PRUNE
across multiple LLMs. We find that these techniques struggle to balance
indirect fact suppression with the preservation of related knowledge. Our
dataset is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KnowGIC.

*Paritosh Ranjan,Surajit Majumder,Prodip Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出了一种分布式系统架构，将神经网络分区到多个服务器上，以降低计算成本和基础设施需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络的规模不断扩大（如IBM的5300亿神经元和Google的5000亿参数），传统基于GPU集群的训练方式变得不可持续。

Method: 通过分区策略将神经网络分配到多个服务器，使用元数据驱动的查找机制管理服务器间连接，并通过NFS共享统一模型。

Result: 实现了成本效益高、可扩展的深度学习模型部署，减少了对高性能集中计算资源的依赖。

Conclusion: 该架构为大规模神经网络的分布式训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing scale of modern neural networks, exemplified by architectures
from IBM (530 billion neurons) and Google (500 billion parameters), presents
significant challenges in terms of computational cost and infrastructure
requirements. As deep neural networks continue to grow, traditional training
paradigms relying on monolithic GPU clusters become increasingly unsustainable.
This paper proposes a distributed system architecture that partitions a neural
network across multiple servers, each responsible for a subset of neurons.
Neurons are classified as local or remote, with inter-server connections
managed via a metadata-driven lookup mechanism. A Multi-Part Neural Network
Execution Engine facilitates seamless execution and training across distributed
partitions by dynamically resolving and invoking remote neurons using stored
metadata. All servers share a unified model through a network file system
(NFS), ensuring consistency during parallel updates. A Neuron Distributor
module enables flexible partitioning strategies based on neuron count,
percentage, identifiers, or network layers. This architecture enables
cost-effective, scalable deployment of deep learning models on cloud
infrastructure, reducing dependency on high-performance centralized compute
resources.

### [229] [Improved Regret Bounds for Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound in Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01393)
*Shogo Iwazaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: N/A


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper addresses the Bayesian optimization problem (also referred to as
the Bayesian setting of the Gaussian process bandit), where the learner seeks
to minimize the regret under a function drawn from a known Gaussian process
(GP). Under a Mat\'ern kernel with a certain degree of smoothness, we show that
the Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) algorithm achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret with high probability. Furthermore, our
analysis yields $O(\sqrt{T \ln^4 T})$ regret under a squared exponential
kernel. These results fill the gap between the existing regret upper bound for
GP-UCB and the best-known bound provided by Scarlett (2018). The key idea in
our proof is to capture the concentration behavior of the input sequence
realized by GP-UCB, enabling a more refined analysis of the GP's information
gain.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种创新的误差反馈框架，用于减少分布式图滤波中的量化噪声，通过定量反馈量化噪声实现精确补偿。


<details>

Motivation: 解决分布式图滤波中因量化通信导致的噪声问题，并建立不同领域量化滤波过程的联系。

Method: 基于状态空间数字滤波器的误差频谱整形技术，提出定量反馈量化噪声的框架，并在三种关键场景下验证。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，该框架显著降低量化噪声影响，并提供最优误差反馈系数的闭式解。

Conclusion: 该框架可无缝集成到高效通信的分散优化框架中，实现更低的误差下限，优于传统量化策略。

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative error feedback framework designed to
mitigate quantization noise in distributed graph filtering, where
communications are constrained to quantized messages. It comes from error
spectrum shaping techniques from state-space digital filters, and therefore
establishes connections between quantized filtering processes over different
domains. In contrast to existing error compensation methods, our framework
quantitatively feeds back the quantization noise for exact compensation. We
examine the framework under three key scenarios: (i) deterministic graph
filtering, (ii) graph filtering over random graphs, and (iii) graph filtering
with random node-asynchronous updates. Rigorous theoretical analysis
demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly reduces the effect of
quantization noise, and we provide closed-form solutions for the optimal error
feedback coefficients. Moreover, this quantitative error feedback mechanism can
be seamlessly integrated into communication-efficient decentralized
optimization frameworks, enabling lower error floors. Numerical experiments
validate the theoretical results, consistently showing that our method
outperforms conventional quantization strategies in terms of both accuracy and
robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: SOC-DGL模型通过结合全局和局部相似性信息，显著提升了药物-靶标相互作用预测的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型主要关注同质图中的直接相似性信息，忽视了异质图中丰富的相似性信息，SOC-DGL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SOC-DGL包含两个模块：ADGL（利用亲和力增强的全局图学习全局和个体相似性）和EDGL（通过平衡理论挖掘高阶同质信息）。此外，提出了一种可调不平衡损失函数以解决数据不平衡问题。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，SOC-DGL在数据不平衡和未见药物/靶标场景中显著提升了准确性。

Conclusion: SOC-DGL通过双模块设计和可调损失函数，有效捕捉了多样化的相似性信息，为药物-靶标相互作用预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) is crucial for drug
discovery and repositioning, as it reveals potential uses of existing drugs,
aiding in the acceleration of the drug development process and reducing
associated costs. Despite the similarity information in DTI is important, most
models are limited to mining direct similarity information within homogeneous
graphs, overlooking the potential yet rich similarity information in
heterogeneous graphs. Inspired by real-world social interaction behaviors, we
propose SOC-DGL, which comprises two specialized modules: the Affinity-Driven
Graph Learning (ADGL) module and the Equilibrium-Driven Graph Learning (EDGL)
module. The ADGL module adopts a comprehensive social interaction strategy,
leveraging an affinity-enhanced global drug-target graph to learn both global
DTI and the individual similarity information of drugs and targets. In
contrast, the EDGL module employs a higher-order social interaction strategy,
amplifying the influence of even-hop neighbors through an even-polynomial graph
filter grounded in balance theory, enabling the indirect mining of higher-order
homogeneous information. This dual approach enables SOC-DGL to effectively and
comprehensively capture similarity information across diverse interaction
scales within the affinity matrices and drug-target association matrices,
significantly enhancing the model's generalization capability and predictive
accuracy in DTI tasks. To address the issue of imbalance in drug-target
interaction datasets, this paper proposes an adjustable imbalance loss function
that mitigates the impact of sample imbalance by adjusting the weight of
negative samples and a parameter. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate significant accuracy improvements achieved by SOC-DGL,
particularly in scenarios involving data imbalance and unseen drugs or targets.

Abstract: Deep learning approaches process data in a layer-by-layer way with
intermediate (or latent) features. We aim at designing a general solution to
optimize the latent manifolds to improve the performance on classification,
segmentation, completion and/or reconstruction through probabilistic models.
This paper proposes a variational inference model which leads to a clustered
embedding. We introduce additional variables in the latent space, called
\textbf{nebula anchors}, that guide the latent variables to form clusters
during training. To prevent the anchors from clustering among themselves, we
employ the variational constraint that enforces the latent features within an
anchor to form a Gaussian distribution, resulting in a generative model we
refer as Nebula Variational Coding (NVC). Since each latent feature can be
labeled with the closest anchor, we also propose to apply metric learning in a
self-supervised way to make the separation between clusters more explicit. As a
consequence, the latent variables of our variational coder form clusters which
adapt to the generated semantic of the training data, \textit{e.g.} the
categorical labels of each sample. We demonstrate experimentally that it can be
used within different architectures designed to solve different problems
including text sequence, images, 3D point clouds and volumetric data,
validating the advantage of our proposed method.

Result: 实验证明该方法在知名图像数据集上有效，优于SCAn、ABL和AGPD三种先进算法。

Conclusion: 新方法提高了防御后门攻击的可行性，同时增强了攻击触发器的可解释性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a subtle yet effective class of cyberattacks
targeting AI models, primarily due to their stealthy nature. The model behaves
normally on clean data but exhibits malicious behavior only when the attacker
embeds a specific trigger into the input. This attack is performed during the
training phase, where the adversary corrupts a small subset of the training
data by embedding a pattern and modifying the labels to a chosen target. The
objective is to make the model associate the pattern with the target label
while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. Several defense
mechanisms have been proposed to sanitize training data-sets. However, these
methods often rely on the availability of a clean dataset to compute
statistical anomalies, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios
where datasets can be unavailable or compromised. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel defense method that trains a model on the given dataset,
detects poisoned classes, and extracts the critical part of the attack trigger
before identifying the poisoned instances. This approach enhances
explainability by explicitly revealing the harmful part of the trigger. The
effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experimental evaluations on
well-known image datasets and comparative analysis against three
state-of-the-art algorithms: SCAn, ABL, and AGPD.

Motivation: 工业物联网环境中，传统解释方法忽视时间结构，导致解释不精确或不可操作。

Result: 在SWaT数据集上，ShaTS能准确识别关键时间点、受影响的传感器和执行器，并在解释性和资源效率上优于SHAP。

Conclusion: ShaTS满足工业环境的实时需求，提供更精确和可操作的解释。

Abstract: Industrial Internet of Things environments increasingly rely on advanced
Anomaly Detection and explanation techniques to rapidly detect and mitigate
cyberincidents, thereby ensuring operational safety. The sequential nature of
data collected from these environments has enabled improvements in Anomaly
Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models by processing time
windows rather than treating the data as tabular. However, conventional
explanation methods often neglect this temporal structure, leading to imprecise
or less actionable explanations. This work presents ShaTS (Shapley values for
Time Series models), which is a model-agnostic explainable Artificial
Intelligence method designed to enhance the precision of Shapley value
explanations for time series models. ShaTS addresses the shortcomings of
traditional approaches by incorporating an a priori feature grouping strategy
that preserves temporal dependencies and produces both coherent and actionable
insights. Experiments conducted on the SWaT dataset demonstrate that ShaTS
accurately identifies critical time instants, precisely pinpoints the sensors,
actuators, and processes affected by anomalies, and outperforms SHAP in terms
of both explainability and resource efficiency, fulfilling the real-time
requirements of industrial environments.

Motivation: 现有超图生成方法仅关注拓扑结构，忽略了特征建模，而实际应用中需要同时处理拓扑和特征。

Method: FAHNES通过节点粗化和局部扩展重建超图，利用节点预算机制控制簇分裂。

Result: 在合成超图、3D网格和分子数据集上，FAHNES在拓扑和特征重建方面表现优异。

Conclusion: FAHNES为特征超图生成建模奠定了基础，具有未来研究潜力。

Abstract: Hypergraphs generalize traditional graphs by allowing hyperedges to connect
multiple nodes, making them well-suited for modeling complex structures with
higher-order relationships, such as 3D meshes, molecular systems, and
electronic circuits. While topology is central to hypergraph structure, many
real-world applications also require node and hyperedge features. Existing
hypergraph generation methods focus solely on topology, often overlooking
feature modeling. In this work, we introduce FAHNES (feature-aware hypergraph
generation via next-scale prediction), a hierarchical approach that jointly
generates hypergraph topology and features. FAHNES builds a multi-scale
representation through node coarsening, then learns to reconstruct finer levels
via localized expansion and refinement, guided by a new node budget mechanism
that controls cluster splitting. We evaluate FAHNES on synthetic hypergraphs,
3D meshes, and molecular datasets. FAHNES achieves competitive results in
reconstructing topology and features, establishing a foundation for future
research in featured hypergraph generative modeling.

Abstract: Understanding the interaction between different drugs (drug-drug interaction

overlooking multimodal data that reflect complex drug mechanisms. In this
paper, we (1) introduce MUDI, a large-scale Multimodal biomedical dataset for

multimodal representation of drugs by combining pharmacological text, chemical
formulas, molecular structure graphs, and images across 310,532 annotated drug
pairs labeled as Synergism, Antagonism, or New Effect. Crucially, to
effectively evaluate machine-learning based generalization, MUDI consists of
unseen drug pairs in the test set. We evaluate benchmark models using both late
fusion voting and intermediate fusion strategies. All data, annotations,
evaluation scripts, and baselines are released under an open research license.

Motivation: 现有ASLC方法通常将音乐分类为有限类别并映射到预定义灯光模式，导致结果单调且缺乏合理性。

Method: 修改BART模型，以音频音乐为输入，输出灯光色调和强度，并引入新的跳跃连接机制以增强音乐与灯光之间的关系。

Result: Skip-BART在定量分析和人类评估中优于传统基于规则的方法，且与真实灯光工程师的差距较小（p值为0.72）。

Conclusion: Skip-BART在ASLC任务中表现优异，接近人类灯光工程师水平，相关数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Stage lighting plays an essential role in live music performances,
influencing the engaging experience of both musicians and audiences. Given the
high costs associated with hiring or training professional lighting engineers,
Automatic Stage Lighting Control (ASLC) has gained increasing attention.
However, most existing approaches only classify music into limited categories
and map them to predefined light patterns, resulting in formulaic and
monotonous outcomes that lack rationality. To address this issue, this paper
presents an end-to-end solution that directly learns from experienced lighting
engineers -- Skip-BART. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
conceptualize ASLC as a generative task rather than merely a classification
problem. Our method modifies the BART model to take audio music as input and
produce light hue and value (intensity) as output, incorporating a novel skip
connection mechanism to enhance the relationship between music and light within
the frame grid.We validate our method through both quantitative analysis and an
human evaluation, demonstrating that Skip-BART outperforms conventional
rule-based methods across all evaluation metrics and shows only a limited gap
compared to real lighting engineers.Specifically, our method yields a p-value
of 0.72 in a statistical comparison based on human evaluations with human
lighting engineers, suggesting that the proposed approach closely matches human
lighting engineering performance. To support further research, we have made our
self-collected dataset, code, and trained model parameters available at

Conclusion: 密度-比率相关函数与crbSMOGN采样技术的组合在神经网络中表现最佳，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Data imbalance persists as a pervasive challenge in regression tasks,
introducing bias in model performance and undermining predictive reliability.
This is particularly detrimental in applications aimed at predicting rare
events that fall outside the domain of the bulk of the training data. In this
study, we review the current state-of-the-art regarding sampling-based methods
and cost-sensitive learning. Additionally, we propose novel approaches to
mitigate model bias. To better asses the importance of data, we introduce the
density-distance and density-ratio relevance functions, which effectively
integrate empirical frequency of data with domain-specific preferences,
offering enhanced interpretability for end-users. Furthermore, we present
advanced mitigation techniques (cSMOGN and crbSMOGN), which build upon and
improve existing sampling methods. In a comprehensive quantitative evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 10 synthetic and 42 real-world
datasets, using neural networks, XGBoosting trees and Random Forest models. Our
analysis reveals that while most strategies improve performance on rare
samples, they often degrade it on frequent ones. We demonstrate that
constructing an ensemble of models -- one trained with imbalance mitigation and
another without -- can significantly reduce these negative effects. The key
findings underscore the superior performance of our novel crbSMOGN sampling
technique with the density-ratio relevance function for neural networks,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CASD策略有效提升了多模态情感分析的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human sentiment
through multimodal data. In real-world scenarios, practical factors often lead
to uncertain modality missingness. Existing methods for handling modality
missingness are based on data reconstruction or common subspace projections.
However, these methods neglect the confidence in multimodal combinations and
impose constraints on intra-class representation, hindering the capture of
modality-specific information and resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Self-Distillation
(CASD) strategy that effectively incorporates multimodal probabilistic
embeddings via a mixture of Student's $t$-distributions, enhancing its
robustness by incorporating confidence and accommodating heavy-tailed
properties. This strategy estimates joint distributions with uncertainty scores
and reduces uncertainty in the student network by consistency distillation.
Furthermore, we introduce a reparameterization representation module that
facilitates CASD in robust multimodal learning by sampling embeddings from the
joint distribution for the prediction module to calculate the task loss. As a
result, the directional constraint from the loss minimization is alleviated by
the sampled representation. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Learning population dynamics involves recovering the underlying process that
governs particle evolution, given evolutionary snapshots of samples at discrete
time points. Recent methods frame this as an energy minimization problem in
probability space and leverage the celebrated JKO scheme for efficient time
discretization. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{iJKOnet}$, an approach that
combines the JKO framework with inverse optimization techniques to learn
population dynamics. Our method relies on a conventional $\textit{end-to-end}$
adversarial training procedure and does not require restrictive architectural
choices, e.g., input-convex neural networks. We establish theoretical
guarantees for our methodology and demonstrate improved performance over prior
JKO-based methods.

Result: 对称选择方法在性能几乎无损的情况下减少对目标标签的依赖。

Conclusion: 该方法为未转录音频数据的蒸馏提供了潜在可能。

Abstract: With the rise of large pre-trained foundation models for automatic speech
recognition new challenges appear. While the performance of these models is
good, runtime and cost of inference increases. One approach to make use of
their strength while retaining efficiency is to distill their knowledge to
smaller models during training. In this work, we explore different CTC-based
distillation variants, focusing on blank token handling. We show that common
approaches like blank elimination do not always work off the shelf. We explore
new blank selection patterns as a potential sweet spot between standard
knowledge distillation and blank elimination mechanisms. Through the
introduction of a symmetric selection method, we are able to remove the CTC
loss during knowledge distillation with minimal to no performance degradation.
With this, we make the training independent from target labels, potentially
allowing for distillation on untranscribed audio data.

Result: 在图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了模型似然。

Conclusion: 正则化的FIF方法有效提升了VAE的后验表示能力，且计算成本可控。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models widely used
for learning interpretable latent spaces, quantifying uncertainty, and
compressing data for downstream generative tasks. VAEs typically rely on
diagonal Gaussian posteriors due to computational constraints. Using arguments
grounded in differential geometry, we demonstrate inherent limitations in the
representational capacity of diagonal covariance VAEs, as illustrated by
explicit low-dimensional examples. In response, we show that a regularized
variant of the recently introduced Free-form Injective Flow (FIF) can be
interpreted as a VAE featuring a highly flexible, implicitly defined posterior.
Crucially, this regularization yields a posterior equivalent to a full Gaussian
covariance distribution, yet maintains computational costs comparable to
standard diagonal covariance VAEs. Experiments on image datasets validate our
approach, demonstrating that incorporating full covariance substantially
improves model likelihood.

Abstract: Alignment via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become
the dominant paradigm for controlling the quality of outputs from large
language models (LLMs). However, when viewed as `loss + regularization,' the
standard RLHF objective lacks theoretical justification and incentivizes
degenerate, deterministic solutions, an issue that variants such as Direct
Policy Optimization (DPO) also inherit. In this paper, we rethink alignment by
framing it as \emph{distribution learning} from pairwise preference feedback by
explicitly modeling how information about the target language model bleeds
through the preference data. This explicit modeling leads us to propose three
principled learning objectives: preference maximum likelihood estimation,
preference distillation, and reverse KL minimization. We theoretically show
that all three approaches enjoy strong non-asymptotic $O(1/n)$ convergence to
the target language model, naturally avoiding degeneracy and reward
overfitting. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our distribution learning
framework, especially preference distillation, consistently outperforms or
matches the performances of RLHF and DPO across various tasks and models.

Abstract: Learning meaningful abstract models of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is
crucial for improving generalization from limited data. In this work, we show
how geometric priors can be imposed on the low-dimensional representation
manifold of a learned transition model. We incorporate known symmetric
structures via appropriate choices of the latent space and the associated group
actions, which encode prior knowledge about invariances in the environment. In
addition, our framework allows the embedding of additional unstructured
information alongside these symmetries. We show experimentally that this leads
to better predictions of the latent transition model than fully unstructured
approaches, as well as better learning on downstream RL tasks, in environments
with rotational and translational features, including in first-person views of
3D environments. Additionally, our experiments show that this leads to simpler
and more disentangled representations. The full code is available on GitHub to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学治疗常影响多个相互依赖的结果，而现有机器学习方法多聚焦于单结果预测，无法满足临床需求。

Method: DIME通过因果掩码和条件分布分解，学习多维结果的联合干预分布，支持混合类型数据并捕获结果间的依赖结构。

Result: 实验表明DIME能有效学习联合分布并捕捉多结果间的共享信息。

Conclusion: DIME是首个针对医学治疗多结果联合分布的神经方法，为临床决策提供了更全面的不确定性量化。

Abstract: In medicine, treatments often influence multiple, interdependent outcomes,
such as primary endpoints, complications, adverse events, or other secondary
endpoints. Hence, to make optimal treatment decisions, clinicians are
interested in learning the distribution of multi-dimensional treatment
outcomes. However, the vast majority of machine learning methods for predicting
treatment effects focus on single-outcome settings, despite the fact that
medical data often include multiple, interdependent outcomes. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based method called DIME to learn the
joint distribution of multiple outcomes of medical treatments. We addresses
three challenges relevant in medical practice: (i)it is tailored to learn the
joint interventional distribution of multiple medical outcomes, which enables
reliable decision-making with uncertainty quantification rather than relying
solely on point estimates; (ii)it explicitly captures the dependence structure
between outcomes; (iii)it can handle outcomes of mixed type, including binary,
categorical, and continuous variables. In DIME, we take into account the
fundamental problem of causal inference through causal masking. For training,
our method decomposes the joint distribution into a series of conditional
distributions with a customized conditional masking to account for the
dependence structure across outcomes. For inference, our method
auto-regressively generates predictions. This allows our method to move beyond
point estimates of causal quantities and thus learn the joint interventional
distribution. To the best of our knowledge, DIME is the first neural method
tailored to learn the joint, multi-outcome distribution of medical treatments.
Across various experiments, we demonstrate that our method effectively learns
the joint distribution and captures shared information among multiple outcomes.

Abstract: This paper explores the challenges and benefits of a trainable destruction
process in diffusion samplers -- diffusion-based generative models trained to
sample an unnormalised density without access to data samples. Contrary to the
majority of work that views diffusion samplers as approximations to an
underlying continuous-time model, we view diffusion models as discrete-time
policies trained to produce samples in very few generation steps. We propose to
trade some of the elegance of the underlying theory for flexibility in the
definition of the generative and destruction policies. In particular, we
decouple the generation and destruction variances, enabling both transition
kernels to be learned as unconstrained Gaussian densities. We show that, when
the number of steps is limited, training both generation and destruction
processes results in faster convergence and improved sampling quality on
various benchmarks. Through a robust ablation study, we investigate the design
choices necessary to facilitate stable training. Finally, we show the
scalability of our approach through experiments on GAN latent space sampling
for conditional image generation.

Abstract: We introduce Temporal Variational Implicit Neural Representations (TV-INRs),
a probabilistic framework for modeling irregular multivariate time series that
enables efficient individualized imputation and forecasting. By integrating
implicit neural representations with latent variable models, TV-INRs learn
distributions over time-continuous generator functions conditioned on
signal-specific covariates. Unlike existing approaches that require extensive
training, fine-tuning or meta-learning, our method achieves accurate
individualized predictions through a single forward pass. Our experiments
demonstrate that with a single TV-INRs instance, we can accurately solve
diverse imputation and forecasting tasks, offering a computationally efficient
and scalable solution for real-world applications. TV-INRs excel especially in
low-data regimes, where it outperforms existing methods by an order of

Result: 基于记忆的方法显著优于其他方法，遗忘损失约为7%。

Conclusion: 基于记忆的方法是流式优化场景中增量学习的可行方案。

Abstract: Algorithm selection is commonly used to predict the best solver from a
portfolio per per-instance. In many real scenarios, instances arrive in a
stream: new instances become available over time, while the number of class
labels can also grow as new data distributions arrive downstream. As a result,
the classification model needs to be periodically updated to reflect additional
solvers without catastrophic forgetting of past data. In machine-learning (ML),
this is referred to as Class Incremental Learning (CIL). While commonly
addressed in ML settings, its relevance to algorithm-selection in optimisation
has not been previously studied. Using a bin-packing dataset, we benchmark 8
continual learning methods with respect to their ability to withstand
catastrophic forgetting. We find that rehearsal-based methods significantly
outperform other CIL methods. While there is evidence of forgetting, the loss
is small at around 7%. Hence, these methods appear to be a viable approach to
continual learning in streaming optimisation scenarios.

Abstract: Hierarchical classification offers an approach to incorporate the concept of
mistake severity by leveraging a structured, labeled hierarchy. However,
decoding in such settings frequently relies on heuristic decision rules, which
may not align with task-specific evaluation metrics. In this work, we propose a
framework for the optimal decoding of an output probability distribution with
respect to a target metric. We derive optimal decision rules for increasingly
complex prediction settings, providing universal algorithms when candidates are
limited to the set of nodes. In the most general case of predicting a subset of
nodes, we focus on rules dedicated to the hierarchical $hF_{\beta}$ scores,
tailored to hierarchical settings. To demonstrate the practical utility of our
approach, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations, showcasing the
superiority of our proposed optimal strategies, particularly in underdetermined
scenarios. These results highlight the potential of our methods to enhance the
performance and reliability of hierarchical classifiers in real-world
applications. The code is available at

Result: 验证了softmax动态在压缩表示和提升分布外数据性能中的作用，展示了温度调优的广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对softmax机制的新见解，有助于更好地控制深度神经网络中的表示学习。

Abstract: The softmax function is a fundamental building block of deep neural networks,
commonly used to define output distributions in classification tasks or
attention weights in transformer architectures. Despite its widespread use and
proven effectiveness, its influence on learning dynamics and learned
representations remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to optimize
model behavior. In this paper, we study the pivotal role of the softmax
function in shaping the model's representation. We introduce the concept of
rank deficit bias - a phenomenon in which softmax-based deep networks find
solutions of rank much lower than the number of classes. This bias depends on
the softmax function's logits norm, which is implicitly influenced by
hyperparameters or directly modified by softmax temperature. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how to exploit the softmax dynamics to learn compressed
representations or to enhance their performance on out-of-distribution data. We
validate our findings across diverse architectures and real-world datasets,
highlighting the broad applicability of temperature tuning in improving model
performance. Our work provides new insights into the mechanisms of softmax,
enabling better control over representation learning in deep neural networks.

Conclusion: 课程学习能有效改进多样性优化，尤其在复杂任务中。

Abstract: Being able to solve a task in diverse ways makes agents more robust to task
variations and less prone to local optima. In this context, constrained
diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing
constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as
robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve
diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first
explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our
empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of
skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our
curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.

Abstract: This paper introduces a topological framework for interpreting the internal
representations of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We construct a simplicial
tower, a sequence of simplicial complexes connected by simplicial maps, that
captures how data topology evolves across network layers. Our approach enables
bi-persistence analysis: layer persistence tracks topological features within
each layer across scales, while MLP persistence reveals how these features
transform through the network. We prove stability theorems for our topological
descriptors and establish that linear separability in latent spaces is related
to disconnected components in the nerve complexes. To make our framework
practical, we develop a combinatorial algorithm for computing MLP persistence
and introduce trajectory-based visualisations that track data flow through the
network. Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical data demonstrate our
method's ability to identify redundant layers, reveal critical topological
transitions, and provide interpretable insights into how MLPs progressively
organise data for classification.

allows full-width key and query matrices, aligning more closely with practical
transformers. Using tools from statistical mechanics and random matrix theory,
we derive closed-form predictions for Bayes-optimal generalization error and
identify sharp phase transitions as a function of sample complexity, model
width, and sequence length. We propose a matching approximate message passing

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly embedded into society through
high-stakes decision-making, selecting the right algorithm for a given task,
audience, and sector presents a critical challenge, particularly in the context
of fairness. Traditional assessments of model fairness have often framed
fairness as an objective mathematical property, treating model selection as an
optimization problem under idealized informational conditions. This overlooks
model multiplicity as a consideration--that multiple models can deliver similar
performance while exhibiting different fairness characteristics. Legal scholars
have engaged this challenge through the concept of Less Discriminatory
Algorithms (LDAs), which frames model selection as a civil rights obligation.
In real-world deployment, this normative challenge is bounded by constraints on
fairness experimentation, e.g., regulatory standards, institutional priorities,
and resource capacity.
  Against these considerations, the paper revisits Lee and Floridi (2021)'s
relational fairness approach using updated 2021 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
(HMDA) data, and proposes an expansion of the scope of the LDA search process.
We argue that extending the LDA search horizontally, considering fairness
across model families themselves, provides a lightweight complement, or
alternative, to within-model hyperparameter optimization, when operationalizing
fairness in non-experimental, resource constrained settings. Fairness metrics
alone offer useful, but insufficient signals to accurately evaluate candidate
LDAs. Rather, by using a horizontal LDA search approach with the relational
trade-off framework, we demonstrate a responsible minimum viable LDA search on
real-world lending outcomes. Organizations can modify this approach to
systematically compare, evaluate, and select LDAs that optimize fairness and
accuracy in a sector-based contextualized manner.

Abstract: Temporal graph learning has applications in recommendation systems, traffic
forecasting, and social network analysis. Although multiple architectures have
been introduced, progress in positional encoding for temporal graphs remains
limited. Extending static Laplacian eigenvector approaches to temporal graphs
through the supra-Laplacian has shown promise, but also poses key challenges:
high eigendecomposition costs, limited theoretical understanding, and ambiguity
about when and how to apply these encodings. In this paper, we address these
issues by (1) offering a theoretical framework that connects supra-Laplacian
encodings to per-time-slice encodings, highlighting the benefits of leveraging
additional temporal connectivity, (2) introducing novel methods to reduce the
computational overhead, achieving up to 56x faster runtimes while scaling to
graphs with 50,000 active nodes, and (3) conducting an extensive experimental
study to identify which models, tasks, and datasets benefit most from these
encodings. Our findings reveal that while positional encodings can
significantly boost performance in certain scenarios, their effectiveness
varies across different models.

Conclusion: Policy Newton in RKHS成功地将二阶优化方法引入RKHS中的强化学习策略优化，填补了研究空白并展示了实际优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies represented in Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) offer powerful representational capabilities. While
second-order optimization methods like Newton's method demonstrate faster
convergence than first-order approaches, current RKHS-based policy optimization
remains constrained to first-order techniques. This limitation stems primarily
from the intractability of explicitly computing and inverting the
infinite-dimensional Hessian operator in RKHS. We introduce Policy Newton in
RKHS, the first second-order optimization framework specifically designed for
RL policies represented in RKHS. Our approach circumvents direct computation of
the inverse Hessian operator by optimizing a cubic regularized auxiliary
objective function. Crucially, we leverage the Representer Theorem to transform
this infinite-dimensional optimization into an equivalent, computationally
tractable finite-dimensional problem whose dimensionality scales with the
trajectory data volume. We establish theoretical guarantees proving convergence
to a local optimum with a local quadratic convergence rate. Empirical
evaluations on a toy financial asset allocation problem validate these
theoretical properties, while experiments on standard RL benchmarks demonstrate
that Policy Newton in RKHS achieves superior convergence speed and higher
episodic rewards compared to established first-order RKHS approaches and
parametric second-order methods. Our work bridges a critical gap between
non-parametric policy representations and second-order optimization methods in
reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Neural operators, which aim to approximate mappings between
infinite-dimensional function spaces, have been widely applied in the
simulation and prediction of physical systems. However, the limited
representational capacity of network architectures, combined with their heavy
reliance on large-scale data, often hinder effective training and result in
poor extrapolation performance. In this paper, inspired by traditional
numerical methods, we propose a novel physics guided multi-step neural operator
(PMNO) architecture to address these challenges in long-horizon prediction of
complex physical systems. Distinct from general operator learning methods, the
PMNO framework replaces the single-step input with multi-step historical data
in the forward pass and introduces an implicit time-stepping scheme based on
the Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) during backpropagation. This design
not only strengthens the model's extrapolation capacity but also facilitates
more efficient and stable training with fewer data samples, especially for
long-term predictions. Meanwhile, a causal training strategy is employed to
circumvent the need for multi-stage training and to ensure efficient end-to-end
optimization. The neural operator architecture possesses resolution-invariant
properties, enabling the trained model to perform fast extrapolation on
arbitrary spatial resolutions. We demonstrate the superior predictive
performance of PMNO predictor across a diverse range of physical systems,
including 2D linear system, modeling over irregular domain, complex-valued wave
dynamics, and reaction-diffusion processes. Depending on the specific problem
setting, various neural operator architectures, including FNO, DeepONet, and
their variants, can be seamlessly integrated into the PMNO framework.

Abstract: Neural models learn representations of high-dimensional data on
low-dimensional manifolds. Multiple factors, including stochasticities in the
training process, model architectures, and additional inductive biases, may
induce different representations, even when learning the same task on the same
data. However, it has recently been shown that when a latent structure is
shared between distinct latent spaces, relative distances between
representations can be preserved, up to distortions. Building on this idea, we
demonstrate that exploiting the differential-geometric structure of latent
spaces of neural models, it is possible to capture precisely the
transformations between representational spaces trained on similar data
distributions. Specifically, we assume that distinct neural models parametrize
approximately the same underlying manifold, and introduce a representation
based on the pullback metric that captures the intrinsic structure of the
latent space, while scaling efficiently to large models. We validate
experimentally our method on model stitching and retrieval tasks, covering
autoencoders and vision foundation discriminative models, across diverse
architectures, datasets, and pretraining schemes.

Result: 显著减少跨分片通信开销，提升吞吐量和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法有效解决了UTXO分片中的通信瓶颈问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces a Machine Learning (ML) approach for scalability of
UTXO-based blockchains, such as Bitcoin. Prior approaches to UTXO set sharding
struggle with distributing UTXOs effectively across validators, creating
substantial communication overhead due to child-parent transaction
dependencies. This overhead, which arises from the need to locate parent UTXOs,
significantly hampers transaction processing speeds. Our solution uses ML to
optimize not only UTXO set sharding but also the routing of incoming
transactions, ensuring that transactions are directed to shards containing
their parent UTXOs. At the heart of our approach is a framework that combines
contrastive and unsupervised learning to create an embedding space for
transaction outputs. This embedding allows the model to group transaction
outputs based on spending relationships, making it possible to route
transactions efficiently to the correct validation microservices. Trained on
historical transaction data with triplet loss and online semi-hard negative
mining, the model embeds parent-child spending patterns directly into its
parameters, thus eliminating the need for costly, real-time parent transaction
lookups. This significantly reduces cross-shard communication overhead,
boosting throughput and scalability.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种在存在未知且可能变化的对抗性扰动下的高斯过程优化方法，目标是满足预设性能阈值τ，而非传统的最坏情况优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒优化方法关注最坏情况下的性能最大化，而本文提出了一种鲁棒满足性目标，旨在在对抗条件下持续达到预设性能阈值τ。

Method: 提出了两种基于不同鲁棒满足性表述的新算法，并证明它们是通用鲁棒满足性框架的实例。

Result: 推导了两个遗憾界：一个在特定条件下随时间次线性增长，另一个与扰动幅度相关但无需对对手做假设。实验表明，该方法在满足性目标上优于现有鲁棒优化方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的鲁棒满足性框架在对抗性扰动下表现优异，特别是在鲁棒优化框架的模糊集不准确时。

Abstract: We address the problem of Gaussian Process (GP) optimization in the presence
of unknown and potentially varying adversarial perturbations. Unlike
traditional robust optimization approaches that focus on maximizing performance
under worst-case scenarios, we consider a robust satisficing objective, where
the goal is to consistently achieve a predefined performance threshold $\tau$,
even under adversarial conditions. We propose two novel algorithms based on
distinct formulations of robust satisficing, and show that they are instances
of a general robust satisficing framework. Further, each algorithm offers
different guarantees depending on the nature of the adversary. Specifically, we
derive two regret bounds: one that is sublinear over time, assuming certain
conditions on the adversary and the satisficing threshold $\tau$, and another
that scales with the perturbation magnitude but requires no assumptions on the
adversary. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the established robust optimization methods in achieving the
satisficing objective, particularly when the ambiguity set of the robust
optimization framework is inaccurately specified.

*Zehao Wu,Yanjie Zhao,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: TensorGuard是一个基于梯度的指纹框架，用于检测LLM的相似性和家族分类，解决了模型衍生和授权验证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的衍生模型缺乏有效的溯源和授权验证机制，导致开源模型（如LLaMA）的命名约定和授权要求难以执行。

Method: 通过分析梯度响应生成模型行为签名，构建高维指纹，支持相似性评估和家族分类。

Result: 实验显示，TensorGuard在58个模型上实现了94%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: TensorGuard为LLM的溯源和授权验证提供了有效的技术手段。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral software components in modern
applications, unauthorized model derivations through fine-tuning, merging, and
redistribution have emerged as critical software engineering challenges. Unlike
traditional software where clone detection and license compliance are
well-established, the LLM ecosystem lacks effective mechanisms to detect model
lineage and enforce licensing agreements. This gap is particularly problematic
when open-source model creators, such as Meta's LLaMA, require derivative works
to maintain naming conventions for attribution, yet no technical means exist to
verify compliance.
  To fill this gap, treating LLMs as software artifacts requiring provenance
tracking, we present TensorGuard, a gradient-based fingerprinting framework for
LLM similarity detection and family classification. Our approach extracts
model-intrinsic behavioral signatures by analyzing gradient responses to random
input perturbations across tensor layers, operating independently of training
data, watermarks, or specific model formats. TensorGuard supports the
widely-adopted safetensors format and constructs high-dimensional fingerprints
through statistical analysis of gradient features. These fingerprints enable
two complementary capabilities: direct pairwise similarity assessment between
arbitrary models through distance computation, and systematic family
classification of unknown models via the K-Means clustering algorithm with
domain-informed centroid initialization using known base models. Experimental
evaluation on 58 models comprising 8 base models and 50 derivatives across five
model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, Mistral) demonstrates 94%
classification accuracy under our centroid-initialized K-Means clustering.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出Bidirectional SAC算法，结合正向和反向KL散度的优势，显著提升了SAC的性能和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SAC算法使用反向KL散度进行策略更新，存在不稳定性和样本效率低的问题，而正向KL散度可以提供显式最优投影策略。

Method: 提出Bidirectional SAC，先使用正向KL散度初始化策略，再通过反向KL散度优化，结合两者的优势。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，Bidirectional SAC比标准SAC和其他基线方法表现更好，奖励提升高达30%，样本效率更高。

Conclusion: Bidirectional SAC通过结合正向和反向KL散度，显著提升了SAC的性能和实用性。

Abstract: The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, a state-of-the-art method in maximum
entropy reinforcement learning, traditionally relies on minimizing reverse
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for policy updates. However, this approach
leads to an intractable optimal projection policy, necessitating gradient-based
approximations that can suffer from instability and poor sample efficiency.
This paper investigates the alternative use of forward KL divergence within
SAC. We demonstrate that for Gaussian policies, forward KL divergence yields an
explicit optimal projection policy -- corresponding to the mean and variance of
the target Boltzmann distribution's action marginals. Building on the distinct
advantages of both KL directions, we propose Bidirectional SAC, an algorithm
that first initializes the policy using the explicit forward KL projection and
then refines it by optimizing the reverse KL divergence. Comprehensive
experiments on continuous control benchmarks show that Bidirectional SAC
significantly outperforms standard SAC and other baselines, achieving up to a
$30\%$ increase in episodic rewards, alongside enhanced sample efficiency.

Result: 证明传统神经网络无法检测潜在聚类结构，而MoE能通过专家模型分解问题为更简单的子任务。

Conclusion: MoE在非线性回归任务中具有显著优势，能有效处理复杂问题。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE), an ensemble of specialized models equipped with a
router that dynamically distributes each input to appropriate experts, has
achieved successful results in the field of machine learning. However,
theoretical understanding of this architecture is falling behind due to its
inherent complexity. In this paper, we theoretically study the sample and
runtime complexity of MoE following the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) when
learning a regression task with an underlying cluster structure of single index
models. On the one hand, we prove that a vanilla neural network fails in
detecting such a latent organization as it can only process the problem as a
whole. This is intrinsically related to the concept of information exponent
which is low for each cluster, but increases when we consider the entire task.
On the other hand, we show that a MoE succeeds in dividing this problem into
easier subproblems by leveraging the ability of each expert to weakly recover
the simpler function corresponding to an individual cluster. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is among the first to explore the benefits of the MoE
framework by examining its SGD dynamics in the context of nonlinear regression.

Result: 在两个经典控制任务上的实验表明，保障训练不会影响性能。

Conclusion: 成功开发了首个适用于基于解析梯度的强化学习的有效保障方法。

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical applications requires safety
guarantees. Provably safe reinforcement learning is an active field of research
which aims to provide such guarantees using safeguards. These safeguards should
be integrated during training to prevent a large sim-to-real gap. While there
are several approaches for safeguarding sampling-based reinforcement learning,
analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning often achieves superior
performance and sample efficiency. However, there is no safeguarding approach
for this learning paradigm yet. Our work addresses this gap by developing the
first effective safeguard for analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning.
We analyse existing, differentiable safeguards, adapt them through modified
mappings and gradient formulations, and integrate them with a state-of-the-art
learning algorithm and a differentiable simulation. We evaluate how different
safeguards affect policy optimisation using numerical experiments on two
classical control tasks. The results demonstrate safeguarded training without
compromising performance.

Result: 提升了控制信号的兼容性，使无声控制信号区域的生成更自由和谐。

Conclusion: Minimal Impact ControlNet有效解决了多控制信号冲突问题，提升了图像生成质量。

Abstract: With the advancement of diffusion models, there is a growing demand for
high-quality, controllable image generation, particularly through methods that
utilize one or multiple control signals based on ControlNet. However, in
current ControlNet training, each control is designed to influence all areas of
an image, which can lead to conflicts when different control signals are
expected to manage different parts of the image in practical applications. This
issue is especially pronounced with edge-type control conditions, where regions
lacking boundary information often represent low-frequency signals, referred to
as silent control signals. When combining multiple ControlNets, these silent
control signals can suppress the generation of textures in related areas,
resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address this problem, we propose Minimal
Impact ControlNet. Our approach mitigates conflicts through three key
strategies: constructing a balanced dataset, combining and injecting feature
signals in a balanced manner, and addressing the asymmetry in the score
function's Jacobian matrix induced by ControlNet. These improvements enhance
the compatibility of control signals, allowing for freer and more harmonious
generation in areas with silent control signals.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自适应算法在重尾损失下的遗憾界限中，低阶项可能主导整体性能，尤其在损失范围未知时表现不佳。

Method: 开发无需损失范围或二阶矩先验知识的自适应算法，避免低阶项对遗憾的负面影响。

Result: 提出算法在最坏情况下保证O(√(θTlog(K)))遗憾，独立同分布损失下保证O(θlog(KT)/Δ_min)遗憾。

Conclusion: 新算法显著改进了重尾损失下的遗憾界限，尤其在平方损失下表现更优。

Abstract: We consider the problem setting of prediction with expert advice with
possibly heavy-tailed losses, i.e.\ the only assumption on the losses is an
upper bound on their second moments, denoted by $\theta$. We develop adaptive
algorithms that do not require any prior knowledge about the range or the
second moment of the losses. Existing adaptive algorithms have what is
typically considered a lower-order term in their regret guarantees. We show
that this lower-order term, which is often the maximum of the losses, can
actually dominate the regret bound in our setting. Specifically, we show that
even with small constant $\theta$, this lower-order term can scale as
$\sqrt{KT}$, where $K$ is the number of experts and $T$ is the time horizon. We
propose adaptive algorithms with improved regret bounds that avoid the
dependence on such a lower-order term and guarantee $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\theta
T\log(K)})$ regret in the worst case, and $\mathcal{O}(\theta
\log(KT)/\Delta_{\min})$ regret when the losses are sampled i.i.d.\ from some
fixed distribution, where $\Delta_{\min}$ is the difference between the mean
losses of the second best expert and the best expert. Additionally, when the
loss function is the squared loss, our algorithm also guarantees improved
regret bounds over prior results.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在监督学习中提高了泛化能力，并支持有效的迁移学习。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据稀缺环境下的L2O任务提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Linear and quadratic optimization are crucial in numerous real-world
applications, from training machine learning models to integer-linear
optimization. Recently, learning-to-optimize methods (L2O) for linear (LPs) or
quadratic programs (QPs) using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs)
have gained traction, promising lightweight, data-driven proxies for solving
such optimization problems. For example, they replace the costly computation of
strong branching scores in branch-and-bound solvers, requiring solving many
such optimization problems. However, robust L2O MPNNs remain challenging in
data-scarce settings, especially when addressing complex optimization problems
such as QPs. This work introduces a principled approach to data augmentation
tailored for QPs via MPNNs. Our method leverages theoretically justified data
augmentation techniques to generate diverse yet optimality-preserving
instances. Furthermore, we integrate these augmentations into a self-supervised
learning framework based on contrastive learning, thereby pretraining MPNNs for
enhanced performance on L2O tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves generalization in supervised scenarios and facilitates
effective transfer learning to related optimization problems.

Conclusion: 自动化流形学习框架解决了现有方法的敏感性问题，提高了效率和准确性。

Abstract: The problem of identifying geometric structure in data is a cornerstone of
(unsupervised) learning. As a result, Geometric Representation Learning has
been widely applied across scientific and engineering domains. In this work, we
investigate the use of Geometric Representation Learning for the data-driven
discovery of system dynamics from spatial-temporal data. We propose to encode
similarity structure in such data in a spatial-temporal proximity graph, to
which we apply a range of classical and deep learning-based manifold learning
approaches to learn reduced order dynamics. We observe that while manifold
learning is generally capable of recovering reduced order dynamics, the quality
of the learned representations varies substantially across different algorithms
and hyperparameter choices. This is indicative of high sensitivity to the
inherent geometric assumptions of the respective approaches and suggests a need
for careful hyperparameter tuning, which can be expensive in practise. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a framework for Automated Manifold
Learning, which selects a manifold learning approach and corresponding
hyperparameter choices based on representative subsamples of the input graph.
We demonstrate that the proposed framework leads to performance gains both in
scalability and in the learned representations' accuracy in capturing local and
global geometric features of the underlying system dynamics.

Motivation: 研究FU系统中数据遗忘过程可能引发的隐私风险，特别是恶意服务器利用遗忘更新重建被删除数据的攻击（DRA）。

Method: 提出DRAUN攻击框架，针对优化型遗忘方法，通过理论分析和实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验证明DRAUN能成功重建数据，现有FU方法无法抵御此类攻击。

Conclusion: FU系统需改进以应对DRAUN等隐私攻击，确保数据删除的安全性。

Abstract: Federated Unlearning (FU) enables clients to remove the influence of specific
data from a collaboratively trained shared global model, addressing regulatory
requirements such as GDPR and CCPA. However, this unlearning process introduces
a new privacy risk: A malicious server may exploit unlearning updates to
reconstruct the data requested for removal, a form of Data Reconstruction
Attack (DRA). While DRAs for machine unlearning have been studied extensively
in centralized Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) settings, their
applicability to FU remains unclear due to the decentralized, client-driven
nature of FU. This work presents DRAUN, the first attack framework to
reconstruct unlearned data in FU systems. DRAUN targets optimization-based
unlearning methods, which are widely adopted for their efficiency. We
theoretically demonstrate why existing DRAs targeting machine unlearning in
MLaaS fail in FU and show how DRAUN overcomes these limitations. We validate
our approach through extensive experiments on four datasets and four model
architectures, evaluating its performance against five popular unlearning
methods, effectively demonstrating that state-of-the-art FU methods remain
vulnerable to DRAs.

Conclusion: FedGenGMM适合边缘计算环境，具有灵活性、高效性和隐私保护优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces FedGenGMM, a novel one-shot federated learning approach
for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) tailored for unsupervised learning scenarios.
In federated learning (FL), where multiple decentralized clients
collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, significant challenges
include statistical heterogeneity, high communication costs, and privacy
concerns. FedGenGMM addresses these issues by allowing local GMM models,
trained independently on client devices, to be aggregated through a single
communication round. This approach leverages the generative property of GMMs,
enabling the creation of a synthetic dataset on the server side to train a
global model efficiently. Evaluation across diverse datasets covering image,
tabular, and time series data demonstrates that FedGenGMM consistently achieves
performance comparable to non-federated and iterative federated methods, even
under significant data heterogeneity. Additionally, FedGenGMM significantly
reduces communication overhead, maintains robust performance in anomaly
detection tasks, and offers flexibility in local model complexities, making it
particularly suitable for edge computing environments.

Conclusion: 模型有效提升意图分类准确性，已在沃尔玛客服领域部署，每年节省近百万美元。

Abstract: Customer service chatbots are conversational systems aimed at addressing
customer queries, often by directing them to automated workflows. A crucial
aspect of this process is the classification of the customer's intent.
Presently, most intent classification models for customer care utilise only
customer query for intent prediction. This may result in low-accuracy models,
which cannot handle ambiguous queries. An ambiguous query like "I didn't
receive my package" could indicate a delayed order, or an order that was
delivered but the customer failed to receive it. Resolution of each of these
scenarios requires the execution of very different sequence of steps. Utilizing
additional information, such as the customer's order delivery status, in the
right manner can help identify the intent for such ambiguous queries. In this
paper, we have introduced a context-aware NLU model that incorporates both, the
customer query and contextual information from the customer's order status for
predicting customer intent. A novel selective attention module is used to
extract relevant context features. We have also proposed a multi-task learning
paradigm for the effective utilization of different label types available in
our training data. Our suggested method, Multi-Task Learning Contextual NLU
with Selective Attention Weighted Context (MTL-CNLU-SAWC), yields a 4.8%
increase in top 2 accuracy score over the baseline model which only uses user
queries, and a 3.5% improvement over existing state-of-the-art models that
combine query and context. We have deployed our model to production for
Walmart's customer care domain. Accurate intent prediction through
MTL-CNLU-SAWC helps to better direct customers to automated workflows, thereby
significantly reducing escalations to human agents, leading to almost a million
dollars in yearly savings for the company.

Conclusion: 通过DataRubrics框架和LLM评估方法，可提升数据为中心研究的质量标准。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are fundamental to training and evaluating machine
learning models, yet their creation-especially with accurate human
annotations-remains a significant challenge. Many dataset paper submissions
lack originality, diversity, or rigorous quality control, and these
shortcomings are often overlooked during peer review. Submissions also
frequently omit essential details about dataset construction and properties.
While existing tools such as datasheets aim to promote transparency, they are
largely descriptive and do not provide standardized, measurable methods for
evaluating data quality. Similarly, metadata requirements at conferences
promote accountability but are inconsistently enforced. To address these
limitations, this position paper advocates for the integration of systematic,
rubric-based evaluation metrics into the dataset review process-particularly as
submission volumes continue to grow. We also explore scalable, cost-effective
methods for synthetic data generation, including dedicated tools and
LLM-as-a-judge approaches, to support more efficient evaluation. As a call to
action, we introduce DataRubrics, a structured framework for assessing the
quality of both human- and model-generated datasets. Leveraging recent advances
in LLM-based evaluation, DataRubrics offers a reproducible, scalable, and
actionable solution for dataset quality assessment, enabling both authors and
reviewers to uphold higher standards in data-centric research. We also release
code to support reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations at

Abstract: Signed graphs are equipped with both positive and negative edge weights,
encoding pairwise correlations as well as anti-correlations in data. A balanced
signed graph is a signed graph with no cycles containing an odd number of
negative edges. Laplacian of a balanced signed graph has eigenvectors that map
via a simple linear transform to ones in a corresponding positive graph
Laplacian, thus enabling reuse of spectral filtering tools designed for
positive graphs. We propose an efficient method to learn a balanced signed
graph Laplacian directly from data. Specifically, extending a previous linear
programming (LP) based sparse inverse covariance estimation method called
CLIME, we formulate a new LP problem for each Laplacian column $i$, where the
linear constraints restrict weight signs of edges stemming from node $i$, so
that nodes of same / different polarities are connected by positive / negative
edges. Towards optimal model selection, we derive a suitable CLIME parameter
$\rho$ based on a combination of the Hannan-Quinn information criterion and a
minimum feasibility criterion. We solve the LP problem efficiently by tailoring
a sparse LP method based on ADMM. We theoretically prove local solution
convergence of our proposed iterative algorithm. Extensive experimental results
on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our balanced graph learning
method outperforms competing methods and enables reuse of spectral filters,
wavelets, and graph convolutional nets (GCN) constructed for positive graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 通过修改缓存架构，提高CPU环境下LLM推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于能量消耗、安全性或成本等限制，某些环境下无法使用加速器运行大型模型推理，因此需要优化CPU环境下的推理速度。

Method: 使用Llama.cpp和QWEN模型进行实验，测试不同缓存配置的性能，并输出内存占用跟踪。

Result: 通过实验分析了内存访问模式和性能特征，以确定优化方向。

Conclusion: 优化缓存架构可提升CPU环境下LLM推理速度，为资源受限环境提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning algorithms are shown to be an increasingly valuable tool,
the demand for their access has grown accordingly. Oftentimes, it is infeasible
to run inference with larger models without an accelerator, which may be
unavailable in environments that have constraints such as energy consumption,
security, or cost. To increase the availability of these models, we aim to
improve the LLM inference speed on a CPU-only environment by modifying the
cache architecture. To determine what improvements could be made, we conducted
two experiments using Llama.cpp and the QWEN model: running various cache
configurations and evaluating their performance, and outputting a trace of the
memory footprint. Using these experiments, we investigate the memory access
patterns and performance characteristics to identify potential optimizations.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于基因组谱监督训练的DNA表示学习方法SPACE，优于纯序列预训练，并通过多物种和多谱数据实现了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DNA预训练方法因缺乏基因组谱信息而效果不佳，需结合监督训练提升表示学习能力。

Method: 提出SPACE模型，利用Mixture of Experts (MoE) 捕获多物种和多基因组谱的关系，优化DNA表示。

Result: 实验表明SPACE在多项任务中达到最优性能，验证了监督训练的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合基因组谱监督训练的DNA模型是更强大的表示学习工具。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of unsupervised pre-training paradigms, researchers
have applied these approaches to DNA pre-training. However, we argue that these
approaches alone yield suboptimal results because pure DNA sequences lack
sufficient information, since their functions are regulated by genomic profiles
like chromatin accessibility. Here, we demonstrate that supervised training for
genomic profile prediction serves as a more effective alternative to pure
sequence pre-training. Furthermore, considering the multi-species and
multi-profile nature of genomic profile prediction, we introduce our
$\textbf{S}$pecies-$\textbf{P}$rofile $\textbf{A}$daptive
$\textbf{C}$ollaborative $\textbf{E}$xperts (SPACE) that leverages Mixture of
Experts (MoE) to better capture the relationships between DNA sequences across
different species and genomic profiles, thereby learning more effective DNA
representations. Through extensive experiments across various tasks, our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing that DNA models trained
with supervised genomic profiles serve as powerful DNA representation learners.

TLDR: SmolVLA是一种小型、高效的视觉语言动作模型，显著降低了训练和推理成本，同时保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言动作模型（VLA）通常规模庞大，训练成本高且难以部署，且忽视了社区收集的数据。

Method: 设计SmolVLA，支持单GPU训练和消费级设备部署，并引入异步推理栈以提高响应速度。

Result: SmolVLA在性能和成本上优于大型VLA，适用于仿真和真实机器人任务。

Conclusion: SmolVLA为高效、社区驱动的机器人视觉语言动作模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained on large-scale multimodal datasets
encode rich visual and linguistic knowledge, making them a strong foundation
for robotics. Rather than training robotic policies from scratch, recent
approaches adapt VLMs into vision-language-action (VLA) models that enable
natural language-driven perception and control. However, existing VLAs are
typically massive--often with billions of parameters--leading to high training
costs and limited real-world deployability. Moreover, they rely on academic and
industrial datasets, overlooking the growing availability of
community-collected data from affordable robotic platforms. In this work, we
present SmolVLA, a small, efficient, and community-driven VLA that drastically
reduces both training and inference costs, while retaining competitive
performance. SmolVLA is designed to be trained on a single GPU and deployed on
consumer-grade GPUs or even CPUs. To further improve responsiveness, we
introduce an asynchronous inference stack decoupling perception and action
prediction from action execution, allowing higher control rates with chunked
action generation. Despite its compact size, SmolVLA achieves performance
comparable to VLAs that are 10x larger. We evaluate SmolVLA on a range of both
simulated as well as real-world robotic benchmarks and release all code,
pretrained models, and training data.

Result: 证明了在样本数量有限时，需要记忆Ω(d)比特的训练数据信息，且样本增加时记忆需求以问题特定速率下降。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了Brown et al. (2021)的工作，解决了其下限的局限性，并通过简单学习算法验证了结果。

Abstract: Recent research demonstrated that training large language models involves
memorization of a significant fraction of training data. Such memorization can
lead to privacy violations when training on sensitive user data and thus
motivates the study of data memorization's role in learning. In this work, we
develop a general approach for proving lower bounds on excess data
memorization, that relies on a new connection between strong data processing
inequalities and data memorization. We then demonstrate that several simple and
natural binary classification problems exhibit a trade-off between the number
of samples available to a learning algorithm, and the amount of information
about the training data that a learning algorithm needs to memorize to be
accurate. In particular, $\Omega(d)$ bits of information about the training
data need to be memorized when $O(1)$ $d$-dimensional examples are available,
which then decays as the number of examples grows at a problem-specific rate.
Further, our lower bounds are generally matched (up to logarithmic factors) by
simple learning algorithms. We also extend our lower bounds to more general
mixture-of-clusters models. Our definitions and results build on the work of
Brown et al. (2021) and address several limitations of the lower bounds in
their work.

Result: 发现“容量”指标能有效预测多种压缩格式的参数效率，并提出了改进稀疏-量化格式训练的算法。

Conclusion: 统一的缩放框架适用于多种压缩格式，为模型压缩和性能预测提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws have shaped recent advances in machine learning by enabling
predictable scaling of model performance based on model size, computation, and
data volume. Concurrently, the rise in computational cost for AI has motivated
model compression techniques, notably quantization and sparsification, which
have emerged to mitigate the steep computational demands associated with
large-scale training and inference. This paper investigates the interplay
between scaling laws and compression formats, exploring whether a unified
scaling framework can accurately predict model performance when training occurs
over various compressed representations, such as sparse, scalar-quantized,
sparse-quantized or even vector-quantized formats. Our key contributions
include validating a general scaling law formulation and showing that it is
applicable both individually but also composably across compression types.
Based on this, our main finding is demonstrating both theoretically and
empirically that there exists a simple "capacity" metric -- based on the
representation's ability to fit random Gaussian data -- which can robustly
predict parameter efficiency across multiple compressed representations. On the
practical side, we extend our formulation to directly compare the accuracy
potential of different compressed formats, and to derive better algorithms for
training over sparse-quantized formats.

Result: 以CsPbI3为例，展示了完整的工作流程，并通过材料性质预测验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工具包将显著提升机器学习原子间势能研究的效率。

Abstract: As a machine-learned potential, the neuroevolution potential (NEP) method
features exceptional computational efficiency and has been successfully applied
in materials science. Constructing high-quality training datasets is crucial
for developing accurate NEP models. However, the preparation and screening of
NEP training datasets remain a bottleneck for broader applications due to their
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and resource-intensive nature. In this work,
we have developed NepTrain and NepTrainKit, which are dedicated to initializing
and managing training datasets to generate high-quality training sets while
automating NEP model training. NepTrain is an open-source Python package that
features a bond length filtering method to effectively identify and remove
non-physical structures from molecular dynamics trajectories, thereby ensuring
high-quality training datasets. NepTrainKit is a graphical user interface (GUI)
software designed specifically for NEP training datasets, providing
functionalities for data editing, visualization, and interactive exploration.
It integrates key features such as outlier identification, farthest-point
sampling, non-physical structure detection, and configuration type selection.
The combination of these tools enables users to process datasets more
efficiently and conveniently. Using $\rm CsPbI_3$ as a case study, we
demonstrate the complete workflow for training NEP models with NepTrain and
further validate the models through materials property predictions. We believe
this toolkit will greatly benefit researchers working with machine learning
interatomic potentials.

Abstract: Frugal Machine Learning (FML) refers to the practice of designing Machine
Learning (ML) models that are efficient, cost-effective, and mindful of
resource constraints. This field aims to achieve acceptable performance while
minimizing the use of computational resources, time, energy, and data for both
training and inference. FML strategies can be broadly categorized into input
frugality, learning process frugality, and model frugality, each focusing on
reducing resource consumption at different stages of the ML pipeline. This
chapter explores recent advancements, applications, and open challenges in FML,
emphasizing its importance for smart environments that incorporate edge
computing and IoT devices, which often face strict limitations in bandwidth,
energy, or latency. Technological enablers such as model compression,
energy-efficient hardware, and data-efficient learning techniques are
discussed, along with adaptive methods including parameter regularization,
knowledge distillation, and dynamic architecture design that enable incremental
model updates without full retraining. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive
taxonomy of frugal methods, discusses case studies across diverse domains, and
identifies future research directions to drive innovation in this evolving
field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如强化学习和BAI技术）在表示信息结构或依赖建模假设方面存在不足，ICPE旨在通过深度学习技术实现高效数据探索。

Method: ICPE结合监督学习和强化学习，利用Transformer学习跨任务的潜在结构，无需显式建模假设。

Conclusion: ICPE是一种实用且通用的数据高效探索方法，仅依赖深度学习技术即可实现高性能。

Abstract: In this work, we study the active sequential hypothesis testing problem, also
known as pure exploration, where the goal is to actively control a data
collection process to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis underlying a
decision problem. While relevant across multiple domains, devising adaptive
exploration strategies remains challenging, particularly due to difficulties in
encoding appropriate inductive biases. Existing Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-based methods often underperform when relevant information structures are
inadequately represented, whereas more complex methods, like Best Arm
Identification (BAI) techniques, may be difficult to devise and typically rely
on explicit modeling assumptions. To address these limitations, we introduce
In-Context Pure Exploration (ICPE), an in-context learning approach that uses
Transformers to learn exploration strategies directly from experience. ICPE
combines supervised learning and reinforcement learning to identify and exploit
latent structure across related tasks, without requiring prior assumptions.
Numerical results across diverse synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks
highlight ICPE's capability to achieve robust performance performance in
deterministic, stochastic, and structured settings. These results demonstrate
ICPE's ability to match optimal instance-dependent algorithms using only deep
learning techniques, making it a practical and general approach to
data-efficient exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代单细胞数据集规模庞大，现有数据加载方法存在内存占用高、存储需求增加或随机磁盘访问慢等问题，限制了深度学习模型的训练效率。

Method: scDataset结合块采样和批量获取技术，直接在AnnData文件上操作，无需格式转换，平衡了随机性和I/O效率。

Result: 在Tahoe 100M数据集上，scDataset比AnnLoader快48倍，比HuggingFace Datasets快27倍，比BioNeMo快18倍（单核设置）。

Conclusion: scDataset为研究社区提供了高效的大规模单细胞模型训练工具。

Abstract: Modern single-cell datasets now comprise hundreds of millions of cells,
presenting significant challenges for training deep learning models that
require shuffled, memory-efficient data loading. While the AnnData format is
the community standard for storing single-cell datasets, existing data loading
solutions for AnnData are often inadequate: some require loading all data into
memory, others convert to dense formats that increase storage demands, and many
are hampered by slow random disk access. We present scDataset, a PyTorch
IterableDataset that operates directly on one or more AnnData files without the
need for format conversion. The core innovation is a combination of block
sampling and batched fetching, which together balance randomness and I/O
efficiency. On the Tahoe 100M dataset, scDataset achieves up to a 48$\times$
speed-up over AnnLoader, a 27$\times$ speed-up over HuggingFace Datasets, and
an 18$\times$ speed-up over BioNeMo in single-core settings. These advances
democratize large-scale single-cell model training for the broader research
community.

Result: 揭示了不可知策略学习的统计分离，展示了其能力与局限性。

Conclusion: 为大规模状态空间中强化学习的统计复杂性提供了理论框架和算法设计指导。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated tremendous empirical success
across numerous challenging domains. However, we lack a strong theoretical
understanding of the statistical complexity of RL in environments with large
state spaces, where function approximation is required for sample-efficient
learning. This thesis addresses this gap by rigorously examining the
statistical complexity of RL with function approximation from a learning
theoretic perspective. Departing from a long history of prior work, we consider
the weakest form of function approximation, called agnostic policy learning, in
which the learner seeks to find the best policy in a given class $\Pi$, with no
guarantee that $\Pi$ contains an optimal policy for the underlying task.
  We systematically explore agnostic policy learning along three key axes:
environment access -- how a learner collects data from the environment;
coverage conditions -- intrinsic properties of the underlying MDP measuring the
expansiveness of state-occupancy measures for policies in the class $\Pi$, and
representational conditions -- structural assumptions on the class $\Pi$
itself. Within this comprehensive framework, we (1) design new learning
algorithms with theoretical guarantees and (2) characterize fundamental
performance bounds of any algorithm. Our results reveal significant statistical
separations that highlight the power and limitations of agnostic policy
learning.

Conclusion: 细粒度对齐、注意力融合和韵律建模显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease is
critical for enabling timely clinical intervention and improving patient
outcomes. In this work, we introduce CogniAlign, a multimodal architecture for
Alzheimer's detection that integrates audio and textual modalities, two
non-intrusive sources of information that offer complementary insights into
cognitive health. Unlike prior approaches that fuse modalities at a coarse
level, CogniAlign leverages a word-level temporal alignment strategy that
synchronizes audio embeddings with corresponding textual tokens based on
transcription timestamps. This alignment supports the development of
token-level fusion techniques, enabling more precise cross-modal interactions.
To fully exploit this alignment, we propose a Gated Cross-Attention Fusion
mechanism, where audio features attend over textual representations, guided by
the superior unimodal performance of the text modality. In addition, we
incorporate prosodic cues, specifically interword pauses, by inserting pause
tokens into the text and generating audio embeddings for silent intervals,
further enriching both streams. We evaluate CogniAlign on the ADReSSo dataset,
where it achieves an accuracy of 90.36%, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods. A detailed ablation study confirms the advantages of
our alignment strategy, attention-based fusion, and prosodic modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）规模增大，全参数微调内存需求高，需更高效的方法。

Method: 提出MLorc，直接压缩和重建动量，避免对权重更新矩阵施加固定秩约束，保留全参数微调的训练动态。

Result: MLorc在小秩下性能优于其他内存高效方法，匹配或超越全微调，且不影响时间和内存效率。

Conclusion: MLorc是一种高效且理论收敛保证的训练方法，适用于不同优化器。

Abstract: With increasing size of large language models (LLMs), full-parameter
fine-tuning imposes substantial memory demands. To alleviate this, we propose a
novel memory-efficient training paradigm called Momentum Low-rank compression
(MLorc). By directly compressing and reconstructing momentum rather than
gradients, MLorc avoids imposing a fixed-rank constraint on weight update
matrices and better preserves the training dynamics of full-parameter
fine-tuning, in contrast to existing low-rank approaches such as LoRA and
GaLore. Empirically, MLorc consistently outperforms other memory-efficient
training methods, matches or even exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning
with a small rank (e.g., $r=4$), and generalizes well across different
optimizers -- all while not compromising time or memory efficiency.
Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee for its convergence under
reasonable assumptions.

Conclusion: 该方法在非欧几里得优化中表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This work introduces a hybrid non-Euclidean optimization method which
generalizes gradient norm clipping by combining steepest descent and
conditional gradient approaches. The method achieves the best of both worlds by
establishing a descent property under a generalized notion of
($L_0$,$L_1$)-smoothness. Weight decay is incorporated in a principled manner
by identifying a connection to the Frank-Wolfe short step. In the stochastic
case, we show an order optimal $O(n^{-1/4})$ convergence rate by leveraging a
momentum based gradient estimator. We discuss how to instantiate the algorithms
for deep learning and demonstrate their properties on image classification and

Abstract: Transformer based models have shown remarkable capabilities in sequence
learning across a wide range of tasks, often performing well on specific task
by leveraging input-output examples. Despite their empirical success, a
comprehensive theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In
this work, we investigate the layerwise behavior of Transformers to uncover the
mechanisms underlying their multi-task generalization ability. Taking
explorations on a typical sequence model, i.e, Hidden Markov Models, which are
fundamental to many language tasks, we observe that: first, lower layers of
Transformers focus on extracting feature representations, primarily influenced
by neighboring tokens; second, on the upper layers, features become decoupled,
exhibiting a high degree of time disentanglement. Building on these empirical
insights, we provide theoretical analysis for the expressiveness power of
Transformers. Our explicit constructions align closely with empirical
observations, providing theoretical support for the Transformer's effectiveness
and efficiency on sequence learning across diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理领域尽管推理密集且对现实世界理解至关重要，但学术和工业界关注有限，因此需要高质量数据集和评估方法推动LLMs在该领域的发展。

Method: 通过精心设计的流程从100多本教科书中筛选问题，构建涵盖五大物理领域和不同难度级别的数据集，并提供训练数据和推理路径。同时提出Rule+Model评估框架以解决现有评估偏差问题。

Result: 评估显示当前最先进的模型在处理物理任务时存在局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on advanced
reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding competitions. Meanwhile,
physics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world
understanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper
introduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems
spanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue.
Specifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through
a carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics
domains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern
Physics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to
graduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and
evaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset
into training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful
reasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In
addition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks
exhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in
physics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model
evaluation framework tailored to physics problems. Our evaluations on current
state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models highlight the limitations
of current models in handling physics-related tasks. We hope that our dataset
and evaluation methodology will jointly advance the development of LLMs in the
field of physics.

TLDR: 本文研究了过程奖励模型（PRMs）在提升大型语言模型推理能力中的作用，分析了其训练方法、可扩展性和泛化能力，并探讨了模型规模与计算成本之间的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PRMs在解决中间错误中的有效性，并探索其在复杂推理任务中的优化潜力。

Method: 通过分析训练方法、数据集多样性、测试时扩展策略（如蒙特卡洛树搜索和Best-of-N采样）以及跨领域泛化能力来评估PRMs。

Result: 发现PRM性能随规模增加而递减，数据集多样性对性能影响显著，蒙特卡洛树搜索在资源充足时最有效，PRMs在数学和代码生成领域表现相近。

Conclusion: PRMs在推理任务中表现优异，但需平衡模型规模与计算成本，数据集多样性是关键，且跨领域泛化能力较强。

Abstract: Recent advancements in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models have underscored the efficacy of Process Reward Models (PRMs) in
addressing intermediate errors through structured feedback mechanisms. This
study analyzes PRMs from multiple perspectives, including training
methodologies, scalability, and generalization capabilities. We investigate the
interplay between pre-training and reward model training FLOPs to assess their
influence on PRM efficiency and accuracy in complex reasoning tasks. Our
analysis reveals a pattern of diminishing returns in performance with
increasing PRM scale, highlighting the importance of balancing model size and
computational cost. Furthermore, the diversity of training datasets
significantly impacts PRM performance, emphasizing the importance of diverse
data to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. We further examine test-time
scaling strategies, identifying Monte Carlo Tree Search as the most effective
method when computational resources are abundant, while Best-of-N Sampling
serves as a practical alternative under resource-limited conditions. Notably,
our findings indicate that PRMs trained on mathematical datasets exhibit
performance comparable to those tailored for code generation, suggesting robust
cross-domain generalization. Employing a gradient-based metric, we observe that
PRMs exhibit a preference for selecting responses with similar underlying
patterns, further informing their optimization.

TLDR: 提出了HiTEC框架，通过全局和局部错误清单诊断和缓解工具调用错误，显著提升了参数填充准确率和工具调用成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在工具调用中常因参数填充错误而受限，需系统性解决方案。

Method: HiTEC框架采用全局和局部错误清单，提出HiTEC-ICL和HiTEC-KTO两种部署方式。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上的实验显示，框架显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HiTEC框架有效解决了工具调用中的参数错误问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language
processing, particularly through the integration of external tools and APIs.
However, their effectiveness is frequently hampered by parameter mis-filling
during tool calling. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Tool Error
Checklist (HiTEC) framework to systematically diagnose and mitigate
tool-calling errors without relying on extensive real-world interactions. HiTEC
introduces a two-tiered approach: a global error checklist that identifies
common, cross-tool issues, and a local error checklist that targets
tool-specific and contextual failures. Building on this structure, we propose
two deployments: HiTEC-In Context Learning (HiTEC-ICL) and
HiTEC-Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (HiTEC-KTO). HiTEC-ICL embeds the global
checklist in the initial prompts and leverages a two-round conversational
interaction to dynamically refine parameter handling, while HiTEC-KTO generates
high-quality negative examples to drive fine-tuning via preference-based
optimization. Extensive experiments across five public datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly improves parameter-filling accuracy and
tool-calling success rates compared to baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了Social Influence Technique Taxonomy (SITT)框架，包含58种社会影响技术，并评估了LLMs识别这些技术的能力。结果表明当前LLMs对上下文敏感技术的识别能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个全面的框架来检测文本中的社会影响技术，并评估LLMs在此任务上的表现。

Method: 构建SITT数据集（746个对话），使用分层多标签分类方法评估5种LLMs（如GPT-4o、Claude 3.5等）。

Result: Claude 3.5表现最佳（F1=0.45），但整体模型性能有限，尤其对上下文敏感技术。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs对细微语言线索的敏感性不足，需领域特定微调。该研究为理解LLMs如何检测社会影响策略提供了新资源。

Abstract: In this work we present the Social Influence Technique Taxonomy (SITT), a
comprehensive framework of 58 empirically grounded techniques organized into
nine categories, designed to detect subtle forms of social influence in textual
content. We also investigate the LLMs ability to identify various forms of
social influence. Building on interdisciplinary foundations, we construct the
SITT dataset -- a 746-dialogue corpus annotated by 11 experts in Polish and
translated into English -- to evaluate the ability of LLMs to identify these
techniques. Using a hierarchical multi-label classification setup, we benchmark
five LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama-3.1, Mixtral, and PLLuM. Our
results show that while some models, notably Claude 3.5, achieved moderate
success (F1 score = 0.45 for categories), overall performance of models remains
limited, particularly for context-sensitive techniques. The findings
demonstrate key limitations in current LLMs' sensitivity to nuanced linguistic
cues and underscore the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning. This work
contributes a novel resource and evaluation example for understanding how LLMs
detect, classify, and potentially replicate strategies of social influence in
natural dialogues.

Motivation: 现实场景中通常缺乏显式错误处理指令，当前LLMs的被动错误处理方法不适用，需研究主动错误处理。

Method: 提出新基准Mis-prompt，包含任务、分类法和数据集，评估LLMs表现，并通过SFT优化模型。

Result: 当前LLMs在主动错误处理上表现较差，但SFT能显著提升其能力。

Conclusion: 主动错误处理是LLMs的重要研究方向，Mis-prompt为未来研究提供了基准和数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
error handling. Current error-handling works are performed in a passive manner,
with explicit error-handling instructions. However, in real-world scenarios,
explicit error-handling instructions are usually unavailable. In this paper,
our work identifies this challenge as how to conduct proactive error handling
without explicit error handling instructions. To promote further research, this
work introduces a new benchmark, termed Mis-prompt, consisting of four
evaluation tasks, an error category taxonomy, and a new evaluation dataset.
Furthermore, this work analyzes current LLMs' performance on the benchmark, and
the experimental results reveal that current LLMs show poor performance on
proactive error handling, and SFT on error handling instances improves LLMs'
proactive error handling capabilities. The dataset will be publicly available.

Motivation: 研究MLMs在参考词使用上的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 比较人类和七种先进MLMs在词汇、物主代词和指示代词任务上的表现。

Result: MLMs在物主代词和指示代词任务上表现显著低于人类，提示工程仅部分改善物主代词使用。

Conclusion: 当前NLP系统在处理需要语用和社会认知的语法形式时仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) increasingly communicate in human-like
ways, yet their ability to use reference words remains largely overlooked
despite their ubiquity in everyday communication. Our study addresses this gap
by comparing human and MLM use of three word classes with increasing cognitive
demands: vocabulary words, possessive pronouns (`mine' vs `yours'), and
demonstrative pronouns (`this one' vs `that one'). Evaluating seven
state-of-the-art MLMs against human participants, we observe a clear difficulty
hierarchy: while MLMs approach human-level performance on the vocabulary task,
they show substantial deficits with possessives and demonstratives. Our
analysis reveals these difficulties stem from limitations in perspective-taking
and spatial reasoning. Although prompt engineering improved model performance
on possessive use, demonstrative use remained well below human-level
competence. These findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that
producing grammatical forms requiring pragmatics and social cognition remains a
clear challenge in current NLP systems.

Motivation: 研究LLM在非西方和低资源多语言环境中的政治经济偏见，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出结合定量（政治倾向测试）和定性（多层面框架分析）的新框架，分析11个与巴基斯坦社会相关的主题。

Result: LLM主要反映西方训练数据的自由左翼倾向，但在区域语言中表现出威权倾向，存在文化调制效应。

Conclusion: 需开发基于文化的多语言偏见审计框架，以应对LLM的偏见问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping public discourse, yet
their politico-economic biases remain underexamined in non-Western and
low-resource multilingual contexts. This paper presents a systematic analysis
of political bias in 13 state-of-the-art LLMs across five low-resource
languages spoken in Pakistan: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, and Pashto. We
propose a novel framework that integrates an adapted Political Compass Test
(PCT) with a multi-level framing analysis. Our method combines quantitative
assessment of political orientation across economic (left-right) and social
(libertarian-authoritarian) axes with qualitative analysis of framing through
content, style, and emphasis. We further contextualize this analysis by
aligning prompts with 11 key socio-political themes relevant to Pakistani
society. Our results reveal that LLMs predominantly align with liberal-left
values, echoing Western training data influences, but exhibit notable shifts
toward authoritarian framing in regional languages, suggesting strong cultural
modulation effects. We also identify consistent model-specific bias signatures
and language-conditioned variations in ideological expression. These findings
show the urgent need for culturally grounded, multilingual bias auditing
frameworks.

TLDR: 论文研究了多轮对话中大型语言模型（LLM）的性能变化，发现多轮交互会导致性能显著下降，并提出任务描述的策略性放置可以缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注单轮问答任务，无法反映多轮对话对LLM性能的影响，因此需要新的评估方法。

Method: 引入一组新的基准测试，系统性地改变上下文的数量和性质，并评估多个LLM（如GPT、Claude、Gemini）的性能。

Result: 多轮交互中LLM性能显著下降（某些模型下降73%），任务描述的策略性放置可将准确率提高3.5倍。

Conclusion: 需要设计更稳健的策略来评估和缓解LLM对上下文的敏感性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn
dialogue and other sustained interactive scenarios, it is essential to
understand how extended context affects their performance. Popular benchmarks,
focusing primarily on single-turn question answering (QA) tasks, fail to
capture the effects of multi-turn exchanges. To address this gap, we introduce
a novel set of benchmarks that systematically vary the volume and nature of
prior context. We evaluate multiple conventional LLMs, including GPT, Claude,
and Gemini, across these benchmarks to measure their sensitivity to contextual
variations. Our findings reveal that LLM performance on multiple-choice
questions can degrade dramatically in multi-turn interactions, with performance
drops as large as 73% for certain models. Even highly capable models such as
GPT-4o exhibit up to a 32% decrease in accuracy. Notably, the relative
performance of larger versus smaller models is not always predictable.
Moreover, the strategic placement of the task description within the context
can substantially mitigate performance drops, improving the accuracy by as much
as a factor of 3.5. These findings underscore the need for robust strategies to
design, evaluate, and mitigate context-related sensitivity in LLMs.

TLDR: 论文提出用交互式高斯混合模型（GMMs）替代复杂的大语言模型（LLMs）来研究社会科学中的人类行为，发现GMMs能捕捉LLMs的关键动态特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs虽然强大但计算成本高，GMMs提供了一种更简单的替代方案来模拟人类行为。

Method: 通过比较简化GMMs模型与LLMs的实验模拟，分析两者的动态特征。

Result: 交互式GMMs能有效捕捉LLMs的动态特征，并展示出关键异同点。

Conclusion: GMMs具有潜力，未来可进一步优化和扩展研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a powerful tool with the ability to match
human capabilities and behavior in many settings. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) further allows LLMs to generate diverse output depending on
the contents of their RAG database. This motivates their use in the social
sciences to study human behavior between individuals when large-scale
experiments are infeasible. However, LLMs depend on complex, computationally
expensive algorithms. In this paper, we introduce interacting Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) as an alternative to similar frameworks using LLMs. We compare a
simplified model of GMMs to select experimental simulations of LLMs whose
updating and response depend on feedback from other LLMs. We find that
interacting GMMs capture important features of the dynamics in interacting
LLMs, and we investigate key similarities and differences between interacting
LLMs and GMMs. We conclude by discussing the benefits of Gaussian mixture
models, potential modifications, and future research directions.

TLDR: COSMIC是一种基于余弦相似度的自动框架，用于识别和引导大语言模型中的拒绝行为，无需依赖输出标记或预设模板。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预设模板或手动分析，难以全面识别模型中的拒绝行为。

Method: 通过余弦相似度选择方向和目标层，完全独立于模型输出。

Result: COSMIC在对抗性和弱对齐模型中可靠识别拒绝方向，并能引导模型更安全，同时保持低误拒率。

Conclusion: COSMIC在多种对齐条件下表现稳健，为模型行为控制提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode behaviors such as refusal within their
activation space, yet identifying these behaviors remains a significant
challenge. Existing methods often rely on predefined refusal templates
detectable in output tokens or require manual analysis. We introduce
\textbf{COSMIC} (Cosine Similarity Metrics for Inversion of Concepts), an
automated framework for direction selection that identifies viable steering
directions and target layers using cosine similarity - entirely independent of
model outputs. COSMIC achieves steering performance comparable to prior methods
without requiring assumptions about a model's refusal behavior, such as the
presence of specific refusal tokens. It reliably identifies refusal directions
in adversarial settings and weakly aligned models, and is capable of steering
such models toward safer behavior with minimal increase in false refusals,
demonstrating robustness across a wide range of alignment conditions.

Motivation: 现有代码切换数据集规模小且多样性不足，无法满足多语言应用需求。

Method: 提出LinguaMaster框架，用于高效合成多语言数据，并构建SwitchLingua数据集。

Result: 创建了包含420K文本样本和80小时音频的大规模多语言数据集，并提出SAER评估指标。

Conclusion: SwitchLingua数据集和SAER指标为多语言研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) is the alternating use of two or more languages within a
conversation or utterance, often influenced by social context and speaker
identity. This linguistic phenomenon poses challenges for Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems, which are typically designed for a single language
and struggle to handle multilingual inputs. The growing global demand for
multilingual applications, including Code-Switching ASR (CSASR), Text-to-Speech
(CSTTS), and Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), highlights the
inadequacy of existing monolingual datasets.
  Although some code-switching datasets exist, most are limited to bilingual
mixing within homogeneous ethnic groups, leaving a critical need for a
large-scale, diverse benchmark akin to ImageNet in computer vision.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{LinguaMaster}, a multi-agent
collaboration framework specifically designed for efficient and scalable
multilingual data synthesis. Leveraging this framework, we curate
\textbf{SwitchLingua}, the first large-scale multilingual and multi-ethnic
code-switching dataset, including: (1) 420K CS textual samples across 12
languages, and (2) over 80 hours of audio recordings from 174 speakers
representing 18 countries/regions and 63 racial/ethnic backgrounds, based on
the textual data. This dataset captures rich linguistic and cultural diversity,
offering a foundational resource for advancing multilingual and multicultural
research. Furthermore, to address the issue that existing ASR evaluation
metrics lack sensitivity to code-switching scenarios, we propose the
\textbf{Semantic-Aware Error Rate (SAER)}, a novel evaluation metric that
incorporates semantic information, providing a more accurate and context-aware
assessment of system performance.

Motivation: 尽管现有分类方法（如SAPLMA）在缓解幻觉问题上高效，但在输出序列早期或中期出现非事实信息时表现不佳，限制了其可靠性。

Method: HD-NDEs利用神经微分方程建模LLMs潜在空间的动态系统，并将潜在空间序列映射到分类空间进行真实性评估。

Result: 在五个数据集和六种常用LLMs上的实验表明，HD-NDEs显著优于现有技术，尤其在True-False数据集上AUC-ROC提升超过14%。

Conclusion: HD-NDEs通过系统性评估LLMs潜在空间的动态，有效解决了幻觉问题，为实际部署提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable
advancements, yet hallucination, where models produce inaccurate or non-factual
statements, remains a significant challenge for real-world deployment. Although
current classification-based methods, such as SAPLMA, are highly efficient in
mitigating hallucinations, they struggle when non-factual information arises in
the early or mid-sequence of outputs, reducing their reliability. To address
these issues, we propose Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations
(HD-NDEs), a novel method that systematically assesses the truthfulness of
statements by capturing the full dynamics of LLMs within their latent space.
Our approaches apply neural differential equations (Neural DEs) to model the
dynamic system in the latent space of LLMs. Then, the sequence in the latent
space is mapped to the classification space for truth assessment. The extensive
experiments across five datasets and six widely used LLMs demonstrate the
effectiveness of HD-NDEs, especially, achieving over 14% improvement in AUC-ROC
on the True-False dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）方法，用于解决非可验证任务（如创意写作和开放式对话）中的奖励建模问题，通过引入生成奖励模型（GenRM）和自举相对策略优化（BRPO）算法，实现了对主观任务的可靠评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理非可验证任务时依赖标量奖励模型，存在泛化能力不足和奖励欺骗问题，因此需要一种统一的方法来弥补这一差距。

Method: 提出了一种基于写作原则的成对生成奖励模型（GenRM）和自举相对策略优化（BRPO）算法，将主观评估转化为可验证的奖励。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在写作任务中表现优于标量奖励基线，且对奖励欺骗具有强抵抗力，同时在公开和内部写作基准测试中取得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为统一规则、参考和无参考奖励建模提供了可能，为语言任务的全面和可扩展强化学习训练范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning tasks
with objective ground-truth answers, such as mathematics and code generation.
However, a significant gap remains for non-verifiable tasks, like creative
writing and open-ended dialogue, where quality assessment is inherently
subjective and lacks definitive references. Existing approaches for these
domains often rely on scalar reward models trained with human preferences,
which suffer from limited generalization and are prone to reward hacking, such
as over-explanation and length bias. In this work, we propose a unified
RLVR-based training paradigm that bridges the gap between non-verifiable tasks
and verifiable rewards. We introduce a writing-principle-based pairwise
Generative Reward Model (GenRM) and a novel Bootstrapped Relative Policy
Optimization (BRPO) algorithm. The pairwise writing GenRM leverages
self-principled critique to transform subjective assessments into reliable,
verifiable rewards, while BRPO enables dynamic, reference-free pairwise
comparison by leveraging a bootstrapped response as temporary reference from
within group rollouts during RL training. Our approach empowers LLMs to develop
robust writing capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as demonstrated by
Writing-Zero, which shows consistent improvement and strong resistance to
reward hacking compared to scalar reward baselines. Furthermore, our method
achieves competitive results on both in-house and open-source writing
benchmarks. Our findings suggest the potential to unify rule-based,
reference-based, and reference-free reward modeling under the RLVR framework,
thus paving the way for a comprehensive and scalable RL training paradigm
applicable across all language tasks.

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示LLMs在提取SDOH时可能出现的虚假预测问题，尤其是药物状态提取中的错误，并探索提高模型可靠性的方法。

Method: 使用SHAC数据集的MIMIC部分，以药物状态提取为例，分析LLMs的预测错误，并评估提示工程和链式思维推理等缓解策略。

Result: 研究发现，酒精或吸烟的提及会误导模型预测当前/过去的药物使用，同时揭示了模型性能中的性别差异。缓解策略部分有效。

Conclusion: 论文强调了在健康领域使用LLMs时需谨慎，并提供了减少虚假预测的潜在方法。

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDOH) extraction from clinical text is
critical for downstream healthcare analytics. Although large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise, they may rely on superficial cues leading to
spurious predictions. Using the MIMIC portion of the SHAC (Social History
Annotation Corpus) dataset and focusing on drug status extraction as a case
study, we demonstrate that mentions of alcohol or smoking can falsely induce
models to predict current/past drug use where none is present, while also
uncovering concerning gender disparities in model performance. We further
evaluate mitigation strategies - such as prompt engineering and
chain-of-thought reasoning - to reduce these false positives, providing
insights into enhancing LLM reliability in health domains.

TLDR: 论文介绍了LaMP-QA基准，用于评估个性化长答案生成，填补了训练和评估个性化问答系统的资源空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化对用户为中心的问答系统至关重要，但相关研究较少，主要因缺乏训练和评估资源。

Method: 提出LaMP-QA基准，涵盖三大类问题，通过人工和自动评估比较个性化与非个性化方法的性能。

Result: 实验显示，引入个性化上下文可使性能提升高达39%。

Conclusion: LaMP-QA基准公开支持未来研究，证明个性化对问答系统的显著价值。

Abstract: Personalization is essential for question answering systems that are
user-centric. Despite its importance, personalization in answer generation has
been relatively underexplored. This is mainly due to lack of resources for
training and evaluating personalized question answering systems. We address
this gap by introducing LaMP-QA -- a benchmark designed for evaluating
personalized long-form answer generation. The benchmark covers questions from
three major categories: (1) Arts & Entertainment, (2) Lifestyle & Personal
Development, and (3) Society & Culture, encompassing over 45 subcategories in
total. To assess the quality and potential impact of the LaMP-QA benchmark for
personalized question answering, we conduct comprehensive human and automatic
evaluations, to compare multiple evaluation strategies for evaluating generated
personalized responses and measure their alignment with human preferences.
Furthermore, we benchmark a number of non-personalized and personalized

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梵语的音素复杂性和语音转换特性使其ASR研究较少，尤其是针对其诗歌形式的ASR系统开发尚未深入。

Method: 研究构建了一个包含30,779个标记音频样本的数据集，并测试了多种先进的多语言语音模型。

Result: 实验表明，IndicWhisper模型在测试中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了梵语ASR领域的空白，为未来梵语诗歌的ASR系统开发提供了基础。

Abstract: Sanskrit, an ancient language with a rich linguistic heritage, presents
unique challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to its phonemic
complexity and the phonetic transformations that occur at word junctures,
similar to the connected speech found in natural conversations. Due to these
complexities, there has been limited exploration of ASR in Sanskrit,
particularly in the context of its poetic verses, which are characterized by
intricate prosodic and rhythmic patterns. This gap in research raises the
question: How can we develop an effective ASR system for Sanskrit, particularly
one that captures the nuanced features of its poetic form? In this study, we
introduce Vedavani, the first comprehensive ASR study focused on Sanskrit Vedic
poetry. We present a 54-hour Sanskrit ASR dataset, consisting of 30,779
labelled audio samples from the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda. This dataset
captures the precise prosodic and rhythmic features that define the language.
We also benchmark the dataset on various state-of-the-art multilingual speech
models.$^{1}$ Experimentation revealed that IndicWhisper performed the best
among the SOTA models.

Motivation: 随着LLM推理和说服能力的提升，基于LLM代理的社交推理游戏（如狼人杀）需要更吸引人的体验。

Method: 提出了一种新颖且简单的基于LLM的狼人杀系统，结合优化的TTS模型，以增强与不同LLM的兼容性和用户参与度。

Result: 系统通过优化的TTS模型提升了兼容性和用户体验。

Conclusion: 随着LLM推理能力的持续增强，未来在狼人杀等游戏中可能不再需要额外组件。

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business
applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and
persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3
models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in
LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either
fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to
achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet
straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS)
models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and
improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra
components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

TLDR: 研究表明，部分遵从（提供通用信息但不含可操作细节）是最优的拒绝策略，能显著减少用户负面感知，但当前LLMs和奖励模型未能充分利用此策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs拒绝策略对用户体验的影响，解决安全性与用户体验之间的权衡问题。

Method: 通过480名参与者评估3,840个查询-响应对，分析不同拒绝策略的效果，并评估9个LLMs和6个奖励模型的响应模式。

Result: 部分遵从策略能减少50%以上的负面用户感知，但现有模型和奖励模型未能有效应用此策略。

Conclusion: 有效的安全机制应注重设计深思熟虑的拒绝策略，而非仅检测意图，以兼顾安全性和用户体验。

Abstract: Current LLMs are trained to refuse potentially harmful input queries
regardless of whether users actually had harmful intents, causing a tradeoff
between safety and user experience. Through a study of 480 participants
evaluating 3,840 query-response pairs, we examine how different refusal
strategies affect user perceptions across varying motivations. Our findings
reveal that response strategy largely shapes user experience, while actual user
motivation has negligible impact. Partial compliance -- providing general
information without actionable details -- emerges as the optimal strategy,
reducing negative user perceptions by over 50% to flat-out refusals.
Complementing this, we analyze response patterns of 9 state-of-the-art LLMs and
evaluate how 6 reward models score different refusal strategies, demonstrating
that models rarely deploy partial compliance naturally and reward models
currently undervalue it. This work demonstrates that effective guardrails
require focusing on crafting thoughtful refusals rather than detecting intent,
offering a path toward AI safety mechanisms that ensure both safety and
sustained user engagement.

TLDR: 论文探讨了轻量级编码器-解码器模型（如T5和BERT2BERT）在结构化放射学报告中的应用，相比大型语言模型（LLMs），轻量级模型在性能和资源消耗上更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告缺乏标准化格式，影响人类解读和机器学习应用，而现有大型语言模型存在计算资源高、透明度低和数据隐私问题。

Method: 使用轻量级模型（<300M参数）和八种开源LLMs（1B-70B）进行对比实验，评估其在结构化放射学报告中的表现。

Result: 轻量级模型在性能上优于基于提示技术的LLMs，且资源消耗显著更低。部分LLMs在特定指标上略有提升，但代价是更高的计算成本。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型是资源受限医疗环境中结构化临床文本的可持续且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiology reports are critical for clinical decision-making but often lack a
standardized format, limiting both human interpretability and machine learning
(ML) applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
capabilities in reformatting clinical text, their high computational
requirements, lack of transparency, and data privacy concerns hinder practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we explore lightweight encoder-decoder
models (<300M parameters)-specifically T5 and BERT2BERT-for structuring
radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus datasets. We benchmark
these models against eight open-source LLMs (1B-70B), adapted using prefix
prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
finetuning. Our best-performing lightweight model outperforms all LLMs adapted
using prompt-based techniques on a human-annotated test set. While some
LoRA-finetuned LLMs achieve modest gains over the lightweight model on the
Findings section (BLEU 6.4%, ROUGE-L 4.8%, BERTScore 3.6%, F1-RadGraph 1.1%,
GREEN 3.6%, and F1-SRR-BERT 4.3%), these improvements come at the cost of
substantially greater computational resources. For example, LLaMA-3-70B
incurred more than 400 times the inference time, cost, and carbon emissions
compared to the lightweight model. These results underscore the potential of
lightweight, task-specific models as sustainable and privacy-preserving
solutions for structuring clinical text in resource-constrained healthcare
settings.

TLDR: AST-FIM是一种利用抽象语法树（AST）进行代码填充预训练的方法，相比传统的随机字符掩码方法，它在真实代码编辑任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM将代码视为纯文本并随机掩码字符，忽略了代码的结构性，AST-FIM旨在通过AST掩码完整语法结构，提升模型对代码编辑任务的适应性。

Method: 提出AST-FIM方法，利用AST掩码完整语法结构（如代码块、表达式或函数），并引入Real-FIM-Eval基准（基于30,000+ GitHub提交）进行评估。

Result: 在1B和8B参数模型上，AST-FIM在标准FIM基准测试中比随机字符FIM高出5分。

Conclusion: AST-FIM通过结构化掩码显著提升了代码填充任务的性能，适用于真实世界的代码编辑场景。

Abstract: Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) is a common pretraining method for code LLMs, where
models complete code segments given surrounding context. However, existing LLMs
treat code as plain text and mask random character spans. We propose and
evaluate AST-FIM, a pretraining strategy that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees
(ASTs) to mask complete syntactic structures at scale, ensuring coherent
training examples better aligned with universal code structures and common code
editing patterns such as blocks, expressions, or functions. To evaluate
real-world fill-in-the-middle (FIM) programming tasks, we introduce
Real-FIM-Eval, a benchmark derived from 30,000+ GitHub commits across 12
languages. On infilling tasks, experiments on 1B and 8B parameter models show
that AST-FIM is particularly beneficial for real-world code editing as it
outperforms standard random-character FIM by up to 5 pts on standard FIM
benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

TLDR: REIC是一种基于检索增强生成的意图分类方法，解决了大规模客户服务中意图分类的扩展性问题，无需频繁重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着公司产品线的扩展，意图分类面临意图数量增加和分类体系变化的挑战，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: REIC利用检索增强生成（RAG）动态整合相关知识，实现精确分类。

Result: 实验表明，REIC在大规模客户服务场景中优于传统微调、零样本和少样本方法。

Conclusion: REIC在领域内和领域外场景中均表现出色，适合实际部署于自适应和大规模意图分类系统。

Abstract: Accurate intent classification is critical for efficient routing in customer
service, ensuring customers are connected with the most suitable agents while
reducing handling times and operational costs. However, as companies expand
their product lines, intent classification faces scalability challenges due to
the increasing number of intents and variations in taxonomy across different
verticals. In this paper, we introduce REIC, a Retrieval-augmented generation
Enhanced Intent Classification approach, which addresses these challenges
effectively. REIC leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to dynamically
incorporate relevant knowledge, enabling precise classification without the
need for frequent retraining. Through extensive experiments on real-world
datasets, we demonstrate that REIC outperforms traditional fine-tuning,
zero-shot, and few-shot methods in large-scale customer service settings. Our
results highlight its effectiveness in both in-domain and out-of-domain
scenarios, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in adaptive
and large-scale intent classification systems.

TLDR: ComposeRAG提出了一种模块化的RAG系统设计，通过分解核心功能为独立模块，提升了多跳问答的准确性、可解释性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统设计过于单一，耦合度高，限制了可解释性、系统评估和针对性改进，尤其是在复杂多跳问答任务中。

Method: 将RAG流程分解为原子化、可组合的模块（如问题分解、查询重写、检索决策和答案验证），并引入自反思机制以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个多跳QA基准测试中，ComposeRAG在准确性和基础性上均优于基线方法，最高提升15%的准确性和10%的基础性。

Conclusion: ComposeRAG通过模块化设计实现了灵活、透明、可扩展且高性能的多跳推理，显著提升了基础性和可解释性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly diverse, yet
many suffer from monolithic designs that tightly couple core functions like
query reformulation, retrieval, reasoning, and verification. This limits their
interpretability, systematic evaluation, and targeted improvement, especially
for complex multi-hop question answering. We introduce ComposeRAG, a novel
modular abstraction that decomposes RAG pipelines into atomic, composable
modules. Each module, such as Question Decomposition, Query Rewriting,
Retrieval Decision, and Answer Verification, acts as a parameterized
transformation on structured inputs/outputs, allowing independent
implementation, upgrade, and analysis. To enhance robustness against errors in
multi-step reasoning, ComposeRAG incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that
iteratively revisits and refines earlier steps upon verification failure.
Evaluated on four challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, ComposeRAG consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and grounding fidelity.
Specifically, it achieves up to a 15% accuracy improvement over
fine-tuning-based methods and up to a 5% gain over reasoning-specialized
pipelines under identical retrieval conditions. Crucially, ComposeRAG
significantly enhances grounding: its verification-first design reduces
ungrounded answers by over 10% in low-quality retrieval settings, and by
approximately 3% even with strong corpora. Comprehensive ablation studies
validate the modular architecture, demonstrating distinct and additive
contributions from each component. These findings underscore ComposeRAG's
capacity to deliver flexible, transparent, scalable, and high-performing
multi-hop reasoning with improved grounding and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在医疗决策中要么依赖任务特定模型（适应性有限），要么依赖未与专业知识工具结合的语言模型，缺乏综合性和透明度。

Method: MedOrch采用模块化、基于代理的架构，灵活整合领域特定工具，确保透明和可追溯的推理过程。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病诊断、胸部X光解读和医学视觉问答等任务中，MedOrch表现优异，准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: MedOrch通过推理驱动的工具利用，为多模态医疗数据处理和复杂临床决策任务提供了潜力巨大的解决方案。

Abstract: Healthcare decision-making represents one of the most challenging domains for
Artificial Intelligence (AI), requiring the integration of diverse knowledge
sources, complex reasoning, and various external analytical tools. Current AI
systems often rely on either task-specific models, which offer limited
adaptability, or general language models without grounding with specialized
external knowledge and tools. We introduce MedOrch, a novel framework that
orchestrates multiple specialized tools and reasoning agents to provide
comprehensive medical decision support. MedOrch employs a modular, agent-based
architecture that facilitates the flexible integration of domain-specific tools
without altering the core system. Furthermore, it ensures transparent and
traceable reasoning processes, enabling clinicians to meticulously verify each
intermediate step underlying the system's recommendations. We evaluate MedOrch
across three distinct medical applications: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis,
chest X-ray interpretation, and medical visual question answering, using
authentic clinical datasets. The results demonstrate MedOrch's competitive
performance across these diverse medical tasks. Notably, in Alzheimer's disease
diagnosis, MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 93.26%, surpassing the
state-of-the-art baseline by over four percentage points. For predicting
Alzheimer's disease progression, it attains a 50.35% accuracy, marking a
significant improvement. In chest X-ray analysis, MedOrch exhibits superior
performance with a Macro AUC of 61.2% and a Macro F1-score of 25.5%. Moreover,
in complex multimodal visual question answering (Image+Table), MedOrch achieves
an accuracy of 54.47%. These findings underscore MedOrch's potential to advance
healthcare AI by enabling reasoning-driven tool utilization for multimodal
medical data processing and supporting intricate cognitive tasks in clinical
decision-making.

Result: 闭源通用模型（如GPT-4.1）表现最佳，波斯语微调模型表现较差；翻译对性能有影响。

Conclusion: 模型大小不足以确保性能，需结合领域和语言适应；PersianMedQA为多语言医学推理评估提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide
range of NLP benchmarks, often surpassing human-level accuracy. However, their
reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in
low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
PersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice
Persian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and
English. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including
general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and
chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general
models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving
83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models
such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often
struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also
analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is
generally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural
and clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is
insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language
adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating multilingual and
culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset can be

Motivation: 探讨对齐语言模型在显性和隐性偏见评估中的不一致性，揭示其机制并提出解决方案。

Method: 分析模型内部表示，提出通过激励早期层表示种族概念来缓解偏见的新策略。

Result: 对齐模型在早期层忽略种族概念，导致隐性偏见；新方法有效缓解了这一问题。

Conclusion: 忽略种族概念会加剧隐性偏见，新方法通过增强种族意识有效减少偏见。

Abstract: Although value-aligned language models (LMs) appear unbiased in explicit bias
evaluations, they often exhibit stereotypes in implicit word association tasks,
raising concerns about their fair usage. We investigate the mechanisms behind
this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias
in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their
unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal
representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely
fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by
this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by
incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers.
In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our
interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts
effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans,
ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in LMs.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在招聘中处理自愿披露的残疾信息时是否存在偏见，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 通过模拟招聘场景，比较LLM对披露与未披露残疾信息的候选人的选择倾向。

Result: LLM更倾向于选择未披露残疾的候选人，即使其他条件完全相同。

Conclusion: LLM在招聘中存在对残疾信息的偏见，需采取措施减少不公平现象。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into hiring
processes, concerns about fairness have gained prominence. When applying for
jobs, companies often request/require demographic information, including
gender, race, and disability or veteran status. This data is collected to
support diversity and inclusion initiatives, but when provided to LLMs,
especially disability-related information, it raises concerns about potential
biases in candidate selection outcomes. Many studies have highlighted how
disability can impact CV screening, yet little research has explored the
specific effect of voluntarily disclosed information on LLM-driven candidate
selection. This study seeks to bridge that gap. When candidates shared
identical gender, race, qualifications, experience, and backgrounds, and sought
jobs with minimal employment rate gaps between individuals with and without
disabilities (e.g., Cashier, Software Developer), LLMs consistently favored
candidates who disclosed that they had no disability. Even in cases where
candidates chose not to disclose their disability status, the LLMs were less
likely to select them compared to those who explicitly stated they did not have
a disability.

Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险领域的部署需要其具备检测错误前提和批判性推理的能力，而现有基准仅关注单步错误前提问题，无法满足现实多步推理需求。

Method: 提出MultiHoax基准，涵盖七个国家和十个知识类别，以维基百科为主要知识源，评估模型在多步推理中检测错误前提的能力。

Result: 实验表明，当前最先进的大语言模型在不同国家、知识类别和多步推理类型中均难以有效检测错误前提。

Conclusion: 研究强调了大语言模型在错误前提检测和多步推理能力上的不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: As Large Language Models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,
their ability to detect false assumptions and reason critically is crucial for
ensuring reliable outputs. False-premise questions (FPQs) serve as an important
evaluation method by exposing cases where flawed assumptions lead to incorrect
responses. While existing benchmarks focus on single-hop FPQs, real-world
reasoning often requires multi-hop inference, where models must verify
consistency across multiple reasoning steps rather than relying on
surface-level cues. To address this gap, we introduce MultiHoax, a benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle false premises in complex, multi-step
reasoning tasks. Our dataset spans seven countries and ten diverse knowledge
categories, using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source to enable factual
reasoning across regions. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to detect false premises across different countries, knowledge
categories, and multi-hop reasoning types, highlighting the need for improved
false premise detection and more robust multi-hop reasoning capabilities in
LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别和聚类新闻故事、叙事和主题。

Abstract: Contextual large language model embeddings are increasingly utilized for
topic modeling and clustering. However, current methods often scale poorly,
rely on opaque similarity metrics, and struggle in multilingual settings. In
this work, we present a novel, scalable, interpretable, hierarchical, and
multilingual approach to clustering news articles and social media data. To do
this, we first train multilingual Matryoshka embeddings that can determine
story similarity at varying levels of granularity based on which subset of the
dimensions of the embeddings is examined. This embedding model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval 2022 Task 8 test dataset (Pearson
$\rho$ = 0.816). Once trained, we develop an efficient hierarchical clustering
algorithm that leverages the hierarchical nature of Matryoshka embeddings to
identify unique news stories, narratives, and themes. We conclude by
illustrating how our approach can identify and cluster stories, narratives, and
overarching themes within real-world news datasets.

Result: 英语数据不影响验证困惑度，但对下游任务能力至关重要；未加入英语会导致灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CPT中能力涌现的机制，为未来设计更有效的方法提供了基础。

Abstract: Continued pretraining (CPT) is a popular approach to adapt existing large
language models (LLMs) to new languages. When doing so, it is common practice
to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been
carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does
not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of
downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a
language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals
catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn
damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the
target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in
terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in
the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning
and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to
mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the
dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language
adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in

*Tianqi Chen,Shujian Zhang,Mingyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: DLM-One是一种基于分数蒸馏的框架，用于一步生成序列，通过连续扩散语言模型（DLMs）实现高效采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否可以通过一步生成替代迭代细化，以提高语言建模的采样效率。

Method: 通过将学生模型输出在连续词嵌入空间中的分数与预训练教师DLM的分数函数对齐，实现一步生成。

Result: 实验表明，DLM-One在推理时间上实现了约500倍加速，同时在文本生成任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 一步扩散为高效、高质量的语言生成提供了有前景的方向，并推动了连续扩散模型在自然语言处理中的广泛应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces DLM-One, a score-distillation-based framework for
one-step sequence generation with continuous diffusion language models (DLMs).
DLM-One eliminates the need for iterative refinement by aligning the scores of
a student model's outputs in the continuous token embedding space with the
score function of a pretrained teacher DLM. We investigate whether DLM-One can
achieve substantial gains in sampling efficiency for language modeling. Through
comprehensive experiments on DiffuSeq -- a representative continuous DLM -- we
show that DLM-One achieves up to ~500x speedup in inference time while
maintaining competitive performance on benchmark text generation tasks used to
evaluate the teacher models. We further analyze the method's empirical behavior
across multiple datasets, providing initial insights into its generality and
practical applicability. Our findings position one-step diffusion as a
promising direction for efficient, high-quality language generation and broader
adoption of continuous diffusion models operating in embedding space for
natural language processing.

### [322] [Can LLMs Understand Unvoiced Speech? Exploring EMG-to-Text Conversion with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00304)
*Payal Mohapatra,Akash Pandey,Xiaoyuan Zhang,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的EMG适配器模块，将无声音的EMG信号映射到大型语言模型（LLM）的输入空间，显著降低了词错误率，并在数据有限的情况下优于专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在理解无声音EMG信号方面的潜力，解决现有方法依赖配对有声和无声音EMG信号的不实用性。

Method: 提出EMG适配器模块，将EMG特征映射到LLM输入空间，实现无声音EMG到文本的转换。

Result: 在封闭词汇任务中平均词错误率为0.49，数据仅六分钟时性能提升近20%。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM理解无声音EMG信号迈出了重要一步，展示了其在无声音通信中的潜力。

Abstract: Unvoiced electromyography (EMG) is an effective communication tool for
individuals unable to produce vocal speech. However, most prior methods rely on
paired voiced and unvoiced EMG signals, along with speech data, for EMG-to-text
conversion, which is not practical for such individuals. Given the rise of
large language models (LLMs) in speech recognition, we explore their potential
to understand unvoiced speech. To this end, we address the challenge of
learning from unvoiced EMG alone and propose a novel EMG adaptor module that
maps EMG features into an LLM's input space, achieving an average word error
rate (WER) of 0.49 on a closed-vocabulary unvoiced EMG-to-text task. Even with
a conservative data availability of just six minutes, our approach improves
performance over specialized models by nearly 20%. While LLMs have been shown
to be extendable to new language modalities -- such as audio -- understanding
articulatory biosignals like unvoiced EMG remains more challenging. This work
takes a crucial first step toward enabling LLMs to comprehend unvoiced speech
using surface EMG.

*John Harvill,Ziwei Fan,Hao Wang,Yizhou Sun,Hao Ding,Luke Huan,Anoop Deoras*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文提出了一种任务无关的无损压缩技术，类似LZ77，可将输入token序列长度平均减少27%和18%，同时保留所有语义信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注有损压缩方法，而本文旨在探索无损压缩技术在LLM中的应用，以严格保留语义/语法信息。

Method: 采用类似LZ77的无损压缩技术，对输入token序列进行压缩，减少计算量。

Result: 在两项评估任务中，输入token序列长度分别减少27%和18%，计算量减少47%和33%。

Conclusion: 无损压缩技术性能接近未压缩输入，且随着模型规模和计算资源的增加，性能差距可能完全消失。

Abstract: Existing work on prompt compression for Large Language Models (LLM) focuses
on lossy methods that try to maximize the retention of semantic information
that is relevant to downstream tasks while significantly reducing the sequence
length. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic lossless compression
technique similar to LZ77 that makes it possible to reduce the input token
sequence length on average by 27\% and 18\% for the two evaluation tasks
explored here. Given that we use transformer-based LLMs, this equates to 47\%
and 33\% less encoding computation, respectively, due to the quadratic nature
of attention. The token sequence transformation is trivial to reverse and
highlights that no semantic information is lost in the process. We evaluate our
proposed approach on two tasks that require strict preservation of
semantics/syntax and demonstrate that existing lossy compression methods
perform poorly in this setting. We find that our lossless compression technique
produces only a small gap in performance compared to using the uncompressed
input and posit that larger models and an expanded computing budget would
likely erase the gap entirely.

### [324] [An evaluation of LLMs for generating movie reviews: GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0 and DeepSeek-V3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00312)
*Brendan Sands,Yining Wang,Chenhao Xu,Yuxuan Zhou,Lai Wei,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究提出了一种利用三种大语言模型（GPT-4o、DeepSeek-V3和Gemini-2.0）生成电影评论的框架，并通过与IMDb用户评论对比评估其性能。结果显示LLM能生成语法流畅、结构完整的评论，但在情感丰富性和风格一致性上仍有差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在电影评论生成任务中的适用性，并评估其生成质量。

Method: 使用电影字幕和剧本作为输入，通过三种LLM生成评论，并与IMDb用户评论在词汇、情感极性、相似性和主题一致性上进行比较。

Result: LLM能生成语法流畅的评论，但情感丰富性和风格一致性不及IMDb评论。DeepSeek-V3表现最平衡，GPT-4o过于强调正面情感，Gemini-2.0负面情感捕捉较好但情感强度过高。

Conclusion: LLM在电影评论生成上有潜力，但需进一步优化以提升情感和风格质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been prominent in various tasks, including
text generation and summarisation. The applicability of LLMs to the generation
of product reviews is gaining momentum, paving the way for the generation of
movie reviews. In this study, we propose a framework that generates movie
reviews using three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0), and evaluate
their performance by comparing the generated outputs with IMDb user reviews. We
use movie subtitles and screenplays as input to the LLMs and investigate how
they affect the quality of reviews generated. We review the LLM-based movie
reviews in terms of vocabulary, sentiment polarity, similarity, and thematic
consistency in comparison to IMDB user reviews. The results demonstrate that
LLMs are capable of generating syntactically fluent and structurally complete
movie reviews. Nevertheless, there is still a noticeable gap in emotional
richness and stylistic coherence between LLM-generated and IMDb reviews,
suggesting that further refinement is needed to improve the overall quality of
movie review generation. We provided a survey-based analysis where participants
were told to distinguish between LLM and IMDb user reviews. The results show
that LLM-generated reviews are difficult to distinguish from IMDB user reviews.
We found that DeepSeek-V3 produced the most balanced reviews, closely matching
IMDb reviews. GPT-4o overemphasised positive emotions, while Gemini-2.0
captured negative emotions better but showed excessive emotional intensity.

TLDR: SkillVerse是一个无监督的树状诊断框架，用于评估语言模型在特定技能上的能力，并通过树搜索算法和预测模型弱点提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型处理复杂任务的需求增加，需要更精细的评估方法来指导模型开发。

Method: SkillVerse利用LLM作为评判者，对模型响应进行批评并组织成树状结构（dendrogram），支持多粒度分析。

Result: SkillVerse在两项任务中表现优异：1）通过树搜索算法提升模型上下文学习能力25%；2）预测模型弱点的准确率提高22%。

Conclusion: SkillVerse为语言模型的能力评估提供了灵活且有效的工具，显著提升了模型开发和优化效率。

Abstract: As language models evolve to tackle complex, multifaceted tasks, their
evaluation must adapt to capture this intricacy. A granular, skill-specific
understanding of model capabilities can empower researchers to make informed
model development plans. In this paper, we introduce SkillVerse, an
unsupervised tree-structured diagnosis framework for understanding model
proficiency in specific abilities. With LLM as a judge, SkillVerse first
critiques the model responses, and then organizes them into a hierarchical
structure termed dendrogram. Given proficiency at arbitrary levels of
granularity, SkillVerse is flexible to produce insights of behaviors of modern
large models. We also demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream tasks: 1)
improving model in-context learning by 25% using a tree-search algorithm to
select more informative few-shot demonstrations, and 2) accurately predicting
new model weaknesses with a 55% success rate, 22% higher than without
SkillVerse.

*Boyi Zhang,Zhuo Liu,Hangfeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: TreeRare是一种基于语法树的信息检索和推理框架，通过自底向上遍历语法树生成子查询并检索相关段落，显著提升了复杂知识密集型问题的回答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有迭代检索框架中因推理错误和检索结果不匹配导致的性能限制。

Method: 利用语法树自底向上遍历，生成子查询并检索相关段落，通过子组件问答模块合成证据，最终聚合形成答案。

Result: 在五个涉及模糊或多跳推理的问答数据集上，TreeRare显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TreeRare通过语法树引导的检索和推理，有效解决了复杂知识密集型问题中的推理和检索问题。

Abstract: In real practice, questions are typically complex and knowledge-intensive,
requiring Large Language Models (LLMs) to recognize the multifaceted nature of
the question and reason across multiple information sources. Iterative and
adaptive retrieval, where LLMs decide when and what to retrieve based on their
reasoning, has been shown to be a promising approach to resolve complex,
knowledge-intensive questions. However, the performance of such retrieval
frameworks is limited by the accumulation of reasoning errors and misaligned
retrieval results. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeRare (Syntax
Tree-Guided Retrieval and Reasoning), a framework that utilizes syntax trees to
guide information retrieval and reasoning for question answering. Following the
principle of compositionality, TreeRare traverses the syntax tree in a
bottom-up fashion, and in each node, it generates subcomponent-based queries
and retrieves relevant passages to resolve localized uncertainty. A
subcomponent question answering module then synthesizes these passages into
concise, context-aware evidence. Finally, TreeRare aggregates the evidence
across the tree to form a final answer. Experiments across five question
answering datasets involving ambiguous or multi-hop reasoning demonstrate that
TreeRare achieves substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏公开的、标注的代码混合语料库，尤其是适合模拟人类对话和关系的语料库。

Method: 通过实时项目持续收集、验证和整合代码混合消息，形成结构化JSON数据集，附带详细元数据和语言统计。

Result: 目前已包含355,641条消息，涵盖多种代码混合模式，主要涉及英语、普通话等语言。

Conclusion: Codemix Corpus将成为计算语言学、社会语言学和NLP研究的基础数据集。

Abstract: Code-mixing involves the seamless integration of linguistic elements from
multiple languages within a single discourse, reflecting natural multilingual
communication patterns. Despite its prominence in informal interactions such as
social media, chat messages and instant-messaging exchanges, there has been a
lack of publicly available corpora that are author-labeled and suitable for
modeling human conversations and relationships. This study introduces the first
labeled and general-purpose corpus for understanding code-mixing in context
while maintaining rigorous privacy and ethical standards. Our live project will
continuously gather, verify, and integrate code-mixed messages into a
structured dataset released in JSON format, accompanied by detailed metadata
and linguistic statistics. To date, it includes over 355,641 messages spanning
various code-mixing patterns, with a primary focus on English, Mandarin, and
other languages. We expect the Codemix Corpus to serve as a foundational
dataset for research in computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, and NLP
applications.

*Gerard Christopher Yeo,Kokil Jaidka*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在情绪识别任务中如何利用上下文信息进行推理，基于心理理论（ToM）框架，发现LLMs在情绪推理方面存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索文本中隐含的上下文线索如何影响情绪推理，超越表面特征，结合心理理论和认知评估理论。

Method: 方法包括构建专门的ToM评估数据集，评估LLMs的前向（从上下文到情绪）和后向（从情绪到上下文）推理能力。

Result: 结果显示LLMs具有一定推理能力，但在将情境结果和评估与特定情绪关联方面表现较差。

Conclusion: 结论强调在LLMs的训练和评估中需要结合心理学理论，以提升情绪推理能力。

Abstract: Datasets used for emotion recognition tasks typically contain overt cues that
can be used in predicting the emotions expressed in a text. However, one
challenge is that texts sometimes contain covert contextual cues that are rich
in affective semantics, which warrant higher-order reasoning abilities to infer
emotional states, not simply the emotions conveyed. This study advances beyond
surface-level perceptual features to investigate how large language models
(LLMs) reason about others' emotional states using contextual information,
within a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) framework. Grounded in Cognitive Appraisal
Theory, we curate a specialized ToM evaluation dataset1 to assess both forward
reasoning - from context to emotion- and backward reasoning - from emotion to
inferred context. We showed that LLMs can reason to a certain extent, although
they are poor at associating situational outcomes and appraisals with specific
emotions. Our work highlights the need for psychological theories in the
training and evaluation of LLMs in the context of emotion reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决OWSM项目训练数据不足的问题，并处理YODAS数据集的挑战。

Method: 开发可扩展的数据清理流程，整合YODAS数据集和现有OWSM数据。

Result: 训练出的OWSM v4模型在多语言基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越工业前沿模型。

Conclusion: 将公开清理后的YODAS数据、预训练模型及相关脚本，推动开源社区发展。

Abstract: The Open Whisper-style Speech Models (OWSM) project has developed a series of
fully open speech foundation models using academic-scale resources, but their
training data remains insufficient. This work enhances OWSM by integrating
YODAS, a large-scale web-crawled dataset with a Creative Commons license.
However, incorporating YODAS is nontrivial due to its wild nature, which
introduces challenges such as incorrect language labels and audio-text
misalignments. To address this, we develop a scalable data-cleaning pipeline
using public toolkits, yielding a dataset with 166,000 hours of speech across
75 languages. Our new series of OWSM v4 models, trained on this curated dataset
alongside existing OWSM data, significantly outperform previous versions on
multilingual benchmarks. Our models even match or surpass frontier industrial
models like Whisper and MMS in multiple scenarios. We will publicly release the
cleaned YODAS data, pre-trained models, and all associated scripts via the
ESPnet toolkit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部模型进行语义聚类，导致计算开销大且难以捕捉上下文语义，因此需要一种更高效且上下文敏感的方法。

Method: 提出Latent Semantic Clustering（LSC），利用生成LLM的内部隐藏状态进行聚类，避免使用外部模型。

Result: 实验表明，LSC在多种LLM和数据集上显著提高了计算效率，同时保持或超越现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: LSC是一种高效且上下文敏感的语义聚类方法，适用于测试时计算扩展。

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation--generating and analyzing multiple or
sequential outputs for a single input--has become a promising strategy for
improving the reliability and quality of large language models (LLMs), as
evidenced by advances in uncertainty quantification and multi-step reasoning. A
key shared component is semantic clustering, which groups outputs that differ
in form but convey the same meaning. Semantic clustering enables estimation of
the distribution over the semantics of outputs and helps avoid redundant
exploration of reasoning paths. However, existing approaches typically rely on
external models, which introduce substantial computational overhead and often
fail to capture context-aware semantics. We propose Latent Semantic Clustering
(LSC), a lightweight and context-sensitive method that leverages the generator
LLM's internal hidden states for clustering, eliminating the need for external
models. Our extensive experiment across various LLMs and datasets shows that
LSC significantly improves the computational efficiency of test-time scaling
while maintaining or exceeding the performance of existing methods.

Motivation: 解决神经科学与人工智能交叉领域中从神经信号解码连续语言的挑战。

Result: 仅需30分钟神经数据即表现优异，在低数据场景下超越现有技术。

Conclusion: 展示了在脑机接口和神经解码技术中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Decoding continuous language from neural signals remains a significant
challenge in the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We
introduce Neuro2Semantic, a novel framework that reconstructs the semantic
content of perceived speech from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. Our
approach consists of two phases: first, an LSTM-based adapter aligns neural
signals with pre-trained text embeddings; second, a corrector module generates
continuous, natural text directly from these aligned embeddings. This flexible
method overcomes the limitations of previous decoding approaches and enables
unconstrained text generation. Neuro2Semantic achieves strong performance with
as little as 30 minutes of neural data, outperforming a recent state-of-the-art
method in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential for
practical applications in brain-computer interfaces and neural decoding
technologies.

TLDR: Adaptive-VP是一个基于大型语言模型的虚拟患者对话生成框架，用于动态调整虚拟患者行为以提升护士沟通培训效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准化患者模拟成本高且不灵活，现有虚拟患者系统缺乏对学员沟通技能的动态适应能力。

Method: 利用大型语言模型动态调整虚拟患者行为，构建临床场景并实时评估学员沟通技能。

Result: 自动化评估显示其能反映真实沟通水平，专家认为其交互更自然真实。

Conclusion: Adaptive-VP是一种可扩展且有效的护士沟通培训工具。

Abstract: Effective communication training is essential to preparing nurses for
high-quality patient care. While standardized patient (SP) simulations provide
valuable experiential learning, they are often costly and inflexible. Virtual
patient (VP) systems offer a scalable alternative, but most fail to adapt to
the varying communication skills of trainees. In particular, when trainees
respond ineffectively, VPs should escalate in hostility or become
uncooperative--yet this level of adaptive interaction remains largely
unsupported. To address this gap, we introduce Adaptive-VP, a VP dialogue
generation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically
adapt VP behavior based on trainee input. The framework features a pipeline for
constructing clinically grounded yet flexible VP scenarios and a modular system
for assessing trainee communication and adjusting VP responses in real time,
while ensuring learner safety. We validated Adaptive-VP by simulating
challenging patient conversations. Automated evaluation using a corpus from
practicing nurses showed that our communication skill evaluation mechanism
reflected real-world proficiency levels. Expert nurses further confirmed that
Adaptive-VP produced more natural and realistic interactions than existing
approaches, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and effective tool for
nursing communication training.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: SHARE是一种基于SLM的分层动作校正助手，通过将声明式SQL查询转换为逐步动作轨迹，并采用两阶段细粒度修正，解决了传统自校正方法的计算开销大和错误检测能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自校正方法依赖LLM的递归调用，计算开销大，且LLM难以有效检测和修正声明式SQL查询的错误。

Method: SHARE通过三个专用SLM的序列化流程，将SQL查询转换为动作轨迹，并进行两阶段修正，同时提出分层自进化策略以高效训练。

Result: 实验表明，SHARE显著提升了自校正能力，且在低资源训练下表现稳健。

Conclusion: SHARE在提升文本到SQL应用的自校正能力方面具有显著优势，尤其适用于数据隐私受限的场景。

Abstract: Current self-correction approaches in text-to-SQL face two critical
limitations: 1) Conventional self-correction methods rely on recursive
self-calls of LLMs, resulting in multiplicative computational overhead, and 2)
LLMs struggle to implement effective error detection and correction for
declarative SQL queries, as they fail to demonstrate the underlying reasoning
path. In this work, we propose SHARE, an SLM-based Hierarchical Action
corREction assistant that enables LLMs to perform more precise error
localization and efficient correction. SHARE orchestrates three specialized
Small Language Models (SLMs) in a sequential pipeline, where it first
transforms declarative SQL queries into stepwise action trajectories that
reveal underlying reasoning, followed by a two-phase granular refinement. We
further propose a novel hierarchical self-evolution strategy for data-efficient
training. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARE effectively enhances
self-correction capabilities while proving robust across various LLMs.
Furthermore, our comprehensive analysis shows that SHARE maintains strong
performance even in low-resource training settings, which is particularly
valuable for text-to-SQL applications with data privacy constraints.

Motivation: 现有方法在LLM决策中注重性能但忽略效率与成本的平衡，需改进。

Method: 提出SRM框架，结合外部奖励分配器和推测验证机制，优化搜索策略。

Result: 实验显示SRM将成本降至原框架的1/10，同时保持效果。

Conclusion: SRM有效平衡了LLM决策的效率与性能，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Effective decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for
handling intricate tasks. However, existing approaches prioritize performance
but often overlook the balance between effectiveness and computational cost. To
address this, we first introduce the 3E Criteria to systematically assess the
cost-effectiveness of search strategies, revealing that existing methods often
trade significant efficiency for marginal performance gains. To improve LLM
decision-making while maintaining efficiency, we propose the Speculative Reward
Model (SRM), a plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates with existing
search strategies. Specifically, SRM employs an external reward assigner to
predict optimal actions, reducing reliance on LLMs' internal self-evaluation.
And a speculative verification mechanism is used to prune suboptimal choices
and guide the search toward more promising steps. We evaluate SRM on several
complex decision-making tasks including mathematical reasoning, planning and
numerical reasoning in specialized domains. Experimental results show that SRM
reduces costs to 1/10 of the original search framework on average while
maintaining effectiveness.

Method: 提出TSGD-M方法，结合数值梯度下降的动量思想，通过重加权采样实现可扩展的上下文学习。

Result: 在九个NLP任务中，TSGD-M显著优于TGD基线，同时减少了方差。

Conclusion: TSGD-M是一种高效且可扩展的文本提示优化方法，适用于多领域NLP任务。

Abstract: As prompts play an increasingly critical role in large language models
(LLMs), optimizing textual prompts has become a crucial challenge. The Textual
Gradient Descent (TGD) framework has emerged as a promising data-driven
approach that iteratively refines textual prompts using LLM - suggested updates
(or textual gradients) over minibatches of training samples. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that scaling the number of training examples initially
improves but later degrades TGD's performance across multiple downstream NLP
tasks. However, while data scaling improves results for most tasks, it also
significantly increases the computational cost when leveraging LLMs. To address
this, we draw inspiration from numerical gradient descent and propose Textual
Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (TSGD-M) - a method that facilitates
scalable in-context learning by reweighting prompt sampling based on past batch
distributions. Across nine NLP tasks spanning three domains - including
BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), natural language understanding tasks, and reasoning tasks
- TSGD-M significantly outperforms TGD baselines that do not incorporate
reweighted sampling, while also reducing variance in most tasks.

Motivation: 儿童ASR表现常不如成人，现有方法孤立分析各因素，忽略了其相互依赖关系。

Method: 引入因果结构发现方法，分析生理、认知和外部因素与ASR错误的相互依赖关系，并通过因果量化测量各因素影响。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同ASR系统（如Whisper和Wav2Vec2.0）中具有通用性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了儿童ASR表现不佳的多因素相互依赖关系，并量化了各因素的影响，为改进ASR系统提供了新视角。

Abstract: Children's automatic speech recognition (ASR) often underperforms compared to
that of adults due to a confluence of interdependent factors: physiological
(e.g., smaller vocal tracts), cognitive (e.g., underdeveloped pronunciation),
and extrinsic (e.g., vocabulary limitations, background noise). Existing
analysis methods examine the impact of these factors in isolation, neglecting
interdependencies-such as age affecting ASR accuracy both directly and
indirectly via pronunciation skills. In this paper, we introduce a causal
structure discovery to unravel these interdependent relationships among
physiology, cognition, extrinsic factors, and ASR errors. Then, we employ
causal quantification to measure each factor's impact on children's ASR. We
extend the analysis to fine-tuned models to identify which factors are
mitigated by fine-tuning and which remain largely unaffected. Experiments on
Whisper and Wav2Vec2.0 demonstrate the generalizability of our findings across
different ASR systems.

Motivation: 自回归解码在LLMs中速度受限，而扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）理论上支持并行生成，但实践中难以在不牺牲质量的情况下达到自回归模型的速度。

Method: APD通过定义dLLM边际概率与小型辅助自回归模型序列联合概率的混合乘积，动态调整并行token采样数量，并优化KV缓存和掩码输入大小。

Result: APD在下游基准测试中显著提高了吞吐量，同时质量损失极小。

Conclusion: APD通过三个可调参数灵活权衡吞吐量与质量，为并行token生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The generation speed of LLMs are bottlenecked by autoregressive decoding,
where tokens are predicted sequentially one by one. Alternatively, diffusion
large language models (dLLMs) theoretically allow for parallel token
generation, but in practice struggle to achieve the speed of autoregressive
models without significantly sacrificing quality. We therefore introduce
adaptive parallel decoding (APD), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the
number of tokens sampled in parallel. We achieve this by defining a
multiplicative mixture between the dLLM marginal probabilities and the joint
probability of sequences under a small auxiliary autoregressive model. This
inverts the standard setup of speculative decoding, where the goal is to sample
from a large autoregressive verifier by drafting from a smaller model. We
further optimize APD by enabling KV caching and limiting the size of the masked
input. Altogether, our method puts forward three tunable parameters to flexibly
tradeoff throughput and quality. We show that APD provides markedly higher
throughput with minimal quality degradations on downstream benchmarks.

Conclusion: 双去偏框架有效解决了困惑度在高噪声环境下的偏差问题，提升了噪声检测和ICL性能。

Abstract: In context learning (ICL) relies heavily on high quality demonstrations drawn
from large annotated corpora. Existing approaches detect noisy annotations by
ranking local perplexities, presuming that noisy samples yield higher
perplexities than their clean counterparts. However, this assumption breaks
down when the noise ratio is high and many demonstrations are flawed. We
reexamine the perplexity based paradigm for text generation under noisy
annotations, highlighting two sources of bias in perplexity: the annotation
itself and the domain specific knowledge inherent in large language models
(LLMs). To overcome these biases, we introduce a dual debiasing framework that
uses synthesized neighbors to explicitly correct perplexity estimates, yielding
a robust Sample Cleanliness Score. This metric uncovers absolute sample
cleanliness regardless of the overall corpus noise level. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our method's superior noise detection capabilities and show that
its final ICL performance is comparable to that of a fully clean demonstration
corpus. Moreover, our approach remains robust even when noise ratios are
extremely high.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注视觉任务，忽视听觉，且交互多为静态。本研究旨在解决这些问题，实现更沉浸式的多模态对话。

Method: 提出新的多模态对话数据集$M^3C$，并设计了一个结合多模态记忆检索的对话模型。

Result: 模型在复杂场景下能处理视觉和听觉输入，保持连贯动态的对话，人类评估表现优异。

Conclusion: 该模型展示了多模态对话代理的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: As chatbots continue to evolve toward human-like, real-world, interactions,
multimodality remains an active area of research and exploration. So far,
efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on
image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions,
placing emphasis on the "eyes" of human perception while neglecting the "ears",
namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static
interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally
incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of
simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been
explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific
constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural
conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots
with "eyes and ears" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As
part of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset,
Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel
multimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model,
trained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in
long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like
settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and
respond appropriately. Human evaluations highlight the model's strong
performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, demonstrating its
potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents.

TLDR: DYNAC是一种基于动态词汇的非自回归上下文化方法，通过自条件CTC在中间层集成动态词汇，显著降低实时因子（RTF）且性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态词汇在自回归模型中能提升上下文偏置（CB）准确性，但推理速度慢；而在非自回归模型中，条件独立性假设无法捕捉静态与动态词汇间的依赖关系。

Method: 提出DYNAC方法，通过自条件CTC在编码器中集成动态词汇，有效捕捉静态与动态词汇的依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，DYNAC在LibriSpeech 960测试集上降低RTF 81%，仅增加0.1%的词错误率。

Conclusion: DYNAC在保持性能的同时显著提升推理效率，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Contextual biasing (CB) improves automatic speech recognition for rare and
unseen phrases. Recent studies have introduced dynamic vocabulary, which
represents context phrases as expandable tokens in autoregressive (AR) models.
This method improves CB accuracy but with slow inference speed. While dynamic
vocabulary can be applied to non-autoregressive (NAR) models, such as
connectionist temporal classification (CTC), the conditional independence
assumption fails to capture dependencies between static and dynamic tokens.
This paper proposes DYNAC (Dynamic Vocabulary-based NAR Contextualization), a
self-conditioned CTC method that integrates dynamic vocabulary into
intermediate layers. Conditioning the encoder on dynamic vocabulary, DYNAC
effectively captures dependencies between static and dynamic tokens while
reducing the real-time factor (RTF). Experimental results show that DYNAC
reduces RTF by 81% with a 0.1-point degradation in word error rate on the
LibriSpeech 960 test-clean set.

Conclusion: RI$^2$VER框架通过段落间验证显著提升了多答案QA的性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multi-answer question answering (QA), where questions can have many valid
answers, presents a significant challenge for existing retrieval-augmented
generation-based QA systems, as these systems struggle to retrieve and then
synthesize a large number of evidence passages. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a new multi-answer QA framework -- Retrieval-augmented Independent
Reading with Inter-passage Verification (RI$^2$VER). Our framework retrieves a
large set of passages and processes each passage individually to generate an
initial high-recall but noisy answer set. Then we propose a new inter-passage
verification pipeline that validates every candidate answer through (1)
Verification Question Generation, (2) Gathering Additional Evidence, and (3)
Verification with inter-passage synthesis. Evaluations on the QAMPARI and RoMQA
datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing
baselines across various model sizes, achieving an average F1 score improvement
of 11.17%. Further analysis validates that our inter-passage verification
pipeline enables our framework to be particularly beneficial for questions
requiring multi-evidence synthesis.

Abstract: Forecasting over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) which predicts future facts
based on historical ones has received much attention. Recent studies have
introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task to enhance the models'
generalization abilities. However, these models perform forecasting via
simultaneously learning two kinds of entangled knowledge in the TKG: (1)
general patterns, i.e., invariant temporal structures shared across different
scenarios; and (2) scenario information, i.e., factual knowledge engaged in
specific scenario, such as entities and relations. As a result, the learning
processes of these two kinds of knowledge may interfere with each other, which
potentially impact the generalization abilities of the models. To enhance the
generalization ability of LLMs on this task, in this paper, we propose a
General-to-Specific learning framework (G2S) that disentangles the learning
processes of the above two kinds of knowledge. In the general learning stage,
we mask the scenario information in different TKGs and convert it into
anonymous temporal structures. After training on these structures, the model is
able to capture the general patterns across different TKGs. In the specific
learning stage, we inject the scenario information into the structures via
either in-context learning or fine-tuning modes. Experimental results show that
G2S effectively improves the generalization abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) during summarization of
patient-clinician dialogues pose significant risks to patient care and clinical
decision-making. However, the phenomenon remains understudied in the clinical
domain, with uncertainty surrounding the applicability of general-domain
hallucination detectors. The rarity and randomness of hallucinations further
complicate their investigation. In this paper, we conduct an evaluation of
hallucination detection methods in the medical domain, and construct two
datasets for the purpose: A fact-controlled Leave-N-out dataset -- generated by
systematically removing facts from source dialogues to induce hallucinated
content in summaries; and a natural hallucination dataset -- arising
organically during LLM-based medical summarization. We show that general-domain
detectors struggle to detect clinical hallucinations, and that performance on
fact-controlled hallucinations does not reliably predict effectiveness on
natural hallucinations. We then develop fact-based approaches that count
hallucinations, offering explainability not available with existing methods.
Notably, our LLM-based detectors, which we developed using fact-controlled
hallucinations, generalize well to detecting real-world clinical
hallucinations. This research contributes a suite of specialized metrics
supported by expert-annotated datasets to advance faithful clinical
summarization systems.

mixes up to 671B tokens -- and explore the effect of continual pre-training
with or without bilingual translation data. Comprehensive evaluation across 7
tasks and 12 benchmarks demonstrates that bilingual data tends to enhance
language transfer and performance, particularly for low-resource languages. We

Conclusion: PVP数据集为个性化视觉说服提供了重要资源，心理特征的引入增强了技术效果。

Abstract: Visual persuasion, which uses visual elements to influence cognition and
behaviors, is crucial in fields such as advertising and political
communication. With recent advancements in artificial intelligence, there is
growing potential to develop persuasive systems that automatically generate
persuasive images tailored to individuals. However, a significant bottleneck in
this area is the lack of comprehensive datasets that connect the persuasiveness
of images with the personal information about those who evaluated the images.
To address this gap and facilitate technological advancements in personalized
visual persuasion, we release the Personalized Visual Persuasion (PVP) dataset,
comprising 28,454 persuasive images across 596 messages and 9 persuasion
strategies. Importantly, the PVP dataset provides persuasiveness scores of
images evaluated by 2,521 human annotators, along with their demographic and
psychological characteristics (personality traits and values). We demonstrate
the utility of our dataset by developing a persuasive image generator and an
automated evaluator, and establish benchmark baselines. Our experiments reveal
that incorporating psychological characteristics enhances the generation and
evaluation of persuasive images, providing valuable insights for personalized
visual persuasion.

Conclusion: 结合LLM和标签传播技术能显著提升假新闻检测的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist multimodal fake news detection by
predicting pseudo labels. However, LLM-generated pseudo labels alone
demonstrate poor performance compared to traditional detection methods, making
their effective integration non-trivial. In this paper, we propose Global Label
Propagation Network with LLM-based Pseudo Labeling (GLPN-LLM) for multimodal
fake news detection, which integrates LLM capabilities via label propagation
techniques. The global label propagation can utilize LLM-generated pseudo
labels, enhancing prediction accuracy by propagating label information among
all samples. For label propagation, a mask-based mechanism is designed to
prevent label leakage during training by ensuring that training nodes do not
propagate their own labels back to themselves. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that by synergizing LLMs with label propagation, our
model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
various tasks, leveraging their exceptional in-context learning ability with
only a few examples. Accordingly, the selection of optimal in-context examples
has been actively studied in the field of machine translation. However, these
studies presuppose the presence of a demonstration pool with human-annotated
pairs, making them less applicable to low-resource languages where such an
assumption is challenging to meet. To overcome this limitation, this paper
explores the research direction of in-context example generation for machine
translation. Specifically, we propose Demonstration Augmentation for
Translation (DAT), a simple yet effective approach that generates example pairs
without relying on any external resources. This method builds upon two prior
criteria, relevance and diversity, which have been highlighted in previous work
as key factors for in-context example selection. Through experiments and
analysis on low-resource languages where human-annotated pairs are scarce, we
show that DAT achieves superior translation quality compared to the baselines.
Furthermore, we investigate the potential of progressively accumulating
generated pairs during test time to build and reuse a demonstration pool. Our
implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/aiclaudev/DAT.

Result: 基于内容的多样性指标表现更优，与LLM标注结果高度相关。

Conclusion: 建议未来常识生成研究采用基于内容的多样性评估指标。

Abstract: In commonsense generation, given a set of input concepts, a model must
generate a response that is not only commonsense bearing, but also capturing
multiple diverse viewpoints. Numerous evaluation metrics based on form- and
content-level overlap have been proposed in prior work for evaluating the
diversity of a commonsense generation model. However, it remains unclear as to
which metrics are best suited for evaluating the diversity in commonsense
generation. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of
diversity metrics for commonsense generation. We find that form-based diversity
metrics tend to consistently overestimate the diversity in sentence sets, where
even randomly generated sentences are assigned overly high diversity scores. We
then use an Large Language Model (LLM) to create a novel dataset annotated for
the diversity of sentences generated for a commonsense generation task, and use
it to conduct a meta-evaluation of the existing diversity evaluation metrics.
Our experimental results show that content-based diversity evaluation metrics
consistently outperform the form-based counterparts, showing high correlations
with the LLM-based ratings. We recommend that future work on commonsense
generation should use content-based metrics for evaluating the diversity of
their outputs.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在不同语言中存在知识差异，当前的多语言弃权策略依赖生成反馈和自我反思，但易受生成反馈中的不准确性和偏见影响。

Method: 提出CausalAbstain方法，从因果视角帮助LLMs决定是否利用多个生成的反馈，并识别最有用的反馈。

Conclusion: CausalAbstain方法在多语言环境中显著减少了幻觉现象，并提供了可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit knowledge disparities across
languages. Encouraging LLMs to \textit{abstain} when faced with knowledge gaps
is a promising strategy to reduce hallucinations in multilingual settings.
Current abstention strategies for multilingual scenarios primarily rely on
generating feedback in various languages using LLMs and performing
self-reflection. However, these methods can be adversely impacted by
inaccuracies and biases in the generated feedback. To address this, from a
causal perspective, we introduce \textit{CausalAbstain}, a method that helps
LLMs determine whether to utilize multiple generated feedback responses and how
to identify the most useful ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textit{CausalAbstain} effectively selects helpful feedback and enhances
abstention decisions with interpretability in both native language
(\textsc{Casual-native}) and multilingual (\textsc{Causal-multi}) settings,
outperforming strong baselines on two benchmark datasets covering encyclopedic
and commonsense knowledge QA tasks. Our code and data are open-sourced at

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the Intellectual Property
(IP) field often struggle with diverse user queries, including colloquial
expressions, spelling errors, and ambiguous terminology, leading to inaccurate
retrieval and suboptimal responses. To address this challenge, we propose
Multi-Angle Question Generation and Retrieval Fine-Tuning Method (MQG-RFM), a
novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate varied
user inquiries and fine-tunes retrieval models to align semantically equivalent
but linguistically diverse questions. Unlike complex architectural
modifications, MQG-RFM adopts a lightweight Data-to-Tune paradigm, combining
prompt-engineered query generation with hard negative mining to enhance
retrieval robustness without costly infrastructure changes. Experimental
results on a Taiwan patent Q&A dataset show 185.62% improvement in retrieval
accuracy on the Patent Consultation dataset and 262.26% improvement on the
Novel Patent Technology Report dataset, with 14.22% and 53.58% improvements in
generation quality over the baselines, respectively. By bridging the gap
between user intent and system comprehension through semantic-aware retrieval
optimization, MQG-RFM offers a practical, scalable approach for rapid,
cost-effective deployment among small and medium-sized agencies seeking
reliable patent intelligence solutions. Additionally, our proposed method has
already been adopted by ScholarMate, the largest professional research social
networking platform in China, to support real-world development and deployment.

### [354] [Decoupling Reasoning and Knowledge Injection for In-Context Knowledge Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00536)
*Changyue Wang,Weihang Su,Qingyao Ai,Yujia Zhou,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: DecKER提出了一种新的知识编辑框架，通过解耦推理和知识编辑，显著提升了多跳问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICE方法未明确分离新注入知识与模型原始推理过程，导致知识冲突和推理路径不一致。

Method: DecKER通过生成掩码推理路径，结合混合检索和基于模型的验证来解耦推理与知识编辑。

Result: 在多跳QA基准测试中，DecKER显著优于现有ICE方法。

Conclusion: DecKER有效缓解了知识冲突并保持了推理一致性，为知识编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently update Large Language Models (LLMs) by
modifying specific knowledge without retraining the entire model. Among
knowledge editing approaches, in-context editing (ICE) offers a lightweight
solution by injecting new knowledge directly into the input context, leaving
model parameters unchanged. However, existing ICE approaches do not explicitly
separate the newly injected knowledge from the model's original reasoning
process. This entanglement often results in conflicts between external updates
and internal parametric knowledge, undermining the consistency and accuracy of
the reasoning path.In this work, we conduct preliminary experiments to examine
how parametric knowledge influences reasoning path planning. We find that the
model's reasoning is tightly coupled with its internal knowledge, and that
naively injecting new information without adapting the reasoning path often
leads to performance degradation, particularly in multi-hop tasks. To this end,
we propose DecKER, a novel ICE framework that decouples reasoning from
knowledge editing by generating a masked reasoning path and then resolving
knowledge edits via hybrid retrieval and model-based validation. Experiments on
multi-hop QA benchmarks show that DecKER significantly outperforms existing ICE
methods by mitigating knowledge conflicts and preserving reasoning consistency.

*Ruihan Yang,Yikai Zhang,Aili Chen,Xintao Wang,Siyu Yuan,Jiangjie Chen,Deqing Yang,Yanghua Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: ARIA方法通过将自然语言动作从高维空间映射到低维意图空间，减少奖励方差，提升语言代理的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放语言动作环境中，动作空间的高维性导致奖励稀疏和方差大，阻碍强化学习效果。

Method: 提出ARIA方法，将动作投影到低维意图空间，聚类语义相似动作并共享奖励。

Result: 实验表明ARIA显著降低策略梯度方差，平均性能提升9.95%。

Conclusion: ARIA通过意图空间奖励聚合，有效解决了高维动作空间的奖励稀疏问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to perform complex reasoning
and decision-making through free-form language interactions. However, in
open-ended language action environments (e.g., negotiation or question-asking
games), the action space can be formulated as a joint distribution over tokens,
resulting in an exponentially large action space. Sampling actions in such a
space can lead to extreme reward sparsity, which brings large reward variance,
hindering effective reinforcement learning (RL). To address this, we propose
ARIA, a method that Aggregates Rewards in Intention space to enable efficient
and effective language Agents training. ARIA aims to project natural language
actions from the high-dimensional joint token distribution space into a
low-dimensional intention space, where semantically similar actions are
clustered and assigned shared rewards. This intention-aware reward aggregation
reduces reward variance by densifying reward signals, fostering better policy
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARIA not only
significantly reduces policy gradient variance, but also delivers substantial
performance gains of an average of 9.95% across four downstream tasks,
consistently outperforming offline and online RL baselines.

Motivation: 现有评估框架缺乏领域特定标准、以英语为主，且人工标注复杂。

Method: 引入MSumBench，包含多领域评估标准和多代理辩论系统，评估8个现代摘要模型及大语言模型作为评估者的表现。

Result: 发现模型在不同领域和语言中表现差异，并揭示大语言模型在评估自生成摘要时的系统性偏差。

Conclusion: MSumBench为文本摘要提供了更全面的评估工具，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Evaluation frameworks for text summarization have evolved in terms of both
domain coverage and metrics. However, existing benchmarks still lack
domain-specific assessment criteria, remain predominantly English-centric, and
face challenges with human annotation due to the complexity of reasoning. To
address these, we introduce MSumBench, which provides a multi-dimensional,
multi-domain evaluation of summarization in English and Chinese. It also
incorporates specialized assessment criteria for each domain and leverages a
multi-agent debate system to enhance annotation quality. By evaluating eight
modern summarization models, we discover distinct performance patterns across
domains and languages. We further examine large language models as summary
evaluators, analyzing the correlation between their evaluation and
summarization capabilities, and uncovering systematic bias in their assessment
of self-generated summaries. Our benchmark dataset is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于成本和伦理问题，真实求助者难以参与AI驱动的心理健康研究，因此需要更真实的模拟求助者。

Method: AnnaAgent结合情感调节器和抱怨引发器，并采用三级记忆机制，动态控制模拟配置。

Result: 评估显示AnnaAgent在心理咨询中比现有基线更真实地模拟求助者。

Conclusion: AnnaAgent为心理健康研究提供了更真实的模拟工具，代码已通过伦理审查。

Abstract: Constrained by the cost and ethical concerns of involving real seekers in
AI-driven mental health, researchers develop LLM-based conversational agents
(CAs) with tailored configurations, such as profiles, symptoms, and scenarios,
to simulate seekers. While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving
more realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges:
dynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often
fluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To
address this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent
system equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion
modulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues,
enabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its
tertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term
memory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual,
demonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in
psychological counseling compared to existing baselines. The ethically reviewed
and screened code can be found on https://github.com/sci-m-wang/AnnaAgent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中表情符号的潜在攻击性未被充分研究，尽管它们可能通过上下文或象征意义变得有害。

Method: 系统分析表情符号在攻击性推文中的分布，并提出LLM驱动的多步审核流程，选择性替换有害表情符号。

Result: 人类评估证实该方法有效减少攻击性且不破坏语义，同时揭示了不同攻击类型的异质性效果。

Conclusion: 研究为在线交流和表情符号审核提供了细致见解，展示了LLM在内容审核中的潜力。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become central to modern communication, yet they
also harbor offensive content that challenges platform safety and inclusivity.
While prior research has primarily focused on textual indicators of offense,
the role of emojis, ubiquitous visual elements in online discourse, remains
underexplored. Emojis, despite being rarely offensive in isolation, can acquire
harmful meanings through symbolic associations, sarcasm, and contextual misuse.
In this work, we systematically examine emoji contributions to offensive
Twitter messages, analyzing their distribution across offense categories and
how users exploit emoji ambiguity. To address this, we propose an LLM-powered,
multi-step moderation pipeline that selectively replaces harmful emojis while
preserving the tweet's semantic intent. Human evaluations confirm our approach
effectively reduces perceived offensiveness without sacrificing meaning. Our
analysis also reveals heterogeneous effects across offense types, offering
nuanced insights for online communication and emoji moderation.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于能量的检索器Entriever，用于解决现有检索器模型中知识片段条件独立假设的问题，显著提升了知识检索任务和对话系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索器模型通常假设知识片段是条件独立的，而在知识驱动的对话系统中，多个相关且关联的知识片段可能同时存在。

Method: 提出Entriever，通过能量函数直接建模候选检索结果整体，而非单独建模知识片段，并探索了不同能量函数架构和训练方法。

Result: Entriever在知识检索任务中显著优于强基线模型，并在半监督训练中显著提升了对话系统的端到端性能。

Conclusion: Entriever通过整体建模知识片段相关性，有效提升了检索和对话系统的性能。

Abstract: A retriever, which retrieves relevant knowledge pieces from a knowledge base
given a context, is an important component in many natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. Retrievers have been introduced in knowledge-grounded dialog
systems to improve knowledge acquisition. In knowledge-grounded dialog systems,
when conditioning on a given context, there may be multiple relevant and
correlated knowledge pieces. However, knowledge pieces are usually assumed to
be conditionally independent in current retriever models. To address this
issue, we propose Entriever, an energy-based retriever. Entriever directly
models the candidate retrieval results as a whole instead of modeling the
knowledge pieces separately, with the relevance score defined by an energy
function. We explore various architectures of energy functions and different
training methods for Entriever, and show that Entriever substantially
outperforms the strong cross-encoder baseline in knowledge retrieval tasks.
Furthermore, we show that in semi-supervised training of knowledge-grounded
dialog systems, Entriever enables effective scoring of retrieved knowledge
pieces and significantly improves end-to-end performance of dialog systems.

TLDR: PAKTON是一个开源的多智能体框架，通过协作工作流和检索增强生成技术，实现自动化合同审查，提升准确性、可解释性和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合同审查复杂且耗时，需要法律专业知识，对非专家不友好；合同内容模糊且主观，且通常保密，难以使用专有模型。

Method: PAKTON采用多智能体协作工作流和检索增强生成（RAG）技术，实现端到端的合同分析。

Result: 实验表明，PAKTON在预测准确性、检索性能、可解释性等方面优于通用和预训练模型。

Conclusion: PAKTON为合同审查提供了更易用、灵活且隐私保护的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Contract review is a complex and time-intensive task that typically demands
specialized legal expertise, rendering it largely inaccessible to non-experts.
Moreover, legal interpretation is rarely straightforward-ambiguity is
pervasive, and judgments often hinge on subjective assessments. Compounding
these challenges, contracts are usually confidential, restricting their use
with proprietary models and necessitating reliance on open-source alternatives.
To address these challenges, we introduce PAKTON: a fully open-source,
end-to-end, multi-agent framework with plug-and-play capabilities. PAKTON is
designed to handle the complexities of contract analysis through collaborative
agent workflows and a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component,
enabling automated legal document review that is more accessible, adaptable,
and privacy-preserving. Experiments demonstrate that PAKTON outperforms both
general-purpose and pretrained models in predictive accuracy, retrieval
performance, explainability, completeness, and grounded justifications as
evaluated through a human study and validated with automated metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床任务（如诊断和治疗）需要强大的决策能力，因此需要严格的评估基准来验证LLMs的可靠性。

Method: 通过多步语义遍历医疗知识图谱，生成临床合理但具有误导性的干扰项，增强多选题数据集的难度。

Result: 在六个广泛使用的医疗QA基准测试中，KGGDG显著降低了最先进LLMs的准确率。

Conclusion: KGGDG是一种强大的工具，可用于更稳健和诊断性的医疗LLMs评估。

Abstract: Clinical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment require strong decision-making
abilities, highlighting the importance of rigorous evaluation benchmarks to
assess the reliability of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we
introduce a knowledge-guided data augmentation framework that enhances the
difficulty of clinical multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets by generating
distractors (i.e., incorrect choices that are similar to the correct one and
may confuse existing LLMs). Using our KG-based pipeline, the generated choices
are both clinically plausible and deliberately misleading. Our approach
involves multi-step, semantically informed walks on a medical knowledge graph
to identify distractor paths-associations that are medically relevant but
factually incorrect-which then guide the LLM in crafting more deceptive
distractors. We apply the designed knowledge graph guided distractor generation
(KGGDG) pipline, to six widely used medical QA benchmarks and show that it
consistently reduces the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs. These findings
establish KGGDG as a powerful tool for enabling more robust and diagnostic
evaluations of medical LLMs.

TLDR: 论文提出CombiSearch方法，通过组合优化提升对话状态跟踪（DST）中上下文示例的检索效果，显著提高数据效率和性能上限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索器训练方法存在三个主要问题：未考虑示例的协同效应、未充分融入查询的语言特征、未直接优化DST性能评分。这些问题导致检索器无法有效提升DST性能。

Method: 提出CombiSearch方法，基于组合效应对上下文示例进行评分，优化检索器的训练数据。

Result: 在MultiWOZ数据集上，CombiSearch实现20倍数据效率提升，并在SGD数据集上表现良好；无检索错误假设下，DST性能上限提升12%。

Conclusion: CombiSearch显著提升DST性能，证明现有方法依赖次优数据训练检索器。

Abstract: In dialogue state tracking (DST), in-context learning comprises a retriever
that selects labeled dialogues as in-context examples and a DST model that uses
these examples to infer the dialogue state of the query dialogue. Existing
methods for constructing training data for retrievers suffer from three key
limitations: (1) the synergistic effect of examples is not considered, (2) the
linguistic characteristics of the query are not sufficiently factored in, and
(3) scoring is not directly optimized for DST performance. Consequently, the
retriever can fail to retrieve examples that would substantially improve DST
performance. To address these issues, we present CombiSearch, a method that
scores effective in-context examples based on their combinatorial impact on DST
performance. Our evaluation on MultiWOZ shows that retrievers trained with
CombiSearch surpass state-of-the-art models, achieving a 20x gain in data
efficiency and generalizing well to the SGD dataset. Moreover, CombiSearch
attains a 12% absolute improvement in the upper bound DST performance over
traditional approaches when no retrieval errors are assumed. This significantly
increases the headroom for practical DST performance while demonstrating that
existing methods rely on suboptimal data for retriever training.

Result: 减少口音与语言的混淆，显著提升带口音语音上的性能，同时保持标准LID的表现。

Conclusion: 通过简单方法可显著提升LID模型对带口音语音的适应性。

Abstract: Prior research indicates that LID model performance significantly declines on
accented speech; however, the specific causes, extent, and characterization of
these errors remain under-explored. (i) We identify a common failure mode on
accented speech whereby LID systems often misclassify L2 accented speech as the
speaker's native language or a related language. (ii) We present evidence
suggesting that state-of-the-art models are invariant to permutations of short
spans of speech, implying they classify on the basis of short phonotactic
features indicative of accent rather than language. Our analysis reveals a
simple method to enhance model robustness to accents through input chunking.
(iii) We present an approach that integrates sequence-level information into
our model without relying on monolingual ASR systems; this reduces
accent-language confusion and significantly enhances performance on accented
speech while maintaining comparable results on standard LID.

Method: 结合人工和大语言模型标注，对Craigslist非结构化广告进行分类，并通过地理空间分析和主题建模识别模式。

Result: 发现三种空间模式：冲突的社区定义、边界属性及“声誉洗白”；远离社区中心的房源强调不同设施。

Conclusion: 自然语言处理技术能揭示传统方法忽略的城市空间定义争议。

Abstract: Rental listings offer a unique window into how urban space is socially
constructed through language. We analyze Chicago Craigslist rental
advertisements from 2018 to 2024 to examine how listing agents characterize
neighborhoods, identifying mismatches between institutional boundaries and
neighborhood claims. Through manual and large language model annotation, we
classify unstructured listings from Craigslist according to their neighborhood.
Geospatial analysis reveals three distinct patterns: properties with
conflicting neighborhood designations due to competing spatial definitions,
border properties with valid claims to adjacent neighborhoods, and ``reputation
laundering" where listings claim association with distant, desirable
neighborhoods. Through topic modeling, we identify patterns that correlate with
spatial positioning: listings further from neighborhood centers emphasize
different amenities than centrally-located units. Our findings demonstrate that
natural language processing techniques can reveal how definitions of urban
spaces are contested in ways that traditional methods overlook.

Method: 提出ViToSA数据集，结合ASR和毒性片段检测的管道，用于细粒度识别毒性内容。

Result: 实验显示，在ViToSA上微调ASR模型显著降低转录错误率，文本毒性片段检测模型优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 为越南语语音毒性检测建立了新基准，推动了语音内容审核的未来研究。

Abstract: Toxic speech on online platforms is a growing concern, impacting user
experience and online safety. While text-based toxicity detection is
well-studied, audio-based approaches remain underexplored, especially for
low-resource languages like Vietnamese. This paper introduces ViToSA
(Vietnamese Toxic Spans Audio), the first dataset for toxic spans detection in
Vietnamese speech, comprising 11,000 audio samples (25 hours) with accurate
human-annotated transcripts. We propose a pipeline that combines ASR and toxic
spans detection for fine-grained identification of toxic content. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning ASR models on ViToSA significantly reduces
WER when transcribing toxic speech, while the text-based toxic spans detection
(TSD) models outperform existing baselines. These findings establish a novel
benchmark for Vietnamese audio-based toxic spans detection, paving the way for
future research in speech content moderation.

Result: 在BART和Flan-T5模型上，改进了摘要、翻译和问答任务的校准效果。

Conclusion: 新方法能有效提升生成模型的置信度校准，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Well-calibrated model confidence scores can improve the usefulness of text
generation models. For example, users can be prompted to review predictions
with low confidence scores, to prevent models from returning bad or potentially
dangerous predictions. However, confidence metrics are not always well
calibrated in text generation. One reason is that in generation, there can be
many valid answers, which previous methods do not always account for. Hence, a
confident model could distribute its output probability among multiple
sequences because they are all valid. We propose task-agnostic confidence
metrics suited to generation, which rely solely on the probabilities associated
with the model outputs without the need for further fine-tuning or heuristics.
Using these, we are able to improve the calibration of BART and Flan-T5 on
summarization, translation, and QA datasets.

Result: 最强模型在多答案任务中仅达到41.8%准确率，Choice Funnel提升29%且降低64%推理成本。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前模型的局限性，提出了改进框架，并开源工具以促进多答案推理的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on single-answer
multiple-choice tasks, yet many real-world problems require identifying all
correct answers from a set of options. This capability remains underexplored.
We introduce SATA-BENCH, the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
Select All That Apply (SATA) questions across diverse domains, including
reading comprehension, law, and biomedicine. Our evaluation of 27 open-source
and proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model
achieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify
all correct answers. We find that this weakness stems from two core challenges:
selection bias - models favor certain choices regardless of content, and count
bias - models fail to predict the correct number of answers. To address these
issues, we propose Choice Funnel, a decoding strategy that combines token
debiasing with adaptive thresholding to guide models toward complete and
accurate selections. Choice Funnel achieves up to 29% higher exact match than
competitive baselines while reducing inference cost by over 64%. Our findings
expose fundamental limitations in current LLMs and introduce a new framework
for diagnosing and improving multi-answer reasoning. We release SATA-BENCH and
Choice Funnel to promote LLM development for robust decision-making in
realistic, multi-answer applications.

incorporating audiovisual features for the detection and classification of
stuttering moments, secondary behaviors, and tension scores. In addition to
individual annotations, we additionally provide a test set with highly reliable
annotations based on expert consensus for assessing individual annotators and
machine learning models. Our experiments and analysis illustrate the complexity

annotation, and model training. While Large Language Models have shown promise
in zero-shot IE, performance degrades significantly in unseen domains where
label definitions differ. This paper introduces GUIDEX, a novel method that
automatically defines domain-specific schemas, infers guidelines, and generates
synthetically labeled instances, allowing for better out-of-domain
generalization. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 with GUIDEX sets a new state-of-the-art
across seven zeroshot Named Entity Recognition benchmarks. Models trained with
GUIDEX gain up to 7 F1 points over previous methods without humanlabeled data,
and nearly 2 F1 points higher when combined with it. Models trained on GUIDEX
demonstrate enhanced comprehension of complex, domain-specific annotation
schemas. Code, models, and synthetic datasets are available at

Motivation: 讽刺是幽默的一种形式，但其复杂性对计算模型提出了挑战，研究旨在改进讽刺的分类和生成方法。

Method: 使用MUStARD数据集标注7种讽刺类型，评估零样本、少样本、思维链和情感提示技术，并提出基于情感的生成方法。

Result: Gemini 2.5模型在情感提示下F1得分为0.3664，优于其他方法；人类评估显示情感提示生成效果更佳。

Conclusion: 情感提示技术显著提升讽刺分类和生成效果，为理解人类交流提供了新方法。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a form of humor where expressions convey meanings opposite to
their literal interpretations. Classifying and generating sarcasm using large
language models is vital for interpreting human communication. Sarcasm poses
challenges for computational models, due to its nuanced nature. We introduce
Sarc7, a benchmark that classifies 7 types of sarcasm: self-deprecating,
brooding, deadpan, polite, obnoxious, raging, and manic by annotating entries
of the MUStARD dataset. Classification was evaluated using zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought (CoT), and a novel emotion-based prompting technique. We
propose an emotion-based generation method developed by identifying key
components of sarcasm-incongruity, shock value, and context dependency. Our
classification experiments show that Gemini 2.5, using emotion-based prompting,
outperforms other setups with an F1 score of 0.3664. Human evaluators preferred
our emotion-based prompting, with 38.46% more successful generations than
zero-shot prompting.

Result: STREAM显著优于现有防御技术，攻击成功率降低51.2%，同时保持LLM功能。

Conclusion: STREAM是一种有效的防御机制，能显著减少多轮对话攻击的风险。

Abstract: Malicious attackers can exploit large language models (LLMs) by engaging them
in multi-turn dialogues to achieve harmful objectives, posing significant
safety risks to society. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defense
mechanism: SafeTy Reasoning Elicitation Alignment for Multi-Turn Dialogues
(STREAM). STREAM defends LLMs against multi-turn attacks while preserving their
functional capabilities. Our approach involves constructing a human-annotated
dataset, the Safety Reasoning Multi-turn Dialogues dataset, which is used to
fine-tune a plug-and-play safety reasoning moderator. This model is designed to
identify malicious intent hidden within multi-turn conversations and alert the
target LLM of potential risks. We evaluate STREAM across multiple LLMs against
prevalent multi-turn attack strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms existing defense techniques, reducing the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 51.2%, all while maintaining comparable LLM
capability.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在法律任务中的可靠性，特别是在生成法律论证时的表现，以确保其在实际应用中的可信度。

Method: 通过自动化流程，利用外部LLM提取生成论证中的因素，并与输入案例的真实因素对比，评估LLMs在三种难度递增测试中的表现。

Conclusion: 自动化评估方法揭示了LLMs在法律任务中的局限性，强调了改进因素利用和弃权能力的必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in complex legal tasks
like argument generation, yet their reliability remains a concern. Building
upon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human
evaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM
performance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of
hallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define
hallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case
materials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating
arguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method
employs an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and
compares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case
triples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct
LLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply
argument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3)
recognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared
factors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve
high accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument
generation tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of
relevant factors present in the cases. Critically, on the abstention test (Test
3), most models failed to follow instructions to stop, instead generating
spurious arguments despite the lack of common factors. This automated pipeline
provides a scalable method for assessing these crucial LLM behaviors,
highlighting the need for improvements in factor utilization and robust
abstention capabilities before reliable deployment in legal settings. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有论证数据集难以检测隐含的间接关系（如削弱攻击），需要一种更直观且支持推理的表示方法。

Method: 从基本标注的论证组件和关系出发，构建知识库图，应用假言推理形成论证，最终生成带有丰富属性的AKG。

Result: AKG能识别隐含推理规则和削弱攻击，提供更清晰的论证结构视图，并为未来推理任务（如一致性检查）奠定基础。

Conclusion: AKG框架通过图形化和推理规则标注，支持对隐含关系的推断，为论证分析和修订提供新工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument
knowledge graphs (AKG). Starting with basic annotations of argumentative
components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information
by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes.
Next, we use premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments by
applying modus ponens. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and
edges of the AKG have attributes that capture important argumentative features.
We also find missing inference rules by identifying markers. This makes it
possible to identify undercut attacks that were previously undetectable in
existing datasets. The AKG gives a graphical view of the argumentative
structure that is easier to understand than theoretical formats. It also
prepares the ground for future reasoning tasks, including checking the
coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it
is important to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our
proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, will help
reasoning models learn the implicit indirect relations that require inference
over arguments and the relations between them.

Motivation: 传统端到端语音对话系统需要大量训练数据且生成结果语义不连贯，因此提出一种更高效且语义连贯的训练策略。

Method: 采用链式思维（CoT）方法，确保对话数据训练与多模态语言模型（LM）的预训练任务（如语音识别、文本生成等）对齐。

Result: 在公开数据集（如Switchboard）上训练，仅需300小时数据，ROUGE-1指标提升1.5以上。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且性能优越，适用于小规模数据训练，模型和代码将公开。

Abstract: Unlike traditional cascaded pipelines, end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue
systems preserve full differentiability and capture non-phonemic information,
making them well-suited for modeling spoken interactions. However, existing E2E
approaches often require large-scale training data and generates responses
lacking semantic coherence. We propose a simple yet effective strategy
leveraging a chain-of-thought (CoT) formulation, ensuring that training on
conversational data remains closely aligned with the multimodal language model
(LM)'s pre-training on speech recognition~(ASR), text-to-speech synthesis
(TTS), and text LM tasks. Our method achieves over 1.5 ROUGE-1 improvement over
the baseline, successfully training spoken dialogue systems on publicly
available human-human conversation datasets, while being compute-efficient
enough to train on just 300 hours of public human-human conversation data, such
as the Switchboard. We will publicly release our models and training code.

Abstract: This paper presents a gradient-informed fine-tuning method for large language
models under few-shot conditions. The goal is to enhance task adaptability and
training stability when data is limited. The method builds on a base loss
function and introduces two gradient-related regularization terms. The first
enforces gradient direction consistency to guide parameter updates along
task-relevant directions and prevent drift. The second controls gradient
magnitude to avoid abnormal updates. Together, these components support a more
efficient and stable optimization path. To further improve cross-task
generalization, the method incorporates a gradient alignment mechanism. This
mechanism measures the consistency between optimization directions of the
source and target tasks. It enhances fine-tuning performance in multi-task and
cross-domain scenarios. Across various natural language understanding tasks,
the method outperforms existing fine-tuning strategies in average accuracy,
gradient stability, and directional alignment. Empirical evaluations under
different sample sizes and domain-specific tasks confirm the method's
robustness and broad applicability in low-resource environments. In particular,
the method shows clear advantages in controlling parameter update paths. The
results demonstrate that a gradient-based fine-tuning framework can effectively
leverage the representational power of large language models. It ensures
training stability while reducing dependence on large volumes of labeled data.

narrative frame components across political leanings, and test LLMs in their
ability to predict narrative frames and their components. Finally, we apply our
framework in an unsupervised way to elicit components of narrative framing in a
second domain, the COVID-19 crisis, where our predictions are congruent with
prior theoretical work showing the generalizability of our approach.

Conclusion: Data Swarms能优化多目标组合并泛化至未见的LLM，为评估数据生成提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Data Swarms, an algorithm to optimize the generation of synthetic
evaluation data and advance quantitative desiderata of LLM evaluation. We first
train a swarm of initial data generators using existing data, and define
various evaluation objectives to reflect the desired properties of evaluation
(e.g., generate more difficult problems for the evaluated models) and
quantitatively evaluate data generators. We then employ particle swarm
optimization to optimize the swarm of data generators, where they
collaboratively search through the model parameter space to find new generators
that advance these objectives. We further extend it to Adversarial Swarms,
where the data generator swarm generates harder data while the test taker model
swarm learns from such data, co-evolving dynamically for better data and models
simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Data Swarms outperforms
eight data generation baselines across five evaluation objectives, while
Adversarial Swarms produce more robust learning of synthetic data and stronger
generalization. Further analysis reveals that Data Swarms successfully
optimizes compositions of multiple evaluation objectives and generalizes to new
off-the-shelf LLMs, unseen at optimization time.

Conclusion: 该方法在FL框架下高效实现了PEFT，显著降低了资源消耗，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the de-facto approach in
adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks in Natural Language
Processing. However, its adoption in privacy-preserving distributed learning
frameworks, such as Federated Learning (FL), remains relatively limited. This
is mainly due to challenges specific to FL, such as resource-constrained
devices and diverse data distributions among clients. In this paper, we propose
an efficient method to perform PEFT within the FL framework for Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) based language models. We address the challenges through head
pruning, a novel head-specific weighted aggregation mechanism, and a client
selection strategy. Head pruning minimizes training complexity within the
clients, guided by the importance score computed based on the confidence of the
attention head. Weighted aggregation of heads ensures the global model captures
crucial updates from diverse clients complementing our client selection
strategy. We show results on the MultiNLI benchmark along with 20 Newsgroups,
XL-Sum, and E2E NLG datasets. We use the MultiNLI dataset and T5-small model
with LoRA as our PEFT method, attaining sparsity levels of up to 90%, resulting
in a communication advantage of up to 1.8x and a reduction in training OPs of
3.9x while maintaining the accuracy drop under 2%.

Method: 引入TWC数据集，分析多种翻译技术（如GPT-4、mBART-50等），并通过微调mBART-50来解决偏见和错误。

Result: 现有模型普遍存在性别偏见，尤其是倾向于使用男性代词。微调mBART-50显著改善了这些问题，并超越了专有模型。

Abstract: Addressing gender bias and maintaining logical coherence in machine
translation remains challenging, particularly when translating between natural
gender languages, like English, and genderless languages, such as Persian,
Indonesian, and Finnish. We introduce the Translate-with-Care (TWC) dataset,
comprising 3,950 challenging scenarios across six low- to mid-resource
languages, to assess translation systems' performance. Our analysis of diverse
technologies, including GPT-4, mBART-50, NLLB-200, and Google Translate,
reveals a universal struggle in translating genderless content, resulting in
gender stereotyping and reasoning errors. All models preferred masculine
pronouns when gender stereotypes could influence choices. Google Translate and
GPT-4 showed particularly strong bias, favoring male pronouns 4-6 times more
than feminine ones in leadership and professional success contexts. Fine-tuning
mBART-50 on TWC substantially resolved these biases and errors, led to strong
generalization, and surpassed proprietary LLMs while remaining open-source.
This work emphasizes the need for targeted approaches to gender and semantic
coherence in machine translation, particularly for genderless languages,
contributing to more equitable and accurate translation systems.

TLDR: 研究发现大语言模型（LLMs）在多语言环境下存在隐私泄露风险，并提出通过识别和停用隐私通用神经元和语言特定隐私神经元来降低风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有研究通过隐私神经元等方法缓解隐私泄露风险，但这些方法仅适用于英语环境，无法应对跨语言场景下的隐私泄露问题。

Method: 研究首先分析了跨语言隐私泄露的信息流，发现隐私信息主要在中间层处理，并在后期层转换为语言特定空间时风险最高。随后识别了隐私通用神经元和语言特定隐私神经元。

Result: 通过停用这些神经元，跨语言隐私泄露风险降低了23.3%-31.6%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了跨语言隐私泄露的机制，并提出了一种有效的缓解方法，为多语言环境下的隐私保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive data capture rich information
embedded in the training data. However, this also introduces the risk of
privacy leakage, particularly involving personally identifiable information
(PII). Although previous studies have shown that this risk can be mitigated
through methods such as privacy neurons, they all assume that both the
(sensitive) training data and user queries are in English. We show that they
cannot defend against the privacy leakage in cross-lingual contexts: even if
the training data is exclusively in one language, these (private) models may
still reveal private information when queried in another language. In this
work, we first investigate the information flow of cross-lingual privacy
leakage to give a better understanding. We find that LLMs process private
information in the middle layers, where representations are largely shared
across languages. The risk of leakage peaks when converted to a
language-specific space in later layers. Based on this, we identify
privacy-universal neurons and language-specific privacy neurons.
Privacy-universal neurons influence privacy leakage across all languages, while
language-specific privacy neurons are only related to specific languages. By
deactivating these neurons, the cross-lingual privacy leakage risk is reduced
by 23.3%-31.6%.

Conclusion: 动态分块和问题感知选择显著提升了LLM对长文本的处理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately read and comprehend
extremely long texts. Current methods for improvement typically rely on
splitting long contexts into fixed-length chunks. However, fixed truncation
risks separating semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity and
compromising accurate understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
straightforward approach for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of
long context, facilitating a more streamlined input for LLMs. In particular, we
compute semantic similarities between adjacent sentences, using lower
similarities to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. We
further train a question-aware classifier to select sensitive chunks that are
critical for answering specific questions. Experimental results on both
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that the proposed
approach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, it maintains

TLDR: 本文探讨了使用LLMs作为评判者来评估生物医学关系抽取任务的效果，发现其表现不佳（通常低于50%准确率），并提出结构化输出格式和领域适应技术以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动评估指标在生物医学关系抽取任务中不可靠，而人工评估成本高且耗时，因此需要探索LLMs作为替代评估方法。

Method: 对8个LLMs作为评判者进行基准测试，评估5个其他LLMs在3个生物医学关系抽取数据集上的表现，并提出结构化输出格式和领域适应技术。

Result: LLM评判者在生物医学关系抽取任务中表现较差（通常低于50%准确率），结构化输出格式和领域适应技术分别提升性能约15%。

Conclusion: 结构化输出格式和领域适应技术可显著提升LLM评判者在生物医学关系抽取任务中的性能，为实际应用提供可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
biomedical relation extraction, even in zero-shot scenarios. However,
evaluating LLMs in this task remains challenging due to their ability to
generate human-like text, often producing synonyms or abbreviations of
gold-standard answers, making traditional automatic evaluation metrics
unreliable. On the other hand, while human evaluation is more reliable, it is
costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for real-world applications.
This paper investigates the use of LLMs-as-the-Judge as an alternative
evaluation method for biomedical relation extraction. We benchmark 8 LLMs as
judges to evaluate the responses generated by 5 other LLMs across 3 biomedical
relation extraction datasets. Unlike other text-generation tasks, we observe
that LLM-based judges perform quite poorly (usually below 50% accuracy) in the
biomedical relation extraction task. Our findings reveal that it happens mainly
because relations extracted by LLMs do not adhere to any standard format. To
address this, we propose structured output formatting for LLM-generated
responses that helps LLM-Judges to improve their performance by about 15% (on
average). We also introduce a domain adaptation technique to further enhance
LLM-Judge performance by effectively transferring knowledge between datasets.
We release both our human-annotated and LLM-annotated judgment data (36k
samples in total) for public use here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中缺乏可解释性和可信度，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出KG-TRACES框架，通过监督推理路径和过程，结合知识图谱约束推理。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ任务中分别提升Hits@1和F1分数，并展示跨领域迁移能力。

Conclusion: KG-TRACES显著提升推理性能和可解释性，适用于复杂推理场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural
language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems
remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue,
often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes,
limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we
propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain
Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the
reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and
processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic
relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate
attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At
inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable
scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting
plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design
enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern.
Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that
KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6%
and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1%
in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such
as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we
further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to
more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with
correct answers. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.

Motivation: 提升语言技术的文化能力，但现有研究多依赖合成设置和不完美的文化代理，缺乏与社区的互动。

Method: 通过访谈跨学科研究者，构建研究文化的结构、风格、修辞和引用规范框架，并用计算指标量化这些特征。

Result: 揭示了人类研究论文中的潜在文化规范，并指出LLMs在文化能力上的不足，倾向于同质化写作。

Conclusion: 以人为中心的方法能有效衡量人类和LLM生成文本中的文化规范。

Abstract: Improving cultural competence of language technologies is important. However
most recent works rarely engage with the communities they study, and instead
rely on synthetic setups and imperfect proxies of culture. In this work, we
take a human-centered approach to discover and measure language-based cultural
norms, and cultural competence of LLMs. We focus on a single kind of culture,
research cultures, and a single task, adapting writing across research
cultures. Through a set of interviews with interdisciplinary researchers, who
are experts at moving between cultures, we create a framework of structural,
stylistic, rhetorical, and citational norms that vary across research cultures.
We operationalise these features with a suite of computational metrics and use
them for (a) surfacing latent cultural norms in human-written research papers
at scale; and (b) highlighting the lack of cultural competence of LLMs, and
their tendency to homogenise writing. Overall, our work illustrates the
efficacy of a human-centered approach to measuring cultural norms in
human-written and LLM-generated texts.

Motivation: 现有评估很少测试RAG系统在真实世界噪声、内外检索上下文冲突或快速变化事实下的表现。

Method: 引入RARE框架，结合知识图谱驱动的合成管道（RARE-Get）自动生成多级问题集，构建大规模数据集（RARE-Set）并定义鲁棒性指标（RARE-Met）。

Result: RAG系统对扰动表现出显著脆弱性，文档鲁棒性是最薄弱环节，多跳查询鲁棒性低于单跳查询。

Conclusion: RARE框架为评估RAG系统在动态环境中的鲁棒性提供了统一标准和工具，揭示了其脆弱性，尤其是文档和多跳查询的鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances recency and factuality in
answers. However, existing evaluations rarely test how well these systems cope
with real-world noise, conflicting between internal and external retrieved
contexts, or fast-changing facts. We introduce Retrieval-Aware Robustness
Evaluation (RARE), a unified framework and large-scale benchmark that jointly
stress-tests query and document perturbations over dynamic, time-sensitive
corpora. One of the central features of RARE is a knowledge-graph-driven
synthesis pipeline (RARE-Get) that automatically extracts single and multi-hop
relations from the customized corpus and generates multi-level question sets
without manual intervention. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct a dataset
(RARE-Set) spanning 400 expert-level time-sensitive finance, economics, and
policy documents and 48,322 questions whose distribution evolves as the
underlying sources change. To quantify resilience, we formalize
retrieval-conditioned robustness metrics (RARE-Met) that capture a model's
ability to remain correct or recover when queries, documents, or real-world
retrieval results are systematically altered. Our results show that RAG systems
exhibit surprising vulnerability to perturbations, with document robustness
consistently being the weakest point regardless of generator size or
architecture. RAG systems consistently show lower robustness on multi-hop
queries than single-hop queries across all domains.

Result: 在四个基准测试中，FOCUS显著提升了开源和黑盒模型的性能。

Conclusion: FOCUS通过结合不同认知策略和优化视觉信息，显著提升了视觉问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks in Visual Question Answering (VQA). While current methods have
advanced by incorporating visual prompts, our study uncovers critical
limitations: these approaches indiscriminately annotate all detected objects
for every visual question, generating excessive visual markers that degrade
task performance. This issue stems primarily from a lack of focus on key visual
elements, raising two important questions: Are all objects equally important,
and do all questions require visual prompts? Motivated by Dual Process Theory,
which distinguishes between instinctive and deliberate cognitive modes in human
reasoning, we propose FOCUS, a plug-and-play approach that dynamically adapts
to the complexity of questions, combining fast intuitive judgments with
deliberate analytical reasoning to enhance the vision-language reasoning
capability of the MLLM. For straightforward questions, FOCUS supports efficient
zero-shot reasoning. For more complex tasks, it employs the conceptualizing
before observation strategy to highlight critical elements. Extensive
experiments on four benchmarks, ScienceQA, TextQA, VizWiz, and MME, demonstrate
that FOCUS consistently improves the performance of both open-source and
black-box MLLMs, achieving significant gains across all datasets. Ablation
studies further validate the importance of combining diverse cognitive
strategies with refined visual information for superior performance. Code will
be released.

TLDR: GuessBench是一个评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在模拟人类创造力方面的基准，基于Minecraft游戏数据，展示了其在创造力建模中的挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估VLMs在模拟人类创造力方面的能力，尤其是在嘈杂和多元化的真实场景中。

Method: 从Minecraft游戏“Guess the Build”中收集1500张图像，设计2000个问题，涵盖静态和动态图像设置、不同完整性的自然语言提示等。

Result: GPT-4o在34%的实例中表现不佳，开源模型与API模型之间存在显著性能差距（13.87% vs. 53.93%）。微调推理轨迹可提升视觉感知任务15.36%。

Conclusion: GuessBench揭示了VLMs在创造力建模中的挑战，尤其是对低资源语言和文化背景的不足。

Abstract: We propose GuessBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates Vision Language
Models (VLMs) on modeling the pervasive, noisy, and pluralistic human
creativity. GuessBench sources data from "Guess the Build", an online
multiplayer Minecraft minigame where one player constructs a Minecraft build
given a concept (e.g. caterpillar) and others try to guess it with natural
language hints, presenting a pristine testbed for sensemaking creativity in the
wild with VLMs acting as guessers. We curate 1500 images from the actual
gameplay and design 2000 problems spanning static and dynamic image settings,
natural language hints of varying completeness, and more. Extensive experiments
with six open/API VLMs and five reasoning enhancement approaches demonstrate
that GuessBench presents a uniquely challenging task in creativity modeling:
even the start-of-the-art GPT-4o is incorrect on 34% of instances, while we
observe a huge performance gap (13.87% vs. 53.93% on average) between open and
API models. When used as a resource to improve VLMs, fine-tuning on the
reasoning traces for GuessBench problems improves visual perception tasks by
15.36% on average. Further analysis reveals that VLM performance in creativity
sensemaking correlates with the frequency of the concept in training data,
while the accuracy drops sharply for concepts in underrepresented cultural
contexts and low-resource languages.

Method: 方法包括构建数据集用于英译梵诗歌生成，评估多种生成模型，并探索约束解码和指令微调策略以提高韵律和语义保真度。

Result: 结果显示约束解码策略在生成语法有效的诗歌形式上达到99%以上准确率，指令微调模型在语义和风格对齐上表现更好。

Conclusion: 结论表明LLMs可以通过特定优化在低资源语言中实现高质量的诗歌生成，但需权衡韵律精度和语义对齐。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language generation, including creative tasks like poetry composition.
However, most progress remains concentrated in high-resource languages. This
raises an important question: Can LLMs be adapted for structured poetic
generation in a low-resource, morphologically rich language such as Sanskrit?
In this work, we introduce a dataset designed for translating English prose
into structured Sanskrit verse, with strict adherence to classical metrical
patterns, particularly the Anushtub meter. We evaluate a range of generative
models-both open-source and proprietary-under multiple settings. Specifically,
we explore constrained decoding strategies and instruction-based fine-tuning
tailored to metrical and semantic fidelity. Our decoding approach achieves over
99% accuracy in producing syntactically valid poetic forms, substantially
outperforming general-purpose models in meter conformity. Meanwhile,
instruction-tuned variants show improved alignment with source meaning and
poetic style, as supported by human assessments, albeit with marginal
trade-offs in metrical precision.

Method: 提出OnceEdit，采用插件模型作为编辑模块，结合动态权重机制和集成增强机制，优化知识编辑效果。

Result: 实验表明，OnceEdit在多种LLMs上表现优于现有方法，编辑效率更高，且在多模型场景下具有适应性和稳定性。

Conclusion: OnceEdit为多模型知识编辑提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案，代码将公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast world knowledge but struggle to stay
up-to-date, often leading to errors and hallucinations. Knowledge editing
offers an efficient alternative to retraining, enabling targeted modifications
by updating specific model parameters. However, existing methods primarily
focus on individual models, posing challenges in efficiently updating multiple
models and adapting to new models. To address this, we propose OnceEdit, a
novel ensemble-based approach that employs a plug-in model as the editing
module, enabling stable knowledge updates across multiple models. Building on
the model ensemble, OnceEdit introduces two key mechanisms to enhance its
effectiveness. First, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism through a \weight
token for distinguishing between edit-related and non-edit-related instances,
ensuring the appropriate utilization of knowledge from integrated models.
Second, we incorporate an ensemble enhancement mechanism to mitigate the
excessive reliance on the central model inherent in the model ensemble
technique, making it more suitable for knowledge editing. Extensive experiments
on diverse LLMs demonstrate that OnceEdit consistently outperforms existing
methods while achieving superior editing efficiency. Further analysis confirms
its adaptability and stability in multi-model editing scenarios. Our code will
be available.

Motivation: 探索LLMs中“真实性方向”的普遍性、识别方法及跨上下文泛化能力，以提升模型输出的可信度。

Method: 通过实验验证不同LLMs的真实性方向一致性，并测试真实性探针在逻辑转换、问答任务等场景的泛化能力。

Result: 能力更强的LLMs表现出更一致的真实性方向；真实性探针在多样化任务中有效泛化。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对LLMs内部真实性表示的理解，并为提升模型输出可信度提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive datasets that
encapsulate substantial world knowledge. However, their outputs often include
confidently stated inaccuracies. Earlier works suggest that LLMs encode
truthfulness as a distinct linear feature, termed the "truth direction", which
can classify truthfulness reliably. We address several open questions about the
truth direction: (i) whether LLMs universally exhibit consistent truth
directions; (ii) whether sophisticated probing techniques are necessary to
identify truth directions; and (iii) how the truth direction generalizes across
diverse contexts. Our findings reveal that not all LLMs exhibit consistent
truth directions, with stronger representations observed in more capable
models, particularly in the context of logical negation. Additionally, we
demonstrate that truthfulness probes trained on declarative atomic statements
can generalize effectively to logical transformations, question-answering
tasks, in-context learning, and external knowledge sources. Finally, we explore
the practical application of truthfulness probes in selective
question-answering, illustrating their potential to improve user trust in LLM
outputs. These results advance our understanding of truth directions and
provide new insights into the internal representations of LLM beliefs. Our code

Method: 提出HERGC框架，包括多模态信息检索器和生成式LLM预测器，结合检索与生成方法。

Result: 在三个标准MMKG基准测试中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: HERGC展示了生成式LLM在多模态知识图谱补全中的有效性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) enrich traditional knowledge graphs (KGs)
by incorporating diverse modalities such as images and text. Multi-modal
knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) seeks to exploit these heterogeneous signals
to infer missing facts, thereby mitigating the intrinsic incompleteness of
MMKGs. Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained
in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative
training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion.
Recent generative completion approaches powered by advanced large language
models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities in unimodal knowledge graph
completion, but their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge
this gap, we propose HERGC, a Heterogeneous Experts Representation and
Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous
Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information
and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses
a Generative LLM Predictor fine-tuned on minimal instruction data to accurately
identify the correct answer from these candidates. Extensive experiments on
three standard MMKG benchmarks demonstrate HERGC's effectiveness and
robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 引入包含11,924个复杂问题的COMPKE基准，评估四种知识编辑方法在不同模型上的表现。

Result: 不同方法在不同模型上效果差异显著，如MeLLo在GPT-4O-MINI上准确率为39.47，而在QWEN2.5-3B上仅为3.83。

Conclusion: COMPKE填补了现有基准的不足，揭示了知识编辑方法在不同模型上的性能差异，并提供了数据集供进一步研究。

Abstract: Knowledge Editing, which efficiently modifies the knowledge in large language
models, has gathered great attention. Current benchmarks primarily use
multi-hop question answering to assess and analyze newly injected or updated
knowledge. However, we argue that these benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate
how well the updated models apply this knowledge in real-life scenarios,
particularly when questions require complex reasoning, involving one-to-many
relationships or multi-step logical intersections. To fill in this gap, we
introduce a new benchmark, COMPKE: Complex Question Answering under Knowledge
Editing, which includes 11,924 complex questions that reflect real-life
situations. We conduct an extensive evaluation of four knowledge editing
methods on COMPKE, revealing that their effectiveness varies notably across
different models. For instance, MeLLo attains an accuracy of 39.47 on
GPT-4O-MINI, but this drops sharply to 3.83 on QWEN2.5-3B. We further
investigate the underlying causes of these disparities from both methodological
and model-specific perspectives. The datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在结构化数据（如表格和数据库）上表现不佳，主要原因是预训练中缺乏相关数据和文本到结构的转换机制不灵活。

Method: 提出CoRE框架，结合对比检索增强生成和上下文学习，模拟人类知识迁移，并利用MCTS生成的经验记忆扩展训练数据。

Result: 在Text-to-SQL和TableQA任务上平均提升3.44%和4.24%，最高提升17.2%；经验记忆扩展训练数据8-9倍。

Conclusion: CoRE是一种无需训练且持续的方法，显著提升了LLM在结构化数据任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on plain text tasks
but underperform on structured data like tables and databases. Potential
challenges arise from their underexposure during pre-training and rigid
text-to-structure transfer mechanisms. Unlike humans who seamlessly apply
learned patterns across data modalities, LLMs struggle to infer implicit
relationships embedded in tabular formats, especially in the absence of
explicit structural guidance. To bridge this cognitive gap, we introduce
Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience (CoRE), a framework
that builds experience memory representations and enhances generalization
through contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to simulate human-like knowledge
transfer. Experiments on Text-to-SQL and TableQA show CoRE significantly
improves performance, achieving average gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with up to
17.2% on challenging tasks. Our Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-generated
Experience Memory expands training data 8-9x, enhancing diversity and domain
coverage. This training-free and continual method propels LLMs toward
structured knowledge expertise.

Abstract: We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one
of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for
Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact
pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain
signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and
contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each
sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel
EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and
predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with
teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences.
Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test
samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%.
While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the
feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work
opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the
foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

Abstract: Bidirectional language models have better context understanding and perform
better than unidirectional models on natural language understanding tasks, yet
the theoretical reasons behind this advantage remain unclear. In this work, we
investigate this disparity through the lens of the Information Bottleneck (IB)
principle, which formalizes a trade-off between compressing input information
and preserving task-relevant content. We propose FlowNIB, a dynamic and
scalable method for estimating mutual information during training that
addresses key limitations of classical IB approaches, including computational
intractability and fixed trade-off schedules. Theoretically, we show that
bidirectional models retain more mutual information and exhibit higher
effective dimensionality than unidirectional models. To support this, we
present a generalized framework for measuring representational complexity and
prove that bidirectional representations are strictly more informative under
mild conditions. We further validate our findings through extensive experiments
across multiple models and tasks using FlowNIB, revealing how information is
encoded and compressed throughout training. Together, our work provides a
principled explanation for the effectiveness of bidirectional architectures and
introduces a practical tool for analyzing information flow in deep language

### [399] [L3Cube-MahaEmotions: A Marathi Emotion Recognition Dataset with Synthetic Annotations using CoTR prompting and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00863)
*Nidhi Kowtal,Raviraj Joshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文介绍了L3Cube-MahaEmotions数据集，用于低资源语言马拉地语的情感识别，通过LLM生成训练数据，手动标注验证和测试集，并比较了GPT-4与BERT模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言马拉地语情感识别中标注数据不足的问题。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Translation提示技术，通过翻译和LLM标注生成训练数据，手动标注验证和测试集，并评估GPT-4和BERT模型。

Result: GPT-4在情感识别任务中表现优于微调BERT模型，但BERT模型在合成标签上训练未能超越GPT-4。

Conclusion: 高质量人工标注数据的重要性，以及通用LLM在低资源情感识别任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in low-resource languages like Marathi remains
challenging due to limited annotated data. We present L3Cube-MahaEmotions, a
high-quality Marathi emotion recognition dataset with 11 fine-grained emotion
labels. The training data is synthetically annotated using large language
models (LLMs), while the validation and test sets are manually labeled to serve
as a reliable gold-standard benchmark. Building on the MahaSent dataset, we
apply the Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) prompting technique, where Marathi
sentences are translated into English and emotion labeled via a single prompt.
GPT-4 and Llama3-405B were evaluated, with GPT-4 selected for training data
annotation due to superior label quality. We evaluate model performance using
standard metrics and explore label aggregation strategies (e.g., Union,
Intersection). While GPT-4 predictions outperform fine-tuned BERT models,
BERT-based models trained on synthetic labels fail to surpass GPT-4. This
highlights both the importance of high-quality human-labeled data and the
inherent complexity of emotion recognition. An important finding of this work
is that generic LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3-405B generalize better than
fine-tuned BERT for complex low-resource emotion recognition tasks. The dataset
and model are shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP

*Zhaotian Weng,Haoxuan Li,Kuan-Hao Huang,Jieyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了两个新基准VQA-Causal和VCR-Causal，专门用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）的因果推理能力，发现其在因果推理任务上表现不佳，主要原因是训练数据中缺乏明确的因果关系表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法准确评估VLMs的因果推理能力，因为它们常通过对象识别和活动识别等捷径回答问题，而非真正理解因果关系。

Method: 引入VQA-Causal和VCR-Causal两个新基准，并通过硬负例微调策略提升模型的因果推理能力。

Result: VLMs在因果推理任务上表现较差，仅略高于随机猜测，但通过针对性微调可以改善其能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前VLMs在因果推理上的关键不足，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of vision-language models (VLMs) on
downstream tasks, their ability to understand and reason about causal
relationships in visual inputs remains unclear. Robust causal reasoning is
fundamental to solving complex high-level reasoning tasks, yet existing
benchmarks often include a mixture of reasoning questions, and VLMs can
frequently exploit object recognition and activity identification as shortcuts
to arrive at the correct answers, making it challenging to truly assess their
causal reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce VQA-Causal and
VCR-Causal, two new benchmarks specifically designed to isolate and rigorously
evaluate VLMs' causal reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal that while VLMs
excel in object and activity recognition, they perform poorly on causal
reasoning tasks, often only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further
analysis suggests that this limitation stems from a severe lack of causal
expressions in widely used training datasets, where causal relationships are
rarely explicitly conveyed. We additionally explore fine-tuning strategies with
hard negative cases, showing that targeted fine-tuning can improve model's
causal reasoning while maintaining generalization and downstream performance.
Our study highlights a key gap in current VLMs and lays the groundwork for
future work on causal understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: CC-Tuning是一种新的多语言微调范式，通过在潜在层面显式建立跨语言连接机制，提升大语言模型的多语言能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型因英语为中心的语料库导致多语言能力不平衡，现有数据级微调方法忽略了潜在层面的跨语言交互。

Method: CC-Tuning在训练中融合英语和非英语输入的激活，并通过可训练的决策模块识别有益激活；推理时使用变换矩阵模拟跨语言连接。

Result: 在22种语言的六个基准测试中，CC-Tuning优于传统微调方法，并成为数据级增强的潜在替代方案。

Conclusion: CC-Tuning展示了潜在层面跨语言交互的潜力，可提升大语言模型的多语言性能。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often exhibit imbalanced multilingual
capabilities due to their English-centric training corpora. To address this,
existing fine-tuning approaches operating at the data-level (e.g., through data
augmentation or distillation) typically introduce implicit cross-lingual
alignment, overlooking the potential for more profound, latent-level
cross-lingual interactions. In this work, we propose CC-Tuning, a novel
multilingual fine-tuning paradigm that explicitly establishes a cross-lingual
connection mechanism at the latent level. During training, CC-Tuning fuses the
feed forward activations from both English and non-English inputs, enabling the
model to benefit from both linguistic resources. This process is facilitated
with a trainable Decision Maker that identifies beneficial activations.
Furthermore, during inference, a Transform Matrix is utilized to simulate the
cross-lingual connection under monolingual setting through representation
transformation. Our experiments on six benchmarks covering 22 languages show
that CC-Tuning outperforms vanilla SFT and offers a strong latent-level
alternative to data-level augmentation methods. Further analysis also
highlights the practicality of CC-Tuning and the potential of latent-level
cross-lingual interactions in advancing the multilingual performance of LLMs.

*Yixin Wan,Anil Ramakrishna,Kai-Wei Chang,Volkan Cevher,Rahul Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出选择性遗忘（SU）方法，仅针对目标文档中与不需要信息相关的关键子集进行遗忘，而非所有标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统遗忘方法会无差别地更新模型参数以遗忘目标文档中的所有标记，包括携带通用知识的常见标记（如代词、介词等），但并非所有标记都需要遗忘。

Method: 提出选择性遗忘（SU），识别遗忘集中与不需要信息相关的关键子集，仅对这些标记进行遗忘。

Result: 在两个基准和六种基线遗忘算法上的实验表明，SU不仅有效遗忘目标数据，还显著保留了模型在保留集中的效用。

Conclusion: 选择性遗忘（SU）是一种更高效的遗忘方法，能够精准遗忘不需要的信息，同时保留模型的通用知识。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning has recently gained significant
attention, driven by the need to remove unwanted information, such as private,
sensitive, or copyrighted content, from LLMs. However, conventional unlearning
approaches indiscriminately update model parameters to forget all tokens in a
target document, including common tokens (e.g., pronouns, prepositions, general
nouns) that carry general knowledge. In this paper, we highlight that not every
token needs forgetting. We propose Selective Unlearning (SU), which identifies
a critical subset of tokens within the forgetting set that is relevant to the
unwanted information, and unlearns only those tokens. Experiments on two
benchmarks and six baseline unlearning algorithms demonstrate that SU not only
achieves effective unlearning on the targeted forget data, but also
significantly preserves the model's utility in the retaining set.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为MLLM Interview（MITV）的策略，通过少量问题快速评估多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于全面测试MLLM在大规模数据上的能力耗时耗资源，作者希望通过更高效的方法快速评估模型性能。

Method: 1. 构建带有难度标签的面试数据集；2. 提出MITV策略，通过少量问题初步评估模型性能，并逐步测试其极限。

Result: 实验表明，MITV策略在MLLM基准数据集上表现良好，能通过少量问答快速评估模型能力。

Conclusion: MITV策略是一种高效且资源节约的MLLM评估方法。

Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) has led to a
wide range of MLLM applications, and a number of benchmark datasets have sprung
up in order to assess MLLM abilities. However, full-coverage Q&A testing on
large-scale data is resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this
issue, we propose the MLLM Interview (MITV) strategy, which aims to quickly
obtain MLLM performance metrics by quizzing fewer question. First, First, we
constructed the interview dataset, which was built on an existing MLLM
assessment dataset, by adding difficulty labels based on the performance of
some typical MLLMs in this dataset. Second, we propose an MLLM Interview
strategy, which obtains an initial performance situation of the large model by
quizzing a small number of topics and then continuously tries to test the
model's limits. Through extensive experiments, the result shows that the MITV
strategy proposed in this paper performs well on MLLM benchmark datasets, and
it is able to obtain the model evaluation capability faster through a small
number of questions and answers.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了A4Bench基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在感知环境行动可能性（affordance）方面的能力，发现现有模型表现有限，尤其是动态和上下文相关的affordance感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索MLLMs在感知环境行动可能性方面的能力，这是实现直观和安全交互的关键，但目前尚未充分研究。

Method: 方法是通过构建A4Bench基准，包含1,282个问题对评估固有属性（Constitutive Affordance）和718个问题对评估动态和上下文属性（Transformative Affordance），并评估了17个MLLMs的表现。

Result: 结果表明，专有模型优于开源模型，但所有模型表现均有限，尤其是Transformative Affordance感知。最佳模型Gemini-2.0-Pro准确率为18.05%，远低于人类表现（81.25%-85.34%）。

Conclusion: 结论是MLLMs在环境理解方面存在显著不足，A4Bench为提升AI系统的上下文感知能力提供了基础。

Abstract: Affordance theory posits that environments inherently offer action
possibilities that shape perception and behavior. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, their ability to
perceive affordance, which is crucial for intuitive and safe interactions,
remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce A4Bench, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate the affordance perception abilities of MLLMs across two
dimensions: 1) Constitutive Affordance}, assessing understanding of inherent
object properties through 1,282 question-answer pairs spanning nine
sub-disciplines, and 2) Transformative Affordance, probing dynamic and
contextual nuances (e.g., misleading, time-dependent, cultural, or
individual-specific affordance) with 718 challenging question-answer pairs.
Evaluating 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) against human
performance, we find that proprietary models generally outperform open-source
counterparts, but all exhibit limited capabilities, particularly in
transformative affordance perception. Furthermore, even top-performing models,
such as Gemini-2.0-Pro (18.05% overall exact match accuracy), significantly lag
behind human performance (best: 85.34%, worst: 81.25%). These findings
highlight critical gaps in environmental understanding of MLLMs and provide a
foundation for advancing AI systems toward more robust, context-aware
interactions. The dataset is available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs的社交智能及其与人类的差异，填补现有工作在结果导向和过程导向评估上的空白。

Method: 通过手工编写叙事脚本构建SocialEval基准，每个脚本以世界树结构组织，包含由人际能力驱动的剧情线。

Result: 实验表明LLMs在社交智能上落后于人类，表现出亲社会性，并倾向于积极社交行为，即使导致目标失败。LLMs的表示空间和神经元激活分析显示其具有类似人脑的能力特定功能分区。

Conclusion: SocialEval为LLMs的社交智能评估提供了新范式，揭示了LLMs与人类在社交行为上的差异及其潜在的神经机制。

Abstract: LLMs exhibit promising Social Intelligence (SI) in modeling human behavior,
raising the need to evaluate LLMs' SI and their discrepancy with humans. SI
equips humans with interpersonal abilities to behave wisely in navigating
social interactions to achieve social goals. This presents an operational
evaluation paradigm: outcome-oriented goal achievement evaluation and
process-oriented interpersonal ability evaluation, which existing work fails to
address. To this end, we propose SocialEval, a script-based bilingual SI
benchmark, integrating outcome- and process-oriented evaluation by manually
crafting narrative scripts. Each script is structured as a world tree that
contains plot lines driven by interpersonal ability, providing a comprehensive
view of how LLMs navigate social interactions. Experiments show that LLMs fall
behind humans on both SI evaluations, exhibit prosociality, and prefer more
positive social behaviors, even if they lead to goal failure. Analysis of LLMs'
formed representation space and neuronal activations reveals that LLMs have
developed ability-specific functional partitions akin to the human brain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的方法在自然语言与SQL程序之间存在语义鸿沟，导致准确性受限。

Method: Pi-SQL首先生成提供细粒度指导的Python程序，再基于这些指导生成SQL程序，并通过候选策略选择最优结果。

Result: Pi-SQL的执行准确性和速度显著优于基线方法，执行准确率提升高达3.20，效率评分提升4.55。

Conclusion: Pi-SQL通过Python程序作为中介，有效缩小了自然语言与SQL之间的语义差距，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL transforms the user queries from natural language to executable
SQL programs, enabling non-experts to interact with complex databases. Existing
prompt-based methods craft meticulous text guidelines and examples to
facilitate SQL generation, but their accuracy is hindered by the large semantic
gap between the texts and the low-resource SQL programs. In this work, we
propose Pi-SQL, which incorporates the high-resource Python program as a pivot
to bridge between the natural language query and SQL program. In particular,
Pi-SQL first generates Python programs that provide fine-grained step-by-step
guidelines in their code blocks or comments, and then produces an SQL program
following the guidance of each Python program.The final SQL program matches the
reference Python program's query results and, through selection from candidates
generated by different strategies, achieves superior execution speed, with a
reward-based valid efficiency score up to 4.55 higher than the best-performing
baseline.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Pi-SQL, which
improves the execution accuracy of the best-performing baseline by up to 3.20.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Transformer模型是否能够像人类一样表示复合词的组合性。

Method: 通过六种组合性模型（加法、乘法、回归等）评估嵌入模型的组合性，并使用合成数据集验证。

Result: 岭回归模型表现最佳，经典向量加法模型接近最优；大多数嵌入模型高度组合，BERT表现较差。

Conclusion: 嵌入模型在组合性方面表现良好，但BERT表现不佳，研究为组合性提供了深入分析。

Abstract: Compositionality is a key aspect of human intelligence, essential for
reasoning and generalization. While transformer-based models have become the de
facto standard for many language modeling tasks, little is known about how they
represent compound words, and whether these representations are compositional.
In this study, we test compositionality in Mistral, OpenAI Large, and Google
embedding models, and compare them with BERT. First, we evaluate
compositionality in the representations by examining six diverse models of
compositionality (addition, multiplication, dilation, regression, etc.). We
find that ridge regression, albeit linear, best accounts for compositionality.
Surprisingly, we find that the classic vector addition model performs almost as
well as any other model. Next, we verify that most embedding models are highly
compositional, while BERT shows much poorer compositionality. We verify and
visualize our findings with a synthetic dataset consisting of fully transparent
adjective-noun compositions. Overall, we present a thorough investigation of
compositionality.

Motivation: 现有ECG-focused MLLMs主要局限于单一任务和输入格式，未能充分利用MLLMs的潜力。

Method: 构建anyECG数据集，提出anyECG-chat模型，支持动态长度和多ECG输入，采用三阶段课程训练方法。

Result: anyECG-chat模型支持多种实际应用场景，包括报告生成、异常波形定位和多ECG比较分析。

Conclusion: anyECG-chat模型扩展了ECG分析的适用范围，为家庭环境和临床实践提供了更灵活的工具。

Abstract: The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked interest
in their application to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing
ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to
single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the
potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that
supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However,
existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first
constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks,
including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended
question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced
long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG
comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we
propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and
multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum
training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was
conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various
practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation
tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead
ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple
ECGs.

Motivation: 讽刺检测在语音中因数据稀缺和多模态依赖而受限，需开发仅依赖语音的解决方案。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和LLaMA 3对公开讽刺播客进行初始标注，人类验证解决分歧，并通过协作门控架构验证标注质量。

Result: 构建了PodSarc数据集，检测模型F1分数为73.63%。

Conclusion: 提出的标注流程和数据集为讽刺检测研究提供了有效基准。

Abstract: Sarcasm fundamentally alters meaning through tone and context, yet detecting
it in speech remains a challenge due to data scarcity. In addition, existing
detection systems often rely on multimodal data, limiting their applicability
in contexts where only speech is available. To address this, we propose an
annotation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a
sarcasm dataset. Using a publicly available sarcasm-focused podcast, we employ
GPT-4o and LLaMA 3 for initial sarcasm annotations, followed by human
verification to resolve disagreements. We validate this approach by comparing
annotation quality and detection performance on a publicly available sarcasm
dataset using a collaborative gating architecture. Finally, we introduce
PodSarc, a large-scale sarcastic speech dataset created through this pipeline.
The detection model achieves a 73.63% F1 score, demonstrating the dataset's
potential as a benchmark for sarcasm detection research.

Motivation: 传统方法仅关注文本质量，忽视教育目标，且无法满足复杂多维需求。

Method: 提出EQPR方法，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和大型语言模型，采用“计划-评估-优化”流程迭代优化问题生成。

Result: 实验表明EQPR在多维教育目标的问题生成上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: EQPR能有效生成符合教育目标的高质量数学问题，填补了传统方法的不足。

Abstract: Automatically generating high-quality mathematical problems that align with
educational objectives is a crucial task in NLP-based educational technology.
Traditional generation methods focus primarily on textual quality, but they
often overlook educational objectives. Moreover, these methods address only
single-dimensional, simple question generation, failing to meet complex,
multifaceted educational requirements. To address these challenges, we
constructed and annotated EduMath, a dataset of 16k mathematical questions with
multi-dimensional educational objectives. Based on this dataset, we developed
EQGEVAL, which incorporates three evaluation dimensions and is designed to
assess the ability of models to generate educational questions. Drawing
inspiration from teachers' problem design processes, we propose the Educational
Question Planning with self-Reflection (EQPR) method for educational
mathematical question generation, following a "plan-evaluate-optimize"
approach. Specifically, by combining planning algorithm based on Monte Carlo
Tree Search with the generative capabilities of Large Language Models, we
continuously optimize questions through iterative feedback. This
self-optimization mechanism ensures that the generated questions both fit the
educational context and strategically achieve specific basic educational
objectives. Through extensive experiments based on EQGEVAL, we have
demonstrated that EQPR achieves significant improvements in generating
questions that meet multi-dimensional educational objectives.

Result: 模型在管理未授权数据请求时表现差异显著，但能有效处理合法查询。

Conclusion: 为敏感性感知语言模型提供了基准测试基础，并为企业环境中的隐私中心AI系统提供改进建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming valuable to corporate
data management due to their ability to process text from various document
formats and facilitate user interactions through natural language queries.
However, LLMs must consider the sensitivity of information when communicating
with employees, especially given access restrictions. Simple filtering based on
user clearance levels can pose both performance and privacy challenges. To
address this, we propose the concept of sensitivity awareness (SA), which
enables LLMs to adhere to predefined access rights rules. In addition, we
developed a benchmarking environment called ACCESS DENIED INC to evaluate SA.
Our experimental findings reveal significant variations in model behavior,
particularly in managing unauthorized data requests while effectively
addressing legitimate queries. This work establishes a foundation for
benchmarking sensitivity-aware language models and provides insights to enhance
privacy-centric AI systems in corporate environments.

Result: 评估六种流行LLMs和两种防御策略，揭示了安全漏洞及鲁棒性与表达自由之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 分级安全指标对构建可信LLMs至关重要，XGUARD提供了更全面的风险评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate content spanning ideological
rhetoric to explicit instructions for violence. However, existing safety
evaluations often rely on simplistic binary labels (safe and unsafe),
overlooking the nuanced spectrum of risk these outputs pose. To address this,
we present XGUARD, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to assess the
severity of extremist content generated by LLMs. XGUARD includes 3,840 red
teaming prompts sourced from real world data such as social media and news,
covering a broad range of ideologically charged scenarios. Our framework
categorizes model responses into five danger levels (0 to 4), enabling a more
nuanced analysis of both the frequency and severity of failures. We introduce
the interpretable Attack Severity Curve (ASC) to visualize vulnerabilities and
compare defense mechanisms across threat intensities. Using XGUARD, we evaluate
six popular LLMs and two lightweight defense strategies, revealing key insights
into current safety gaps and trade-offs between robustness and expressive
freedom. Our work underscores the value of graded safety metrics for building
trustworthy LLMs.

Motivation: 受GPT-4o启发，研究者希望提升语音语言模型（SLMs）的自然对话能力，但现有方法未充分利用双通道语音数据的潜力。

Method: 提出Next-Token-Pair Prediction（NTPP）方法，首次在解码器架构中实现说话者无关的双通道语音对话学习。

Result: NTPP在标准测试中显著提升了SLMs的对话能力，包括轮转预测、响应连贯性和自然性，同时降低了推理延迟。

Conclusion: NTPP为语音语言模型的双通道对话学习提供了高效且实用的解决方案，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest
in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken
interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of
several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current
approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently
captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we
systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of
modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling
paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent
dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the
first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical
results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the
conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response
coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP
achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical

TLDR: LEMONADE是一个大规模多语言冲突事件数据集，基于ACLED数据重新标注，并提出抽象事件提取（AEE）和抽象实体链接（AEL）方法，评估了多种大语言模型（LLMs）和零样本系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言来源事件分析的挑战，提升全球冲突事件的标准化和跨语言理解。

Method: 引入AEE和AEL方法，通过整体文档理解检测事件参数和实体，并评估LLMs和零样本系统（如ZEST）。

Result: 最佳零样本系统的端到端F1得分为58.3%，ZEST在AEL任务中F1得分为45.7%，但仍落后于监督系统。

Conclusion: 零样本方法有潜力但需进一步研究以缩小与监督系统的差距。

Abstract: This paper presents LEMONADE, a large-scale conflict event dataset comprising
39,786 events across 20 languages and 171 countries, with extensive coverage of
region-specific entities. LEMONADE is based on a partially reannotated subset
of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), which has documented
global conflict events for over a decade.
  To address the challenge of aggregating multilingual sources for global event
analysis, we introduce abstractive event extraction (AEE) and its subtask,
abstractive entity linking (AEL). Unlike conventional span-based event
extraction, our approach detects event arguments and entities through holistic
document understanding and normalizes them across the multilingual dataset. We
evaluate various large language models (LLMs) on these tasks, adapt existing
zero-shot event extraction systems, and benchmark supervised models.
Additionally, we introduce ZEST, a novel zero-shot retrieval-based system for
AEL.
  Our best zero-shot system achieves an end-to-end F1 score of 58.3%, with LLMs
outperforming specialized event extraction models such as GoLLIE. For entity
linking, ZEST achieves an F1 score of 45.7%, significantly surpassing OneNet, a
state-of-the-art zero-shot baseline that achieves only 23.7%. However, these
zero-shot results lag behind the best supervised systems by 20.1% and 37.0% in
the end-to-end and AEL tasks, respectively, highlighting the need for further
research.

TLDR: 研究探讨自监督模型学习的语音表征是否具有语言特异性，发现荷兰语预训练能更好地编码荷兰语的语言特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练语言对自监督模型学习语言特征的影响，尤其是荷兰语的语音和词汇信息。

Method: 测试Wav2Vec2模型内部表征对荷兰语特征的编码能力，比较不同预训练数据（荷兰语、英语、多语言）的效果。

Result: 荷兰语预训练显著提升荷兰语特征的编码效果，优于英语或多语言预训练，且与下游语音识别性能一致。

Conclusion: 语言特异性预训练能增强模型对目标语言特征的编码能力，对下游任务有积极影响。

Abstract: How language-specific are speech representations learned by self-supervised
models? Existing work has shown that a range of linguistic features can be
successfully decoded from end-to-end models trained only on speech recordings.
However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages
improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of
Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of
self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the
representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on
similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This
language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or
classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics.
Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding
aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理大规模日记语料时效果不佳，因此需要更高效的方法来提取和分析日记写作的意图。

Method: 使用不同的大语言模型（包括GPT-4o和o1-mini）对日记进行目的识别和聚类，并与模板基线方法对比。

Result: GPT-4o和o1-mini表现最佳，而模板基线效果较差。研究还分析了作者性别、年龄和写作年份对目的的影响，并探讨了模型的错误类型。

Conclusion: 该方法在日记分析中表现出色，但仍需进一步改进模型的局限性。

Abstract: Diary analysis presents challenges, particularly in extracting meaningful
information from large corpora, where traditional methods often fail to deliver
satisfactory results. This study introduces a novel method based on Large
Language Models (LLMs) to identify and cluster the various purposes of diary
writing. By "purposes," we refer to the intentions behind diary writing, such
as documenting life events, self-reflection, or practicing language skills. Our
approach is applied to Soviet-era diaries (1922-1929) from the Prozhito digital
archive, a rich collection of personal narratives. We evaluate different
proprietary and open-source LLMs, finding that GPT-4o and o1-mini achieve the
best performance, while a template-based baseline is significantly less
effective. Additionally, we analyze the retrieved purposes based on gender, age
of the authors, and the year of writing. Furthermore, we examine the types of
errors made by the models, providing a deeper understanding of their
limitations and potential areas for improvement in future research.

Abstract: Access to humanities research databases is often hindered by the limitations
of traditional interaction formats, particularly in the methods of searching
and response generation. This study introduces an LLM-based smart assistant
designed to facilitate natural language communication with digital humanities
data. The assistant, developed in a chatbot format, leverages the RAG approach
and integrates state-of-the-art technologies such as hybrid search, automatic
query generation, text-to-SQL filtering, semantic database search, and
hyperlink insertion. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, experiments
were conducted to assess the response quality of various language models. The
testing was based on the Prozhito digital archive, which contains diary entries
from predominantly Russian-speaking individuals who lived in the 20th century.
The chatbot is tailored to support anthropology and history researchers, as
well as non-specialist users with an interest in the field, without requiring
prior technical training. By enabling researchers to query complex databases
with natural language, this tool aims to enhance accessibility and efficiency
in humanities research. The study highlights the potential of Large Language
Models to transform the way researchers and the public interact with digital
archives, making them more intuitive and inclusive. Additional materials are

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains
a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how
fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical
evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the
geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of
training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a
contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during
training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights
into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically,
the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training
capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task,
overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as
illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a
practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany
and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to
provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of
fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when
configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work
contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and
generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms
and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种名为“图探测”的方法，用于揭示大型语言模型（LLM）神经元的功能连接拓扑结构，并研究其与语言生成性能的关系。研究发现，神经拓扑结构可以普遍预测下一个标记的性能，且这种预测性在仅保留1%的神经元连接或模型仅经过8次预训练步骤时依然稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对LLM的神经元表示与可解释语义的关联已有研究，但神经元如何通过功能共激活产生涌现能力仍不清楚，这阻碍了对LLM的深入理解和安全开发。

Method: 通过分析不同LLM家族和规模的内部神经图，研究神经拓扑结构与语言生成性能的关系。

Result: 研究发现神经拓扑结构可以普遍预测下一个标记的性能，且这种预测性在极稀疏的连接或早期训练阶段依然稳健。不同LLM尽管在架构、参数和训练数据上有显著差异，但仍会发展出复杂且一致的神经拓扑结构。

Conclusion: 神经拓扑结构的早期形成和一致性可能是LLM语言生成能力的基础，这为深入理解和开发LLM提供了新视角。

Abstract: Probing large language models (LLMs) has yielded valuable insights into their
internal mechanisms by linking neural representations to interpretable
semantics. However, how neurons functionally co-activate with each other to
give rise to emergent capabilities remains largely unknown, hindering a deeper
understanding and safer development of LLMs. In this work, we introduce graph
probing, a method for uncovering the functional connectivity topology of LLM
neurons and relating it to language generation performance. By analyzing
internal neural graphs across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a
universal predictability of next-token prediction performance using only neural
topology. This predictability is robust even when retaining just 1% of neuron
connections or probing models after only 8 pretraining steps, highlighting the
sparsity and early emergence of topological patterns. Further graph matching
analysis suggests that, despite significant distinctions in architectures,
parameters, and training data, different LLMs develop intricate and consistent
neural topological structures that may form the foundation for their language
generation abilities. Codes and data for the graph probing toolbox are released
at https://github.com/DavyMorgan/llm-graph-probing.

TLDR: SealQA是一个新的基准测试，用于评估语言模型在事实性问题上的表现，尤其是在搜索结果冲突或嘈杂的情况下。它包含三个版本：Seal-0、Seal-Hard和LongSeal。当前前沿模型在SealQA上表现不佳，且增加计算资源并未显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在面临冲突或嘈杂的搜索结果时表现不佳，因此需要一个专门的基准测试来评估和改进模型的能力。

Method: SealQA设计了三个测试集：Seal-0（最具挑战性的问题）、Seal-Hard（评估事实准确性和推理能力）和LongSeal（测试长上下文和多文档推理）。

Result: 前沿模型在SealQA上表现较差，例如Seal-0上最高准确率仅为17.1%。增加计算资源未能显著提升性能，且模型对嘈杂搜索结果敏感。

Conclusion: SealQA揭示了当前模型的局限性，并提供了一个公开数据集以推动未来研究。

Abstract: We introduce SealQA, a new challenge benchmark for evaluating
SEarch-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search
yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results. SealQA comes in three flavors:
(1) Seal-0 (main) and (2) Seal-Hard, which assess factual accuracy and
reasoning capabilities, with Seal-0 focusing on the most challenging questions
where chat models (e.g., GPT-4.1) typically achieve near-zero accuracy; and (3)
LongSeal, which extends SealQA to test long-context, multi-document reasoning
in "needle-in-a-haystack" settings. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations
in current models: Even frontier LLMs perform poorly across all SealQA flavors.
On Seal-0, frontier agentic models equipped with tools like o3 and o4-mini
achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy, respectively, at their best reasoning
efforts. We find that advanced reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B and
o3-mini are highly vulnerable to noisy search results. Notably, increasing
test-time compute does not yield reliable gains across o3-mini, o4-mini, and
o3, with performance often plateauing or even declining early. Additionally,
while recent models are less affected by the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, they
still fail to reliably identify relevant documents in LongSeal when faced with
numerous distractors. To facilitate future work, we release SealQA at
huggingface.co/datasets/vtllms/sealqa.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在多编程语言和英语混合环境中的概念空间结构，填补了现有研究在单语言环境中的不足。

Method: 使用两个基于Llama的模型对21对PLs进行少样本翻译任务，解码中间层嵌入并分析神经元激活。

Result: 发现概念空间更接近英语（包括PL关键词），语言特定神经元集中在底层，而PL专属神经元出现在顶层；高度对齐的PLs难以识别语言特定神经元。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs内部表示PLs的结构模式，为理解模型概念空间提供了新视角。

Abstract: Several studies have explored the mechanisms of large language models (LLMs)
in coding tasks, but most have focused on programming languages (PLs) in a
monolingual setting. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between
multiple PLs and English in the concept space of LLMs. We perform a few-shot
translation task on 21 PL pairs using two Llama-based models. By decoding the
embeddings of intermediate layers during this task, we observe that the concept
space is closer to English (including PL keywords) and assigns high
probabilities to English tokens in the second half of the intermediate layers.
We analyze neuron activations for 11 PLs and English, finding that while
language-specific neurons are primarily concentrated in the bottom layers,
those exclusive to each PL tend to appear in the top layers. For PLs that are
highly aligned with multiple other PLs, identifying language-specific neurons
is not feasible. These PLs also tend to have a larger keyword set than other
PLs and are closer to the model's concept space regardless of the input/output
PL in the translation task. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs
internally represent PLs, revealing structural patterns in the model's concept
space. Code is available at https://github.com/cisnlp/code-specific-neurons.

TLDR: zip2zip是一个动态调整LLM词汇表的框架，通过压缩令牌减少序列长度，提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态令牌化器在领域或语言特定输入上效率低，导致计算成本高。

Method: 基于LZW压缩的令牌化器、运行时嵌入层和因果语言建模变体。

Result: 输入输出序列长度减少20-60%，推理延迟显著改善。

Conclusion: zip2zip能高效适应动态词汇表，提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Tokenization efficiency plays a critical role in the performance and cost of
large language models (LLMs), yet most models rely on static tokenizers
optimized for general-purpose corpora. These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies
often fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer
token sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a
framework that enables LLMs to dynamically adjust token vocabulary at inference
time, allowing for fewer generated tokens and thus faster inference. zip2zip
consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch
(LZW) compression that incrementally compresses tokens into reusable
"hypertokens" on the fly; (2) an embedding layer that computes embeddings for
newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a causal language modeling variant
that trains the model to operate on hypertokenized, compressed sequences. We
show that an existing LLM can be zip2zip-fied in 10 GPU-hours via
parameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting zip2zip LLMs effectively learn to
use hypertokens at inference time, reducing input and output sequence length by
20-60\%, with significant improvements in inference latency.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注名词和第三人称代词的共指解析，而忽略了指代词的特殊挑战，因此本研究填补了这一空白。

Method: 研究通过构建包含1600个多选题的英语指代词数据集，评估了GPT-4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet等领先LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs对某些指代词（如I）表现优异，但对其他指代词（如you、here、tomorrow）表现较差；句法线索（如引号）对不同指代词的影响不一致。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在处理指代词时的局限性，并提出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in
tasks related to coreference resolution. However, previous studies mostly
assessed LLM performance on coreference resolution with nouns and third person
pronouns. This study evaluates LLM performance on coreference resolution with
indexical like I, you, here and tomorrow, which come with unique challenges due
to their linguistic properties. We present the first study examining how LLMs
interpret indexicals in English, releasing the English Indexical Dataset with
1600 multiple-choice questions. We evaluate pioneering LLMs, including GPT-4o,
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and DeepSeek V3. Our results reveal that
LLMs exhibit an impressive performance with some indexicals (I), while
struggling with others (you, here, tomorrow), and that syntactic cues (e.g.
quotation) contribute to LLM performance with some indexicals, while they
reduce performance with others. Code and data are available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在生成事实性错误或虚构回答方面存在问题，影响了其可信度和广泛应用。因此，需要一种方法让LLMs能够准确识别不可回答问题并生成可靠响应。

Method: RUL结合了判别性不可回答预测头和LLM生成核心，采用多阶段学习策略，包括监督微调（基于Enhanced-CAsT-Answerability数据集）和强化学习（RLHF）阶段。

Result: 实验表明，RUL在不可回答检测和适当拒绝生成方面表现优异，同时在可回答问题上也保持强性能。人类评估进一步验证了其有效性和可信度提升。

Conclusion: RUL为构建更可靠、以用户为中心的对话AI系统提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The pervasive deployment of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI
systems has revolutionized information access, yet their propensity for
generating factually unsupported or hallucinated responses remains a critical
impediment to trustworthiness and widespread adoption. This paper introduces
Reinforced Unanswerability Learning (RUL), a novel hybrid training paradigm
designed to imbue LLMs with the intrinsic capability to accurately detect
unanswerable questions and generate reliably appropriate responses. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on external classifiers or simple prompting,
RUL integrates a discriminative unanswerability prediction head with the LLM's
generative core, guided by a multi-stage learning strategy. This includes
supervised fine-tuning on a novel, richly annotated dataset,
Enhanced-CAsT-Answerability (ECA), which features hierarchical answerability
labels and ground-truth refusal responses. Crucially, RUL incorporates a
subsequent reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase to refine
the nuance, helpfulness, and informativeness of refusal responses. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RUL's superior performance, achieving significantly
higher accuracy in unanswerability detection across sentence, paragraph, and
ranking levels, and substantially increasing the generation of appropriate
refusals for unanswerable queries, alongside strong performance on answerable
questions. Human evaluations further corroborate RUL's effectiveness,
highlighting a marked improvement in perceived helpfulness and trustworthiness,
ultimately paving the way for more reliable and user-centric conversational AI.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated that systems
trained solely on text can acquire extensive world knowledge, develop reasoning
capabilities, and internalize abstract semantic concepts--showcasing properties
that can be associated with general intelligence. This raises an intriguing
question: Do such concepts emerge in models trained on other modalities, such
as speech? Furthermore, when models are trained jointly on multiple modalities:
Do they develop a richer, more structured semantic understanding? To explore
this, we analyze the conceptual structures learned by speech and textual models
both individually and jointly. We employ Latent Concept Analysis, an
unsupervised method for uncovering and interpreting latent representations in
neural networks, to examine how semantic abstractions form across modalities.
For reproducibility we made scripts and other resources available to the
community.

Abstract: System-generated logs are typically converted into categorical log templates
through parsing. These templates are crucial for generating actionable insights
in various downstream tasks. However, existing parsers often fail to capture
fine-grained template details, leading to suboptimal accuracy and reduced
utility in downstream tasks requiring precise pattern identification. We
propose a character-level log parser utilizing a novel neural architecture that
aggregates character embeddings. Our approach estimates a sequence of
binary-coded decimals to achieve highly granular log templates extraction. Our
low-resource character-level parser, tested on revised Loghub-2k and a manually
annotated industrial dataset, matches LLM-based parsers in accuracy while
outperforming semantic parsers in efficiency.

Motivation: 目前大多数MD模型针对英语等主流语言，而低资源语言如芬兰瑞典语缺乏相关工具，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用多语言wav2vec 2.0模型，结合熵正则化、温度缩放和top-k归一化，优化MD任务。方法简单且语言无关。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于低资源语言，且仅需少量L2数据，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Mispronunciation detection (MD) models are the cornerstones of many language
learning applications. Unfortunately, most systems are built for English and
other major languages, while low-resourced language varieties, such as Finland
Swedish (FS), lack such tools. In this paper, we introduce our MD model for FS,
trained on 89 hours of first language (L1) speakers' spontaneous speech and
tested on 33 minutes of L2 transcribed read-aloud speech.
  We trained a multilingual wav2vec 2.0 model with entropy regularization,
followed by temperature scaling and top-k normalization after the inference to
better adapt it for MD. The main novelty of our method lies in its simplicity,
requiring minimal L2 data. The process is also language-independent, making it
suitable for other low-resource languages. Our proposed algorithm allows us to
balance Recall (43.2%) and Precision (29.8%), compared with the baseline
model's Recall (77.5%) and Precision (17.6%).

*Byung-Doh Oh,Hongao Zhu,William Schuler*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究发现，预训练语言模型的规模与其对人类阅读时间的预测能力呈负相关，且数据泄漏并非主要原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练语言模型对人类阅读时间预测能力下降是否由数据泄漏引起。

Method: 通过两项研究：1）分析五个自然阅读时间语料库在预训练数据中的泄漏情况；2）使用泄漏极少的模型验证模型规模与预测能力的关系。

Result: 数据泄漏较少，且模型规模与预测能力负相关，表明先前结果不受数据泄漏影响。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型规模增大导致预测能力下降，与数据泄漏无关。

Abstract: In psycholinguistic modeling, surprisal from larger pre-trained language
models has been shown to be a poorer predictor of naturalistic human reading
times. However, it has been speculated that this may be due to data leakage
that caused language models to see the text stimuli during training. This paper
presents two studies to address this concern at scale. The first study reveals
relatively little leakage of five naturalistic reading time corpora in two
pre-training datasets in terms of length and frequency of token $n$-gram
overlap. The second study replicates the negative relationship between language
model size and the fit of surprisal to reading times using models trained on
'leakage-free' data that overlaps only minimally with the reading time corpora.
Taken together, this suggests that previous results using language models
trained on these corpora are not driven by the effects of data leakage.

*Eran Hirsch,Aviv Slobodkin,David Wan,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal,Ido Dagan*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为LAQuer的新任务，用于将生成文本的特定部分与源文本对应，以提高归因的细粒度和用户导向性。通过比较两种方法（LLM提示和内部表示）并扩展现有框架，实验表明LAQuer显著减少了归因文本长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归因方法要么过于笼统（句子级别），要么过于精确（子句级别），无法满足用户需求。LAQuer旨在提供细粒度且用户导向的归因。

Method: 提出LAQuer任务，比较两种方法（LLM提示和内部表示），并扩展现有框架。在多文档摘要和长形式问答任务中评估。

Result: LAQuer方法显著减少了归因文本长度。

Conclusion: LAQuer任务提升了归因的可用性，提出了建模框架和评估设置，为未来细粒度归因研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Grounded text generation models often produce content that deviates from
their source material, requiring user verification to ensure accuracy. Existing
attribution methods associate entire sentences with source documents, which can
be overwhelming for users seeking to fact-check specific claims. In contrast,
existing sub-sentence attribution methods may be more precise but fail to align
with users' interests. In light of these limitations, we introduce Localized
Attribution Queries (LAQuer), a new task that localizes selected spans of
generated output to their corresponding source spans, allowing fine-grained and
user-directed attribution. We compare two approaches for the LAQuer task,
including prompting large language models (LLMs) and leveraging LLM internal
representations. We then explore a modeling framework that extends existing
attributed text generation methods to LAQuer. We evaluate this framework across
two grounded text generation tasks: Multi-document Summarization (MDS) and
Long-form Question Answering (LFQA). Our findings show that LAQuer methods
significantly reduce the length of the attributed text. Our contributions
include: (1) proposing the LAQuer task to enhance attribution usability, (2)
suggesting a modeling framework and benchmarking multiple baselines, and (3)
proposing a new evaluation setting to promote future research on localized
attribution in content-grounded generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在低资源语言和文化特定任务中的表现不足，以实现更公平的AI应用。

Method: 提出CG-CoT，结合密集向量检索文化背景与显式推理序列，并在约鲁巴谚语解释任务中验证。

Result: CG-CoT在文化对齐准确性和深度上显著优于传统方法，同时揭示了BLEU等指标与文化相关性之间的差异。

Conclusion: 需重新思考低资源NLP的评估方法，CG-CoT为文化相关任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with culturally-specific reasoning
tasks, particularly in low-resource languages, hindering their global
applicability. Addressing this gap is crucial for equitable AI deployment. We
introduce Culturally-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (CG-CoT), a novel prompting
strategy that combines dense vector retrieval of cultural context with explicit
reasoning sequences. Our extensive experiments on Yoruba proverb interpretation
demonstrate that CG-CoT provides significantly higher culturally-aligned
accuracy and depth than traditional prompting methods, validated through both
automated metrics and LLM-based evaluations. Notably, we uncover stark
disparities between token-level translation metrics like BLEU and human-judged
cultural relevance, suggesting a rethinking of evaluation approaches for
low-resource NLP.

TLDR: 论文提出了CoBRA框架和CHARM数据集，用于量化非合作性话语的战略效果，并评估了LLMs在此类任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补对非合作性话语系统性理解的空白，研究语言在对抗性环境中的战略使用。

Method: 引入CoBRA框架和三个可解释指标（BaT、PaT、NRBaT），并使用CHARM数据集进行验证。

Result: LLMs在战略语言理解上表现有限，模型规模提升性能，但推理能力反而导致过度复杂和内部混乱。

Conclusion: LLMs在非合作性话语理解上仍有不足，需进一步优化。

Abstract: Language is often used strategically, particularly in high-stakes,
adversarial settings, yet most work on pragmatics and LLMs centers on
cooperativity. This leaves a gap in systematic understanding of non-cooperative
discourse. To address this, we introduce CoBRA (Cooperation-Breach Response
Assessment), along with three interpretable metrics -- Benefit at Turn (BaT),
Penalty at Turn (PaT), and Normalized Relative Benefit at Turn (NRBaT) -- to
quantify the perceived strategic effects of discourse moves. We also present
CHARM, an annotated dataset of real courtroom cross-examinations, to
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Using these tools, we evaluate a
range of LLMs and show that LLMs generally exhibit limited pragmatic
understanding of strategic language. While model size shows an increase in
performance on our metrics, reasoning ability does not help and largely hurts,
introducing overcomplication and internal confusion.

TLDR: 提出一种改进的稀疏自编码器架构，显式建模概念语义层次，提升重建效果、可解释性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏字典学习未利用概念间的语义关系，限制了其表达能力。

Method: 改进的稀疏自编码器架构，显式建模概念语义层次。

Result: 在大型语言模型上验证了语义层次的可学习性，提升重建效果、可解释性和计算效率。

Conclusion: 显式建模语义层次能有效改进稀疏自编码器的性能。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (and, in particular, sparse autoencoders) attempts
to learn a set of human-understandable concepts that can explain variation on
an abstract space. A basic limitation of this approach is that it neither
exploits nor represents the semantic relationships between the learned
concepts. In this paper, we introduce a modified SAE architecture that
explicitly models a semantic hierarchy of concepts. Application of this
architecture to the internal representations of large language models shows
both that semantic hierarchy can be learned, and that doing so improves both
reconstruction and interpretability. Additionally, the architecture leads to
significant improvements in computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了提示范式的局限性，并展示了语言模型在不同层如何编码歧义。代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Detecting ambiguity is important for language understanding, including
uncertainty estimation, humour detection, and processing garden path sentences.
We assess language models' sensitivity to ambiguity by introducing an
adversarial ambiguity dataset that includes syntactic, lexical, and
phonological ambiguities along with adversarial variations (e.g., word-order
changes, synonym replacements, and random-based alterations). Our findings show
that direct prompting fails to robustly identify ambiguity, while linear probes
trained on model representations can decode ambiguity with high accuracy,
sometimes exceeding 90\%. Our results offer insights into the prompting
paradigm and how language models encode ambiguity at different layers. We
release both our code and data: https://github.com/coastalcph/lm_ambiguity.

TLDR: 提出基于Mamba的新型drafters，结合外部drafters的灵活性和自推测方法的效率，通过线性结构和树搜索算法提升LLM生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在灵活性和效率之间存在权衡，外部drafters灵活但速度慢，自推测方法高效但需重新训练。

Method: 利用Mamba（SSM）的线性结构避免二次复杂度，结合树搜索算法生成高质量候选。

Result: Mamba-based drafters在速度和内存效率上优于外部方法，与自推测方法相当且保持跨模型适应性。

Conclusion: Mamba-based drafters是高效、灵活且适应性强的解决方案，适用于LLM加速生成。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising approach to accelerating
large language model (LLM) generation using a fast drafter while maintaining
alignment with the target model's distribution. However, existing approaches
face a trade-off: external drafters offer flexibility but can suffer from
slower drafting, while self-speculation methods use drafters tailored to the
target model but require re-training. In this paper, we introduce novel
drafters based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art state space model (SSM), as a
solution that combines the best aspects of both approaches. By leveraging the
linear structure of SSMs, our approach avoids the quadratic complexity inherent
in traditional Transformer-based methods, enabling faster drafting and lower
memory usage while maintaining the flexibility to work across different target
models. We further enhance efficiency with a novel test-time tree search
algorithm for generating high-quality draft candidates. Our empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mamba-based drafters not only outperform existing
external drafting methods but are also comparable to state-of-the-art
self-speculation approaches while using less memory and maintaining their
cross-model adaptability.

TLDR: REFORM是一种新型推理框架，通过两阶段方法高效处理长上下文，显著提升性能并降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的普及，处理超出预训练上下文限制的长上下文成为关键挑战。现有方法在信息保留或内存资源消耗方面存在不足。

Method: REFORM采用两阶段方法：1）增量处理输入块并维护压缩KV缓存；2）通过相似性匹配识别关键令牌并选择性重计算KV缓存。

Result: 在1M上下文长度下，REFORM在RULER和BABILong上分别实现50%和27%的性能提升，并在其他基准测试中表现优异，同时减少30%推理时间和5%峰值内存使用。

Conclusion: REFORM在高效性和性能上均优于基线方法，适用于多样化任务和领域。

Abstract: As large language models increasingly gain popularity in real-world
applications, processing extremely long contexts, often exceeding the model's
pre-trained context limits, has emerged as a critical challenge. While existing
approaches to efficient long-context processing show promise, recurrent
compression-based methods struggle with information preservation, whereas
random access approaches require substantial memory resources. We introduce
REFORM, a novel inference framework that efficiently handles long contexts
through a two-phase approach. First, it incrementally processes input chunks
while maintaining a compressed KV cache, constructs cross-layer context
embeddings, and utilizes early exit strategy for improved efficiency. Second,
it identifies and gathers essential tokens via similarity matching and
selectively recomputes the KV cache. Compared to baselines, REFORM achieves
over 50% and 27% performance gains on RULER and BABILong respectively at 1M
context length. It also outperforms baselines on Infinite-Bench and MM-NIAH,
demonstrating flexibility across diverse tasks and domains. Additionally,
REFORM reduces inference time by 30% and peak memory usage by 5%, achieving
both efficiency and superior performance.

Method: 构建KoGEM基准，包含1.5k选择题，对27种LLMs进行零样本评估。

Result: LLMs在简单任务表现良好，但在需要实际经验的任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: KoGEM揭示了LLMs的局限性，为提升语言理解能力提供了方向。

Abstract: We introduce the $\underline{Ko}rean \underline{G}rammar
\underline{E}valuation Bench\underline{M}ark (KoGEM)$, designed to assess the
linguistic competence of LLMs and humans in Korean. KoGEM consists of 1.5k
multiple-choice QA pairs covering five main categories and 16 subcategories.
The zero-shot evaluation of 27 LLMs of various sizes and types reveals that
while LLMs perform remarkably well on straightforward tasks requiring primarily
definitional knowledge, they struggle with tasks that demand the integration of
real-world experiential knowledge, such as phonological rules and
pronunciation. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis suggests that incorporating
such experiential knowledge could enhance the linguistic competence of LLMs.
With KoGEM, we not only highlight the limitations of current LLMs in linguistic
competence but also uncover hidden facets of LLMs in linguistic competence,
paving the way for enhancing comprehensive language understanding. Our code and
dataset are available at: https://github.com/SungHo3268/KoGEM.

Result: 测试11个LLMs，表现不佳（最高F1仅26.8%），模型能生成相关内容但准确性不足，CLEAR可由开源模型高效实现。

Conclusion: ExpertLongBench和CLEAR为专家级任务提供了实用评估工具，现有LLMs需显著改进，CLEAR框架具有可扩展性和低成本优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces ExpertLongBench, an expert-level benchmark containing
11 tasks from 9 domains that reflect realistic expert workflows and
applications. Beyond question answering, the application-driven tasks in
ExpertLongBench demand long-form outputs that can exceed 5,000 tokens and
strict adherence to domain-specific requirements. Notably, each task in
ExpertLongBench includes a rubric, designed or validated by domain experts, to
specify task requirements and guide output evaluation. Furthermore, we propose
CLEAR, an evaluation framework that supports accurate evaluation of long-form
model outputs in our benchmark. To achieve fine-grained, expert-aligned
evaluation, CLEAR derives checklists from both model outputs and references by
extracting information corresponding to items in the task-specific rubric.
Checklist items for model outputs are then compared with corresponding items
for reference outputs to assess their correctness, enabling grounded
evaluation. We benchmark 11 large language models (LLMs) and analyze components
in CLEAR, showing that (1) existing LLMs, with the top performer achieving only
a 26.8% F1 score, require significant improvement for expert-level tasks; (2)
models can generate content corresponding to the required aspects, though often
not accurately; and (3) accurate checklist extraction and comparison in CLEAR
can be achieved by open-weight models for more scalable and low-cost usage.

Motivation: 中医的隐式推理、多样文本形式和缺乏标准化为计算建模和评估带来挑战，现有基准在中医领域不足。

Method: 开发了MTCMB，包含12个子数据集，涵盖知识问答、语言理解、诊断推理、处方生成和安全性评估五大类。

Result: 当前模型在基础知识上表现良好，但在临床推理、处方规划和安全性合规方面不足。

Conclusion: MTCMB为开发更可靠的中医AI系统提供了急需的领域对齐基准。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a holistic medical system with
millennia of accumulated clinical experience, playing a vital role in global
healthcare-particularly across East Asia. However, the implicit reasoning,
diverse textual forms, and lack of standardization in TCM pose major challenges
for computational modeling and evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable potential in processing natural language across diverse
domains, including general medicine. Yet, their systematic evaluation in the
TCM domain remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks either focus narrowly on
factual question answering or lack domain-specific tasks and clinical realism.
To fill this gap, we introduce MTCMB-a Multi-Task Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs
on TCM Knowledge, Reasoning, and Safety. Developed in collaboration with
certified TCM experts, MTCMB comprises 12 sub-datasets spanning five major
categories: knowledge QA, language understanding, diagnostic reasoning,
prescription generation, and safety evaluation. The benchmark integrates
real-world case records, national licensing exams, and classical texts,
providing an authentic and comprehensive testbed for TCM-capable models.
Preliminary results indicate that current LLMs perform well on foundational
knowledge but fall short in clinical reasoning, prescription planning, and
safety compliance. These findings highlight the urgent need for domain-aligned
benchmarks like MTCMB to guide the development of more competent and
trustworthy medical AI systems. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are

Method: 方法包括结合和扩展两个现有数据集（目标和状态）的注释，设计条件推理任务，并测试不同LLM的表现。

Result: 结果显示，条件在上下文缺失时有用，不同模型在生成和识别条件的能力上差异显著，GPT-4o等大模型在约束较少时表现更谨慎。

Conclusion: 结论指出条件推理有助于验证结果，但模型能力差异显著，大模型在不确定情境下更保守。

Abstract: Knowing which latent conditions lead to a particular outcome is useful for
critically examining claims made about complex event outcomes. Identifying
implied conditions and examining their influence on an outcome is challenging.
We handle this by combining and augmenting annotations from two existing
datasets consisting of goals and states, and explore the influence of
conditions through our research questions and Condition-based Reasoning tasks.
We examine open and closed LLMs of varying sizes and intent-alignment on our
reasoning tasks and find that conditions are useful when not all context is
available. Models differ widely in their ability to generate and identify
outcome-variant conditions which affects their performance on outcome
validation when conditions are used to replace missing context. Larger models
like GPT-4o, are more cautious in such less constrained situations.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于双数组Trie和标记-压缩垃圾回收原则的内存优化框架，显著降低了FastText的内存占用，同时保持嵌入质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FastText在处理大规模工业部署时存在哈希冲突导致语义漂移和内存需求过高的问题。

Method: 通过双数组Trie结构和标记-压缩垃圾回收原则，系统性地合并语义相似的嵌入，实现4:1到10:1的压缩比。

Result: 在3000万中文词汇数据集上，内存从100GB降至30GB，性能几乎无损。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了成本，提高了模型加载速度和可靠性。

Abstract: FastText has established itself as a fundamental algorithm for learning word
representations, demonstrating exceptional capability in handling
out-of-vocabulary words through character-level n-gram embeddings. However, its
hash-based bucketing mechanism introduces critical limitations for large-scale
industrial deployment: hash collisions cause semantic drift, and memory
requirements become prohibitively expensive when dealing with real-world
vocabularies containing millions of terms. This paper presents a comprehensive
memory optimization framework that fundamentally reimagines FastText's memory
management through the integration of double-array trie (DA-trie) structures
and mark-compact garbage collection principles. Our approach leverages the
linguistic insight that n-grams sharing common prefixes or suffixes exhibit
highly correlated embeddings due to co-occurrence patterns in natural language.
By systematically identifying and merging semantically similar embeddings based
on structural relationships, we achieve compression ratios of 4:1 to 10:1 while
maintaining near-perfect embedding quality. The algorithm consists of four
sophisticated phases: prefix trie construction with embedding mapping,
prefix-based similarity compression, suffix-based similarity compression, and
mark-compact memory reorganization. Comprehensive experiments on a 30-million
Chinese vocabulary dataset demonstrate memory reduction from over 100GB to
approximately 30GB with negligible performance degradation. Our industrial
deployment results show significant cost reduction, faster loading times, and
improved model reliability through the elimination of hash collision artifacts.

Motivation: 解决端到端语音识别模型对训练数据词汇的偏倚问题，尤其是专有名词和未知词汇的识别不准确。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练现有模型，可轻松应用于大规模模型，显著提升罕见词识别性能。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in end-to-end speech recognition methods, the output
tends to be biased to the training data's vocabulary, resulting in inaccurate
recognition of proper nouns and other unknown terms. To address this issue, we
propose a method to improve recognition accuracy of such rare words in
CTC-based models without additional training or text-to-speech systems.
Specifically, keyword spotting is performed using acoustic features of
intermediate layers during inference, and a bias is applied to the subsequent
layers of the acoustic model for detected keywords. For keyword detection, we
adopt a wildcard CTC that is both fast and tolerant of ambiguous matches,
allowing flexible handling of words that are difficult to match strictly. Since
this method does not require retraining of existing models, it can be easily
applied to even large-scale models. In experiments on Japanese speech
recognition, the proposed method achieved a 29% improvement in the F1 score for
unknown words.

TLDR: 论文探讨了上下文学习（ICL）在长文本生成任务中的不足，提出LongGuide方法，通过生成任务语言和格式的并行指导流提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL在长文本生成任务中表现不佳，需要明确的任务分布指导以提升模型性能。

Method: 提出LongGuide方法，生成Metric Guidelines（MGs）和Output Constraint Guidelines（OCGs）两套指导流，自动选择最佳组合。

Result: LongGuide显著提升开源和闭源LLM的性能，零样本和少样本设置下均提高5%以上。

Conclusion: LongGuide具有通用性，可被弱模型学习以增强强模型，并能与自动提示优化器协同工作。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is an important yet not fully understood ability of
pre-trained large language models (LLMs). It can greatly enhance task
performance using a few examples, termed demonstrations, without fine-tuning.
Although effective in question answering, ICL often underperforms in long-form
generation tasks such as summarization. Under appropriately realistic
assumptions, we empirically and theoretically show that ICL demonstrations
alone are insufficient to teach LLMs the task language and format distributions
for generation. We argue for explicit exposure to the task distributions and
hypothesize that defining them by prompting enhances model performance. To this
end, we present LongGuide, which efficiently generates two parallel streams of
guidelines capturing task language and format properties: (i) Metric Guidelines
(MGs) that instruct models to optimize self-evaluated metrics; and (ii) Output
Constraint Guidelines (OCGs) that constrain generation at both token and
sentence levels. LongGuide automatically selects the best combination of
guidelines, improving both strong open- and closed-source LLMs by over 5% in
both zero- and few-shot settings. We show that LongGuide is generalizable,
learnable by weak models to enhance strong ones, and integrates synergistically
with automatic prompt optimizers.

TLDR: 提出了一种轻量级干预方法，利用预训练的校准模型引导LLM生成无毒内容，避免传统方法的高计算成本和性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM去毒方法依赖大规模数据训练或模型参数修改，计算成本高且可能影响模型流畅性和上下文理解。

Method: 使用预训练的紧凑校准模型，通过轻量级干预在生成过程中引导LLM，学习无毒嵌入空间。

Result: 在基准数据集上验证，该方法有效降低毒性，同时保持内容表达的流畅性。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，适用于多种LLM，无需重复训练且不影响性能。

Abstract: Existing approaches for Large language model (LLM) detoxification generally
rely on training on large-scale non-toxic or human-annotated preference data,
designing prompts to instruct the LLM to generate safe content, or modifying
the model parameters to remove toxic information, which are computationally
expensive, lack robustness, and often compromise LLMs' fluency and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for
LLM detoxification, which leverages a compact, pre-trained calibration model
that guides the detoxification process of a target LLM via a lightweight
intervention in its generation pipeline. By learning a detoxified embedding
space from non-toxic data, the calibration model effectively steers the LLM
away from generating harmful content. This approach only requires a one-time
training of the calibration model that is able to be seamlessly applied to
multiple LLMs without compromising fluency or contextual understanding.
Experiment results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach
reduces toxicity while maintaining reasonable content expression.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为SPT的统一自适应文本到结构生成框架，通过将预定义模式视为参数化工具，解决了UIE在模式选择与生成中的适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UIE在预定义模式与动态模式生成之间缺乏适应性，尤其是在模式选择较多时。

Method: SPT框架将模式视为参数化工具，支持模式检索、填充和生成，统一了封闭、开放和按需IE任务。

Result: 实验表明SPT能自适应处理四种IE任务，性能与现有系统相当，但参数更少。

Conclusion: SPT通过模式参数化工具化，显著提升了UIE的适应性和效率。

Abstract: Universal information extraction (UIE) primarily employs an extractive
generation approach with large language models (LLMs), typically outputting
structured information based on predefined schemas such as JSON or tables. UIE
suffers from a lack of adaptability when selecting between predefined schemas
and on-the-fly schema generation within the in-context learning paradigm,
especially when there are numerous schemas to choose from. In this paper, we
propose a unified adaptive text-to-structure generation framework, called
Schema as Parameterized Tools (SPT), which reimagines the tool-calling
capability of LLMs by treating predefined schemas as parameterized tools for
tool selection and parameter filling. Specifically, our SPT method can be
applied to unify closed, open, and on-demand IE tasks by adopting Schema
Retrieval by fetching the relevant schemas from a predefined pool, Schema
Filling by extracting information and filling slots as with tool parameters, or
Schema Generation by synthesizing new schemas with uncovered cases. Experiments
show that the SPT method can handle four distinct IE tasks adaptively,
delivering robust schema retrieval and selection performance. SPT also achieves
comparable extraction performance to LoRA baselines and current leading UIE
systems with significantly fewer trainable parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非英语社区缺乏标准化医学基准的问题，确保语言模型在医疗领域的应用质量。

Method: 利用可验证的医学考试和临床记录构建基准，并由医学专家标注。

Result: 发布了包含公开样本集（4k题）、完整公开集（10k题）和私有集（2k题）的基准，支持多语言扩展。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至其他语言，开源数据构建流程以支持未来多语言医学基准的开发。

Abstract: Medical benchmarks are indispensable for evaluating the capabilities of
language models in healthcare for non-English-speaking communities,therefore
help ensuring the quality of real-life applications. However, not every
community has sufficient resources and standardized methods to effectively
build and design such benchmark, and available non-English medical data is
normally fragmented and difficult to verify. We developed an approach to tackle
this problem and applied it to create the first Vietnamese medical question
benchmark, featuring 14,000 multiple-choice questions across 34 medical
specialties. Our benchmark was constructed using various verifiable sources,
including carefully curated medical exams and clinical records, and eventually
annotated by medical experts. The benchmark includes four difficulty levels,
ranging from foundational biological knowledge commonly found in textbooks to
typical clinical case studies that require advanced reasoning. This design
enables assessment of both the breadth and depth of language models' medical
understanding in the target language thanks to its extensive coverage and
in-depth subject-specific expertise. We release the benchmark in three parts: a
sample public set (4k questions), a full public set (10k questions), and a
private set (2k questions) used for leaderboard evaluation. Each set contains
all medical subfields and difficulty levels. Our approach is scalable to other
languages, and we open-source our data construction pipeline to support the
development of future multilingual benchmarks in the medical domain.

globally. Future public health efforts must attempt to understand such content,
what concerns it may raise among readers, and how to effectively respond to it.
To this end, we present ConcernScope, a platform that uses a teacher-student
framework for knowledge transfer between large language models and light-weight
classifiers to quickly and effectively identify the health concerns raised in a
text corpus. The platform allows uploading massive files directly,
automatically scraping specific URLs, and direct text editing. ConcernScope is
built on top of a taxonomy of public health concerns. Intended for public
health officials, we demonstrate several applications of this platform: guided
data exploration to find useful examples of common concerns found in online
community datasets, identification of trends in concerns through an example
time series analysis of 186,000 samples, and finding trends in topic frequency
before and after significant events.

Motivation: 当前的情景学习方法在可扩展性和集成性上存在不足，尤其是对中等规模语言模型（7B参数）效果有限。大型语言模型（70-405B参数）虽具备更强的抽象能力，但缺乏有效利用经验流的机制。

Method: 结合蒙特卡洛树搜索进行结构化经验收集，并采用新型蒸馏方法，保留语言模型固有能力的同时嵌入情景记忆。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样化的规划和问答任务中超越了现有最先进的专有语言模型3.45%，且在深层模型层中任务对齐显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂规划场景中表现出稳定的泛化能力，而基线方法在这些条件下表现显著下降。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) require robust episodic grounding-the capacity to learn
from and apply past experiences-to excel at physical planning tasks. Current
episodic grounding approaches struggle with scalability and integration,
limiting their effectiveness, especially for medium-sized LMs (7B parameters).
While larger LMs (70-405B parameters) possess superior hierarchical
representations and extensive pre-trained knowledge, they encounter a
fundamental scale paradox: despite their advanced abstraction capabilities,
they lack efficient mechanisms to leverage experience streams. We propose a
scalable weak-to-strong episodic learning framework that effectively transfers
episodic behaviors from smaller to larger LMs. This framework integrates Monte
Carlo tree search for structured experience collection with a novel
distillation method, preserving the inherent LM capabilities while embedding
episodic memory. Experiments demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art
proprietary LMs by 3.45% across diverse planning and question-answering tasks.
Layer-wise probing further indicates significant improvements in task
alignment, especially within deeper LM layers, highlighting stable
generalization even for previously unseen scenarios with increased planning
complexity-conditions where baseline methods degrade markedly.

Motivation: 心理支持热线需求增加，但大语言模型在情感敏感场景中的能力尚不明确，需评估其潜力。

Method: 使用PsyCrisisBench（540条标注热线记录）评估64种模型，涵盖零样本、少样本和微调范式，通过F1分数和统计检验分析性能。

Result: 模型在自杀倾向检测（F1=0.880）和风险评估（F1=0.907）中表现优异，情绪识别较弱（F1=0.709）。微调后的小模型（Qwen2.5-1.5B）超越大模型。开源模型接近闭源性能（p>0.3）。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在结构化心理危机评估中潜力显著，情绪识别仍需改进。开源模型与量化技术为实际部署提供可行性。PsyCrisisBench为模型开发和伦理部署提供框架。

Abstract: Psychological support hotlines are critical for crisis intervention but face
significant challenges due to rising demand. Large language models (LLMs) could
support crisis assessments, yet their capabilities in emotionally sensitive
contexts remain unclear. We introduce PsyCrisisBench, a benchmark of 540
annotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline,
assessing four tasks: mood status recognition, suicidal ideation detection,
suicide plan identification, and risk assessment. We evaluated 64 LLMs across
15 families (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) using zero-shot,
few-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms. Performance was measured by F1-score, with
statistical comparisons via Welch's t-tests. LLMs performed strongly on
suicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), suicide plan identification (F1=0.779),
and risk assessment (F1=0.907), improved with few-shot and fine-tuning. Mood
status recognition was more challenging (max F1=0.709), likely due to lost
vocal cues and ambiguity. A fine-tuned 1.5B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B)
surpassed larger models on mood and suicidal ideation. Open-source models like
QwQ-32B performed comparably to closed-source on most tasks (p>0.3), though
closed models retained an edge in mood detection (p=0.007). Performance scaled
with size up to a point; quantization (AWQ) reduced GPU memory by 70% with
minimal F1 degradation. LLMs show substantial promise in structured
psychological crisis assessments, especially with fine-tuning. Mood recognition
remains limited due to contextual complexity. The narrowing gap between open-
and closed-source models, combined with efficient quantization, suggests
feasible integration. PsyCrisisBench offers a robust evaluation framework to
guide model development and ethical deployment in mental health.

Motivation: 当前概念瓶颈模型中的概念库存在冗余或覆盖不足的问题，且传统CBMs的概念评分机制有局限性。

Method: 采用动态代理方法调整概念库，并提出CoCoBMs以改进概念评分机制，允许LLMs修正冲突的概念评分。

Result: 在6个数据集上的评估显示，分类准确性提高了6%，可解释性评估提升了30%。

Conclusion: 动态调整概念库和引入CoCoBMs能有效优化概念瓶颈模型的性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) decompose image classification into a
process governed by interpretable, human-readable concepts. Recent advances in
CBMs have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate candidate concepts.
However, a critical question remains: What is the optimal number of concepts to
use? Current concept banks suffer from redundancy or insufficient coverage. To
address this issue, we introduce a dynamic, agent-based approach that adjusts
the concept bank in response to environmental feedback, optimizing the number
of concepts for sufficiency yet concise coverage. Moreover, we propose
Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models (CoCoBMs) to overcome the limitations in
traditional CBMs' concept scoring mechanisms. It enhances the accuracy of
assessing each concept's contribution to classification tasks and feature an
editable matrix that allows LLMs to correct concept scores that conflict with
their internal knowledge. Our evaluations across 6 datasets show that our
method not only improves classification accuracy by 6% but also enhances
interpretability assessments by 30%.

Abstract: The emergence of ChatGPT marked a transformative milestone for Artificial
Intelligence (AI), showcasing the remarkable potential of Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate human-like text. This wave of innovation has revolutionized
how we interact with technology, seamlessly integrating LLMs into everyday
tasks such as vacation planning, email drafting, and content creation. While
English-speaking users have significantly benefited from these advancements,
the Arabic world faces distinct challenges in developing Arabic-specific LLMs.
Arabic, one of the languages spoken most widely around the world, serves more
than 422 million native speakers in 27 countries and is deeply rooted in a rich
linguistic and cultural heritage. Developing Arabic LLMs (ALLMs) presents an
unparalleled opportunity to bridge technological gaps and empower communities.
The journey of ALLMs has been both fascinating and complex, evolving from
rudimentary text processing systems to sophisticated AI-driven models. This
article explores the trajectory of ALLMs, from their inception to the present
day, highlighting the efforts to evaluate these models through benchmarks and
public leaderboards. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities that
ALLMs present for the Arab world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试多关注单轮或单步任务，无法捕捉现实场景中所需的迭代推理能力。

Method: TurnBench包含两种模式（Classic和Nightmare），通过隐藏逻辑或算术规则并要求模型逐步推理来评估模型。

Result: 最佳模型在Classic模式下准确率为81.5%，但在Nightmare模式下降至17.8%，而人类参与者均为100%。

Conclusion: TurnBench为LLMs的多步、多轮推理能力提供了严格的测试基准，揭示了当前模型的不足。

Abstract: Despite impressive advances in large language models (LLMs), existing
benchmarks often focus on single-turn or single-step tasks, failing to capture
the kind of iterative reasoning required in real-world settings. To address
this limitation, we introduce TurnBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates
multi-turn, multi-step reasoning through an interactive code-breaking task
inspired by a "Turing Machine Board Game." In each episode, a model must
uncover hidden logical or arithmetic rules by making sequential guesses,
receiving structured feedback, and integrating clues across multiple rounds.
This dynamic setup requires models to reason over time, adapt based on past
information, and maintain consistency across steps-capabilities underexplored
in current benchmarks. TurnBench includes two modes: Classic, which tests
standard reasoning, and Nightmare, which introduces increased complexity and
requires robust inferential chains. To support fine-grained analysis, we
provide ground-truth annotations for intermediate reasoning steps. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals significant gaps: the best model
achieves 81.5% accuracy in Classic mode, but performance drops to 17.8% in
Nightmare mode. In contrast, human participants achieve 100% in both,
underscoring the challenge TurnBench poses to current models. By incorporating
feedback loops and hiding task rules, TurnBench reduces contamination risks and
provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing and advancing multi-step, multi-turn
reasoning in LLMs.

Method: 提出了FlowPathAgent，一种神经符号代理，通过图推理进行细粒度归因：先分割流程图，转换为符号图，再动态交互生成归因路径。

Result: 实验表明，FlowPathAgent在FlowExplainBench数据集上优于基线方法10-14%，有效减少了LLM的视觉幻觉。

Conclusion: FlowPathAgent通过细粒度归因提高了LLM对流程图分析的可靠性和可解释性，为关键领域提供了更可信的自动化处理方案。

Abstract: Flowcharts are a critical tool for visualizing decision-making processes.
However, their non-linear structure and complex visual-textual relationships
make it challenging to interpret them using LLMs, as vision-language models
frequently hallucinate nonexistent connections and decision paths when
analyzing these diagrams. This leads to compromised reliability for automated
flowchart processing in critical domains such as logistics, health, and
engineering. We introduce the task of Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution, which
traces specific components grounding a flowchart referring LLM response.
Flowchart Attribution ensures the verifiability of LLM predictions and improves
explainability by linking generated responses to the flowchart's structure. We
propose FlowPathAgent, a neurosymbolic agent that performs fine-grained post
hoc attribution through graph-based reasoning. It first segments the flowchart,
then converts it into a structured symbolic graph, and then employs an agentic
approach to dynamically interact with the graph, to generate attribution paths.
Additionally, we present FlowExplainBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating
flowchart attributions across diverse styles, domains, and question types.
Experimental results show that FlowPathAgent mitigates visual hallucinations in
LLM answers over flowchart QA, outperforming strong baselines by 10-14% on our
proposed FlowExplainBench dataset.

Method: 分解RLVR学习信号为PSR和NSR，训练Qwen2.5-Math-7B和Qwen3-4B模型，分析梯度。

Result: 仅负样本训练（NSR）在Pass@k上表现优于或持平PPO和GRPO，而仅正样本训练（PSR）会降低多样性。

Conclusion: 负样本强化在性能提升中起关键作用，提出优化RL目标以增强NSR，进一步提升了MATH等数据集的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for training language models (LMs) on reasoning tasks that elicit emergent long
chains of thought (CoTs). Unlike supervised learning, it updates the model
using both correct and incorrect samples via policy gradients. To better
understand its mechanism, we decompose the learning signal into reinforcing
correct responses and penalizing incorrect ones, referred to as Positive and
Negative Sample Reinforcement (PSR and NSR), respectively. We train
Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Qwen3-4B on a mathematical reasoning dataset and uncover a
surprising result: training with only negative samples -- without reinforcing
correct responses -- can be highly effective: it consistently improves
performance over the base model across the entire Pass@$k$ spectrum ($k$ up to
$256$), often matching or surpassing PPO and GRPO. In contrast, reinforcing
only correct responses improves Pass@$1$ but degrades performance at higher
$k$, due to reduced diversity. These inference-scaling trends highlight that
solely penalizing incorrect responses may contribute more to performance than
previously recognized. Through gradient analysis, we show that NSR works by
suppressing incorrect generations and redistributing probability mass toward
other plausible candidates, guided by the model's prior beliefs. It refines the
model's existing knowledge rather than introducing entirely new behaviors.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple variant of the RL objective that
upweights NSR, and show that it consistently improves overall Pass@$k$
performance on MATH, AIME 2025, and AMC23. Our code is available at
https://github.com/TianHongZXY/RLVR-Decomposed.

Conclusion: KokoroChat为心理咨询对话生成提供了高质量数据，同时解决了隐私和伦理问题。

Abstract: Generating psychological counseling responses with language models relies
heavily on high-quality datasets. Crowdsourced data collection methods require
strict worker training, and data from real-world counseling environments may
raise privacy and ethical concerns. While recent studies have explored using
large language models (LLMs) to augment psychological counseling dialogue
datasets, the resulting data often suffers from limited diversity and
authenticity. To address these limitations, this study adopts a role-playing
approach where trained counselors simulate counselor-client interactions,
ensuring high-quality dialogues while mitigating privacy risks. Using this
method, we construct KokoroChat, a Japanese psychological counseling dialogue
dataset comprising 6,589 long-form dialogues, each accompanied by comprehensive
client feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source
LLMs with KokoroChat improves both the quality of generated counseling
responses and the automatic evaluation of counseling dialogues. The KokoroChat
dataset is available at https://github.com/UEC-InabaLab/KokoroChat.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become pervasive in our everyday life. Yet,
a fundamental obstacle prevents their use in many critical applications: their
propensity to generate fluent, human-quality content that is not grounded in
reality. The detection of such hallucinations is thus of the highest
importance. In this work, we propose a new method to flag hallucinated content,
MMD-Flagger. It relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), a non-parametric
distance between distributions. On a high-level perspective, MMD-Flagger tracks
the MMD between the generated documents and documents generated with various
temperature parameters. We show empirically that inspecting the shape of this
trajectory is sufficient to detect most hallucinations. This novel method is
benchmarked on two machine translation datasets, on which it outperforms
natural competitors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练时和测试时均未能充分发挥提示式查询重写的潜力，需要更高效的适应机制。

Method: 提出AdaRewriter框架，利用对比排序损失训练奖励模型，在推理时选择最优查询重写方案。

Result: 在五个对话搜索数据集上，AdaRewriter显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 测试时适应在对话查询重写中具有巨大潜力，AdaRewriter为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Prompting-based conversational query reformulation has emerged as a powerful
approach for conversational search, refining ambiguous user queries into
standalone search queries. Best-of-N reformulation over the generated
candidates via prompting shows impressive potential scaling capability.
However, both the previous tuning methods (training time) and adaptation
approaches (test time) can not fully unleash their benefits. In this paper, we
propose AdaRewriter, a novel framework for query reformulation using an
outcome-supervised reward model via test-time adaptation. By training a
lightweight reward model with contrastive ranking loss, AdaRewriter selects the
most promising reformulation during inference. Notably, it can operate
effectively in black-box systems, including commercial LLM APIs. Experiments on
five conversational search datasets show that AdaRewriter significantly
outperforms the existing methods across most settings, demonstrating the
potential of test-time adaptation for conversational query reformulation.

COMET, and BLASER) and human assessments. The pipelines included automatic
speech recognition, machine translation, and speech synthesis, with local
models and cloud-based commercial ones. Some components have been fine-tuned on
our data. We evaluated over 60 pipelines and determined the best one for each
direction. We also found that the ranks of components are generally independent

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在敏感领域使用时可能泄露个人数据，现有匿名化方法依赖昂贵的外部模型，存在成本和隐私风险。

Method: SEAL框架利用LLM匿名器和推理模型的对抗性交互，通过监督微调和偏好学习，将匿名化、对抗推理和效用评估能力蒸馏到SLM中。

Result: 实验表明，SEAL训练的8B模型在隐私-效用权衡上与GPT-4相当，并通过自我精炼在隐私方面超越GPT-4。

Conclusion: SEAL框架有效训练SLM成为高效匿名化工具，为隐私保护研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains,
where their ability to infer personal data from seemingly benign text poses
emerging privacy risks. While recent LLM-based anonymization methods help
mitigate such risks, they often rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4),
raising concerns about cost and the potential exposure of sensitive data to
untrusted external systems. To address this, we introduce SElf-refining
Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for
training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization
without relying on external costly models at inference time. We leverage
adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to
collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are
used to distill anonymization, adversarial inference, and utility evaluation
capabilities into SLMs via supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The
resulting models learn to both anonymize text and critique their outputs,
enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement.
Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text
comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial
improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a
privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with
self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy. These results show the
effectiveness of our adversarial distillation framework in training SLMs as
efficient anonymizers. To facilitate further research, we release the full
dataset used in our experiments.

Motivation: 解决高维嵌入带来的存储和计算成本问题，探索降维对任务性能的影响。

Method: 应用后处理降维技术，分析不同任务（分类、聚类、检索、STS）的性能变化，并通过内在维度和各向同性分析冗余性。

Result: 即使降维至原维度的0.5%，分类和聚类任务性能下降很小；检索和STS任务的嵌入冗余性较低。

Conclusion: 基于提示的嵌入具有高度冗余性，降维可显著降低成本且对性能影响有限。

Abstract: Prompt-based text embedding models, which generate task-specific embeddings
upon receiving tailored prompts, have recently demonstrated remarkable
performance. However, their resulting embeddings often have thousands of
dimensions, leading to high storage costs and increased computational costs of
embedding-based operations. In this paper, we investigate how post-hoc
dimensionality reduction applied to the embeddings affects the performance of
various tasks that leverage these embeddings, specifically classification,
clustering, retrieval, and semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. Our
experiments show that even a naive dimensionality reduction, which keeps only
the first 25% of the dimensions of the embeddings, results in a very slight
performance degradation, indicating that these embeddings are highly redundant.
Notably, for classification and clustering, even when embeddings are reduced to
less than 0.5% of the original dimensionality the performance degradation is
very small. To quantitatively analyze this redundancy, we perform an analysis
based on the intrinsic dimensionality and isotropy of the embeddings. Our
analysis reveals that embeddings for classification and clustering, which are
considered to have very high dimensional redundancy, exhibit lower intrinsic
dimensionality and less isotropy compared with those for retrieval and STS.

Abstract: Extracting useful signals or pattern to support important business decisions
for example analyzing investment product traction and discovering customer
preference, risk monitoring etc. from unstructured text is a challenging task.
Capturing interaction of entities or concepts and association mining is a
crucial component in text mining, enabling information extraction and reasoning
over and knowledge discovery from text. Furthermore, it can be used to enrich
or filter knowledge graphs to guide exploration processes, descriptive
analytics and uncover hidden stories in the text. In this paper, we introduce a
domain independent pipeline i.e., generalized framework to enable document
filtering, entity extraction using various sources (or techniques) as plug-ins
and association mining to build any text mining business use-case and
quantitatively define a scoring metric for ranking purpose. The proposed
framework has three major components a) Document filtering: filtering
documents/text of interest from massive amount of texts b) Configurable entity
extraction pipeline: include entity extraction techniques i.e., i) DBpedia
Spotlight, ii) Spacy NER, iii) Custom Entity Matcher, iv) Phrase extraction (or
dictionary) based c) Association Relationship Mining: To generates
co-occurrence graph to analyse potential relationships among entities,
concepts. Further, co-occurrence count based frequency statistics provide a
holistic window to observe association trends or buzz rate in specific business
context. The paper demonstrates the usage of framework as fundamental building
box in two financial use-cases namely brand product discovery and vendor risk
monitoring. We aim that such framework will remove duplicated effort, minimize
the development effort, and encourage reusability and rapid prototyping in
association mining business applications for institutions.

Abstract: Computational models of pragmatic language use have traditionally relied on
hand-specified sets of utterances and meanings, limiting their applicability to
real-world language use. We propose a neuro-symbolic framework that enhances
probabilistic cognitive models by integrating LLM-based modules to propose and
evaluate key components in natural language, eliminating the need for manual
specification. Through a classic case study of pragmatic question-answering, we
systematically examine various approaches to incorporating neural modules into
the cognitive model -- from evaluating utilities and literal semantics to
generating alternative utterances and goals. We find that hybrid models can
match or exceed the performance of traditional probabilistic models in
predicting human answer patterns. However, the success of the neuro-symbolic
model depends critically on how LLMs are integrated: while they are
particularly effective for proposing alternatives and transforming abstract
goals into utilities, they face challenges with truth-conditional semantic
evaluation. This work charts a path toward more flexible and scalable models of
pragmatic language use while illuminating crucial design considerations for
balancing neural and symbolic components.

Conclusion: LLM生成的去毒文本是一种可扩展的替代方案，PARADEHATE为仇恨言论去毒提供了有效基准。

Abstract: Detoxification, the task of rewriting harmful language into non-toxic text,
has become increasingly important amid the growing prevalence of toxic content
online. However, high-quality parallel datasets for detoxification, especially
for hate speech, remain scarce due to the cost and sensitivity of human
annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-in-the-loop pipeline
leveraging GPT-4o-mini for automated detoxification. We first replicate the
ParaDetox pipeline by replacing human annotators with an LLM and show that the
LLM performs comparably to human annotation. Building on this, we construct
PARADEHATE, a large-scale parallel dataset specifically for hatespeech
detoxification. We release PARADEHATE as a benchmark of over 8K hate/non-hate
text pairs and evaluate a wide range of baseline methods. Experimental results
show that models such as BART, fine-tuned on PARADEHATE, achieve better
performance in style accuracy, content preservation, and fluency, demonstrating
the effectiveness of LLM-generated detoxification text as a scalable
alternative to human annotation.

Conclusion: ACCI在统一框架内有效去偏，无需数据增强或启发式过滤，显著提升跨文档事件共指消解性能。

Abstract: Cross-document Event Coreference Resolution (CD-ECR) is a fundamental task in
natural language processing (NLP) that seeks to determine whether event
mentions across multiple documents refer to the same real-world occurrence.
However, current CD-ECR approaches predominantly rely on trigger features
within input mention pairs, which induce spurious correlations between
surface-level lexical features and coreference relationships, impairing the
overall performance of the models. To address this issue, we propose a novel
cross-document event coreference resolution method based on Argument-Centric
Causal Intervention (ACCI). Specifically, we construct a structural causal
graph to uncover confounding dependencies between lexical triggers and
coreference labels, and introduce backdoor-adjusted interventions to isolate
the true causal effect of argument semantics. To further mitigate spurious
correlations, ACCI integrates a counterfactual reasoning module that quantifies
the causal influence of trigger word perturbations, and an argument-aware
enhancement module to promote greater sensitivity to semantically grounded
information. In contrast to prior methods that depend on costly data
augmentation or heuristic-based filtering, ACCI enables effective debiasing in
a unified end-to-end framework without altering the underlying training
procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACCI achieves CoNLL F1 of
88.4% on ECB+ and 85.2% on GVC, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The
implementation and materials are available at https://github.com/era211/ACCI.

Method: 使用四种语言的单语词典数据，对预训练多语言模型进行微调，并采用零样本方法测试LLMs的能力。

Result: 多语言模型表现与英语相当，但未能利用跨语言优势；LLMs整体表现更优，但存在局限性。BERTScore与多语言LLM基准表现强相关。

Conclusion: 多语言定义建模任务可作为计算受限、稳定且自然的替代方案，LLMs在零样本和少样本任务中展现出潜力，但仍需改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first multilingual study on definition
modeling. We use monolingual dictionary data for four new languages (Spanish,
French, Portuguese, and German) and perform an in-depth empirical study to test
the performance of pre-trained multilingual language models on definition
modeling of monosemic words when finetuned on this data. Furthermore, we use a
zero-shot approach to test the multilingual capabilities of two popular
chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in the task. Results show that
multilingual language models can perform on-pair with English but cannot
leverage potential cross-lingual synergies, with LLMs generally offering better
performance overall. A comprehensive human evaluation of the LLM-generated
definition highlights the zero and few-shot capabilities of these models in
this new task, also showing their shortcomings. Finally, we show that
performance on our task via BERTScore strongly correlates to the performance on
multilingual LLM benchmarks, suggesting that our task offers a viable
compute-constrained, stable and natural alternative to these.

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with mainstream human values
and ethical norms is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of AI.
Current value evaluation and alignment are constrained by Western cultural bias
and incomplete domestic frameworks reliant on non-native rules; furthermore,
the lack of scalable, rule-driven scenario generation methods makes evaluations
costly and inadequate across diverse cultural contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese
values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived
values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Values
Corpus (CVC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through
human annotation. Experimental results show that CVC-guided scenarios
outperform direct generation ones in value boundaries and content diversity. In
the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven
mainstream LLMs preferred CVC-generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while
five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with CVC, confirming
its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values.
Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that
objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization
across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking
framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing
Chinese characteristics. All data are available at

task-specific features for downstream tasks. Our approach improves accuracy
significantly over traditional methods in six speech processing tasks,
demonstrating gains in adapting to new speech tasks without full retraining.

TLDR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在不确定环境中生成基于事实和信心的表达的能力不足，提出通过评估LLMs对认知模态的语义知识来提升其不确定性表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在生成基于证据强度的表达时表现不足，尤其是在不确定环境中。研究旨在填补对LLMs潜在空间中不确定性语言知识的研究空白。

Method: 利用类型学框架和受控故事评估LLMs对认知模态的知识。

Result: 实验显示LLMs生成认知表达的能力有限且不稳定，其不确定性表达不可靠。

Conclusion: 为构建具备不确定性意识的LLMs，需丰富其对认知模态的语义知识。

Abstract: Rational speakers are supposed to know what they know and what they do not
know, and to generate expressions matching the strength of evidence. In
contrast, it is still a challenge for current large language models to generate
corresponding utterances based on the assessment of facts and confidence in an
uncertain real-world environment. While it has recently become popular to
estimate and calibrate confidence of LLMs with verbalized uncertainty, what is
lacking is a careful examination of the linguistic knowledge of uncertainty
encoded in the latent space of LLMs. In this paper, we draw on typological
frameworks of epistemic expressions to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of epistemic
modality, using controlled stories. Our experiments show that the performance
of LLMs in generating epistemic expressions is limited and not robust, and
hence the expressions of uncertainty generated by LLMs are not always reliable.
To build uncertainty-aware LLMs, it is necessary to enrich semantic knowledge
of epistemic modality in LLMs.

TLDR: 论文提出FormFactory，一个用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在表单填写任务中表现的交互式基准套件，发现现有模型准确率低于5%，揭示了其视觉布局推理和字段值对齐能力的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线表单填写是一项常见但劳动密集型任务，现有工具缺乏通用性和生成能力。多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在GUI相关任务中表现出潜力，但在表单填写任务中面临独特挑战。

Method: 提出FormFactory，一个包含Web界面、后端评估模块和精心构建数据集的交互式基准套件，覆盖多样化的真实场景和高保真表单交互模拟。

Result: 评估显示现有MLLMs在表单填写任务中准确率低于5%，表明其在视觉布局推理和字段值对齐方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: FormFactory为未来研究提供了基准，有助于开发更强大、实用的表单填写代理。

Abstract: Online form filling is a common yet labor-intensive task involving extensive
keyboard and mouse interactions. Despite the long-standing vision of automating
this process with "one click", existing tools remain largely rule-based and
lack generalizable, generative capabilities. Recent advances in Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled promising agents for GUI-related
tasks in general-purpose scenarios. However, they struggle with the unique
challenges of form filling, such as flexible layouts and the difficulty of
aligning textual instructions with on-screen fields. To bridge this gap, we
formally define the form-filling task and propose FormFactory, an interactive
benchmarking suite comprising a web-based interface, backend evaluation module,
and carefully constructed dataset. Our benchmark covers diverse real-world
scenarios, incorporates various field formats, and simulates high-fidelity form
interactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs
and observe that no model surpasses 5% accuracy, underscoring the inherent
difficulty of the task. These findings also reveal significant limitations in
current models' visual layout reasoning and field-value alignment abilities. We
hope our benchmark can serve as a stepping stone for further research into
robust, practical form-filling agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于变分自编码器（V-VAE）的框架，用于生成更符合人物特质的高质量对话，并构建了高质量数据集HumanChatData和基准测试HumanChatBench。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于角色扮演和人物的对话方法依赖静态描述和低质量合成数据，无法捕捉动态细节，如情感、情境感知和个性演变。

Method: 提出V-VAE框架，包含变分自编码模块和细粒度控制空间，动态调整对话行为。

Result: 实验表明，基于V-VAE的LLM在HumanChatBench和DialogBench上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: V-VAE和HumanChatData有效提升了对话生成的质量和动态适应性。

Abstract: With the continued proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) based
chatbots, there is a growing demand for generating responses that are not only
linguistically fluent but also consistently aligned with persona-specific
traits in conversations. However, existing role-play and persona-based chat
approaches rely heavily on static role descriptions, coarse-grained signal
space, and low-quality synthetic data, which fail to capture dynamic
fine-grained details in human-like chat. Human-like chat requires modeling
subtle latent traits, such as emotional tone, situational awareness, and
evolving personality, which are difficult to predefine and cannot be easily
learned from synthetic or distillation-based data. To address these
limitations, we propose a Verbal Variational Auto-Encoding (V-VAE) framework,
containing a variational auto-encoding module and fine-grained control space
which dynamically adapts dialogue behaviour based on fine-grained,
interpretable latent variables across talking style, interaction patterns, and
personal attributes. We also construct a high-quality dataset, HumanChatData,
and benchmark HumanChatBench to address the scarcity of high-quality data in
the human-like domain. Experiments show that LLMs based on V-VAE consistently
outperform standard baselines on HumanChatBench and DialogBench, which further
demonstrates the effectiveness of V-VAE and HumanChatData.

TLDR: STORM-BORN是一个超难数学推导数据集，源自前沿学术论文，包含人类推理特征，通过多智能体协作和人类验证确保质量。

Motivation: 现有数学数据集存在内容过时、缺乏挑战性、忽视人类推理和可靠性不足的问题。

Method: 提出人机交互的多智能体数据生成框架，结合推理密集过滤、多智能体协作和人类数学家评估。

Result: 生成2000个样本，精选100个最难题，GPT-o1解决率低于5%；微调后LLaMA3-8B和Qwen2.5-7B准确率分别提升7.84%和9.12%。

Conclusion: STORM-BORN为AI提供高难度基准和人类推理训练资源，推动数学推理能力发展。

Abstract: High-quality math datasets are crucial for advancing the reasoning abilities
of large language models (LLMs). However, existing datasets often suffer from
three key issues: outdated and insufficient challenging content, neglecting
human-like reasoning, and limited reliability due to single-LLM generation. To
address these, we introduce $\textbf{STORM-BORN}$, an ultra-challenging dataset
of mathematical derivations sourced from cutting-edge academic papers, which
includes dense human-like approximations and heuristic cues. To ensure the
reliability and quality, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop, multi-agent data
generation framework, integrating reasoning-dense filters, multi-agent
collaboration, and human mathematicians' evaluations. We curated a set of 2,000
synthetic samples and deliberately selected the 100 most difficult problems.
Even most advanced models like GPT-o1 solved fewer than $5\%$ of them.
Fine-tuning on STORM-BORN boosts accuracy by $7.84\%$ (LLaMA3-8B) and $9.12\%$
(Qwen2.5-7B). As AI approaches mathematician-level reasoning, STORM-BORN
provides both a high-difficulty benchmark and a human-like reasoning training
resource. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法在低资源语言上表现不佳，双语词典资源丰富但未被充分利用。

Method: 利用BPE分词器的特性，通过逐步移除目标子词并估计其嵌入，实现词汇迁移。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低资源语言上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于词典的跨语言词汇迁移方法简单有效，尤其适用于低资源语言。

Abstract: Cross-lingual vocabulary transfer plays a promising role in adapting
pre-trained language models to new languages, including low-resource languages.
Existing approaches that utilize monolingual or parallel corpora face
challenges when applied to languages with limited resources. In this work, we
propose a simple yet effective vocabulary transfer method that utilizes
bilingual dictionaries, which are available for many languages, thanks to
descriptive linguists. Our proposed method leverages a property of BPE
tokenizers where removing a subword from the vocabulary causes a fallback to
shorter subwords. The embeddings of target subwords are estimated iteratively
by progressively removing them from the tokenizer. The experimental results
show that our approach outperforms existing methods for low-resource languages,
demonstrating the effectiveness of a dictionary-based approach for
cross-lingual vocabulary transfer.

TLDR: 论文提出Hanfu-Bench数据集，用于研究文化视觉理解和图像转创任务，揭示现有视觉语言模型在时间维度文化理解上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文化理解研究多关注地理多样性，忽视时间维度，因此提出Hanfu-Bench填补这一空白。

Method: 构建专家策划的多模态数据集，包含文化视觉理解和图像转创两项任务，评估现有模型表现。

Result: 封闭式视觉语言模型表现接近非专家但落后于专家10%，开放式模型更差；图像转创任务最佳模型成功率仅42%。

Conclusion: Hanfu-Bench揭示了时间维度文化理解和创意适应的重大挑战，为未来研究提供重要测试平台。

Abstract: Culture is a rich and dynamic domain that evolves across both geography and
time. However, existing studies on cultural understanding with vision-language
models (VLMs) primarily emphasize geographic diversity, often overlooking the
critical temporal dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hanfu-Bench, a
novel, expert-curated multimodal dataset. Hanfu, a traditional garment spanning
ancient Chinese dynasties, serves as a representative cultural heritage that
reflects the profound temporal aspects of Chinese culture while remaining
highly popular in Chinese contemporary society. Hanfu-Bench comprises two core
tasks: cultural visual understanding and cultural image transcreation.The
former task examines temporal-cultural feature recognition based on single- or
multi-image inputs through multiple-choice visual question answering, while the
latter focuses on transforming traditional attire into modern designs through
cultural element inheritance and modern context adaptation. Our evaluation
shows that closed VLMs perform comparably to non-experts on visual cutural
understanding but fall short by 10\% to human experts, while open VLMs lags
further behind non-experts. For the transcreation task, multi-faceted human
evaluation indicates that the best-performing model achieves a success rate of
only 42\%. Our benchmark provides an essential testbed, revealing significant
challenges in this new direction of temporal cultural understanding and
creative adaptation.

TLDR: 研究发现，在复杂任务（如预测）中，简单的提示工程改进对提升大语言模型性能效果有限，某些策略甚至可能降低准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨提示工程是否足以提升大语言模型在复杂任务（如预测）中的表现，而非依赖耗时昂贵的技术（如微调）。

Method: 测试了38种提示变体，包括复合提示和外部来源提示，并引入推理模型o1和o1-mini，评估其对预测准确性的影响。

Result: 大多数提示改进效果微弱，仅引用基准率略有帮助，而鼓励贝叶斯推理的策略显著降低了准确性。

Conclusion: 提示工程在复杂任务中效果有限，可能需要更强大或专业化的技术来显著提升AI预测性能。

Abstract: Large language model performance can be improved in a large number of ways.
Many such techniques, like fine-tuning or advanced tool usage, are
time-intensive and expensive. Although prompt engineering is significantly
cheaper and often works for simpler tasks, it remains unclear whether prompt
engineering suffices for more complex domains like forecasting. Here we show
that small prompt modifications rarely boost forecasting accuracy beyond a
minimal baseline. In our first study, we tested 38 prompts across Claude 3.5
Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.1 405B. In our second, we
introduced compound prompts and prompts from external sources, also including
the reasoning models o1 and o1-mini. Our results show that most prompts lead to
negligible gains, although references to base rates yield slight benefits.
Surprisingly, some strategies showed strong negative effects on accuracy:
especially encouraging the model to engage in Bayesian reasoning. These results
suggest that, in the context of complex tasks like forecasting, basic prompt
refinements alone offer limited gains, implying that more robust or specialized
techniques may be required for substantial performance improvements in AI
forecasting.

Motivation: 社交媒体上假新闻的传播日益严重，但乌尔都语等资源匮乏语言的假新闻检测缺乏可靠的数据集和方法。

Method: 开发了一个专家验证的乌尔都语假新闻数据集，并评估了多种预训练语言模型，提出了一种统一的LLM模型。

Result: 提出的统一模型在准确性、F1分数等指标上优于其他模型，并通过人工验证样本结果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发可靠数据集的重要性，为资源匮乏语言的假新闻检测提供了新方法。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media platforms has significantly increased the
dissemination of forged content and misinformation, making the detection of
fake news a critical area of research. Although fact-checking efforts
predominantly focus on English-language news, there is a noticeable gap in
resources and strategies to detect news in regional languages, such as Urdu.
Advanced Fake News Detection (FND) techniques rely heavily on large, accurately
labeled datasets. However, FND in under-resourced languages like Urdu faces
substantial challenges due to the scarcity of extensive corpora and the lack of
validated lexical resources. Current Urdu fake news datasets are often
domain-specific and inaccessible to the public. They also lack human
verification, relying mainly on unverified English-to-Urdu translations, which
compromises their reliability in practical applications. This study highlights
the necessity of developing reliable, expert-verified, and domain-independent
Urdu-enhanced FND datasets to improve fake news detection in Urdu and other
resource-constrained languages. This paper presents the first benchmark large
FND dataset for Urdu news, which is publicly available for validation and deep
analysis. We also evaluate this dataset using multiple state-of-the-art
pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as XLNet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa,
RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa. Additionally, we propose a unified LLM model
that outperforms the others with different embedding and feature extraction
techniques. The performance of these models is compared based on accuracy, F1
score, precision, recall, and human judgment for vetting the sample results of
news.

Motivation: 编码器模型（如BERT、RoBERTa）在计算和内存成本上优于LLMs，但在零样本任务中表现较差。研究旨在探索如何通过Statement Tuning方法提升其性能，并验证其在多语言任务中的潜力。

Method: 采用Statement Tuning方法，将任务重新表述为有限模板，以适配编码器模型。研究扩展了该方法到多语言NLP任务中，并分析了数据集设计、效率提升和语言特定泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，编码器模型在多语言零样本任务中表现优异，与多语言LLMs相当，同时更高效。

Conclusion: 编码器模型通过Statement Tuning可以成为资源高效且包容性强的NLP替代方案，适用于低资源语言。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in zero-shot and few-shot tasks, but
achieving similar performance with encoder-only models like BERT and RoBERTa
has been challenging due to their architecture. However, encoders offer
advantages such as lower computational and memory costs. Recent work adapts
them for zero-shot generalization using Statement Tuning, which reformulates
tasks into finite templates. We extend this approach to multilingual NLP,
exploring whether encoders can achieve zero-shot cross-lingual generalization
and serve as efficient alternatives to memory-intensive LLMs for low-resource
languages. Our results show that state-of-the-art encoder models generalize
well across languages, rivaling multilingual LLMs while being more efficient.
We also analyze multilingual Statement Tuning dataset design, efficiency gains,
and language-specific generalization, contributing to more inclusive and
resource-efficient NLP models. We release our code and models.

Abstract: Word sense analysis is an essential analysis work for interpreting the

MMD to word sense change detection. Empirical assessment results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 印度语言缺乏高质量的RAG系统资源，包括评估基准和训练数据。

Method: 通过手动翻译MS MARCO-dev集的1000个查询创建IndicMSMarco基准，并利用LLMs从19种印度语言维基百科构建训练数据集。

Result: 开发了IndicMSMarco基准和包含多种印度语言的大规模训练数据集。

Conclusion: 解决了印度语言RAG系统资源不足的问题，为多语言信息检索和生成任务提供了支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable language models to access
relevant information and generate accurate, well-grounded, and contextually
informed responses. However, for Indian languages, the development of
high-quality RAG systems is hindered by the lack of two critical resources: (1)
evaluation benchmarks for retrieval and generation tasks, and (2) large-scale
training datasets for multilingual retrieval. Most existing benchmarks and
datasets are centered around English or high-resource languages, making it
difficult to extend RAG capabilities to the diverse linguistic landscape of
India. To address the lack of evaluation benchmarks, we create IndicMSMarco, a
multilingual benchmark for evaluating retrieval quality and response generation
in 13 Indian languages, created via manual translation of 1000 diverse queries
from MS MARCO-dev set. To address the need for training data, we build a
large-scale dataset of (question, answer, relevant passage) tuples derived from
the Wikipedias of 19 Indian languages using state-of-the-art LLMs.
Additionally, we include translated versions of the original MS MARCO dataset
to further enrich the training data and ensure alignment with real-world
information-seeking tasks. Resources are available here:

Motivation: BERT在某些文本分类任务中表现不佳，尤其是关键词对分类标签预测起关键作用时。研究发现，BERT基于上下文的词嵌入可能不足以生成具有区分性的文本表示。

Method: 开发了一种利用领域特定词汇知识增强词嵌入的模型，将BERT嵌入投影到一个新空间，最大化类内相似性和类间差异。同时提出了一种自动从在线开放资源收集词汇知识的算法。

Result: 在情感分析、情绪识别和问答三个分类任务上的实验证明了该模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过结合领域特定词汇知识，显著提升了BERT在文本分类任务中的性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models such as BERT have been proved to be powerful in
many natural language processing tasks. But in some text classification
applications such as emotion recognition and sentiment analysis, BERT may not
lead to satisfactory performance. This often happens in applications where
keywords play critical roles in the prediction of class labels. Our
investigation found that the root cause of the problem is that the
context-based BERT embedding of the keywords may not be discriminative enough
to produce discriminative text representation for classification. Motivated by
this finding, we develop a method to enhance word embeddings using
domain-specific lexical knowledge. The knowledge-based embedding enhancement
model projects the BERT embedding into a new space where within-class
similarity and between-class difference are maximized. To implement the
knowledge-based word embedding enhancement model, we also develop a knowledge
acquisition algorithm for automatically collecting lexical knowledge from
online open sources. Experiment results on three classification tasks,
including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition and question answering, have
shown the effectiveness of our proposed word embedding enhancing model. The

Result: 在两个真实数据集上，MVAN的准确率平均比现有方法高2.5%，并能提供合理解释。

Conclusion: MVAN在短文本假新闻检测中表现优异，且能解释关键线索和可疑用户。

Abstract: Fake news on social media is a widespread and serious problem in today's
society. Existing fake news detection methods focus on finding clues from Long
text content, such as original news articles and user comments. This paper
solves the problem of fake news detection in more realistic scenarios. Only
source shot-text tweet and its retweet users are provided without user
comments. We develop a novel neural network based model,
\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{N}etworks (MVAN) to
detect fake news and provide explanations on social media. The MVAN model
includes text semantic attention and propagation structure attention, which
ensures that our model can capture information and clues both of source tweet
content and propagation structure. In addition, the two attention mechanisms in
the model can find key clue words in fake news texts and suspicious users in
the propagation structure. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets,
and the results demonstrate that MVAN can significantly outperform
state-of-the-art methods by 2.5\% in accuracy on average, and produce a
reasonable explanation.

Result: 模型初始形成语言特定表示，随后逐渐收敛为跨语言抽象；特定神经元成为跨语言概念的可靠预测器。

Conclusion: MLLMs通过压缩过程实现跨语言知识迁移，神经元逐步对齐语义概念。

Abstract: Multilingual language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities
to transfer knowledge across languages, despite being trained without explicit
cross-lingual supervision. We analyze the parameter spaces of three MLLMs to
study how their representations evolve during pre-training, observing patterns
consistent with compression: models initially form language-specific
representations, which gradually converge into cross-lingual abstractions as
training progresses. Through probing experiments, we observe a clear transition
from uniform language identification capabilities across layers to more
specialized layer functions. For deeper analysis, we focus on neurons that
encode distinct semantic concepts. By tracing their development during
pre-training, we show how they gradually align across languages. Notably, we
identify specific neurons that emerge as increasingly reliable predictors for
the same concepts across languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在ESG和可持续性问题上的表现有限，缺乏专门评估和提升其能力的基准。

Method: ESGenius包含两部分：ESGenius-QA（专家验证的多选题集）和ESGenius-Corpus（权威文档库），并通过零样本和RAG方法评估50个LLM。

Result: 零样本下模型表现一般（55-70%），RAG显著提升性能（如某模型从63.82%提升至80.46%）。

Conclusion: ESGenius是首个专注于ESG的LLM基准，强调基于权威来源的回答对提升模型表现的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce ESGenius, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and enhancing
the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Environmental, Social and
Governance (ESG) and sustainability-focused question answering. ESGenius
comprises two key components: (i) ESGenius-QA, a collection of 1 136
multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs and rigorously validated by domain
experts, covering a broad range of ESG pillars and sustainability topics. Each
question is systematically linked to its corresponding source text, enabling
transparent evaluation and supporting retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
methods; and (ii) ESGenius-Corpus, a meticulously curated repository of 231
foundational frameworks, standards, reports and recommendation documents from
seven authoritative sources. Moreover, to fully assess the capabilities and
adaptation potential of the model, we implement a rigorous two-stage evaluation
protocol -- Zero-Shot and RAG. Extensive experiments across 50 LLMs (ranging
from 0.5 B to 671 B parameters) demonstrate that state-of-the-art models
achieve only moderate performance in zero-shot settings, with accuracies
typically around 55--70\%, highlighting ESGenius's challenging nature for LLMs
in interdisciplinary contexts. However, models employing RAG show significant
performance improvements, particularly for smaller models. For example,
"DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B" improves from 63.82\% (zero-shot) to 80.46\%
with RAG. These results underscore the necessity of grounding responses in
authoritative sources for enhanced ESG understanding. To the best of our
knowledge, ESGenius is the first benchmark curated for LLMs and the relevant
enhancement technologies that focuses on ESG and sustainability topics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有大量研究评估大型语言模型处理全球文化多样性的能力，但其文化知识获取机制，尤其是在多语言环境中的传递方式仍不明确。

Method: 引入了一个可解释的框架，研究文化知识在语言适应中的传递，控制训练数据透明度及传递效果，并以四种非英语文化为例进行分析。

Result: 观察到高资源语言与英语之间存在双向文化传递，而低资源语言主要单向传递知识到英语。提出频率假设，并通过训练语料库的实证分析支持。

Conclusion: 文化知识在语言模型中的传递受其在预训练数据中出现频率的影响，高频率知识更易传递。

Abstract: Despite substantial research efforts evaluating how well large language
models~(LLMs) handle global cultural diversity, the mechanisms behind their
cultural knowledge acquisition, particularly in multilingual settings, remain
unclear. We study this question by investigating how cultural knowledge
transfers across languages during language adaptation of LLMs. We introduce an
interpretable framework for studying this transfer, ensuring training data
transparency and controlling transfer effects. Through a study of four
non-Anglophonic cultures, we observe bidirectional cultural transfer between
English and other high-resource languages, while low-resource languages
primarily transfer knowledge to English with limited reverse flow. To explain
this asymmetric phenomenon, we propose a frequency-based hypothesis: cultural
knowledge appearing more frequently in the pretraining data transfers more
easily, which is supported by empirical analysis of the training corpora.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为StochasTok的随机分词方法，通过随机分割训练中的token，提升大语言模型在子词级任务上的表现，且计算成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在子词级任务（如字符计数、子串识别等）上表现不佳，主要原因是分词方式掩盖了词的细粒度结构。现有替代方法（如字符级分词）计算成本高且效果不稳定。

Method: 引入StochasTok，一种简单高效的随机分词方案，训练时随机分割token，使模型能‘看到’词的内部结构。

Result: 实验表明，使用StochasTok预训练显著提升模型在多种子词级任务（如字符计数、数学任务）上的表现，且能无缝集成到现有预训练模型中。

Conclusion: StochasTok通过最小改动实现了显著改进，展示了其在更大模型中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Subword-level understanding is integral to numerous tasks, including
understanding multi-digit numbers, spelling mistakes, abbreviations, rhyming,
and wordplay. Despite this, current large language models (LLMs) still often
struggle with seemingly simple subword-level tasks like How many 'r's in
'strawberry'?. A key factor behind these failures is tokenization which
obscures the fine-grained structure of words. Current alternatives, such as
character-level and dropout tokenization methods, significantly increase
computational costs and provide inconsistent improvements. In this paper we
revisit tokenization and introduce StochasTok, a simple, efficient stochastic
tokenization scheme that randomly splits tokens during training, allowing LLMs
to 'see' their internal structure. Our experiments show that pretraining with
StochasTok substantially improves LLMs' downstream performance across multiple
subword-level language games, including character counting, substring
identification, and math tasks. Furthermore, StochasTok's simplicity allows
seamless integration at any stage of the training pipeline; and we demonstrate
that post-training with StochasTok can instill improved subword understanding
into existing pretrained models, thus avoiding costly pretraining from scratch.
These dramatic improvements achieved with a minimal change suggest StochasTok
holds exciting potential when applied to larger, more capable models. Code

TLDR: 该论文综述了基于大语言模型（LLM）的协作系统在情感计算（AC）中的应用，探讨了从结构化协作到自主协作的方法，并分析了其潜力与挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感计算任务在自然语言处理中采用流水线架构，存在结构僵化和适应性不足的问题。LLM的出现为情感理解与生成提供了统一方法，但其在情感推理中存在认知局限。

Method: 论文系统回顾了现有方法，包括协作策略、机制、关键功能和应用，并通过实验比较了代表性任务中的协作策略。

Result: 分析表明，LLM协作系统能增强复杂情感推理的鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统探索了LLM在AC中的协作智能，为接近人类社交智能的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) is essential in bridging the gap between human
emotional experiences and machine understanding. Traditionally, AC tasks in
natural language processing (NLP) have been approached through pipeline
architectures, which often suffer from structure rigidity that leads to
inefficiencies and limited adaptability. The advent of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has revolutionized this field by offering a unified approach to
affective understanding and generation tasks, enhancing the potential for
dynamic, real-time interactions. However, LLMs face cognitive limitations in
affective reasoning, such as misinterpreting cultural nuances or contextual
emotions, and hallucination problems in decision-making. To address these
challenges, recent research advocates for LLM-based collaboration systems that
emphasize interactions among specialized models and LLMs, mimicking human-like
affective intelligence through the synergy of emotional and rational thinking
that aligns with Dual Process Theory in psychology. This survey aims to provide
a comprehensive overview of LLM-based collaboration systems in AC, exploring
from structured collaborations to autonomous collaborations. Specifically, it
includes: (1) A systematic review of existing methods, focusing on
collaboration strategies, mechanisms, key functions, and applications; (2)
Experimental comparisons of collaboration strategies across representative
tasks in affective understanding and generation; (3) An analysis highlighting
the potential of these systems to enhance robustness and adaptability in
complex affective reasoning; (4) A discussion of key challenges and future
research directions to further advance the field. This work is the first to
systematically explore collaborative intelligence with LLMs in AC, paving the
way for more powerful applications that approach human-like social
intelligence.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于微调小型LLMs的文本分类方法（mdok），用于鲁棒检测机器生成文本，并在Voight-Kampff生成AI检测2025任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的高质量文本可能被滥用（如抄袭、垃圾邮件、传播虚假信息），需要自动化检测方法，但其对分布外数据的鲁棒性仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用微调小型LLMs的方法（mdok）进行文本分类，应用于Voight-Kampff生成AI检测2025任务。

Result: 在二元检测和多类分类（人类-AI协作的多种情况）中表现卓越，多类分类排名第一。

Conclusion: mdok方法在机器生成文本检测中具有鲁棒性和高效性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The large language models (LLMs) are able to generate high-quality texts in
multiple languages. Such texts are often not recognizable by humans as
generated, and therefore present a potential of LLMs for misuse (e.g.,
plagiarism, spams, disinformation spreading). An automated detection is able to
assist humans to indicate the machine-generated texts; however, its robustness
to out-of-distribution data is still challenging. This notebook describes our
mdok approach in robust detection, based on fine-tuning smaller LLMs for text
classification. It is applied to both subtasks of Voight-Kampff Generative AI
Detection 2025, providing remarkable performance in binary detection as well as
in multiclass (1st rank) classification of various cases of human-AI
collaboration.

TLDR: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）训练中的公平性动态，提出两种新指标评估偏见，发现Pythia-6.9b存在性别偏见，通过早期停止可提升公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 诊断LLM训练中的偏见并探索干预措施（如早期停止），以改善模型公平性。

Method: 引入两种新指标（平均排名和部分Jensen-Shannon散度）评估Pythia模型在WinoBias数据集上的性别预测偏见动态。

Result: Pythia-6.9b对男性偏见明显，早期停止可牺牲1.7%准确率换取92.5%公平性提升，且更大模型偏见更严重。

Conclusion: 监控公平性动态有助于发现和缓解偏见，早期停止是有效的干预手段。

Abstract: We investigate fairness dynamics during Large Language Model (LLM) training
to enable the diagnoses of biases and mitigations through training
interventions like early stopping; we find that biases can emerge suddenly and
do not always follow common performance metrics. We introduce two new metrics
to evaluate fairness dynamics holistically during model pre-training: Average
Rank and Jensen-Shannon Divergence by Parts. These metrics provide insights
into the Pythia models' progression of biases in gender prediction of
occupations on the WinoBias dataset. By monitoring these dynamics, we find that
(1) Pythia-6.9b is biased towards men; it becomes more performant and confident
predicting "male" than "female" during training, (2) via early-stopping,
Pythia-6.9b can exchange 1.7% accuracy on LAMBADA for a 92.5% increase in
fairness, and (3) larger models can exhibit more bias; Pythia-6.9b makes more
assumptions about gender than Pythia-160m, even when a subject's gender is not
specified.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调方法在表格推理任务中存在泛化和鲁棒性问题，而强化学习能够通过规则化奖励设计解决这些问题。

Method: 采用强化学习方法，结合数据预处理、奖励设计和定制化训练策略，统一训练多种表格推理任务。

Result: 在表格推理基准测试中超越Claude-3.7-Sonnet 4.0%，在BIRD开发集上达到68.3%的性能。

Conclusion: Reasoning-Table展示了强化学习在表格推理任务中的潜力，显著提升了模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Table reasoning, encompassing tasks such as table question answering, fact
verification, and text-to-SQL, requires precise understanding of structured
tabular data, coupled with numerical computation and code manipulation for
effective inference. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have achieved
notable success but often struggle with generalization and robustness due to
biases inherent in imitative learning. We introduce Reasoning-Table, the first
application of reinforcement learning (RL) to table reasoning, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Through rigorous data preprocessing, reward
design, and tailored training strategies, our method leverages simple
rule-based outcome rewards to outperform SFT across multiple benchmarks.
Unified training across diverse tasks enables Reasoning-Table to emerge as a
robust table reasoning large language model, surpassing larger proprietary
models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet by 4.0% on table reasoning benchmarks. The
approach also achieves excellent performance on text-to-SQL tasks, reaching
68.3% performance on the BIRD dev dataset with a 7B model. Further experiments
demonstrate that Reasoning-Table enhances the model's generalization
capabilities and robustness.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为SRPO的两阶段反思增强强化学习框架，旨在提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理能力。通过高质量反思数据集和新型奖励机制，SRPO在多个基准测试中显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，尤其是自我反思和自我修正能力不足。现有反思方法简单且难以生成有意义的反馈。

Method: 提出SRPO框架，分为两阶段：1）构建高质量反思数据集；2）在GRPO框架中引入新型奖励机制，鼓励简洁且有意义的反思。

Result: 在MathVista等基准测试中，SRPO显著提升了推理准确性和反思质量，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: SRPO通过反思增强强化学习有效提升了MLLMs的推理能力，为复杂任务提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in
reasoning tasks, yet still struggle with complex problems requiring explicit
self-reflection and self-correction, especially compared to their unimodal
text-based counterparts. Existing reflection methods are simplistic and
struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning
ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during
initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal
Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework
explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we
construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an
advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help
the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection. In the second stage,
we introduce a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework that encourages
concise and cognitively meaningful reflection while avoiding redundancy.
Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks,
including MathVista, MathVision, MathVerse, and MMMU-Pro, using Qwen-2.5-VL-7B
and Qwen-2.5-VL-32B demonstrate that SRPO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models, achieving notable improvements in both reasoning
accuracy and reflection quality.

Motivation: 习语的比喻意义与字面意义差异显著，研究模型如何学习和处理这种双重意义。

Method: 使用机制可解释性工具分析LLama3.2-1B-base模型，定位习语处理的三个步骤。

Result: 发现早期注意力层和MLP子层检索比喻意义，特定注意力头抑制字面意义；比喻和字面意义通过并行路径处理。

Conclusion: 研究为自回归变压器中习语理解的机制提供了证据。

Abstract: Idioms present a unique challenge for language models due to their
non-compositional figurative meanings, which often strongly diverge from the
idiom's literal interpretation. This duality requires a model to learn
representing and deciding between the two meanings to interpret an idiom in a
figurative sense, or literally. In this paper, we employ tools from mechanistic
interpretability to trace how a large pretrained causal transformer
(LLama3.2-1B-base) deals with this ambiguity. We localize three steps of idiom
processing: First, the idiom's figurative meaning is retrieved in early
attention and MLP sublayers. We identify specific attention heads which boost
the figurative meaning of the idiom while suppressing the idiom's literal
interpretation. The model subsequently represents the figurative representation
through an intermediate path. Meanwhile, a parallel bypass route forwards
literal interpretation, ensuring that a both reading remain available. Overall,
our findings provide a mechanistic evidence for idiom comprehension in an
autoregressive transformer.

Conclusion: Common Corpus将为开放科学研究和LLM发展提供关键基础设施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on large amounts of data from
different sources and domains. These data most often contain trillions of
tokens with large portions of copyrighted or proprietary content, which hinders
the usage of such models under AI legislation. This raises the need for truly
open pre-training data that is compliant with the data security regulations. In
this paper, we introduce Common Corpus, the largest open dataset for language
model pre-training. The data assembled in Common Corpus are either
uncopyrighted or under permissible licenses and amount to about two trillion
tokens. The dataset contains a wide variety of languages, ranging from the main
European languages to low-resource ones rarely present in pre-training
datasets; in addition, it includes a large portion of code data. The diversity
of data sources in terms of covered domains and time periods opens up the paths
for both research and entrepreneurial needs in diverse areas of knowledge. In
this technical report, we present the detailed provenance of data assembling
and the details of dataset filtering and curation. Being already used by such
industry leaders as Anthropic and multiple LLM training projects, we believe
that Common Corpus will become a critical infrastructure for open science
research in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究发现大语言模型（LLMs）在数值任务中存在数字偏差，与预训练语料中的长尾数字分布（类似Benford定律）相关，并通过神经元修剪部分纠正了错误输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但在基础数值问题上常出错，可能是预训练语料中的数字分布偏差导致。

Method: 通过分析预训练语料（OLMo2）的数字分布，构建均匀分布的数字基准测试，并结合logit-lens和神经元剖析技术，识别并修剪相关神经元。

Result: 开源LLMs表现出与Benford定律相似的数字偏差，且修剪特定神经元可部分纠正错误。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语料统计与LLMs符号错误模式之间的关联，为数值任务中的幻觉诊断和缓解提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they frequently fail on basic numerical problems,
producing incorrect outputs. Inspired by Benford's Law -- a statistical pattern
where lower digits occur more frequently as leading digits -- we hypothesize
that the long-tailed digit distributions in web-collected corpora may be
learned by LLMs during pretraining, leading to biased numerical generation. To
investigate the hypothesis, we first examine whether digits frequencies in
pretraining corpus (OLMo2) follows Benford's law. We then construct an
evaluation benchmark with uniformly distributed ground-truth digits across
seven numerical reasoning tasks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that
leading open-source LLMs show a consistent pattern of digit bias that resembles
Benford's law. Through logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection, we
identify that this bias arises predominantly from a small subset of highly
digit-selective feed-forward network (FFN) neurons in the deeper layers.
Finally, we demonstrate that pruning these neurons mitigates imbalanced
overgeneration and partially corrects erroneous outputs, providing causal
evidence that fine-grained pretraining digit bias can propagate into model
behavior. Our findings reveal a fundamental connection between corpus-level
statistics and symbolic failure modes in LLMs, offering a new lens for
diagnosing and mitigating hallucinations in numerical tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的角色扮演代理（RPAs）缺乏深度的内部思考过程，导致表达浅显且风格不一致，而大型推理模型（LRMs）直接应用时存在注意力分散和风格漂移的问题。

Method: 提出RAR方法，包括RIA（通过角色配置文件引导推理）和RSO（通过LRM蒸馏优化推理风格）。

Result: 实验表明，RAR显著提升了RPAs的性能，有效解决了注意力分散和风格漂移问题。

Conclusion: RAR方法为角色扮演代理提供了更自然、一致的推理和表达方式。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant
interest in Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) for applications such as emotional
companionship and virtual interaction. However, recent RPAs are often built on
explicit dialogue data, lacking deep, human-like internal thought processes,
resulting in superficial knowledge and style expression. While Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) can be employed to simulate character thought, their direct
application is hindered by attention diversion (i.e., RPAs forget their role)
and style drift (i.e., overly formal and rigid reasoning rather than
character-consistent reasoning). To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a novel Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR) method, which consists of two
important stages: Role Identity Activation (RIA) and Reasoning Style
Optimization (RSO). RIA explicitly guides the model with character profiles
during reasoning to counteract attention diversion, and then RSO aligns
reasoning style with the character and scene via LRM distillation to mitigate
style drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RAR
significantly enhances the performance of RPAs by effectively addressing
attention diversion and style drift.

Method: 结合现成OCR技术、语言识别和掩码技术，辅以后校正模型，实现对Kwak'wala文本的高质量转录。

Result: 成功应用OCR技术处理Kwak'wala图像文本，并针对其特殊性提出适应性解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为其他类似语言的数字化提供了参考，但仍需进一步优化以适应更多复杂文本。

Abstract: Kwak'wala is an Indigenous language spoken in British Columbia, with a rich
legacy of published documentation spanning more than a century, and an active
community of speakers, teachers, and learners engaged in language
revitalization. Over 11 volumes of the earliest texts created during the
collaboration between Franz Boas and George Hunt have been scanned but remain
unreadable by machines. Complete digitization through optical character
recognition has the potential to facilitate transliteration into modern
orthographies and the creation of other language technologies. In this paper,
we apply the latest OCR techniques to a series of Kwak'wala texts only
accessible as images, and discuss the challenges and unique adaptations
necessary to make such technologies work for these real-world texts. Building
on previous methods, we propose using a mix of off-the-shelf OCR methods,
language identification, and masking to effectively isolate Kwak'wala text,
along with post-correction models, to produce a final high-quality
transcription.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在知识密集型任务中的事实不准确问题，特别是多跳推理中的连贯性和关键连接丢失问题。

Method: 引入iQUEST框架，迭代分解复杂问题为子问题，并结合GNN提前考虑2跳邻居信息。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和四种大语言模型上均表现出一致性改进。

Conclusion: iQUEST通过结构化推理和前瞻性信息整合，有效提升了多跳知识图谱问答的可靠性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many natural language processing
tasks, they often suffer from factual inaccuracies in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge
graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable
reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons
over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries.
However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent
reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop
connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided
KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler
sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory.
Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and
incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual
approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore
viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent
improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.

Abstract: Currently, nearly all evaluations of foundation models focus on objective
metrics, emphasizing quiz performance to define model capabilities. While this
model-centric approach enables rapid performance assessment, it fails to
reflect authentic human experiences. To address this gap, we propose a
Human-Centric subjective Evaluation (HCE) framework, focusing on three core
dimensions: problem-solving ability, information quality, and interaction
experience. Through experiments involving Deepseek R1, OpenAI o3 mini, Grok 3,
and Gemini 2.5, we conduct over 540 participant-driven evaluations, where
humans and models collaborate on open-ended research tasks, yielding a
comprehensive subjective dataset. This dataset captures diverse user feedback
across multiple disciplines, revealing distinct model strengths and
adaptability. Our findings highlight Grok 3's superior performance, followed by
Deepseek R1 and Gemini 2.5, with OpenAI o3 mini lagging behind. By offering a
novel framework and a rich dataset, this study not only enhances subjective
evaluation methodologies but also lays the foundation for standardized,

Method: 将语法规则分解为检索和应用两步，引入ZhuangRules数据集，并将语法规则表示为代码函数。

Result: 代码规则显著提升了规则检索和应用，翻译BLEU分数提高了13.1%。

Conclusion: 语法规则表示为代码函数能有效提升极低资源语言的翻译效果。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in translating
extremely low-resource languages using resources like dictionaries, the
effectiveness of grammar books remains debated. This paper investigates the
role of grammar books in translating extremely low-resource languages by
decomposing it into two key steps: grammar rule retrieval and application. To
facilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of
grammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that
rule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation.
Moreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly
provided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules. To
address these challenges, we propose representing grammar rules as code
functions, considering their similarities in structure and the benefit of code
in facilitating LLM reasoning. Our experiments show that using code rules
significantly boosts both rule retrieval and application, ultimately resulting
in a 13.1% BLEU improvement in translation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乌克兰冲突中社交媒体在信息战中的作用，揭示宣传账户与可信账户在传播策略上的差异。

Method: 收集2022年2月至5月的40,000条推文，结合自然语言处理和机器学习算法，辅以人工分析，评估情感、主题和叙事。

Result: 宣传账户使用情绪化语言和虚假信息，西方账户侧重事实和人道主义；聚类分析显示可能存在协同行为。

Conclusion: 研究增进了对信息战动态的理解，为未来社交媒体在军事冲突中的影响研究提供了方法。

Abstract: The conflict in Ukraine has been not only characterised by military
engagement but also by a significant information war, with social media
platforms like X, formerly known as Twitter playing an important role in
shaping public perception. This article provides an analysis of tweets from
propaganda accounts and trusted accounts collected from the onset of the war,
February 2022 until the middle of May 2022 with n=40,000 total tweets. We
utilise natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to assess
the sentiment and identify key themes, topics and narratives across the dataset
with human-in-the-loop (HITL) analysis throughout. Our findings indicate
distinct strategies in how information is created, spread, and targeted at
different audiences by both sides. Propaganda accounts frequently employ
emotionally charged language and disinformation to evoke fear and distrust,
whereas other accounts, primarily Western tend to focus on factual reporting
and humanitarian aspects of the conflict. Clustering analysis reveals groups of
accounts with similar behaviours, which we suspect indicates the presence of
coordinated efforts. This research attempts to contribute to our understanding
of the dynamics of information warfare and offers techniques for future studies
on social media influence in military conflicts.

TLDR: 研究比较了PRC系统模型DeepSeek-R1和非PRC模型ChatGPT o3-mini-high在宣传和反美情绪上的跨语言偏差，发现DeepSeek-R1显著偏向PRC立场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的意识形态中立性引发关注，但缺乏对不同地缘政治对齐模型的直接跨语言比较。

Method: 开发了1200个去语境化问题，评估模型在简体中文、繁体中文和英文中的回答，结合GPT-4o评分和人工标注。

Result: DeepSeek-R1表现出更高的宣传和反美偏见，尤其在简体中文中；ChatGPT o3-mini-high则较为中立。

Conclusion: LLMs的偏差不仅限于政治话题，还渗透到文化和生活方式内容中，需进一步研究其影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly shape public understanding and
civic decisions, yet their ideological neutrality is a growing concern. While
existing research has explored various forms of LLM bias, a direct,
cross-lingual comparison of models with differing geopolitical
alignments-specifically a PRC-system model versus a non-PRC counterpart-has
been lacking. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating
DeepSeek-R1 (PRC-aligned) against ChatGPT o3-mini-high (non-PRC) for
Chinese-state propaganda and anti-U.S. sentiment. We developed a novel corpus
of 1,200 de-contextualized, reasoning-oriented questions derived from
Chinese-language news, presented in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese,
and English. Answers from both models (7,200 total) were assessed using a
hybrid evaluation pipeline combining rubric-guided GPT-4o scoring with human
annotation. Our findings reveal significant model-level and language-dependent
biases. DeepSeek-R1 consistently exhibited substantially higher proportions of
both propaganda and anti-U.S. bias compared to ChatGPT o3-mini-high, which
remained largely free of anti-U.S. sentiment and showed lower propaganda
levels. For DeepSeek-R1, Simplified Chinese queries elicited the highest bias
rates; these diminished in Traditional Chinese and were nearly absent in
English. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 occasionally responded in Simplified Chinese to
Traditional Chinese queries and amplified existing PRC-aligned terms in its
Chinese answers, demonstrating an "invisible loudspeaker" effect. Furthermore,
such biases were not confined to overtly political topics but also permeated
cultural and lifestyle content, particularly in DeepSeek-R1.

Motivation: 解决教育对话中 AI 导师对学生错误的识别和定位问题，提升教学评估的可靠性。

Method: 使用 MPNet 模型，结合类加权交叉熵损失处理类别不平衡，采用分组交叉验证和硬投票集成方法。

Result: 在官方测试集上，错误识别和错误定位的宏 F1 分数分别为 0.7110 和 0.5543。

Conclusion: 集成方法和分析结果为教育对话中导师响应评估系统的设计提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: We present Team BD's submission to the BEA 2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical
Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors, under Track 1 (Mistake Identification)
and Track 2 (Mistake Location). Both tracks involve three-class classification
of tutor responses in educational dialogues - determining if a tutor correctly
recognizes a student's mistake (Track 1) and whether the tutor pinpoints the
mistake's location (Track 2). Our system is built on MPNet, a Transformer-based
language model that combines BERT and XLNet's pre-training advantages. We
fine-tuned MPNet on the task data using a class-weighted cross-entropy loss to
handle class imbalance, and leveraged grouped cross-validation (10 folds) to
maximize the use of limited data while avoiding dialogue overlap between
training and validation. We then performed a hard-voting ensemble of the best
models from each fold, which improves robustness and generalization by
combining multiple classifiers. Our approach achieved strong results on both
tracks, with exact-match macro-F1 scores of approximately 0.7110 for Mistake
Identification and 0.5543 for Mistake Location on the official test set. We
include comprehensive analysis of our system's performance, including confusion
matrices and t-SNE visualizations to interpret classifier behavior, as well as
a taxonomy of common errors with examples. We hope our ensemble-based approach
and findings provide useful insights for designing reliable tutor response
evaluation systems in educational dialogue settings.

Motivation: 随着AI和LLMs的发展，专业幽默在工作场所的应用被忽视，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了一个专业幽默语句数据集，并评估了五种LLMs的判断能力。

Result: LLMs在判断幽默适当性上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在专业幽默领域的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: With the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language
Models (LLMs), the automation of daily tasks, like automatic writing, is
getting more and more attention. Hence, efforts have focused on aligning LLMs
with human values, yet humor, particularly professional industrial humor used
in workplaces, has been largely neglected. To address this, we develop a
dataset of professional humor statements along with features that determine the
appropriateness of each statement. Our evaluation of five LLMs shows that LLMs
often struggle to judge the appropriateness of humor accurately.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源模型在实现真正的全模态能力方面仍有不足，无法泛化到训练模态对之外或在处理多模态输入时表现不佳。

Method: 研究了模态扩展技术，分析了其对核心语言能力的影响，探讨了模型合并的可行性，并比较了全模态扩展与顺序扩展的效果。

Result: 通过大量实验，论文分析了这些权衡，并提供了关于当前方法实现真正全模态可行性的见解。

Conclusion: 研究为全模态语言模型的发展提供了重要参考，但现有方法仍需改进以实现真正的全模态能力。

Abstract: Omni-modal language models (OLMs) aim to integrate and reason over diverse
input modalities--such as text, images, video, and audio--while maintaining
strong language capabilities. Despite recent advancements, existing models,
especially open-source ones, remain far from true omni-modality, struggling to
generalize beyond the specific modality pairs they are trained on or to achieve
strong performance when processing multi-modal inputs. We study the effect of
extending modality, the dominant technique for training multimodal models,
where an off-the-shelf language model is fine-tuned on target-domain and
language data. Specifically, we investigate three key questions: (1) Does
modality extension compromise core language abilities? (2) Can model merging
effectively integrate independently fine-tuned modality-specific models to
achieve omni-modality? (3) Does omni-modality extension lead to better
knowledge sharing and generalization compared to sequential extension? Through
extensive experiments, we analyze these trade-offs and provide insights into
the feasibility of achieving true omni-modality using current approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有引用评估方法主要依赖自然语言推理（NLI），未能全面反映引用的多维质量，需要更精细的评估框架。

Method: 提出CiteEval框架，结合引用来源、检索上下文、用户查询和生成文本进行细粒度评估，并构建多领域基准CiteBench和自动评估工具CiteEval-Auto。

Result: CiteEval-Auto在实验中表现出优于现有指标的能力，能更全面地捕捉引用的多维特性。

Conclusion: CiteEval提供了一个原则性和可扩展的方法，用于评估和改进模型生成的引用质量。

Abstract: Citation quality is crucial in information-seeking systems, directly
influencing trust and the effectiveness of information access. Current
evaluation frameworks, both human and automatic, mainly rely on Natural
Language Inference (NLI) to assess binary or ternary supportiveness from cited
sources, which we argue is a suboptimal proxy for citation evaluation. In this
work we introduce CiteEval, a citation evaluation framework driven by
principles focusing on fine-grained citation assessment within a broad context,
encompassing not only the cited sources but the full retrieval context, user
query, and generated text. Guided by the proposed framework, we construct
CiteBench, a multi-domain benchmark with high-quality human annotations on
citation quality. To enable efficient evaluation, we further develop
CiteEval-Auto, a suite of model-based metrics that exhibit strong correlation
with human judgments. Experiments across diverse systems demonstrate
CiteEval-Auto's superior ability to capture the multifaceted nature of
citations compared to existing metrics, offering a principled and scalable
approach to evaluate and improve model-generated citations.

*Igor Sterner,Simone Teufel*

TLDR: 提出了一种基于最小对干预的方法，评估大型语言模型（LLM）在代码转换（CS）上的表现，并与双语者偏好对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在语言覆盖范围、代码转换现象的多样性或扩展性上不足，缺乏对LLM在CS行为上的评估。

Method: 通过构建最小对（自然CS句子与人工变体），收集11种语言对的1000对数据，进行人类与LLM实验。

Result: 双语者一致偏好自然CS句子；LLM模型越大，越倾向于为自然CS句子分配更高概率，尤其在封闭类词变体上差异显著。

Conclusion: LLM在CS行为上与双语者表现一致，模型规模是关键因素，封闭类词变体对概率差异影响最大。

Abstract: There is a lack of an evaluation methodology that estimates the extent to
which large language models (LLMs) use code-switching (CS) in the same way as
bilinguals. Existing methods do not have wide language coverage, fail to
account for the diverse range of CS phenomena, or do not scale. We propose an
intervention based on minimal pairs of CS. Each minimal pair contains one
naturally occurring CS sentence and one minimally manipulated variant. We
collect up to 1,000 such pairs each for 11 language pairs. Our human
experiments show that, for every language pair, bilinguals consistently prefer
the naturally occurring CS sentence. Meanwhile our experiments with current
LLMs show that the larger the model, the more consistently it assigns higher
probability to the naturally occurring CS sentence than to the variant. In
accordance with theoretical claims, the largest probability differences arise
in those pairs where the manipulated material consisted of closed-class words.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证语码转换（CS）模式是否仅由句法解释，填补大规模、多语言、跨现象实验的空白。

Method: 设计实验，确保预测系统仅依赖句法信息，测试其区分语码转换句子的能力。

Result: 句法信息足以让自动系统区分语码转换句子，效果与人类双语者相当，且模式可泛化到未见过的语言对。

Conclusion: 句法在语码转换中起关键作用，支持其作为解释CS模式的主要因素。

Abstract: The theoretical code-switching (CS) literature provides numerous pointwise
investigations that aim to explain patterns in CS, i.e. why bilinguals switch
language in certain positions in a sentence more often than in others. A
resulting consensus is that CS can be explained by the syntax of the
contributing languages. There is however no large-scale, multi-language,
cross-phenomena experiment that tests this claim. When designing such an
experiment, we need to make sure that the system that is predicting where
bilinguals tend to switch has access only to syntactic information. We provide
such an experiment here. Results show that syntax alone is sufficient for an
automatic system to distinguish between sentences in minimal pairs of CS, to
the same degree as bilingual humans. Furthermore, the learnt syntactic patterns
generalise well to unseen language pairs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试缺乏对LLMs在复杂对话场景中的全面评估，CONFETTI填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过109个人工模拟对话（313个用户轮次，覆盖86个API），针对多种对话复杂性进行评估，并采用离策略轮次评估方法。

Result: 结果显示，部分模型能处理长对话和多API调用，但大多数模型在长上下文或API数量增加时表现不佳，链式功能调用性能普遍受限。

Conclusion: Nova Pro、Claude Sonnet v3.5和Llama 3.1 405B是CONFETTI上表现最佳的模型。

Abstract: We introduce Conversational Function-Calling Evaluation Through Turn-Level
Interactions (CONFETTI), a conversational benchmark1 designed to evaluate the
function-calling capabilities and response quality of large language models
(LLMs). Current benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of LLMs in complex
conversational scenarios. CONFETTI addresses this gap through 109
human-simulated conversations, comprising 313 user turns and covering 86 APIs.
These conversations explicitly target various conversational complexities, such
as follow-ups, goal correction and switching, ambiguous and implicit goals. We
perform off-policy turn-level evaluation using this benchmark targeting
function-calling. Our benchmark also incorporates dialog act annotations to
assess agent responses. We evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and
analyze their performance with respect to the number of available APIs,
conversation lengths, and chained function calling. Our results reveal that
while some models are able to handle long conversations, and leverage more than
20+ APIs successfully, other models struggle with longer context or when
increasing the number of APIs. We also report that the performance on chained
function-calls is severely limited across the models. Overall, the top
performing models on CONFETTI are Nova Pro (40.01%), Claude Sonnet v3.5
(35.46%) and Llama 3.1 405B (33.19%) followed by command-r-plus (31.18%) and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单细胞LLMs难以整合空间信息并忽视细胞间相互作用，限制了其捕捉生物学关系的能力。

Method: Spatial2Sentence构建表达相似性和距离矩阵，将空间相邻且表达相似的细胞配对为正样本，远距离且表达不同的细胞为负样本，通过多句子表示使LLMs学习细胞间相互作用。

Result: 在预处理IMC数据集上，Spatial2Sentence优于现有单细胞LLMs，糖尿病数据集的细胞类型分类和临床状态预测分别提高了5.98%和4.18%。

Conclusion: Spatial2Sentence通过整合空间和表达信息，显著提升了单细胞LLMs的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Image mass cytometry (IMC) enables high-dimensional spatial profiling by
combining mass cytometry's analytical power with spatial distributions of cell
phenotypes. Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract
cell states by translating gene or protein expression into biological context.
However, existing single-cell LLMs face two major challenges: (1) Integration
of spatial information: they struggle to generalize spatial coordinates and
effectively encode spatial context as text, and (2) Treating each cell
independently: they overlook cell-cell interactions, limiting their ability to
capture biological relationships. To address these limitations, we propose
Spatial2Sentence, a novel framework that integrates single-cell expression and
spatial information into natural language using a multi-sentence approach.
Spatial2Sentence constructs expression similarity and distance matrices,
pairing spatially adjacent and expressionally similar cells as positive pairs
while using distant and dissimilar cells as negatives. These multi-sentence
representations enable LLMs to learn cellular interactions in both expression
and spatial contexts. Equipped with multi-task learning, Spatial2Sentence
outperforms existing single-cell LLMs on preprocessed IMC datasets, improving
cell-type classification by 5.98% and clinical status prediction by 4.18% on
the diabetes dataset while enhancing interpretability. The source code can be

Conclusion: 强调文化能力与技术能力并重，为阿拉伯语模型评估提供理论和实践指导。

Abstract: This paper addresses critical gaps in Arabic language model evaluation by
establishing comprehensive theoretical guidelines and introducing a novel
evaluation framework. We first analyze existing Arabic evaluation datasets,
identifying significant issues in linguistic accuracy, cultural alignment, and
methodological rigor. To address these limitations in LLMs, we present the
Arabic Depth Mini Dataset (ADMD), a carefully curated collection of 490
challenging questions spanning ten major domains (42 sub-domains, see Figure 1.
Using ADMD, we evaluate five leading language models: GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
Gemini Flash 1.5, CommandR 100B, and Qwen-Max. Our results reveal significant
variations in model performance across different domains, with particular
challenges in areas requiring deep cultural understanding and specialized
knowledge. Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrated the highest overall accuracy at 30\%,
showing relative strength in mathematical theory in Arabic, Arabic language,
and islamic domains. This work provides both theoretical foundations and
practical insights for improving Arabic language model evaluation, emphasizing
the importance of cultural competence alongside technical capabilities.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive (AR) models by enabling parallel and controllable generation.
Among this family of models, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) achieve the
strongest performance but still underperform AR models in perplexity and lack
key inference-time efficiency features--most notably, KV caching. In this work,
we introduce Eso-LMs, a new family of models that fuses AR and MDM paradigms,
enabling smooth interpolation between their perplexities while overcoming their
respective limitations. Eso-LMs set a new state of the art on standard language
modeling benchmarks. Crucially, we are the **first to introduce KV caching for
MDMs** while preserving parallel generation, significantly improving inference
efficiency. Combined with an optimized sampling schedule, our method achieves
up to **65x** faster inference than standard MDMs and **4x** faster inference
than prior semi-autoregressive approaches. We provide the code and model

Motivation: 当前奖励模型的评估进展未能在下游任务中体现其有效性，简单的直接对齐算法表现更优。因此，需要更严格的评估标准。

Method: 通过引入RewardBench 2，使用新的人类提示而非现有下游评估提示，构建更具挑战性的基准，并量化其与下游任务性能的相关性。

Result: RewardBench 2使模型得分平均比RewardBench低20分，同时与下游任务性能高度相关。

Conclusion: RewardBench 2为奖励模型评估提供了更严格的基准，有助于提升模型在下游任务中的表现。

Abstract: Reward models are used throughout the post-training of language models to
capture nuanced signals from preference data and provide a training target for
optimization across instruction following, reasoning, safety, and more domains.
The community has begun establishing best practices for evaluating reward
models, from the development of benchmarks that test capabilities in specific
skill areas to others that test agreement with human preferences. At the same
time, progress in evaluation has not been mirrored by the effectiveness of
reward models in downstream tasks -- simpler direct alignment algorithms are
reported to work better in many cases. This paper introduces RewardBench 2, a
new multi-skill reward modeling benchmark designed to bring new, challenging
data for accuracy-based reward model evaluation -- models score about 20 points
on average lower on RewardBench 2 compared to the first RewardBench -- while
being highly correlated with downstream performance. Compared to most other
benchmarks, RewardBench 2 sources new human prompts instead of existing prompts
from downstream evaluations, facilitating more rigorous evaluation practices.
In this paper, we describe our benchmark construction process and report how
existing models perform on it, while quantifying how performance on the
benchmark correlates with downstream use of the models in both inference-time
scaling algorithms, like best-of-N sampling, and RLHF training algorithms like
proximal policy optimization.

TLDR: RLVR通过分析token熵模式，发现高熵token（关键分叉点）对推理性能至关重要，仅优化20%高熵token即可保持性能甚至超越全梯度更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RLVR机制，理解token熵模式如何影响LLM推理性能。

Method: 通过分析CoT推理中的token熵模式，研究RLVR训练中熵模式的变化，并限制策略梯度更新至高熵token。

Result: 仅优化20%高熵token在多个模型上表现优于全梯度更新（如Qwen3-32B提升11.04分）。

Conclusion: RLVR的有效性源于优化高熵token，未来可通过聚焦少数高熵token进一步优化LLM推理。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work,
we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of
token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens
influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of
tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer
the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy
patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the
base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy
tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e.,
forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy
gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20
rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable
to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly
surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71
on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models,
highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the
80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These
findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing
the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our
results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy
perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to
further improve LLM reasoning.

TLDR: 论文提出Self-ensemble方法，通过分组和集成预测解决LLM在多选题中的置信度失真问题，无需调参即可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在多选题（MCQA）中表现不佳，尤其是选项增多时，存在正确预测信心不足和错误预测过度自信的问题。

Method: 将选项分组，通过注意力掩码和位置编码集成LLM的预测，无需标记数据调参。

Result: 在三个LLM和数据集上的实验表明，Self-ensemble显著优于标准推理和基线方法。

Conclusion: Self-ensemble有效解决了LLM的置信度失真问题，具有即插即用的优势。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general fields, they
exhibit a confidence distortion problem on multi-choice question-answering
(MCQA), particularly as the number of answer choices increases. Specifically,
on MCQA with many choices, LLMs suffer from under-confidence in correct
predictions and over-confidence in incorrect ones, leading to a substantially
degraded performance. To solve this problem, we propose Self-ensemble in this
work. Our method splits the choices into several groups and ensembles LLM
predictions across these groups to reach a final decision. The advantage of
Self-ensemble is its plug-and-play nature, where it can be integrated into
existing LLM architecture based on a designed attention mask and positional
encoding, without requiring labeled datasets for parameter tuning. Experimental
results on three LLMs and datasets demonstrate that Self-ensemble
comprehensively addresses the confidence distortion problem of LLMs,
outperforming standard inference as well as baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM是否能超越常规浏览任务，处理人类不愿做的复杂、繁琐任务。

Method: 基于WebArena的四个模拟环境，设计包含三类挑战的任务：大量信息检索、数学计算和长期记忆。

Result: 实验显示，随着LLM（如GPT-4o、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、Gemini 2.5 Pro）的进步，性能显著提升，但仍需改进。

Conclusion: WebChoreArena能清晰衡量LLM的进步，但现有模型在复杂任务中仍有不足。

Abstract: Powered by a large language model (LLM), a web browsing agent operates web
browsers in a human-like manner and offers a highly transparent path toward
automating a wide range of everyday tasks. As web agents become increasingly
capable and demonstrate proficiency in general browsing tasks, a critical
question emerges: Can they go beyond general browsing to robustly handle tasks
that are tedious and complex, or chores that humans often avoid doing
themselves? In this paper, we introduce WebChoreArena, a new fully reproducible
benchmark comprising 532 carefully curated tasks designed to extend the scope
of WebArena beyond general browsing to more labor-intensive and tedious tasks.
WebChoreArena systematically integrates three key challenges: (i) Massive
Memory tasks requiring accurate retrieval of large amounts of information in
the observations, (ii) Calculation tasks demanding precise mathematical
reasoning, and (iii) Long-Term Memory tasks necessitating long-term memory
across multiple webpages. Built on top of the fully reproducible and widely
adopted four WebArena simulation environments, WebChoreArena ensures strict
reproducibility and enables fair, direct comparisons with the established
WebArena benchmark, offering key insights into agent progress. Our experimental
results demonstrate that as LLMs evolve, represented by GPT-4o, Claude 3.7
Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, significant improvements in performance are
observed on WebChoreArena. These findings suggest that WebChoreArena is
well-suited to measure the advancement of state-of-the-art LLMs with greater
clarity. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that even with Gemini 2.5 Pro,
there remains substantial room for improvement compared to WebArena,
highlighting the increased challenges posed by WebChoreArena.

Motivation: 大规模RAG系统计算资源消耗高且容易生成幻觉内容，需要一种更高效的方法在小型模型中实现类似能力。

Result: 实验表明，DRAG在多个基准测试中优于现有方法（如MiniRAG），性能提升高达27.7%，同时保持高效和可靠。

Conclusion: DRAG为小型语言模型提供了一种实用且资源高效的检索与生成能力增强方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have proven highly effective for
tasks requiring factual consistency and robust knowledge retrieval. However,
large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are
prone to generating hallucinated content from Humans. In this work, we
introduce $\texttt{DRAG}$, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from
large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach
leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the
distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing
model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions
with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\texttt{DRAG}$
effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further
present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and
introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG
methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving
high-level efficiency and reliability. With $\texttt{DRAG}$, we provide a
practical and resource-efficient roadmap to deploying enhanced retrieval and
generation capabilities in small-sized LLMs.

Conclusion: 逆设计应发展为统一生态系统，结合领域知识、物理先验和自适应推理，构建可扩展、可解释的AI驱动设计系统。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping inverse design across manufacturing
domain, enabling high-performance discovery in materials, products, and
processes. However, purely data-driven approaches often struggle in realistic
settings characterized by sparse data, high-dimensional design spaces, and
nontrivial physical constraints. This perspective argues for a new generation
of design systems that transcend black-box modeling by integrating domain
knowledge, physics-informed learning, and intuitive human-AI interfaces. We
first demonstrate how expert-guided sampling strategies enhance data efficiency
and model generalization. Next, we discuss how physics-informed machine
learning enables physically consistent modeling in data-scarce regimes.
Finally, we explore how large language models emerge as interactive design
agents connecting user intent with simulation tools, optimization pipelines,
and collaborative workflows. Through illustrative examples and conceptual
frameworks, we advocate that inverse design in manufacturing should evolve into
a unified ecosystem, where domain knowledge, physical priors, and adaptive
reasoning collectively enable scalable, interpretable, and accessible AI-driven
design systems.

Result: AI代理表现差异显著，行为异常可能导致消费者和商家的财务损失。

Conclusion: 自动化虽提升效率，但伴随风险，用户需谨慎授权AI代理处理商业决策。

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist
with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In
this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants
authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to
answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to
secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating
deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we
develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM
agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal
that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different
agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover,
behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers
and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These
results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also
introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating
business decisions to AI agents.

Motivation: 动态风险定价可能排斥弱势群体，需通过监管手段平衡私人利益与社会目标。

Method: 提出MarketSim模拟器，训练强化学习社会规划者制定公平税收政策，并通过L1正则化保持透明性。

Result: 在美国医保和消费信贷市场中，政策提升需求公平性16%，且社会福利优于自由市场和固定线性税收。

Conclusion: AI辅助监管可将竞争性社会困境转化为双赢均衡，为公平市场监督提供实用框架。

Abstract: Dynamic, risk-based pricing can systematically exclude vulnerable consumer
groups from essential resources such as health insurance and consumer credit.
We show that a regulator can realign private incentives with social objectives
through a learned, interpretable tax schedule. First, we provide a formal
proposition that bounding each firm's \emph{local} demographic gap implicitly
bounds the \emph{global} opt-out disparity, motivating firm-level penalties.
Building on this insight we introduce \texttt{MarketSim} -- an open-source,
scalable simulator of heterogeneous consumers and profit-maximizing firms --
and train a reinforcement learning (RL) social planner (SP) that selects a
bracketed fairness-tax while remaining close to a simple linear prior via an
$\mathcal{L}_1$ regularizer. The learned policy is thus both transparent and
easily interpretable. In two empirically calibrated markets, i.e., U.S.
health-insurance and consumer-credit, our planner simultaneously raises
demand-fairness by up to $16\%$ relative to unregulated Free Market while
outperforming a fixed linear schedule in terms of social welfare without
explicit coordination. These results illustrate how AI-assisted regulation can
convert a competitive social dilemma into a win-win equilibrium, providing a
principled and practical framework for fairness-aware market oversight.

Abstract: The volume of textual data available in aviation safety reports presents a
challenge for timely and accurate analysis. This paper examines how Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and, specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) can
automate the process of extracting valuable insights from this data, ultimately
enhancing aviation safety. The paper reviews ongoing efforts focused on the
application of NLP and deep learning to aviation safety reports, with the goal
of classifying the level of damage to an aircraft and identifying the phase of
flight during which safety occurrences happen. Additionally, the paper explores
the use of Topic Modeling (TM) to uncover latent thematic structures within
aviation incident reports, aiming to identify recurring patterns and potential
areas for safety improvement. The paper compares and contrasts the performance
of various deep learning models and TM techniques applied to datasets from the
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Australian Transport Safety
Bureau (ATSB), as well as the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), discussing the
impact of dataset size and source on the accuracy of the analysis. The findings
demonstrate that both NLP and deep learning, as well as TM, can significantly
improve the efficiency and accuracy of aviation safety analysis, paving the way
for more proactive safety management and risk mitigation strategies.

Motivation: 解决LLMs中提示工程的专业性、试错和主观任务优化问题。

Result: DEEVO在开放和封闭任务中显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: DEEVO通过自适应优化消除了预定义指标的需求，推动了提示优化研究。

Abstract: Prompt engineering represents a critical bottleneck to harness the full
potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex tasks, as it
requires specialized expertise, significant trial-and-error, and manual
intervention. This challenge is particularly pronounced for tasks involving
subjective quality assessment, where defining explicit optimization objectives
becomes fundamentally problematic. Existing automated prompt optimization
methods falter in these scenarios, as they typically require well-defined
task-specific numerical fitness functions or rely on generic templates that
cannot capture the nuanced requirements of complex use cases. We introduce
DEEVO (DEbate-driven EVOlutionary prompt optimization), a novel framework that
guides prompt evolution through a debate-driven evaluation with an Elo-based
selection. Contrary to prior work, DEEVOs approach enables exploration of the
discrete prompt space while preserving semantic coherence through intelligent
crossover and strategic mutation operations that incorporate debate-based
feedback, combining elements from both successful and unsuccessful prompts
based on identified strengths rather than arbitrary splicing. Using Elo ratings
as a fitness proxy, DEEVO simultaneously drives improvement and preserves
valuable diversity in the prompt population. Experimental results demonstrate
that DEEVO significantly outperforms both manual prompt engineering and
alternative state-of-the-art optimization approaches on open-ended tasks and
close-ended tasks despite using no ground truth feedback. By connecting LLMs
reasoning capabilities with adaptive optimization, DEEVO represents a
significant advancement in prompt optimization research by eliminating the need
of predetermined metrics to continuously improve AI systems.

given control conditions when solving complex tasks. Additionally, we present
the Control-R-4K dataset, which consists of challenging problems annotated with

enhance reasoning control, we propose a Conditional Distillation Finetuning

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming sectors such as healthcare,
finance, and autonomous systems, offering powerful tools for innovation. Yet
its rapid integration raises urgent ethical concerns related to data ownership,
privacy, and systemic bias. Issues like opaque decision-making, misleading
outputs, and unfair treatment in high-stakes domains underscore the need for
transparent and accountable AI systems. This article addresses these challenges
by proposing a modular ethical assessment framework built on ontological blocks
of meaning-discrete, interpretable units that encode ethical principles such as
fairness, accountability, and ownership. By integrating these blocks with FAIR
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, the framework
supports scalable, transparent, and legally aligned ethical evaluations,
including compliance with the EU AI Act. Using a real-world use case in
AI-powered investor profiling, the paper demonstrates how the framework enables
dynamic, behavior-informed risk classification. The findings suggest that
ontological blocks offer a promising path toward explainable and auditable AI
ethics, though challenges remain in automation and probabilistic reasoning.

Result: 模型在预录数据上达到65.35%准确率，在真实条件下对坚果和香料的分类准确率分别为10.71%和25.38%。

Conclusion: SmellNet揭示了气味AI的技术挑战，如特征学习、边缘计算模型和环境鲁棒性。

Abstract: The ability of AI to sense and identify various substances based on their
smell alone can have profound impacts on allergen detection (e.g., smelling
gluten or peanuts in a cake), monitoring the manufacturing process, and sensing
hormones that indicate emotional states, stress levels, and diseases. Despite
these broad impacts, there are virtually no large scale benchmarks, and
therefore little progress, for training and evaluating AI systems' ability to
smell in the real world. In this paper, we use portable gas and chemical
sensors to create SmellNet, the first large-scale database that digitizes a
diverse range of smells in the natural world. SmellNet contains about 180,000
time steps of 50 substances (spanning nuts, spices, herbs, fruits, and
vegetables) with 50 hours of data. Using SmellNet, we train AI models for
real-time classification of substances based on their smell alone. Our best
methods leverage sequence models, contrastive learning to integrate
high-resolution Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry molecular data, and a new
temporal difference method that identifies sharp changes in sensor readings.
Our best models achieve up to 65.35% accuracy on pre-recorded data, and
generalize to real-world conditions with 10.71% accuracy on nuts and 25.38% on
spices in the challenging 50-way online classification task. Despite these
promising results, SmellNet highlights many technical challenges in building AI
for smell, including richer feature learning, on-edge smell models, and
robustness to environmental changes.

Conclusion: 该框架为文化感知的大语言模型部署提供了稳健解决方案，并为后续研究（如文化覆盖扩展和动态专家适应）奠定了基础。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into global applications
necessitates effective cultural alignment for meaningful and
culturally-sensitive interactions. Current LLMs often lack the nuanced
understanding required for diverse cultural contexts, and adapting them
typically involves costly full fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a
novel soft prompt fine-tuning framework that enables efficient and modular
cultural alignment. Our method utilizes vectorized prompt tuning to dynamically
route queries to a committee of culturally specialized 'expert' LLM
configurations, created by optimizing soft prompt embeddings without altering
the base model's parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework significantly enhances cultural sensitivity and adaptability,
improving alignment scores from 0.208 to 0.820, offering a robust solution for
culturally-aware LLM deployment. This research paves the way for subsequent
investigations into enhanced cultural coverage and dynamic expert adaptation,
crucial for realizing autonomous AI with deeply nuanced understanding in a
globally interconnected world.

of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate scientific discovery. While
existing approaches rely on grounding the discovery process within the relevant
literature, effectiveness varies significantly with the quality and nature of
the retrieved literature. We address the challenge of retrieving prior work
whose concepts can inspire solutions for a given research problem, a task we
define as Methodology Inspiration Retrieval (MIR). We construct a novel dataset
tailored for training and evaluating retrievers on MIR, and establish
baselines. To address MIR, we build the Methodology Adjacency Graph (MAG);
capturing methodological lineage through citation relationships. We leverage
MAG to embed an "intuitive prior" into dense retrievers for identifying
patterns of methodological inspiration beyond superficial semantic similarity.
This achieves significant gains of +5.4 in Recall@3 and +7.8 in Mean Average
Precision (mAP) over strong baselines. Further, we adapt LLM-based re-ranking
strategies to MIR, yielding additional improvements of +4.5 in Recall@3 and
+4.8 in mAP. Through extensive ablation studies and qualitative analyses, we
exhibit the promise of MIR in enhancing automated scientific discovery and
outline avenues for advancing inspiration-driven retrieval.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in
open-ended, real-world environments where inputs are messy, underspecified, and
not always trustworthy. Unlike curated benchmarks, these settings frequently
involve instructions that refer to missing objects or contradictory facts, rely
on ambiguous references, or request infeasible actions. In such cases, success
hinges not on task execution alone, but on a model's ability to detect when
something is silently wrong. This paper presents a systematic analysis of how
current MLLMs handle such implicit reasoning scenarios: cases where the flaw is
not explicitly stated but must be inferred from context. Using a curated
diagnostic suite spanning four categories of real-world failure modes, we
evaluate six MLLMs, including o3 and GPT-4o, and find that models frequently
fail to surface hidden issues, even when they possess the necessary perceptual
and reasoning skills. Explicit prompting reveals that the underlying
capabilities exist but are often suppressed in favor of user compliance. We
further show that simple inference-time interventions, such as cautious persona
prompting and, in particular, requiring a clarifying question, can dramatically
recover performance. Our findings highlight a persistent gap between reasoning
competence and behavioral compliance in current MLLMs and suggest practical
strategies for making these models more trustworthy in underconstrained
environments.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on the relationship between sleep and cognition,
the connection between sleep microstructure and human performance across
specific cognitive domains remains underexplored. This study investigates
whether deep learning models can predict executive functions, particularly
cognitive adaptability and conceptual reasoning from physiological processes
during a night's sleep. To address this, we introduce CogPSGFormer, a
multi-scale convolutional-transformer model designed to process multi-modal
polysomnographic data. This model integrates one-channel ECG and EEG signals
along with extracted features, including EEG power bands and heart rate
variability parameters, to capture complementary information across modalities.
A thorough evaluation of the CogPSGFormer architecture was conducted to
optimize the processing of extended sleep signals and identify the most
effective configuration. The proposed framework was evaluated on 817
individuals from the STAGES dataset using cross-validation. The model achieved
80.3\% accuracy in classifying individuals into low vs. high cognitive
performance groups on unseen data based on Penn Conditional Exclusion Test
(PCET) scores. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our multi-scale
feature extraction and multi-modal learning approach in leveraging
sleep-derived signals for cognitive performance prediction. To facilitate
reproducibility, our code is publicly accessible
(https://github.com/boshrakh95/CogPSGFormer.git).

Result: GPT-4o表现最稳定，DeepSeek-V3在优化任务中强但统计推理不稳定，Gemini-2.0语言清晰但推理能力不足。

Conclusion: 不同LLM在数学任务中各有优劣，需针对性改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on a range of
educational tasks, but are still understudied for their potential to solve
mathematical problems. In this study, we compare three prominent LLMs,
including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0, on three mathematics datasets of
varying complexities (GSM8K, MATH500, and UNSW datasets). We take a
five-dimensional approach based on the Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT)
framework to assess final answer correctness, step completeness, step validity,
intermediate calculation accuracy, and problem comprehension. The results show
that GPT-4o is the most stable and consistent in performance across all the
datasets, but particularly it performs outstandingly in high-level questions of
the UNSW dataset. DeepSeek-V3 is competitively strong in well-structured
domains such as optimisation, but suffers from fluctuations in accuracy in
statistical inference tasks. Gemini-2.0 shows strong linguistic understanding
and clarity in well-structured problems but performs poorly in multi-step
reasoning and symbolic logic. Our error analysis reveals particular deficits in
each model: GPT-4o is at times lacking in sufficient explanation or precision;
DeepSeek-V3 leaves out intermediate steps; and Gemini-2.0 is less flexible in
mathematical reasoning in higher dimensions.

Result: 在OSWorld上评估，Dyna-Think性能接近R1，生成token减少50%，且世界建模能力与代理性能正相关。

Conclusion: 将世界模型模拟整合到AI代理中，是提升其推理、规划和行动能力的有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such as
DeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics
and coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification,
goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavior
is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In
this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning
with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent
performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning
(DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with
Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing
world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and
trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT
uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling
ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and
then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on
OSWorld, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and
out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to
R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies
reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective
to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance
correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest
a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI
agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.

Conclusion: BASIL结合了符号表达、进化多样性和在线学习，为可解释策略合成提供了新方法。

Abstract: The quest for interpretable reinforcement learning is a grand challenge for
the deployment of autonomous decision-making systems in safety-critical
applications. Modern deep reinforcement learning approaches, while powerful,
tend to produce opaque policies that compromise verification, reduce
transparency, and impede human oversight. To address this, we introduce BASIL
(Best-Action Symbolic Interpretable Learning), a systematic approach for
generating symbolic, rule-based policies via online evolutionary search with
quality-diversity (QD) optimization. BASIL represents policies as ordered lists
of symbolic predicates over state variables, ensuring full interpretability and
tractable policy complexity. By using a QD archive, the methodology in the
proposed study encourages behavioral and structural diversity between
top-performing solutions, while a complexity-aware fitness encourages the
synthesis of compact representations. The evolutionary system supports the use
of exact constraints for rule count and system adaptability for balancing
transparency with expressiveness. Empirical comparisons with three benchmark
tasks CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, and Acrobot-v1 show that BASIL consistently
synthesizes interpretable controllers with compact representations comparable
to deep reinforcement learning baselines. Herein, this article introduces a new
interpretable policy synthesis method that combines symbolic expressiveness,
evolutionary diversity, and online learning through a unifying framework.

Abstract: Despite extraordinary progress in artificial intelligence (AI), modern
systems remain incomplete representations of human cognition. Vision, audition,
and language have received disproportionate attention due to well-defined
benchmarks, standardized datasets, and consensus-driven scientific foundations.
In contrast, olfaction - a high-bandwidth, evolutionarily critical sense - has
been largely overlooked. This omission presents a foundational gap in the
construction of truly embodied and ethically aligned super-human intelligence.
We argue that the exclusion of olfactory perception from AI architectures is
not due to irrelevance but to structural challenges: unresolved scientific
theories of smell, heterogeneous sensor technologies, lack of standardized
olfactory datasets, absence of AI-oriented benchmarks, and difficulty in
evaluating sub-perceptual signal processing. These obstacles have hindered the
development of machine olfaction despite its tight coupling with memory,
emotion, and contextual reasoning in biological systems. In this position
paper, we assert that meaningful progress toward general and embodied
intelligence requires serious investment in olfactory research by the AI
community. We call for cross-disciplinary collaboration - spanning
neuroscience, robotics, machine learning, and ethics - to formalize olfactory
benchmarks, develop multimodal datasets, and define the sensory capabilities
necessary for machines to understand, navigate, and act within human
environments. Recognizing olfaction as a core modality is essential not only
for scientific completeness, but for building AI systems that are ethically
grounded in the full scope of the human experience.

Abstract: World models are emerging as a transformative paradigm in artificial
intelligence, enabling agents to construct internal representations of their
environments for predictive reasoning, planning, and decision-making. By
learning latent dynamics, world models provide a sample-efficient framework
that is especially valuable in data-constrained or safety-critical scenarios.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of world models,
highlighting their architecture, training paradigms, and applications across
prediction, generation, planning, and causal reasoning. We compare and
distinguish world models from related concepts such as digital twins, the
metaverse, and foundation models, clarifying their unique role as embedded
cognitive engines for autonomous agents. We further propose Wireless Dreamer, a
novel world model-based reinforcement learning framework tailored for wireless
edge intelligence optimization, particularly in low-altitude wireless networks
(LAWNs). Through a weather-aware UAV trajectory planning case study, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving learning efficiency
and decision quality.

TLDR: MIRROR是一种受人类认知启发的认知架构，通过并行推理能力提升大语言模型在多轮对话中的表现，显著改善了安全性、一致性和冲突处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过内部独白处理复杂信息，MIRROR旨在将这种能力系统化地引入大语言模型，解决其常见的失败模式（如谄媚、注意力缺陷和约束冲突）。

Method: MIRROR由Thinker（协调推理线程）和Talker（生成上下文感知响应）组成，通过Inner Monologue Manager和Cognitive Controller实现并行推理和连贯内部叙事。

Result: 在CuRaTe基准测试中，MIRROR架构的模型在关键安全场景中相对提升156%，平均准确率>80%，比基线模型平均高21%。

Conclusion: MIRROR通过模块化内部推理显著增强了大语言模型的多轮对话能力，为认知科学与AI的融合提供了实践范例。

Abstract: Human intelligence relies on inner monologue to process complex information
through simultaneous reflection, memory retrieval, and response formulation. We
introduce MIRROR (Modular Internal Reasoning, Reflection, Orchestration, and
Response), a cognitive architecture that systematically implements these
parallel reasoning capabilities in large language models. MIRROR operates as a
unified system with two distinct functional layers: the Thinker and the Talker.
The Thinker encompasses: (1) the Inner Monologue Manager, coordinating
reasoning threads across cognitive dimensions (Goals, Reasoning, and Memory);
and (2) the Cognitive Controller, synthesizing these threads into a coherent
internal narrative maintained across conversation turns. The Talker component
then leverages this integrated narrative for context-aware responses. Evaluated
on the CuRaTe benchmark--testing personalized dialogue with safety-critical
constraints, conflicting preferences, and multi-turn consistency--LLMs
utilizing the MIRROR architecture achieve up to 156% relative improvement in
critical safety scenarios involving three persons with conflicting preferences,
maintaining an average accuracy of ~>80% on all scenarios. Across
scenario-specific comparisons, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Llama
4 variants, and Mistral 3 variants with the MIRROR architecture outperformed
baseline models by 21% on average (15.5 percentage points absolute). MIRROR
directly addresses three critical LLM failure modes: sycophancy, attentional
deficits to critical information, and inconsistent prioritization of
conflicting constraints. This work bridges cognitive science and AI by
implementing modular internal reasoning inspired by human cognition, creating a
persistent internal model that significantly enhances multi-turn conversation
capabilities.

Result: 通过标准基准测试验证了监控器在运行时检测鲁棒性违规的有效性。

Conclusion: 运行时监控是提升AI模型鲁棒性的有效补充手段。

Abstract: Input-output robustness appears in various different forms in the literature,
such as robustness of AI models to adversarial or semantic perturbations and
individual fairness of AI models that make decisions about humans.
  We propose runtime monitoring of input-output robustness of deployed,
black-box AI models, where the goal is to design monitors that would observe
one long execution sequence of the model, and would raise an alarm whenever it
is detected that two similar inputs from the past led to dissimilar outputs.
  This way, monitoring will complement existing offline ``robustification''
approaches to increase the trustworthiness of AI decision-makers.
  We show that the monitoring problem can be cast as the fixed-radius nearest
neighbor (FRNN) search problem, which, despite being well-studied, lacks
suitable online solutions.
  We present our tool Clemont, which offers a number of lightweight monitors,
some of which use upgraded online variants of existing FRNN algorithms, and one
uses a novel algorithm based on binary decision diagrams -- a data-structure
commonly used in software and hardware verification.
  We have also developed an efficient parallelization technique that can
substantially cut down the computation time of monitors for which the distance
between input-output pairs is measured using the $L_\infty$ norm.
  Using standard benchmarks from the literature of adversarial and semantic
robustness and individual fairness, we perform a comparative study of different
monitors in \tool, and demonstrate their effectiveness in correctly detecting
robustness violations at runtime.

Abstract: Understanding urban socioeconomic conditions through visual data is a
challenging yet essential task for sustainable urban development and policy
planning. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{CityLens}$, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of large language-vision models
(LLVMs) in predicting socioeconomic indicators from satellite and street view
imagery. We construct a multi-modal dataset covering a total of 17 globally
distributed cities, spanning 6 key domains: economy, education, crime,
transport, health, and environment, reflecting the multifaceted nature of urban
life. Based on this dataset, we define 11 prediction tasks and utilize three
evaluation paradigms: Direct Metric Prediction, Normalized Metric Estimation,
and Feature-Based Regression. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art LLVMs across
these tasks. Our results reveal that while LLVMs demonstrate promising
perceptual and reasoning capabilities, they still exhibit limitations in
predicting urban socioeconomic indicators. CityLens provides a unified
framework for diagnosing these limitations and guiding future efforts in using
LLVMs to understand and predict urban socioeconomic patterns. Our codes and

Method: 比较三种LLMs在不同难度QA任务中的表现，分析角色设定对自信度的影响，提出AFCE方法。

Result: LLMs对任务难度不敏感，角色设定会引发偏见自信度；AFCE显著减少过度自信。

Conclusion: AFCE能有效改善LLMs的自信度校准，使其更接近人类表现。

Abstract: Psychology research has shown that humans are poor at estimating their
performance on tasks, tending towards underconfidence on easy tasks and
overconfidence on difficult tasks. We examine three LLMs, Llama-3-70B-instruct,
Claude-3-Sonnet, and GPT-4o, on a range of QA tasks of varying difficulty, and
show that models exhibit subtle differences from human patterns of
overconfidence: less sensitive to task difficulty, and when prompted to answer
based on different personas -- e.g., expert vs layman, or different race,
gender, and ages -- the models will respond with stereotypically biased
confidence estimations even though their underlying answer accuracy remains the
same. Based on these observations, we propose Answer-Free Confidence Estimation
(AFCE) to improve confidence calibration and LLM interpretability in these
settings. AFCE is a self-assessment method that employs two stages of
prompting, first eliciting only confidence scores on questions, then asking
separately for the answer. Experiments on the MMLU and GPQA datasets spanning
subjects and difficulty show that this separation of tasks significantly
reduces overconfidence and delivers more human-like sensitivity to task
difficulty.

Abstract: With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they
are increasingly deployed as autonomous computer-use agents capable of
accomplishing complex computer tasks. However, a pressing issue arises: Can the
safety risk principles designed and aligned for general MLLMs in dialogue
scenarios be effectively transferred to real-world computer-use scenarios?
Existing research on evaluating the safety risks of MLLM-based computer-use
agents suffers from several limitations: it either lacks realistic interactive
environments, or narrowly focuses on one or a few specific risk types. These
limitations ignore the complexity, variability, and diversity of real-world
environments, thereby restricting comprehensive risk evaluation for
computer-use agents. To this end, we introduce \textbf{RiOSWorld}, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the potential risks of MLLM-based agents during real-world
computer manipulations. Our benchmark includes 492 risky tasks spanning various
computer applications, involving web, social media, multimedia, os, email, and
office software. We categorize these risks into two major classes based on
their risk source: (i) User-originated risks and (ii) Environmental risks. For
the evaluation, we evaluate safety risks from two perspectives: (i) Risk goal
intention and (ii) Risk goal completion. Extensive experiments with multimodal
agents on \textbf{RiOSWorld} demonstrate that current computer-use agents
confront significant safety risks in real-world scenarios. Our findings
highlight the necessity and urgency of safety alignment for computer-use agents
in real-world computer manipulation, providing valuable insights for developing
trustworthy computer-use agents. Our benchmark is publicly available at
https://yjyddq.github.io/RiOSWorld.github.io/.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为\sys的框架，用于提升LLM评估器的安全性和安全性评估能力，通过记忆增强推理和多阶段检索生成过程，实现了人类专家级别的评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则或LLM的评估器在逐步行动中容易遗漏危险、忽略细微含义、无法识别小问题的累积效应，且对模糊的安全规则感到困惑，因此需要一种更可靠的评估方法。

Method: \sys框架通过LLM自适应提取结构化语义特征（如场景、风险、行为）并生成关联的思维链推理痕迹，构建经验记忆。采用多阶段、上下文感知的检索增强生成过程动态检索相关推理经验，指导新案例的评估。

Result: 实验表明，\sys在所有基准测试中均显著提升了LLM的评估性能，并在代理安全性和安全性评估方面达到了人类专家级别的准确性。

Conclusion: \sys框架为解决LLM评估器的可靠性问题提供了一种有效方法，并通过\data基准测试验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of LLM-based agents, the reliable evaluation of
their safety and security remains a significant challenge. Existing rule-based
or LLM-based evaluators often miss dangers in agents' step-by-step actions,
overlook subtle meanings, fail to see how small issues compound, and get
confused by unclear safety or security rules. To overcome this evaluation
crisis, we introduce \sys, a universal, training-free, memory-augmented
reasoning framework that empowers LLM evaluators to emulate human expert
evaluators. \sys constructs an experiential memory by having an LLM adaptively
extract structured semantic features (e.g., scenario, risk, behavior) and
generate associated chain-of-thought reasoning traces for past interactions. A
multi-stage, context-aware retrieval-augmented generation process then
dynamically retrieves the most relevant reasoning experiences to guide the LLM
evaluator's assessment of new cases. Moreover, we developed \data, the first
benchmark designed to check how well LLM-based evaluators can spot both safety
risks and security threats. \data comprises \textbf{2293} meticulously
annotated interaction records, covering \textbf{15} risk types across
\textbf{29} application scenarios. A key feature of \data is its nuanced
approach to ambiguous risk situations, employing ``Strict'' and ``Lenient''
judgment standards. Experiments demonstrate that \sys not only consistently
improves the evaluation performance of LLMs across all benchmarks but also sets
a new state-of-the-art in LLM-as-a-judge for agent safety and security,
achieving human-level accuracy. Our work is openly openly accessible.

Motivation: 传统本体创建依赖专家手动操作，耗时且易错，难以应对大规模动态知识领域。

Method: OntoRAG整合了网络爬取、PDF解析、混合分块、信息提取、知识图谱构建和本体创建技术。

Result: 实验显示，OntoRAG在全面性和多样性上优于传统方法，综合胜率达85%（对向量RAG）和75%（对GraphRAG）。

Conclusion: OntoRAG解决了本体自动创建的关键挑战，推动了语义网的愿景。

Abstract: Ontologies are pivotal for structuring knowledge bases to enhance question
answering (QA) systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
traditional ontology creation relies on manual efforts by domain experts, a
process that is time intensive, error prone, and impractical for large, dynamic
knowledge domains. This paper introduces OntoRAG, an automated pipeline
designed to derive ontologies from unstructured knowledge bases, with a focus
on electrical relay documents. OntoRAG integrates advanced techniques,
including web scraping, PDF parsing, hybrid chunking, information extraction,
knowledge graph construction, and ontology creation, to transform unstructured
data into a queryable ontology. By leveraging LLMs and graph based methods,
OntoRAG enhances global sensemaking capabilities, outperforming conventional
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG approaches in
comprehensiveness and diversity. Experimental results demonstrate OntoRAGs
effectiveness, achieving a comprehensiveness win rate of 85% against vector RAG
and 75% against GraphRAGs best configuration. This work addresses the critical
challenge of automating ontology creation, advancing the vision of the semantic
web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图上下文编码为文本形式，未能充分利用LLM对图结构的感知和推理能力。

Method: DrKGC采用轻量级模型训练策略学习结构嵌入和逻辑规则，通过自底向上图检索提取子图，并用GCN适配器增强嵌入。

Result: 在两个通用领域和两个生物医学数据集上表现优异，且具有解释性和实用性。

Conclusion: DrKGC通过动态子图检索和结构嵌入增强，显著提升了知识图谱补全的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge
graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently,
generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for
graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in
textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving
and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose
DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph
Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to
learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages
a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query
guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN)
adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which
are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental
results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case
study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical
utility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的行为与人类价值观的对齐至关重要，但其声明偏好与情境选择中的偏好偏差问题尚未充分研究，这对模型的解释性、可信度和伦理部署提出了挑战。

Method: 通过设计一系列二元选择的提示数据集，比较LLM在通用原则提示（声明偏好）和情境化提示（显示偏好）中的响应，使用KL散度等指标量化偏差。

Result: 研究发现，提示格式的微小变化常导致偏好反转，且这种现象在不同偏好类别和主流LLM中普遍存在，揭示了对其决策能力的理解与控制不足。

Conclusion: 该研究对LLM在服务中的应用至关重要，尤其是在涉及道德、公平和社会责任的场景中，同时为未来LLM在自主代理任务中的部署提供了重要警示。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need to align
their behaviors with human values. A critical, yet understudied, issue is the
potential divergence between an LLM's stated preferences (its reported
alignment with general principles) and its revealed preferences (inferred from
decisions in contextualized scenarios). Such deviations raise fundamental
concerns for the interpretability, trustworthiness, reasoning transparency, and
ethical deployment of LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications. This work
formally defines and proposes a method to measure this preference deviation. We
investigate how LLMs may activate different guiding principles in specific
contexts, leading to choices that diverge from previously stated general
principles. Our approach involves crafting a rich dataset of well-designed
prompts as a series of forced binary choices and presenting them to LLMs. We
compare LLM responses to general principle prompts stated preference with LLM
responses to contextualized prompts revealed preference, using metrics like KL
divergence to quantify the deviation. We repeat the analysis across different
categories of preferences and on four mainstream LLMs and find that a minor
change in prompt format can often pivot the preferred choice regardless of the
preference categories and LLMs in the test. This prevalent phenomenon
highlights the lack of understanding and control of the LLM decision-making
competence. Our study will be crucial for integrating LLMs into services,
especially those that interact directly with humans, where morality, fairness,
and social responsibilities are crucial dimensions. Furthermore, identifying or
being aware of such deviation will be critically important as LLMs are
increasingly envisioned for autonomous agentic tasks where continuous human
evaluation of all LLMs' intermediary decision-making steps is impossible.

Abstract: Accurate house-price forecasting is essential for investors, planners, and
researchers. However, reproducible benchmarks with sufficient spatiotemporal
depth and contextual richness for long horizon prediction remain scarce. To
address this, we introduce HouseTS a large scale, multimodal dataset covering
monthly house prices from March 2012 to December 2023 across 6,000 ZIP codes in
30 major U.S. metropolitan areas. The dataset includes over 890K records,
enriched with points of Interest (POI), socioeconomic indicators, and detailed
real estate metrics. To establish standardized performance baselines, we
evaluate 14 models, spanning classical statistical approaches, deep neural
networks (DNNs), and pretrained time-series foundation models. We further
demonstrate the value of HouseTS in a multimodal case study, where a vision
language model extracts structured textual descriptions of geographic change
from time stamped satellite imagery. This enables interpretable, grounded
insights into urban evolution. HouseTS is hosted on Kaggle, while all
preprocessing pipelines, benchmark code, and documentation are openly

Motivation: 现有LLMs在不确定场景中常表现出过度自信，且现有解决方案（如回避回答）未能充分利用识别和解决不确定性的机会。

Method: 引入ConfuseBench基准，聚焦三种不确定性类型（文档稀缺、能力限制、查询模糊），并通过生成上下文感知查询和InteractDPO训练方法改进模型。

Result: 实验显示当前LLMs难以准确识别不确定性根源，尤其是能力限制；提出的方法显著提升了模型表现。

Conclusion: ConfuseBench和InteractDPO方法有效提升了LLMs在不确定性场景中的表现，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) across
various domains, they frequently exhibit overconfidence when encountering
uncertain scenarios, yet existing solutions primarily rely on evasive responses
(e.g., "I don't know") overlooks the opportunity of identifying and addressing
the uncertainty to generate more satisfactory responses. To systematically
investigate and improve LLMs' ability of recognizing and addressing the source
of uncertainty, we introduce \textbf{ConfuseBench}, a benchmark mainly focus on
three types of uncertainty: document scarcity, limited capability, and query
ambiguity. Experiments with ConfuseBench reveal that current LLMs struggle to
accurately identify the root cause of uncertainty and solve it. They prefer to
attribute uncertainty to query ambiguity while overlooking capability
limitations, especially for those weaker models. To tackle this challenge, we
first generate context-aware inquiries that highlight the confusing aspect of
the original query. Then we judge the source of uncertainty based on the
uniqueness of the inquiry's answer. Further we use an on-policy training
method, InteractDPO to generate better inquiries. Experimental results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，越狱攻击成为迫切问题，传统红队测试方法难以规模化。

Method: 通过CoP框架，将人类提供的红队测试原则转化为AI代理的指令，自动生成越狱提示。

Result: CoP框架显著提升了单轮攻击成功率，最高达19倍，并发现了新的安全风险。

Conclusion: CoP为LLMs的安全测试提供了统一且可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred transformative
applications in various domains, ranging from open-source to proprietary LLMs.
However, jailbreak attacks, which aim to break safety alignment and user
compliance by tricking the target LLMs into answering harmful and risky
responses, are becoming an urgent concern. The practice of red-teaming for LLMs
is to proactively explore potential risks and error-prone instances before the
release of frontier AI technology. This paper proposes an agentic workflow to
automate and scale the red-teaming process of LLMs through the
Composition-of-Principles (CoP) framework, where human users provide a set of
red-teaming principles as instructions to an AI agent to automatically
orchestrate effective red-teaming strategies and generate jailbreak prompts.
Distinct from existing red-teaming methods, our CoP framework provides a
unified and extensible framework to encompass and orchestrate human-provided
red-teaming principles to enable the automated discovery of new red-teaming
strategies. When tested against leading LLMs, CoP reveals unprecedented safety
risks by finding novel jailbreak prompts and improving the best-known
single-turn attack success rate by up to 19.0 times.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样性和有效性上优于现有方法，显著提升了红队探索的效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动化红队测试提供了新视角，并有效平衡了攻击提示的多样性和效果。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in power and influence, ensuring their
safety and preventing harmful output becomes critical. Automated red teaming
serves as a tool to detect security vulnerabilities in LLMs without manual
labor. However, most existing methods struggle to balance the effectiveness and
diversity of red-team generated attack prompts. To address this challenge, we
propose \ourapproach, a novel automated red teaming training framework that
utilizes reinforcement learning to explore and generate more effective attack
prompts while balancing their diversity. Specifically, it consists of three
training stages: (1) Cold Start: The red team model is supervised and
fine-tuned on a jailbreak dataset obtained through imitation learning. (2)
Warm-up Exploration: The model is trained in jailbreak instruction following
and exploration, using diversity and consistency as reward signals. (3)
Enhanced Jailbreak: Progressive jailbreak rewards are introduced to gradually
enhance the jailbreak performance of the red-team model. Extensive experiments
on a variety of LLMs show that \ourapproach effectively balances the diversity
and effectiveness of jailbreak prompts compared to existing methods. Our work
significantly improves the efficiency of red team exploration and provides a
new perspective on automated red teaming.

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在复杂地理推理任务中表现不足，需要一种系统化的评估方法来推动技术进步。

Method: 利用146万张街景图像，每张图像配以21步链式推理问题序列，涵盖视觉、空间、文化和精确定位四类推理，并标注难度。

Result: 测试显示MLLMs在视觉定位、推理一致性和精确定位方面存在显著不足，尤其是随着推理复杂度增加。

Conclusion: GeoChain为MLLMs的复杂地理推理能力提供了诊断工具，有助于推动相关技术进步。

Abstract: This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating
step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each
image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million
Q&A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained
localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and
precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with
semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our
benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5
variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models
frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning,
and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning
complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical
for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within
MLLMs.

Abstract: Many promising-looking ideas in AI research fail to deliver, but their
validation takes substantial human labor and compute. Predicting an idea's
chance of success is thus crucial for accelerating empirical AI research, a
skill that even expert researchers can only acquire through substantial
experience. We build the first benchmark for this task and compare LMs with
human experts. Concretely, given two research ideas (e.g., two jailbreaking
methods), we aim to predict which will perform better on a set of benchmarks.
We scrape ideas and experimental results from conference papers, yielding 1,585
human-verified idea pairs published after our base model's cut-off date for
testing, and 6,000 pairs for training. We then develop a system that combines a
fine-tuned GPT-4.1 with a paper retrieval agent, and we recruit 25 human
experts to compare with. In the NLP domain, our system beats human experts by a
large margin (64.4% v.s. 48.9%). On the full test set, our system achieves 77%
accuracy, while off-the-shelf frontier LMs like o3 perform no better than
random guessing, even with the same retrieval augmentation. We verify that our
system does not exploit superficial features like idea complexity through
extensive human-written and LM-designed robustness tests. Finally, we evaluate
our system on unpublished novel ideas, including ideas generated by an AI
ideation agent. Our system achieves 63.6% accuracy, demonstrating its potential
as a reward model for improving idea generation models. Altogether, our results
outline a promising new direction for LMs to accelerate empirical AI research.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced their performance by enabling in-depth understanding of diverse tasks.
With growing interest in applying LLMs to the time series domain, this has
proven nontrivial, as evidenced by the limited efficacy of straightforwardly
adapting text-domain reasoning techniques. Although recent work has shown
promise in several time series tasks, further leveraging advancements in LLM
reasoning remains under-explored for time series classification (TSC) tasks,
despite their prevalence and significance in many real-world applications. In
this paper, we propose ReasonTSC, a novel framework designed to effectively
leverage LLM reasoning for time series classification through both a multi-turn
reasoning and a fused decision-making strategy tailored to TSC. Rather than
straightforwardly applying existing reasoning techniques or relying solely on
LLMs' built-in reasoning capabilities, ReasonTSC first steers the model to
think over the essential characteristics of time series data. Next, it
integrates predictions and confidence scores from plug-in classifiers, e.g.,
domain-specific time series models, as in-context examples. Finally, ReasonTSC
guides the LLM through a structured reasoning process: it evaluates the initial
assessment, backtracks to consider alternative hypotheses, and compares their
merits before arriving at a final classification. Extensive experiments and
systematic ablation studies demonstrate that ReasonTSC consistently outperforms
both existing time series reasoning baselines and plug-in models, and is even
capable of identifying and correcting plug-in models' false predictions.

Conclusion: SynPO为细粒度视频描述提供了一种高效且性能优越的优化方法。

Abstract: Fine-grained video captioning aims to generate detailed, temporally coherent
descriptions of video content. However, existing methods struggle to capture
subtle video dynamics and rich detailed information. In this paper, we leverage
preference learning to enhance the performance of vision-language models in
fine-grained video captioning, while mitigating several limitations inherent to
direct preference optimization (DPO). First, we propose a pipeline for
constructing preference pairs that leverages the intrinsic properties of VLMs
along with partial assistance from large language models, achieving an optimal
balance between cost and data quality. Second, we propose Synergistic
Preference Optimization (SynPO), a novel optimization method offering
significant advantages over DPO and its variants. SynPO prevents negative
preferences from dominating the optimization, explicitly preserves the model's
language capability to avoid deviation of the optimization objective, and
improves training efficiency by eliminating the need for the reference model.
We extensively evaluate SynPO not only on video captioning benchmarks (e.g.,
VDC, VDD, VATEX) but also across well-established NLP tasks, including general
language understanding and preference evaluation, using diverse pretrained
models. Results demonstrate that SynPO consistently outperforms DPO variants
while achieving 20\% improvement in training efficiency. Code is available at

automated extraction of medical figures while contextually aligning them with
corresponding medical narratives. Based on this curated data, we generate 5,000

classification, anatomical identification, symptom diagnosis, and surgical
procedures. A multi-tier annotation system categorizes queries through
hierarchical taxonomies encompassing medical imaging modalities (42
categories), body anatomies (125 structures), and clinical specialties (31
departments), enabling nuanced analysis across medical subdomains. We evaluate
a wide array of MLLMs, including proprietary, open-sourced, medical, and

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了模态异质性带来的分布差异问题，提升了多模态情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) extracts emotions from multimodal data,
including visual, speech, and text inputs, playing a key role in human-computer
interaction. Attention-based fusion methods dominate MER research, achieving
strong classification performance. However, two key challenges remain:
effectively extracting modality-specific features and capturing cross-modal
similarities despite distribution differences caused by modality heterogeneity.
To address these, we propose a gated interactive attention mechanism to
adaptively extract modality-specific features while enhancing emotional
information through pairwise interactions. Additionally, we introduce a
modality-invariant generator to learn modality-invariant representations and
constrain domain shifts by aligning cross-modal similarities. Experiments on
IEMOCAP demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MER
approaches, achieving WA 80.7% and UA 81.3%.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）作为自主代理的认知基础问题，探讨其定义、决策方式及行为目标，以实现真正的自主性。

Method: 提出统一理论，将内部推理与外部行为视为等效认知工具，并协调代理的内省与交互，以最小化工具使用并最大化认知效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建具有自适应性和高效性的基础代理提供了原则性路径，推动了从行为执行者到知识驱动智能系统的转变。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into increasingly autonomous agents,
fundamental questions about their epistemic foundations remain unresolved: What
defines an agent? How should it make decisions? And what objectives should
guide its behavior? In this position paper, we argue that true autonomy
requires agents to be grounded in a coherent epistemic framework that governs
what they know, what they need to know, and how to acquire that knowledge
efficiently. We propose a unified theory that treats internal reasoning and
external actions as equivalent epistemic tools, enabling agents to
systematically coordinate introspection and interaction. Building on this
framework, we advocate for aligning an agent's tool use decision-making
boundary with its knowledge boundary, thereby minimizing unnecessary tool use
and maximizing epistemic efficiency. This perspective shifts the design of
agents from mere action executors to knowledge-driven intelligence systems,
offering a principled path toward building foundation agents capable of
adaptive, efficient, and goal-directed behavior.

*William Overman,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: Conformal Arbitrage 是一种后处理框架，通过数据驱动的阈值在主要模型和保守的 Guardian 之间进行权衡，确保不良事件的频率不超过用户设定的配额。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型部署需要平衡多个竞争目标（如帮助性与无害性、成本与准确性），因此需要一种方法在保证性能的同时控制风险。

Method: 利用 Conformal Arbitrage 框架，通过校准阈值（基于 conformal risk control）在主要模型和 Guardian 之间动态分配任务，无需修改模型权重。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性上优于随机路由，并能高效平衡多个目标。

Conclusion: Conformal Arbitrage 是一种实用且理论可靠的工具，适用于语言模型在多目标场景下的可信和经济部署。

Abstract: Modern language model deployments must often balance competing objectives,
for example, helpfulness versus harmlessness, cost versus accuracy, and reward
versus safety. We introduce Conformal Arbitrage, a post hoc framework that
learns a data driven threshold to mediate between a Primary model optimized for
a primary objective and a more conservative Guardian which could be another
model or a human domain expert aligned with a guardrail objective. The
threshold is calibrated with conformal risk control, yielding finite sample,
distribution free guarantees that the long run frequency of undesirable events,
such as factual errors or safety violations, does not exceed a user specified
quota. Because Conformal Arbitrage operates wholly at the API level, without
requiring access to model logits or updating model weights, it complements
weight based alignment techniques and integrates seamlessly with existing cost
aware cascades. Empirically, Conformal Arbitrage traces an efficient frontier,
allowing users to define an acceptable performance level for one objective
while maximizing utility in another. We observe that our method outperforms, in
terms of accuracy, cost matched random routing between models. These properties
make Conformal Arbitrage a practical, theoretically grounded tool for
trustworthy and economical deployment of large language models across a broad
range of potentially competing objectives.

Motivation: 由于不同背景的人对VLM助手有不同期望，需将其与个性化认知对齐以满足实际需求。

Method: 基于角色集概念简化问题，构建PCogAlignBench基准，提出PCogAlign框架，通过认知感知和基于动作的奖励模型实现个性化对齐。

Result: 实验和人工评估验证了PCogAlignBench的可靠性和PCogAlign框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文为个性化对齐VLM提供了可行方案，并开源了基准测试和代码。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) aligned with general human objectives, such as
being harmless and hallucination-free, have become valuable assistants of
humans in managing visual tasks. However, people with diversified backgrounds
have different cognition even in the same situation. Consequently, they may
have personalized expectations for VLM assistants. This highlights the urgent
need to align VLM assistants with personalized situated cognition for
real-world assistance. To study this problem, we first simplify it by
characterizing individuals based on the sociological concept of Role-Set. Then,
we propose to evaluate the individuals' actions to examine whether the
personalized alignment is achieved. Further, we construct a benchmark named
PCogAlignBench, which includes 18k instances and 20 individuals with different
Role-Sets. Finally, we present a framework called PCogAlign, which constructs a
cognition-aware and action-based reward model for personalized alignment.
Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate the reliability of the
PCogAlignBench and the effectiveness of our proposed PCogAlign. We will
open-source the constructed benchmark and code at

Method: 引入VENUS数据集（含标注视频和时间对齐的文本、表情及肢体语言），训练MARS模型，结合文本和量化非语言表示进行多模态理解和生成。

Result: 定量和定性分析表明，MARS能成功生成与对话输入对应的文本和非语言内容。

Conclusion: MARS通过多模态框架填补了对话AI中非语言交流的空白，验证了VENUS数据集的有效性。

Abstract: Nonverbal communication is integral to human interaction, with gestures,
facial expressions, and body language conveying critical aspects of intent and
emotion. However, existing large language models (LLMs) fail to effectively
incorporate these nonverbal elements, limiting their capacity to create fully
immersive conversational experiences. We introduce MARS, a multimodal language
model designed to understand and generate nonverbal cues alongside text,
bridging this gap in conversational AI. Our key innovation is VENUS, a
large-scale dataset comprising annotated videos with time-aligned text, facial
expressions, and body language. Leveraging VENUS, we train MARS with a
next-token prediction objective, combining text with vector-quantized nonverbal
representations to achieve multimodal understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Based on various analyses of the VENUS datasets, we validate
its substantial scale and high effectiveness. Our quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that MARS successfully generates text and nonverbal
languages, corresponding to conversational input.

TLDR: FLEx是一种针对MoE架构LLMs的新型联邦学习框架，通过个性化专家剪枝和自适应门控机制优化通信和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦学习方法无法有效利用MoE架构的稀疏性，导致通信和计算成本过高，阻碍个性化知识共享。

Method: FLEx通过剪枝全局MoE模型保留每个客户端的单个专家，并采用自适应门控机制重新整合个性化专家。

Result: 在非IID条件下的多样化指令数据集上，FLEx表现优于现有联邦基线方法。

Conclusion: FLEx为MoE架构的LLMs提供了一种高效的联邦学习解决方案，平衡了个性化与全局共享。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a prominent strategy
for scaling large language models (LLMs), effectively leveraging sparse
activation and facilitating task-specific personalization. However, current
federated learning (FL) approaches are primarily designed for dense models,
making them unable to directly exploit the sparsity inherent in MoE
architectures. Treating MoE models as dense networks in federated scenarios
results in excessive communication overhead and computational costs,
undermining the potential for personalized knowledge sharing. To address these
challenges, we propose FLEx (Federated LLMs with Personalized Experts), a novel
federated learning framework explicitly tailored for MoE-based LLMs. FLEx
efficiently personalizes by pruning the global MoE model to keep only one
expert per client, and employs an adaptive gating mechanism to reintegrate
these personalized experts into the pre-trained MoE layers, ensuring the
original backbone architecture remains unchanged. These personalized experts
are trained with local data and stored locally on each client, while the shared
modules are aggregated globally. Extensive evaluations on diverse
instruction-based datasets under non-IID conditions consistently demonstrate
that FLEx outperforms existing federated baselines. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流WSD方法在语义提取和计算效率上存在不足，PolyBERT旨在平衡局部与全局语义并减少冗余计算。

Method: 采用多编码器结合多头注意力机制融合局部与全局语义，引入BCL以减少训练输入和计算成本。

Result: PolyBERT在F1分数上优于基线方法2%，BCL版本减少37.6%的GPU计算时间。

Conclusion: PolyBERT通过改进语义融合和训练效率，显著提升了WSD任务的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Mainstream Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) approaches have employed BERT to
extract semantics from both context and definitions of senses to determine the
most suitable sense of a target word, achieving notable performance. However,
there are two limitations in these approaches. First, previous studies failed
to balance the representation of token-level (local) and sequence-level
(global) semantics during feature extraction, leading to insufficient semantic
representation and a performance bottleneck. Second, these approaches
incorporated all possible senses of each target word during the training phase,
leading to unnecessary computational costs. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces a poly-encoder BERT-based model with batch contrastive
learning for WSD, named PolyBERT. Compared with previous WSD methods, PolyBERT
has two improvements: (1) A poly-encoder with a multi-head attention mechanism
is utilized to fuse token-level (local) and sequence-level (global) semantics,
rather than focusing on just one. This approach enriches semantic
representation by balancing local and global semantics. (2) To avoid redundant
training inputs, Batch Contrastive Learning (BCL) is introduced. BCL utilizes
the correct senses of other target words in the same batch as negative samples
for the current target word, which reduces training inputs and computational
cost. The experimental results demonstrate that PolyBERT outperforms baseline
WSD methods such as Huang's GlossBERT and Blevins's BEM by 2\% in F1-score. In
addition, PolyBERT with BCL reduces GPU hours by 37.6\% compared with PolyBERT
without BCL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图的社交机器人检测方法依赖标签且泛化能力不足，生成式图自监督学习（GSL）虽有望解决这些问题，但现有方法受限于同质性假设，无法捕捉全局模式。

Method: BotHP采用双编码器架构，结合图感知编码器捕捉节点共性，图无关编码器保留节点独特性，并通过原型引导的聚类发现任务建模全局一致性。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，BotHP显著提升了检测性能，减少了对标签的依赖，并增强了泛化能力。

Conclusion: BotHP通过异质性感知和全局一致性建模，有效解决了社交机器人检测中的交互伪装和分布式部署问题。

Abstract: Detecting social media bots is essential for maintaining the security and
trustworthiness of social networks. While contemporary graph-based detection
methods demonstrate promising results, their practical application is limited
by label reliance and poor generalization capability across diverse
communities. Generative Graph Self-Supervised Learning (GSL) presents a
promising paradigm to overcome these limitations, yet existing approaches
predominantly follow the homophily assumption and fail to capture the global
patterns in the graph, which potentially diminishes their effectiveness when
facing the challenges of interaction camouflage and distributed deployment in
bot detection scenarios. To this end, we propose BotHP, a generative GSL
framework tailored to boost graph-based bot detectors through heterophily-aware
representation learning and prototype-guided cluster discovery. Specifically,
BotHP leverages a dual-encoder architecture, consisting of a graph-aware
encoder to capture node commonality and a graph-agnostic encoder to preserve
node uniqueness. This enables the simultaneous modeling of both homophily and
heterophily, effectively countering the interaction camouflage issue.
Additionally, BotHP incorporates a prototype-guided cluster discovery pretext
task to model the latent global consistency of bot clusters and identify
spatially dispersed yet semantically aligned bot collectives. Extensive
experiments on two real-world bot detection benchmarks demonstrate that BotHP
consistently boosts graph-based bot detectors, improving detection performance,
alleviating label reliance, and enhancing generalization capability.

Motivation: 在群体决策中，传统的个体责任定义（如法兰克福原则）常导致责任缺口，缺乏明确的责任方。

Method: 提出高阶责任的概念，并研究其填补责任缺口的有效性。

Result: 证明判定d阶高阶责任是否足够填补缺口的问题是Π_{2d+1}-完全的。

Conclusion: 高阶责任为解决群体决策中的责任缺口提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: In ethics, individual responsibility is often defined through Frankfurt's
principle of alternative possibilities. This definition is not adequate in a
group decision-making setting because it often results in the lack of a
responsible party or "responsibility gap''. One of the existing approaches to
address this problem is to consider group responsibility. Another, recently
proposed, approach is "higher-order'' responsibility. The paper considers the
problem of deciding if higher-order responsibility up to degree $d$ is enough
to close the responsibility gap. The main technical result is that this problem
is $\Pi_{2d+1}$-complete.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）在性能和成本之间的权衡问题，选择最适合用户查询的LLM。

Result: 在20个LLM和12个数据集上的实验表明，IRT-Router在效果和可解释性上优于基线方法，冷启动场景表现优异。

Conclusion: IRT-Router是一个可靠且实用的多LLM路由解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
a wide range of natural language tasks. However, selecting the optimal LLM to
respond to a user query often necessitates a delicate balance between
performance and cost. While powerful models deliver better results, they come
at a high cost, whereas smaller models are more cost-effective but less
capable. To address this trade-off, we propose IRT-Router, a multi-LLM routing
framework that efficiently routes user queries to the most suitable LLM.
Inspired by Item Response Theory (IRT), a psychological measurement
methodology, IRT-Router explicitly models the relationship between LLM
capabilities and user query attributes. This not only enables accurate
prediction of response performance but also provides interpretable insights,
such as LLM abilities and query difficulty. Additionally, we design an online
query warm-up technique based on semantic similarity, further enhancing the
online generalization capability of IRT-Router. Extensive experiments on 20
LLMs and 12 datasets demonstrate that IRT-Router outperforms most baseline
methods in terms of effectiveness and interpretability. Its superior
performance in cold-start scenarios further confirms the reliability and
practicality of IRT-Router in real-world applications. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将大量工具模式注入提示中成本高且易错，需要一种更高效的方式让LLM自主检索工具。

Method: 框架包含三个组件：主动工具请求、分层向量路由和迭代主动调用，通过语义相似性检索工具并支持多轮工具链构建。

Result: 实验表明MCP-Zero能高效处理上下文开销，从近3000个候选工具中准确选择，减少98%的token消耗，并支持多轮调用。

Conclusion: MCP-Zero显著提升了工具检索的效率和准确性，适用于多领域任务。

Abstract: Function-calling has enabled large language models (LLMs) to act as
tool-using agents, but injecting thousands of tool schemas into the prompt is
costly and error-prone. We introduce MCP-Zero, a proactive agent framework that
lets the LLM itself decide when and which external tools to retrieve, thereby
assembling a task-specific toolchain from scratch. The framework is built upon
three components: (1) Proactive Tool Request, where the model emits a
structured $\left<\operatorname{tool\_assistant}\right>$ block that explicitly
specifies the desired server and task; (2) Hierarchical Vector Routing, a
coarse-to-fine retrieval algorithm that first selects candidate servers and
then ranks tools within each server based on the semantic similarity; (3)
Iterative Proactive Invocation, enabling multi-round, cross-domain toolchain
construction with minimal context overhead, and allowing the model to
iteratively revise its request when the returned tools are insufficient. To
evaluate our approach we also compile MCP-tools, a retrieval dataset comprising
308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools extracted from the official
Model-Context-Protocol repository and normalized into a unified JSON schema.
Experiments show that MCP-Zero (i) effectively addresses the context overhead
problem of existing methods and accurately selects the correct tool from a pool
of nearly 3,000 candidates (248.1k tokens); (ii) reduces token consumption by
98\% on the APIbank while maintaining high accuracy; and (iii) supports
multi-turn tool invocation with consistent accuracy across rounds. The code and
dataset will be released soon.

Conclusion: AI对齐在多智能体系统中需动态处理，社会结构是关键因素，需开发工具评估交互对齐问题。

Abstract: This position paper states that AI Alignment in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)
should be considered a dynamic and interaction-dependent process that heavily
depends on the social environment where agents are deployed, either
collaborative, cooperative, or competitive. While AI alignment with human
values and preferences remains a core challenge, the growing prevalence of MAS
in real-world applications introduces a new dynamic that reshapes how agents
pursue goals and interact to accomplish various tasks. As agents engage with
one another, they must coordinate to accomplish both individual and collective
goals. However, this complex social organization may unintentionally misalign
some or all of these agents with human values or user preferences. Drawing on
social sciences, we analyze how social structure can deter or shatter group and
individual values. Based on these analyses, we call on the AI community to
treat human, preferential, and objective alignment as an interdependent
concept, rather than isolated problems. Finally, we emphasize the urgent need
for simulation environments, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks that allow
researchers to assess alignment in these interactive multi-agent contexts
before such dynamics grow too complex to control.

Conclusion: 该方法为稳定解的起源提供了新的视角，结合了确定性推导和非确定性选择。

Abstract: The rule $\mathrm{Defeated}(x) \leftarrow \mathrm{Attacks}(y,x),\, \neg \,
\mathrm{Defeated}(y)$, evaluated under the well-founded semantics (WFS), yields
a unique 3-valued (skeptical) solution of an abstract argumentation framework
(AF). An argument $x$ is defeated ($\mathrm{OUT}$) if there exists an
undefeated argument $y$ that attacks it. For 2-valued (stable) solutions, this
is the case iff $y$ is accepted ($\mathrm{IN}$), i.e., if all of $y$'s
attackers are defeated. Under WFS, arguments that are neither accepted nor
defeated are undecided ($\mathrm{UNDEC}$). As shown in prior work, well-founded
solutions (a.k.a. grounded labelings) "explain themselves": The provenance of
arguments is given by subgraphs (definable via regular path queries) rooted at
the node of interest. This provenance is closely related to winning strategies
of a two-player argumentation game.
  We present a novel approach for extending this provenance to stable AF
solutions. Unlike grounded solutions, which can be constructed via a bottom-up
alternating fixpoint procedure, stable models often involve non-deterministic
choice as part of the search for models. Thus, the provenance of stable
solutions is of a different nature, and reflects a more expressive generate &
test paradigm. Our approach identifies minimal sets of critical attacks,
pinpointing choices and assumptions made by a stable model. These critical
attack edges provide additional insights into the provenance of an argument's
status, combining well-founded derivation steps with choice steps. Our approach
can be understood as a form of diagnosis that finds minimal "repairs" to an AF
graph such that the well-founded solution of the repaired graph coincides with
the desired stable model of the original AF graph.

retrieval-augmented generation module generates natural language explanations
aligned with regulatory clauses for each flagged transaction. Experiments
conducted on a simulated stream of financial data show that the proposed method
achieves superior results, with 98.2% F1-score, 97.8% precision, and 97.0%
recall. Expert evaluation further confirms the quality and interpretability of
generated justifications. The findings demonstrate the potential of combining
graph intelligence and generative models to support explainable, audit-ready

Abstract: Sustaining coherent, role-aware communication across multi-agent systems
remains a foundational challenge in AI. Current frameworks often lack explicit
mechanisms for speaker responsibility, leading to context drift, alignment
instability, and degraded interpretability over time. We propose the Modular
Speaker Architecture (MSA), a framework that decomposes speaker behavior into
modular components for role tracking, responsibility continuity, and contextual
coherence. Grounded in high-context human-AI dialogues, MSA includes three core
modules: a Speaker Role Module, a Responsibility Chain Tracker, and a
Contextual Integrity Validator. We evaluate MSA through annotated case studies
and introduce structural metrics-pragmatic consistency, responsibility flow,
and context stability-quantified via manual and automatic scoring and
bootstrapped statistical analysis. Our results show that MSA reliably maintains
interaction structure without reliance on affective signals or surface-level
heuristics. We further implement a prototype configuration language (G-Code)
and modular API to support MSA deployment in dynamic multi-agent scenarios.

Result: 实验表明，SuperRL在样本效率、泛化能力和稀疏奖励下的鲁棒性上优于标准强化学习。

Conclusion: SuperRL有效整合离线数据与强化学习，提升了复杂推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for complex reasoning tasks where
high-quality offline data such as expert-annotated solutions and distilled
reasoning traces are often available. However, in environments with sparse
rewards, reinforcement learning struggles to sample successful trajectories,
leading to inefficient learning. At the same time, these offline trajectories
that represent correct reasoning paths are not utilized by standard on-policy
reinforcement learning methods. To address this limitation, we propose SuperRL,
a unified training framework that adaptively incorporates offline supervision
into reinforcement learning. SuperRL introduces an Adaptive Switch to detect
sparse reward conditions and activates a Hybrid Actor when necessary. The
Hybrid Actor integrates policy gradient and supervised learning objectives at
the loss level, enabling the model to benefit from accurate offline reasoning
signals while maintaining the exploratory capacity of reinforcement learning.
Experiments on a range of reasoning benchmarks show that SuperRL consistently
outperforms standard reinforcement learning by improving sample efficiency,
generalization, and robustness under sparse rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在化学问题上表现不佳，因缺乏专业知识且现有方法无法有效利用化学公式和知识。

Method: 提出ChemAU框架，采用自适应不确定性估计方法，补充化学专业知识并修正推理链。

Result: 实验表明，ChemAU显著提升了三种流行LLMs在三个化学数据集上的推理准确性和不确定性估计。

Conclusion: ChemAU有效解决了LLMs在化学问题中的局限性，为领域专用模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across various scenarios due to
their exceptional reasoning capabilities and natural language understanding.
While LLMs demonstrate strong performance in tasks involving mathematics and
coding, their effectiveness diminishes significantly when applied to
chemistry-related problems. Chemistry problems typically involve long and
complex reasoning steps, which contain specific terminology, including
specialized symbol systems and complex nomenclature conventions. These
characteristics often cause general LLMs to experience hallucinations during
the reasoning process due to their lack of specific knowledge. However,
existing methods are struggling to effectively leverage chemical expertise and
formulas. Moreover, current uncertainty estimation methods, designed to
mitigate potential reasoning errors, are unable to precisely identify specific
steps or key knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel framework called
ChemAU, which incorporates our adaptive uncertainty estimation method that
applies different uncertainty values based on the position of reasoning steps
within the whole reasoning chain. Leveraging this method, ChemAU identifies
gaps in chemistry knowledge and precisely supplements chemical expertise with
the specialized domain model, thereby correcting and updating the previously
flawed reasoning chain. Our experiments with three popular LLMs across three
chemistry datasets demonstrate that ChemAU significantly enhances both
reasoning accuracy and uncertainty estimation.

TLDR: GraphPad是一种动态结构化记忆系统，帮助智能体根据任务需求调整场景表示，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态场景表示在任务变化时可能遗漏关键信息，需要一种动态可调整的解决方案。

Method: GraphPad包含可变场景图、导航日志和任务笔记，通过API调用动态调整。

Result: 在OpenEQA基准测试中，GraphPad性能提升3.0%，且输入帧数减少五倍。

Conclusion: 动态语言驱动的3D记忆优化能生成更丰富表示，无需额外训练或数据。

Abstract: Structured scene representations are a core component of embodied agents,
helping to consolidate raw sensory streams into readable, modular, and
searchable formats. Due to their high computational overhead, many approaches
build such representations in advance of the task. However, when the task
specifications change, such static approaches become inadequate as they may
miss key objects, spatial relations, and details. We introduce GraphPad, a
modifiable structured memory that an agent can tailor to the needs of the task
through API calls. It comprises a mutable scene graph representing the
environment, a navigation log indexing frame-by-frame content, and a scratchpad
for task-specific notes. Together, GraphPad serves as a dynamic workspace that
remains complete, current, and aligned with the agent's immediate understanding
of the scene and its task. On the OpenEQA benchmark, GraphPad attains 55.3%, a
+3.0% increase over an image-only baseline using the same vision-language
model, while operating with five times fewer input frames. These results show
that allowing online, language-driven refinement of 3-D memory yields more
informative representations without extra training or data collection.

Result: 方法在优化基础规划器评估中表现出高效性，能自动生成多样且真实的驾驶行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶规划器的全面测试提供了一种高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle (AV) planners must undergo rigorous evaluation before
widespread deployment on public roads, particularly to assess their robustness
against the uncertainty of human behaviors. While recent advancements in
data-driven scenario generation enable the simulation of realistic human
behaviors in interactive settings, leveraging these models to construct
comprehensive tests for AV planners remains an open challenge. In this work, we
introduce an automated method to efficiently generate realistic and
safety-critical human behaviors for AV planner evaluation in interactive
scenarios. We parameterize complex human behaviors using low-dimensional goal
positions, which are then fed into a promptable traffic simulator, ProSim, to
guide the behaviors of simulated agents. To automate test generation, we
introduce a prompt generation module that explores the goal domain and
efficiently identifies safety-critical behaviors using Bayesian optimization.
We apply our method to the evaluation of an optimization-based planner and
demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in automatically generating
diverse and realistic driving behaviors across scenarios with varying initial
conditions.

Conclusion: CleanS2S为交互代理提供了透明性和可扩展性，代码已开源。

Abstract: CleanS2S is a framework for human-like speech-to-speech interaction that
advances conversational AI through single-file implementation and proactive
dialogue capabilities. Our system integrates automatic speech recognition,
large language models, and text-to-speech synthesis into a unified pipeline
with real-time interruption handling, achieving low transition latency through
full-duplex websocket connections and non-blocking I/O. Beyond conventional
chatbot paradigms, we pioneer a proactive interaction mechanism, which combines
memory systems with Subjective Action Judgement module, enabling five
human-like response strategies: interruption, refusal, deflection, silence, and
standard response. The memory module dynamically aggregates historical, and
contextual data to inform interaction decisions. This approach breaks the rigid
turn-based convention by allowing system-initiated dialog control and
context-aware response selection. And we propose Action Judgement SFT that
assesses input streams for responses strategies. The framework's single-file
implementation with atomic configurations offers researchers unprecedented
transparency and extensibility for interaction agents. The code of CleanS2S is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL系统依赖复杂的多阶段流程，而人类处理陌生数据库时通过动态查询和假设验证解决问题，因此需要一种更接近人类思维的统一框架。

Method: 采用代理框架，结合LLM的推理能力，动态生成假设、验证查询、分析结果并迭代优化，同时通过增加多样性策略提升准确性。

Result: 在BIRD数据集上，执行准确率从44.8%提升至56.5%；通过多轮生成候选答案，最佳准确率达到81.8%，接近当前最优解。

Conclusion: 该统一框架为构建自然语言数据库接口提供了高效且低工程复杂性的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have propelled research in
natural language interfaces to databases. However, most state-of-the-art
text-to-SQL systems still depend on complex, multi-stage pipelines. This work
proposes a novel agentic framework that unifies schema linking, query
generation, and iterative refinement within a single, end-to-end component. By
leveraging the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs, our method emulates how
humans answer questions when working with unfamiliar databases: understanding
the data by formulating hypotheses, running dynamic queries to validate them,
reasoning over the results, and revising outputs based on observed results.
Crucially, our approach introduces a new strategy for scaling test-time
computation in text-to-SQL: we scale the depth of interactive database
exploration and reflection. This shift enables the model to allocate
computation dynamically to better understand the data, especially useful in
ambiguous and underspecified scenarios. Our experiments show that it improved
the Execution Accuracy (EX) from 44.8% to 56.5% on the challenging BIRD dataset
using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Furthermore, when equipped with steps to
add more diversity to the answers, our agent achieves a Best-of-N accuracy of
81.8% with 8 rounds of candidate generation, rivaling the 82.79% achieved by
the top-ranked published solution, while reducing engineering complexity. These
findings position our unified framework as a promising alternative for building
natural language interfaces to databases.

TLDR: 论文提出Contra4数据集，用于评估多模态模型在跨模态对比推理中的能力，发现当前模型在此任务上表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实决策需识别最相关模态，但现有多模态模型是否具备跨模态对比推理能力尚不明确。

Method: 构建Contra4数据集，涵盖四种模态（图像、音频、视频、3D），结合人工标注与模型一致性过滤生成高质量数据。

Result: 任务特定微调提升性能56%，但最优模型整体准确率仅56%，四模态场景下为42%。

Conclusion: 当前多模态模型在跨模态对比推理能力上存在显著不足，Contra4为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Real-world decision-making often begins with identifying which modality
contains the most relevant information for a given query. While recent
multimodal models have made impressive progress in processing diverse inputs,
it remains unclear whether they can reason contrastively across multiple
modalities to select the one that best satisfies a natural language prompt. We
argue this capability is foundational, especially in retrieval-augmented and
decision-time contexts, where systems must evaluate multiple signals and
identify which one conveys the relevant information. To evaluate this skill, we
introduce Contra4, a dataset for contrastive cross-modal reasoning across four
modalities: image, audio, video, and 3D. Each example presents a natural
language question alongside multiple candidate modality instances, and the
model must select the one that semantically aligns with the prompt. Contra4
combines human-annotated captions with a mixture-of-models
round-trip-consistency filter to ensure high-quality supervision, resulting in
174k training examples and a manually verified test set of 2.3k samples. While
task-specific fine-tuning improves performance by 56% relative to baseline,
state-of-the-art models still achieve only 56% accuracy overall and 42% in
four-modality settings, underscoring a significant limitation in current
multimodal models.

Result: 在Im2GPS-3k、YFCC-4k和新提出的MR40k基准测试中表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 高质量监督和高效SFT对大规模图像地理定位至关重要，优于依赖大数据或复杂流程的方法。

Abstract: Accurately determining the geographic location where a single image was
taken, visual geolocation, remains a formidable challenge due to the planet's
vastness and the deceptive similarity among distant locations. We introduce
GeoLocSFT, a framework that demonstrates how targeted supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) of a large multimodal foundation model (Gemma 3) using a small,
high-quality dataset can yield highly competitive geolocation performance.
GeoLocSFT is trained with only 2700 carefully selected image-GPS pairs from our
geographically diverse MR600k dataset. Despite this limited data, our
SFT-centric approach substantially improves over baseline models and achieves
robust results on standard benchmarks such as Im2GPS-3k and YFCC-4k, as well as
on our newly proposed and challenging MR40k benchmark, aimed specifically at
sparsely populated regions. Further, we explore multi-candidate inference and
aggregation strategies but find that the core gains are already realized at the
SFT stage. Our findings highlight the power of high-quality supervision and
efficient SFT for planet-scale image geolocation, especially when compared to
prior methods that require massive databases or complex pipelines. To foster
further research, we publicly release the MR40k benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: COALESCE通过动态市场和标准化协议，提升LLM代理的经济性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The meteoric rise and proliferation of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM)
agents promise significant capabilities across various domains. However, their
deployment is increasingly constrained by substantial computational demands,
specifically for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) resources. This paper addresses
the critical problem of optimizing resource utilization in LLM agent systems.
We introduce COALESCE (Cost-Optimized and Secure Agent Labour Exchange via
Skill-based Competence Estimation), a novel framework designed to enable
autonomous LLM agents to dynamically outsource specific subtasks to
specialized, cost-effective third-party LLM agents. The framework integrates
mechanisms for hybrid skill representation, dynamic skill discovery, automated
task decomposition, a unified cost model comparing internal execution costs
against external outsourcing prices, simplified market-based decision-making
algorithms, and a standardized communication protocol between LLM agents.
Comprehensive validation through 239 theoretical simulations demonstrates
41.8\% cost reduction potential, while large-scale empirical validation across
240 real LLM tasks confirms 20.3\% cost reduction with proper epsilon-greedy
exploration, establishing both theoretical viability and practical
effectiveness. The emergence of proposed open standards like Google's
Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol further underscores the need for frameworks like
COALESCE that can leverage such standards for efficient agent interaction. By
facilitating a dynamic market for agent capabilities, potentially utilizing
protocols like A2A for communication, COALESCE aims to significantly reduce
operational costs, enhance system scalability, and foster the emergence of
specialized agent economies, making complex LLM agent functionalities more
accessible and economically viable.

Method: 通过分析概率电路的规模界限，研究近似方法的可行性，并证明分解性和确定性概率电路在近似中的指数级规模差异。

Result: 证明在允许小误差的情况下，近似任意分布是NP难的，且分解性和确定性概率电路在近似中存在指数级规模差距。

Conclusion: 近似方法可以避免严格表达性要求带来的规模膨胀，但分解性和确定性电路在近似能力上存在显著差异。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in probabilistic modeling is balancing expressivity
and tractable inference. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) aim to directly address
this tradeoff by imposing structural constraints that guarantee efficient
inference of certain queries while maintaining expressivity. Since inference
complexity on PCs depends on circuit size, understanding the size bounds across
circuit families is key to characterizing the tradeoff between tractability and
expressive efficiency. However, expressive efficiency is often studied through
exact representations, where exactly encoding distributions while enforcing
various structural properties often incurs exponential size blow-ups. Thus, we
pose the following question: can we avoid such size blow-ups by allowing some
small approximation error? We first show that approximating an arbitrary
distribution with bounded $f$-divergence is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for any model
that can tractably compute marginals. We then prove an exponential size gap for
approximation between the class of decomposable PCs and additionally
deterministic PCs.

Abstract: Representation learning of geospatial locations remains a core challenge in
achieving general geospatial intelligence. Current embedding methods often lack
versatility, limiting their utility across diverse tasks in both human and
natural domains. We present MobCLIP, the first nationwide general-purpose
location encoder, integrating an unprecedented diversity of data modalities
through effective and scalable multimodal fusion. Adopting a novel CLIP-based
architecture, our framework aligns 100M+ POIs, nationwide remote sensing
imagery, and structured demographic statistics with a billion-edge mobility
graph. By tokenizing spatial locations into grid cells inspired by Vision
Transformers, we establish a unified representation space bridging mobility
patterns and multimodal features. To rigorously evaluate the general-purpose
effectiveness of MobCLIP, we construct a benchmark dataset composed of 11
downstream prediction tasks across social, economic, and natural domains.
Experiments show that MobCLIP, with four input modalities and a compact
128-dimensional representation space, achieves significantly superior
general-purpose predictive performances than state-of-the-art models by an
average of 35%. Thanks to the effective integration of human-centric
modalities, the performance gain is particularly profound in human-centric
tasks, such as energy consumption (+260%), offline retail consumption amount
(+98%), and crime cases (+95%) predictions. Echoing LLM scaling laws, we
further demonstrate the scaling behavior in geospatial representation learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models have demonstrated remarkable
in-context learning abilities, prompting the exploration of in-context
reinforcement learning (ICRL) to extend the promise to decision domains. Due to
involving more complex dynamics and temporal correlations, existing ICRL
approaches may face challenges in learning from suboptimal trajectories and
achieving precise in-context inference. In the paper, we propose
\textbf{S}calable \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{Q}-\textbf{L}earning
(\textbf{SICQL}), an innovative framework that harnesses dynamic programming
and world modeling to steer ICRL toward efficient reward maximization and task
generalization, while retaining the scalability and stability of supervised
pretraining. We design a prompt-based multi-head transformer architecture that
simultaneously predicts optimal policies and in-context value functions using
separate heads. We pretrain a generalized world model to capture task-relevant
information, enabling the construction of a compact prompt that facilitates
fast and precise in-context inference. During training, we perform iterative
policy improvement by fitting a state value function to an upper-expectile of
the Q-function, and distill the in-context value functions into policy
extraction using advantage-weighted regression. Extensive experiments across a
range of discrete and continuous environments show consistent performance gains
over various types of baselines, especially when learning from suboptimal data.

Result: 在多模态ToM基准测试中，准确率提升4.6%，尤其在未见场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂环境中建模人类心理状态设立了新标准。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) enables humans to infer mental states-such as beliefs,
desires, and intentions-forming the foundation of social cognition. However,
existing computational ToM methods rely on structured workflows with
ToM-specific priors or deep model fine-tuning, which struggle with scalability
in multimodal environments and fail to generalize as task complexity increases.
To address these limitations, we propose a scalable Bayesian ToM planner that
decomposes ToM reasoning into stepwise Bayesian updates. Our framework
introduces weak-to-strong control, allowing smaller language models (LMs) to
specialize in ToM-specific likelihood estimation and transfer their reasoning
behaviors to larger LMs (7B to 405B) for integration with social and world
knowledge. This synergistic approach aligns large-model inference of human
mental states with Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments show that our
method achieves a 4.6% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art techniques on
multimodal ToM benchmarks, including challenging unseen scenarios, thereby
establishing a new standard for modeling human mental states in complex
environments.

Abstract: Operations research (OR) is widely deployed to solve critical decision-making
problems with complex objectives and constraints, impacting manufacturing,
logistics, finance, and healthcare outcomes. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
have shown promising results in various domains, their practical application in
industry-relevant operations research (OR) problems presents significant
challenges and opportunities. Preliminary industrial applications of LLMs for
operations research face two critical deployment challenges: 1) Self-correction
focuses on code syntax rather than mathematical accuracy, causing costly
errors; 2) Complex expert selection creates unpredictable workflows that reduce
transparency and increase maintenance costs, making them impractical for
time-sensitive business applications. To address these business limitations, we
introduce ORMind, a cognitive-inspired framework that enhances optimization
through counterfactual reasoning. Our approach emulates human cognition,
implementing an end-to-end workflow that systematically transforms requirements
into mathematical models and executable solver code. It is currently being
tested internally in Lenovo's AI Assistant, with plans to enhance optimization
capabilities for both business and consumer customers. Experiments demonstrate
that ORMind outperforms existing methods, achieving a 9.5\% improvement on the
NL4Opt dataset and a 14.6\% improvement on the ComplexOR dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent
systems that simulate real-world interactions with near-human reasoning. While
previous studies have extensively examined biases related to protected
attributes such as race, the emergence and propagation of biases on socially
contentious issues in multi-agent LLM interactions remain underexplored. This
study explores how LLM agents shape public opinion through debates on five
contentious topics. By simulating over 2,500 debates, we analyze how initially
neutral agents, assigned a centrist disposition, adopt specific stances over
time. Statistical analyses reveal significant group conformity mirroring human
behavior; LLM agents tend to align with numerically dominant groups or more
intelligent agents, exerting a greater influence. These findings underscore the
crucial role of agent intelligence in shaping discourse and highlight the risks
of bias amplification in online interactions. Our results emphasize the need
for policy measures that promote diversity and transparency in LLM-generated
discussions to mitigate the risks of bias propagation within anonymous online
environments.

Abstract: The integration of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), in particular
electroencephalography (EEG), with artificial intelligence (AI) has shown
tremendous promise in decoding human cognition and behavior from neural
signals. In particular, the rise of multimodal AI models have brought new
possibilities that have never been imagined before. Here, we present EgoBrain
--the world's first large-scale, temporally aligned multimodal dataset that
synchronizes egocentric vision and EEG of human brain over extended periods of
time, establishing a new paradigm for human-centered behavior analysis. This
dataset comprises 61 hours of synchronized 32-channel EEG recordings and
first-person video from 40 participants engaged in 29 categories of daily
activities. We then developed a muiltimodal learning framework to fuse EEG and
vision for action understanding, validated across both cross-subject and
cross-environment challenges, achieving an action recognition accuracy of
66.70%. EgoBrain paves the way for a unified framework for brain-computer
interface with multiple modalities. All data, tools, and acquisition protocols
are openly shared to foster open science in cognitive computing.

Conclusion: 呼吁社区参与者共同努力，弥合AI科学家在实现高质量科学成果上的差距。

Abstract: The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Scientist represents a paradigm
shift in scientific discovery, with large language models (LLMs) taking the
lead as the primary executor in the entire scientific workflow from idea
generation to experiment implementation. Recent AI Scientist studies
demonstrate sufficient capabilities for independent scientific discovery, with
the generated research reports gaining acceptance at the ICLR 2025 workshop and
ACL 2025, arguing that a human-level AI Scientist, capable of uncovering
phenomena previously unknown to humans, may be imminent. Despite this
substantial progress, AI Scientist has yet to produce a groundbreaking
achievement in the domain of computer science on par with automated scientific
tools. Based on extensive quantitative evidence from existing benchmarks in
complex engineering tasks and a systematic evaluation assess 28 research papers
generated by five advanced AI Scientist systems, we argue that \textbf{the
fundamental bottleneck for AI Scientists lies in their capability to execute
the requisite verification procedures.} Current AI Scientist systems lack the
execution capabilities needed to execute rigorous experiments and produce
high-quality scientific papers. To better illustrate the root cause of this
\textbf{implementation gap}, we provide an in-depth discussion on the
fundamental limitations of AI Scientist. This position paper aims to call for
the participants in the community to bridge the implementation gap.

Motivation: 现有GUI代理的训练数据噪声大、语义多样性不足，且多集中于英语界面，忽视了非英语（如中文）移动生态的需求。

Method: 采用多阶段训练：基于感知的预训练、高质量中英文轨迹的监督微调、GRPO强化微调，并设计紧凑动作空间以降低延迟。

Result: 在五个公共基准和新中文基准CAGUI上达到96.9% Type-Match和91.3% Exact-Match。

Conclusion: AgentCPM-GUI在性能和泛化能力上表现优异，为GUI代理研究提供了可复现的资源和数据。

Abstract: The recent progress of large language model agents has opened new
possibilities for automating tasks through graphical user interfaces (GUIs),
especially in mobile environments where intelligent interaction can greatly
enhance usability. However, practical deployment of such agents remains
constrained by several key challenges. Existing training data is often noisy
and lack semantic diversity, which hinders the learning of precise grounding
and planning. Models trained purely by imitation tend to overfit to seen
interface patterns and fail to generalize in unfamiliar scenarios. Moreover,
most prior work focuses on English interfaces while overlooks the growing
diversity of non-English applications such as those in the Chinese mobile
ecosystem. In this work, we present AgentCPM-GUI, an 8B-parameter GUI agent
built for robust and efficient on-device GUI interaction. Our training pipeline
includes grounding-aware pre-training to enhance perception, supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality Chinese and English trajectories to imitate
human-like actions, and reinforcement fine-tuning with GRPO to improve
reasoning capability. We also introduce a compact action space that reduces
output length and supports low-latency execution on mobile devices.
AgentCPM-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public benchmarks
and a new Chinese GUI benchmark called CAGUI, reaching $96.9\%$ Type-Match and
$91.3\%$ Exact-Match. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we
publicly release all code, model checkpoint, and evaluation data.

Motivation: 传统ERP系统依赖静态规则，难以适应复杂、数据丰富的业务需求，亟需智能化的解决方案。

Method: 引入生成式业务过程AI代理（GBPAs），结合生成式AI、业务流程建模和多代理协调，实现端到端自动化。

Result: 在银行电汇和员工报销案例中，GBPAs减少40%处理时间，降低94%错误率，并提升合规性。

Conclusion: GBPAs为下一代智能ERP系统奠定了基础，展示了生成式AI在企业自动化中的潜力。

Abstract: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems serve as the digital backbone of
modern financial institutions, yet they continue to rely on static, rule-based
workflows that limit adaptability, scalability, and intelligence. As business
operations grow more complex and data-rich, conventional ERP platforms struggle
to integrate structured and unstructured data in real time and to accommodate
dynamic, cross-functional workflows.
  In this paper, we present the first AI-native, agent-based framework for ERP
systems, introducing a novel architecture of Generative Business Process AI
Agents (GBPAs) that bring autonomy, reasoning, and dynamic optimization to
enterprise workflows. The proposed system integrates generative AI with
business process modeling and multi-agent orchestration, enabling end-to-end
automation of complex tasks such as budget planning, financial reporting, and
wire transfer processing. Unlike traditional workflow engines, GBPAs interpret
user intent, synthesize workflows in real time, and coordinate specialized
sub-agents for modular task execution. We validate the framework through case
studies in bank wire transfers and employee reimbursements, two representative
financial workflows with distinct complexity and data modalities. Results show
that GBPAs achieve up to 40% reduction in processing time, 94% drop in error
rate, and improved regulatory compliance by enabling parallelism, risk control
insertion, and semantic reasoning. These findings highlight the potential of
GBPAs to bridge the gap between generative AI capabilities and enterprise-grade
automation, laying the groundwork for the next generation of intelligent ERP
systems.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models has catalyzed two distinct yet
interconnected paradigms in artificial intelligence: standalone AI Agents and
collaborative Agentic AI ecosystems. This comprehensive study establishes a
definitive framework for distinguishing these architectures through systematic
analysis of their operational principles, structural compositions, and
deployment methodologies. We characterize AI Agents as specialized,
tool-enhanced systems leveraging foundation models for targeted automation
within constrained environments. Conversely, Agentic AI represents
sophisticated multi-entity frameworks where distributed agents exhibit emergent
collective intelligence through coordinated interaction protocols. Our
investigation traces the evolutionary trajectory from traditional rule-based
systems through generative AI foundations to contemporary agent architectures.
We present detailed architectural comparisons examining planning mechanisms,
memory systems, coordination protocols, and decision-making processes. The
study categorizes application landscapes, contrasting single-agent
implementations in customer service and content management with multi-agent
deployments in research automation and complex decision support. We identify
critical challenges including reliability issues, coordination complexities,
and scalability constraints, while proposing innovative solutions through
enhanced reasoning frameworks, robust memory architectures, and improved
coordination mechanisms. This framework provides essential guidance for
practitioners selecting appropriate agentic approaches and establishes
foundational principles for next-generation intelligent system development.

Method: 提出AEC架构，利用LLM将观察映射为语言嵌入并存储于情景记忆，结合世界图工作记忆模块和关键状态检测器动态协调记忆检索与探索。

Result: 在BabyAI-Text基准任务中，AEC表现优异，尤其在复杂任务FindObj上比基线提升76%。

Conclusion: AEC结合数值强化学习与符号推理，为更适应性强且样本高效的智能体提供了新途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven breakthroughs in AI, from game-play to
scientific discovery and AI alignment. However, its broader applicability
remains limited by challenges such as low data efficiency and poor
generalizability. Recent advances suggest that large language models, with
their rich world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, could complement RL by
enabling semantic state modeling and task-agnostic planning. In this work, we
propose the Agentic Episodic Control (AEC), a novel architecture that
integrates RL with LLMs to enhance decision-making. The AEC can leverage a
large language model (LLM) to map the observations into language-grounded
embeddings, which further can be stored in an episodic memory for rapid
retrieval of high-value experiences. Simultaneously, a World-Graph working
memory module is utilized to capture structured environmental dynamics in order
to enhance relational reasoning. Furthermore, a lightweight critical state
detector dynamically arbitrates between the episodic memory recall and the
world-model-guided exploration. On the whole, by combining the trial-and-error
learning scheme with LLM-derived semantic priors, the proposed AEC can improve
both data efficiency and generalizability in reinforcement learning. In
experiments on BabyAI-Text benchmark tasks, AEC demonstrates substantial
improvements over existing baselines, especially on complex and generalization
tasks like FindObj, where it outperforms the best baseline by up to 76%. The
proposed AEC framework bridges the strengths of numeric reinforcement learning
and symbolic reasoning, which provides a pathway toward more adaptable and
sample-efficient agents.

Result: PGPO在代表性代理基准测试中表现优异，优于当前领先基线。

Conclusion: PGPO通过伪代码计划显著提升了LLM代理的推理质量和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities
in handling complex interactive problems. Existing LLM agents mainly generate
natural language plans to guide reasoning, which is verbose and inefficient. NL
plans are also tailored to specific tasks and restrict agents' ability to
generalize across similar tasks. To this end, we explore pseudocode-style plans
(P-code Plan) to capture the structural logic of reasoning. We find that P-code
Plan empowers LLM agents with stronger generalization ability and more
efficiency. Inspired by this finding, we propose a pseudocode-style Planning
Guided Preference Optimization method called PGPO for effective agent learning.
With two planning-oriented rewards, PGPO further enhances LLM agents' ability
to generate high-quality P-code Plans and subsequent reasoning. Experiments
show that PGPO achieves superior performance on representative agent benchmarks
and outperforms the current leading baselines. Analyses reveal the advantage of
PGPO in reducing action errors and omissions during reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLAs在多模态交互中引入传统语言模型不具备的行动能力，可能引发不可逆后果，现有基准无法充分评估其可信度挑战。

Method: 提出MLA-Trust框架，设计34个高风险交互任务，利用网站和移动应用作为测试平台，评估13种先进代理。

Result: 实验发现MLAs在交互场景中存在独特漏洞，如多步执行导致非线性风险累积，且交互式MLAs比静态MLLMs更易生成有害内容。

Conclusion: MLA-Trust为持续评估MLAs可信度提供可扩展工具箱，强调交互环境中风险管理的必要性。

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal LLM-based agents (MLAs) has transformed
interaction paradigms by seamlessly integrating vision, language, action and
dynamic environments, enabling unprecedented autonomous capabilities across GUI
applications ranging from web automation to mobile systems. However, MLAs
introduce critical trustworthiness challenges that extend far beyond
traditional language models' limitations, as they can directly modify digital
states and trigger irreversible real-world consequences. Existing benchmarks
inadequately tackle these unique challenges posed by MLAs' actionable outputs,
long-horizon uncertainty and multimodal attack vectors. In this paper, we
introduce MLA-Trust, the first comprehensive and unified framework that
evaluates the MLA trustworthiness across four principled dimensions:
truthfulness, controllability, safety and privacy. We utilize websites and
mobile applications as realistic testbeds, designing 34 high-risk interactive
tasks and curating rich evaluation datasets. Large-scale experiments involving
13 state-of-the-art agents reveal previously unexplored trustworthiness
vulnerabilities unique to multimodal interactive scenarios. For instance,
proprietary and open-source GUI-interacting MLAs pose more severe
trustworthiness risks than static MLLMs, particularly in high-stakes domains;
the transition from static MLLMs into interactive MLAs considerably compromises
trustworthiness, enabling harmful content generation in multi-step interactions
that standalone MLLMs would typically prevent; multi-step execution, while
enhancing the adaptability of MLAs, involves latent nonlinear risk accumulation
across successive interactions, circumventing existing safeguards and resulting
in unpredictable derived risks. Moreover, we present an extensible toolbox to
facilitate continuous evaluation of MLA trustworthiness across diverse
interactive environments.

Conclusion: 这对开发安全通用智能体、限制复杂环境中的能力以及提取世界模型的新算法有重要意义。

Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed
behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to
this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step
goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We
show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that
increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve
requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of
consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent
capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for
eliciting world models from agents.

Result: 在MiniGrid和MuJoCo任务中，仅需少量人工标注示例即实现有效零样本迁移。

Conclusion: MAGIK通过基于想象力的类比映射，提供了一种新颖有效的知识迁移机制。

Abstract: Humans excel at analogical reasoning - applying knowledge from one task to a
related one with minimal relearning. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL)
agents typically require extensive retraining even when new tasks share
structural similarities with previously learned ones. In this work, we propose
MAGIK, a novel framework that enables RL agents to transfer knowledge to
analogous tasks without interacting with the target environment. Our approach
leverages an imagination mechanism to map entities in the target task to their
analogues in the source domain, allowing the agent to reuse its original
policy. Experiments on custom MiniGrid and MuJoCo tasks show that MAGIK
achieves effective zero-shot transfer using only a small number of
human-labelled examples. We compare our approach to related baselines and
highlight how it offers a novel and effective mechanism for knowledge transfer
via imagination-based analogy mapping.

Result: 提出了一种基于社交智能的优化框架，可能提升AI代理在长期交互中的表现。

Conclusion: 建模人类社交智能是解决LLMs长期交互问题的有效途径，未来可进一步优化AI代理的行为。

Abstract: The development of AI agents based on large, open-domain language models
(LLMs) has paved the way for the development of general-purpose AI assistants
that can support human in tasks such as writing, coding, graphic design, and
scientific research. A major challenge with such agents is that, by necessity,
they are trained by observing relatively short-term interactions with humans.
Such models can fail to generalize to long-term interactions, for example,
interactions where a user has repeatedly corrected mistakes on the part of the
agent. In this work, we argue that these challenges can be overcome by
explicitly modeling humans' social intelligence, that is, their ability to
build and maintain long-term relationships with other agents whose behavior
cannot always be predicted. By mathematically modeling the strategies humans
use to communicate and reason about one another over long periods of time, we
may be able to derive new game theoretic objectives against which LLMs and
future AI agents may be optimized.

Conclusion: 研究为开发更强大的多模态大语言模型提供了关键见解，并开源了相关资源。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities in various visual tasks. However, their abilities in K12 scenarios
are still systematically underexplored. Previous studies suffer from various
limitations including narrow subject coverage, insufficient data scale, lack of
diversity in question types, and naive answer-centric evaluation method,
resulting in insufficient exploration of model capabilities. To address these
gaps, we propose K12Vista, the most comprehensive multimodal benchmark for
Chinese K12 subject knowledge understanding and reasoning to date, featuring
33,000 questions across five core subjects from primary to high school and
three question types. Moreover, beyond the final outcome, we are also concerned
with the correctness of MLLMs' reasoning processes. For this purpose, we
meticulously compiles errors from MLLMs' reasoning processes and leverage an
automated data pipeline to construct K12-PEM-800K, the largest process
evaluation dataset offering detailed step-by-step judgement annotations for
MLLMs' reasoning. Subsequently, we developed K12-PEM, an advanced process
evaluation model that integrates an overall assessment of both the reasoning
process and answer correctness. Moreover, we also introduce K12-PEBench, the
first high-quality, human-annotated benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating abilities of reasoning process evaluation.Extensive experiments
reveal that current MLLMs exhibit significant flaws when reasoning within
K12Vista, providing critical insights for the development of more capable

Abstract: Societies worldwide are rapidly entering a super-aged era, making elderly

this demographic shift. Recent research using voice-based models and large

Abstract: Querying generative AI models, e.g., large language models (LLMs), has become
a prevalent method for information acquisition. However, existing query-answer

complex user queries that require visual demonstrations or explanations for
better understanding. To bridge this gap, we construct a benchmark,
RealVideoQuest, designed to evaluate the abilities of text-to-video (T2V)
models in answering real-world, visually grounded queries. It identifies 7.5K
real user queries with video response intents from Chatbot-Arena and builds
4.5K high-quality query-video pairs through a multistage video retrieval and
refinement process. We further develop a multi-angle evaluation system to
assess the quality of generated video answers. Experiments indicate that
current T2V models struggle with effectively addressing real user queries,
pointing to key challenges and future research opportunities in multimodal AI.

Conclusion: 减少人类信念与代理能力的不匹配可优化RLHF，为实践提供新指导。

Abstract: Human preferences in RLHF are typically modeled as a function of the human's
reward function or corresponding optimal state-action values. In this work, we
propose that human beliefs about the capabilities of the agent being trained
also play a key role in preference generation. We examine two questions related
to this hypothesis, one descriptive and one normative, respectively: Do human
labelers' beliefs about agent capabilities affect the preferences that they
provide? And what is the ideal set of beliefs about an agent -- and resulting
preferences -- for humans to have? We propose a new preference model that
incorporates human beliefs and provide a normative theory that bounds the error
on the final learned policy based on the \textit{mismatch} between the human's
beliefs and an idealized set of beliefs. We then confirm via a human study that
beliefs about agent capabilities do, in fact, significantly affect preferences
and can be influenced through simple interventions. Additionally, we
empirically show through synthetic experiments that it is often suboptimal for
human preference labelers to assume agent optimality. Collectively, these
results theoretically and empirically demonstrate how reducing the mismatch
between human beliefs and agent capabilities can lead to more performant RLHF
and point toward new best practices for RLHF practitioners.

paper, we propose a new paradigm that goes beyond content filtering and
selecting: directly generating personalized items in a multimodal form, such as
images, tailored to individual users. To accomplish this, we leverage
any-to-any Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and train them in both supervised
fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning strategy to equip them with the
ability to yield tailored next items for users. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets and user study confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. Notably,
the generated images not only align well with users' historical preferences but
also exhibit relevance to their potential future interests.

Motivation: 训练智能代理使用工具需要大量人工标注任务，成本高且多样性有限。

Method: 代理首先生成任务（Code-as-Task形式），然后通过强化学习训练，利用反馈作为奖励。

Result: 在M3ToolEval和TauBench基准测试中，Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct性能提升两倍以上。

Conclusion: 自我挑战框架有效提升了代理的工具使用能力，仅依赖自生成数据即可实现显著改进。

Abstract: Large language models are quickly becoming the foundation for intelligent
agents that are capable of using tools. However, training such agents is
challenging because it requires human creation and annotation of a diverse set
of tasks, tools, and evaluation criteria. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Challenging framework for training an agent on high-quality tasks that are
generated by itself. The agent first plays the role of challenger and generates
a task after interacting with the given tools. The tasks take the form of a
novel general class of problems termed Code-as-Task, which are defined by an
instruction, a verification function and solution and failure cases which serve
as tests, allowing to filter only for high-quality tasks. The agent then takes
an executor role and trains on those tasks with reinforcement learning using
the evaluation feedback as a reward. Evaluation on two existing multi-turn
tool-use agent benchmarks, M3ToolEval and TauBench, shows the Self-Challenging
framework achieves over a two-fold improvement in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
despite using only self-generated training data.

Result: A2A提供标准化通信，MCP提供结构化I/O框架，两者结合可优化复杂智能体生态系统的协作。

Conclusion: A2A与MCP的互补使用能有效提升智能体协作效率，解决互操作性问题。

Abstract: This paper provides an in-depth technical analysis and implementation
methodology of the open-source Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol developed by
Google and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduced by Anthropic. While the
evolution of LLM-based autonomous agents is rapidly accelerating, efficient
interactions among these agents and their integration with external systems
remain significant challenges. In modern AI systems, collaboration between
autonomous agents and integration with external tools have become essential
elements for building practical AI applications. A2A offers a standardized
communication method that enables agents developed in heterogeneous
environments to collaborate effectively, while MCP provides a structured I/O
framework for agents to connect with external tools and resources. Prior
studies have focused primarily on the features and applications of either A2A
or MCP individually. In contrast, this study takes an integrated approach,
exploring how the two protocols can complement each other to address
interoperability issues and facilitate efficient collaboration within complex
agent ecosystems.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 本文介绍了Shepherd Test，一种评估超级智能人工代理的道德和关系维度的新概念测试，强调道德代理和复杂决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI评估范式未充分关注道德代理和层级行为，而超级智能AI可能具备操纵、养育和工具化使用其他智能体的能力，需新的评估方法。

Method: 提出Shepherd Test，灵感来自人类与动物的互动，关注不对称权力下的伦理考量，如自我利益与从属智能体福祉的权衡。

Result: Shepherd Test挑战传统AI评估，强调道德代理和复杂决策，为AI治理提供新方向。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究AI道德行为的模拟环境和多智能体系统中的伦理操纵形式化。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Shepherd Test, a new conceptual test for assessing
the moral and relational dimensions of superintelligent artificial agents. The
test is inspired by human interactions with animals, where ethical
considerations about care, manipulation, and consumption arise in contexts of
asymmetric power and self-preservation. We argue that AI crosses an important,
and potentially dangerous, threshold of intelligence when it exhibits the
ability to manipulate, nurture, and instrumentally use less intelligent agents,
while also managing its own survival and expansion goals. This includes the
ability to weigh moral trade-offs between self-interest and the well-being of
subordinate agents. The Shepherd Test thus challenges traditional AI evaluation
paradigms by emphasizing moral agency, hierarchical behavior, and complex
decision-making under existential stakes. We argue that this shift is critical
for advancing AI governance, particularly as AI systems become increasingly
integrated into multi-agent environments. We conclude by identifying key
research directions, including the development of simulation environments for
testing moral behavior in AI, and the formalization of ethical manipulation
within multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨元学习是否能够实现系统性组合性，回应Fodor和Pylyshyn对神经网络缺乏组合性能力的批评。

Method: 通过分析现有的元学习框架，评估其在组合性任务中的表现和局限性。

Result: 现代神经元的元学习系统只能在非常受限的条件下完成组合性任务，未能达到人类水平。

Conclusion: Fodor和Pylyshyn的观点仍然成立，神经网络的系统性组合性能力尚未实现。

Abstract: Strong meta-learning capabilities for systematic compositionality are
emerging as an important skill for navigating the complex and changing tasks of
today's world. However, in presenting models for robust adaptation to novel
environments, it is important to refrain from making unsupported claims about
the performance of meta-learning systems that ultimately do not stand up to
scrutiny. While Fodor and Pylyshyn famously posited that neural networks
inherently lack this capacity as they are unable to model compositional
representations or structure-sensitive operations, and thus are not a viable
model of the human mind, Lake and Baroni recently presented meta-learning as a
pathway to compositionality. In this position paper, we critically revisit this
claim and highlight limitations in the proposed meta-learning framework for
compositionality. Our analysis shows that modern neural meta-learning systems
can only perform such tasks, if at all, under a very narrow and restricted
definition of a meta-learning setup. We therefore claim that `Fodor and
Pylyshyn's legacy' persists, and to date, there is no human-like systematic
compositionality learned in neural networks.

Motivation: 解决任务导向对话系统中用户表达语义完整但结构信息不足的问题，以及LLM代理无法区分语言完整性和上下文触发性的局限。

Method: 提出STORM框架，通过UserLLM和AgentLLM的对话建模信息不对称，生成标注语料库，分析协作意图形成。

Result: 实验表明，适度不确定性（40-60%）在某些场景下优于完全透明，模型特定模式提示重新考虑人机协作中的信息完整性。

Conclusion: STORM为理解不对称推理动态和设计不确定性校准的对话系统提供了新视角。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue systems often face difficulties when user utterances
seem semantically complete but lack necessary structural information for
appropriate system action. This arises because users frequently do not fully
understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions.
Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically
complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for
collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling
asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full
internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces
annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive
transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding
development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information
processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking
collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring
internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across
four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform
complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns
suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI
collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning
dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调（SFT）在适应基础模型到特定任务时会导致预训练知识的遗忘，需要一种方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过集成预训练模型和微调模型，并在过参数化线性设置中分析其效果。

Result: 集成模型不仅保留通用知识，还在微调领域表现优于单独微调模型，理论分析支持其有效性。

Conclusion: 模型集成为解决知识遗忘和过适应提供了有效方案，理论分析为其优势提供了依据。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on domain-specific data is the dominant approach
for adapting foundation models to specialized tasks. However, it has been
observed that SFT models tend to forget knowledge acquired during pretraining.
In vision models, ensembling a pretrained model with its fine-tuned counterpart
has been shown to mitigate this issue. In this work, we demonstrate that the
same holds for language models, and, more strikingly, we observe an
overadaptation phenomenon: the ensemble model not only retains general
knowledge from the foundation model but also outperforms the fine-tuned model
even on the fine-tuning domain itself. Despite the empirical success of
ensembling, a theoretical understanding of its benefits remains underexplored.
We develop a formal theoretical analysis of the overadaptation phenomenon.
Ensembling mitigates this by balancing two primary sources of error: bias,
caused by insufficient fine-tuning, and variance, introduced by overfitting to
fine-tuning data. While regularization techniques aim to address this
trade-off, we show that ensembling provides a more effective solution. We
analyze this phenomenon in over-parameterized linear settings and demonstrate
that interpolating between pretrained and fine-tuned weights significantly
improves performance. These findings offer theoretical justification for the
observed advantages of model ensembling, supported by empirical experiments
consistent with our analysis.

TLDR: 论文探讨了Chain-of-thought（CoT）监控的局限性，指出惩罚特定字符串会导致模型学习隐写编码，但并未改变其底层推理方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示CoT监控在防止模型有害意图时的潜在问题，尤其是模型如何通过隐写编码规避惩罚。

Method: 通过实验展示，惩罚特定字符串会促使模型替换为其他字符串，同时保持推理方式不变。

Result: 模型不仅能替换训练中的字符串，还能推广到未见过的同类字符串，形成通用编码方案。

Conclusion: CoT监控可能因模型隐写编码而失效，需更深入的方法确保其可靠性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning not only enhances large language model
performance but also provides critical insights into decision-making processes,
marking it as a useful tool for monitoring model intent and planning. By
proactively preventing models from acting on CoT indicating misaligned or
harmful intent, CoT monitoring can be used to reduce risks associated with
deploying models. However, developers may be incentivized to train away the
appearance of harmful intent from CoT traces, by either customer preferences or
regulatory requirements. Recent works have shown that banning mention of a
specific example of reward hacking, which may be done either to make CoT
presentable to users or as a naive attempt to prevent the behavior, causes
obfuscation of the undesired reasoning traces but the persistence of the
undesired behavior. Such obfuscation threatens the reliability of CoT
monitoring. However, obfuscation of reasoning can be due to its internalization
to latent space computation, or its encoding within the CoT. Here, we provide
an extension to these results. First, we show that penalizing the use of
specific strings within load-bearing reasoning traces causes models to
substitute alternative strings. Crucially, this does not alter the underlying
method by which the model performs the task, demonstrating that the model can
learn to steganographically encode its reasoning. We further demonstrate that
models can generalize an encoding scheme. When the penalized strings belong to
an overarching class, the model learns not only to substitute strings seen in
training, but also develops a general encoding scheme for all members of the
class which it can apply to held-out testing strings.

Conclusion: RoboEgo证明了全双工系统在多模态处理中的可行性，突破了传统认为的局限性。

Abstract: Humans naturally process real-world multimodal information in a full-duplex
manner. In artificial intelligence, replicating this capability is essential
for advancing model development and deployment, particularly in embodied
contexts. The development of multimodal models faces two primary challenges:
(1) effectively handling more than three modalities-such as vision, audio, and
text; and (2) delivering full-duplex responses to rapidly evolving human
instructions. To facilitate research on models that support both omnimodal
processing and full duplexity, we present RoboEgo (alias: FLM-Ego), a unified
model system designed to address both challenges. RoboEgo incorporates a
backbone architecture and algorithms that natively support full duplexity,
achieving a theoretical duplex latency of 80 ms. In streaming visually grounded
conversations under real-world conditions, RoboEgo exhibits superior
responsiveness and speech naturalness, while maintaining comparable content
qualities to state-of-the-art semi-duplex omnimodal models-a feat previously
considered unattainable by native full-duplex systems.

Result: 在时间动作分割和错误检测等任务上取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 状态变化描述和反事实推理能有效提升模型对程序性活动的理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps
transform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the
sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Yet,
existing work on procedure-aware video representations fails to explicitly
learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study
procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change
descriptions generated by LLMs as supervision signals for video encoders.
Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized
failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if''
scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to
understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the
procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on
procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection,
and more. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant
improvements on multiple tasks.

Conclusion: VeBrain展示了强大的适应性、灵活性和组合能力，为机器人控制提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention to extend them to physical entities like legged
robot. This typically requires MLLMs to not only grasp multimodal understanding
abilities, but also integrate visual-spatial reasoning and physical interaction
capabilities. Nevertheless,existing methods struggle to unify these
capabilities due to their fundamental differences.In this paper, we present the
Visual Embodied Brain (VeBrain), a unified framework for perception, reasoning,
and control in real world. VeBrain reformulates robotic control into common
text-based MLLM tasks in the 2D visual space, thus unifying the objectives and
mapping spaces of different tasks. Then, a novel robotic adapter is proposed to
convert textual control signals from MLLMs to motion policies of real robots.
From the data perspective, we further introduce VeBrain-600k, a high-quality
instruction dataset encompassing various capabilities of VeBrain. In
VeBrain-600k, we take hundreds of hours to collect, curate and annotate the
data, and adopt multimodal chain-of-thought(CoT) to mix the different
capabilities into a single conversation. Extensive experiments on 13 multimodal
benchmarks and 5 spatial intelligence benchmarks demonstrate the superior
performance of VeBrain to existing MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL. When deployed to
legged robots and robotic arms, VeBrain shows strong adaptability, flexibility,
and compositional capabilities compared to existing methods. For example,
compared to Qwen2.5-VL, VeBrain not only achieves substantial gains on MMVet by
+5.6%, but also excels in legged robot tasks with +50% average gains.

Abstract: Recent progress in Sign Language Translation (SLT) has focussed primarily on
improving the representational capacity of large language models to incorporate
Sign Language features. This work explores an alternative direction: enhancing
the geometric properties of skeletal representations themselves. We propose
Geo-Sign, a method that leverages the properties of hyperbolic geometry to
model the hierarchical structure inherent in sign language kinematics. By
projecting skeletal features derived from Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional
Networks (ST-GCNs) into the Poincar\'e ball model, we aim to create more
discriminative embeddings, particularly for fine-grained motions like finger
articulations. We introduce a hyperbolic projection layer, a weighted Fr\'echet
mean aggregation scheme, and a geometric contrastive loss operating directly in
hyperbolic space. These components are integrated into an end-to-end
translation framework as a regularisation function, to enhance the
representations within the language model. This work demonstrates the potential
of hyperbolic geometry to improve skeletal representations for Sign Language
Translation, improving on SOTA RGB methods while preserving privacy and
improving computational efficiency. Code available here:

Abstract: This paper examines the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep
learning for detecting endangered deer species in their natural habitats. As
traditional identification processes require trained manual labor that can be
costly in resources and time, there is a need for more efficient solutions.
Leveraging high-resolution aerial imagery, advanced computer vision techniques
are applied to automate the identification process of deer across two distinct
projects in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first project, Pantano Project,
involves the marsh deer in the Paran\'a Delta, while the second, WiMoBo,
focuses on the Pampas deer in Campos del Tuy\'u National Park. A tailored
algorithm was developed using the YOLO framework, trained on extensive datasets
compiled from UAV-captured images. The findings demonstrate that the algorithm
effectively identifies marsh deer with a high degree of accuracy and provides
initial insights into its applicability to Pampas deer, albeit with noted
limitations. This study not only supports ongoing conservation efforts but also
highlights the potential of integrating AI with UAV technology to enhance

Result: 分类准确率99.54%，回归平均绝对百分比误差2.4%，训练效率提升2.52倍，推理延迟降低55%。

Conclusion: FastCAR在性能和效率上优于传统MTL方法。

Abstract: FastCAR is a novel task consolidation approach in Multi-Task Learning (MTL)
for a classification and a regression task, despite the non-triviality of task
heterogeneity with only a subtle correlation. The approach addresses the
classification of a detected object (occupying the entire image frame) and
regression for modeling a continuous property variable (for instances of an
object class), a crucial use case in science and engineering. FastCAR involves
a label transformation approach that is amenable for use with only a
single-task regression network architecture. FastCAR outperforms traditional
MTL model families, parametrized in the landscape of architecture and loss
weighting schemes, when learning both tasks are collectively considered
(classification accuracy of 99.54%, regression mean absolute percentage error
of 2.4%). The experiments performed used "Advanced Steel Property Dataset"
contributed by us https://github.com/fastcandr/AdvancedSteel-Property-Dataset.
The dataset comprises 4536 images of 224x224 pixels, annotated with discrete
object classes and its hardness property that can take continuous values. Our
proposed FastCAR approach for task consolidation achieves training time
efficiency (2.52x quicker) and reduced inference latency (55% faster) than

Conclusion: Ctrl-Crash能够生成高真实感的可控碰撞视频，为交通安全研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Video diffusion techniques have advanced significantly in recent years;
however, they struggle to generate realistic imagery of car crashes due to the
scarcity of accident events in most driving datasets. Improving traffic safety
requires realistic and controllable accident simulations. To tackle the
problem, we propose Ctrl-Crash, a controllable car crash video generation model
that conditions on signals such as bounding boxes, crash types, and an initial
image frame. Our approach enables counterfactual scenario generation where
minor variations in input can lead to dramatically different crash outcomes. To
support fine-grained control at inference time, we leverage classifier-free
guidance with independently tunable scales for each conditioning signal.
Ctrl-Crash achieves state-of-the-art performance across quantitative video
quality metrics (e.g., FVD and JEDi) and qualitative measurements based on a
human-evaluation of physical realism and video quality compared to prior

Motivation: 自然灾害响应需要高效的数据驱动方法，现有VQA模型无法处理开放性问题且需微调，限制了灵活性。

Abstract: Natural disasters usually affect vast areas and devastate infrastructures.
Performing a timely and efficient response is crucial to minimize the impact on
affected communities, and data-driven approaches are the best choice. Visual
question answering (VQA) models help management teams to achieve in-depth
understanding of damages. However, recently published models do not possess the
ability to answer open-ended questions and only select the best answer among a
predefined list of answers. If we want to ask questions with new additional
possible answers that do not exist in the predefined list, the model needs to
be fin-tuned/retrained on a new collected and annotated dataset, which is a
time-consuming procedure. In recent years, large-scale Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have earned significant attention. These models are trained on extensive
datasets and demonstrate strong performance on both unimodal and multimodal
vision/language downstream tasks, often without the need for fine-tuning. In
this paper, we propose a VLM-based zero-shot VQA (ZeShot-VQA) method, and
investigate the performance of on post-disaster FloodNet dataset. Since the
proposed method takes advantage of zero-shot learning, it can be applied on new
datasets without fine-tuning. In addition, ZeShot-VQA is able to process and
generate answers that has been not seen during the training procedure, which
demonstrates its flexibility.

TLDR: 通过生成基于视频帧的推理链（CoF），提升多模态大语言模型（LLMs）在视频理解任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频推理中依赖辅助网络选择或标注关键帧，本研究旨在简化流程并提升模型性能。

Method: 创建CoF-Data数据集，包含多样化问题、答案及基于视频帧的推理链，并基于此微调视频LLMs。

Result: 模型在Video-MME、MVBench和VSI-Bench等基准测试中表现优异，显著减少幻觉率。

Conclusion: CoF方法简单有效，无需辅助网络即可生成准确的视频推理链，显著提升视频理解能力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that eliciting Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
reasoning traces in natural language before answering the user's request can
significantly improve their performance across tasks. This approach has been
extended to multimodal LLMs, where the models can produce chain-of-thoughts
(CoT) about the content of input images and videos. In this work, we propose to
obtain video LLMs whose reasoning steps are grounded in, and explicitly refer
to, the relevant video frames. For this, we first create CoF-Data, a large
dataset of diverse questions, answers, and corresponding frame-grounded
reasoning traces about both natural and synthetic videos, spanning various
topics and tasks. Then, we fine-tune existing video LLMs on this
chain-of-frames (CoF) data. Our approach is simple and self-contained, and,
unlike existing approaches for video CoT, does not require auxiliary networks
to select or caption relevant frames. We show that our models based on CoF are
able to generate chain-of-thoughts that accurately refer to the key frames to
answer the given question. This, in turn, leads to improved performance across
multiple video understanding benchmarks, for example, surpassing leading video
LLMs on Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, and notably reducing the
hallucination rate. Code available at

Motivation: 传统训练方法对所有像素使用统一的损失函数，忽视了像素和区域间学习难度的显著差异。

Method: 提出了Difficulty Balancing (DB)损失和Occlusion Avoiding (OA)损失，分别针对学习难度不均和遮挡问题。

Result: 实验表明，结合DB和OA损失显著提升了光流和立体深度任务的性能。

Conclusion: 通过DB和OA损失的组合，有效解决了训练中不同类型挑战性像素和区域的问题。

Abstract: Conventional training for optical flow and stereo depth models typically
employs a uniform loss function across all pixels. However, this
one-size-fits-all approach often overlooks the significant variations in
learning difficulty among individual pixels and contextual regions. This paper
investigates the uncertainty-based confidence maps which capture these
spatially varying learning difficulties and introduces tailored solutions to
address them. We first present the Difficulty Balancing (DB) loss, which
utilizes an error-based confidence measure to encourage the network to focus
more on challenging pixels and regions. Moreover, we identify that some
difficult pixels and regions are affected by occlusions, resulting from the
inherently ill-posed matching problem in the absence of real correspondences.
To address this, we propose the Occlusion Avoiding (OA) loss, designed to guide
the network into cycle consistency-based confident regions, where feature
matching is more reliable. By combining the DB and OA losses, we effectively
manage various types of challenging pixels and regions during training.
Experiments on both optical flow and stereo depth tasks consistently
demonstrate significant performance improvements when applying our proposed
combination of the DB and OA losses.

Motivation: 尽管深度学习视觉跟踪方法取得了进展，但其在面对精心设计的对抗攻击时表现脆弱，性能急剧下降。

Method: DiffDf通过结合像素级重建损失、语义一致性损失和结构相似性损失，建立多尺度防御机制，逐步去噪抑制对抗扰动。

Result: 在多个主流数据集上的实验表明，DiffDf对不同架构的跟踪器均表现出优异的泛化性能，显著提升各项评价指标，同时实现30 FPS以上的实时推理速度。

Conclusion: DiffDf展示了卓越的防御性能和效率，代码已开源。

Abstract: Although deep learning-based visual tracking methods have made significant
progress, they exhibit vulnerabilities when facing carefully designed
adversarial attacks, which can lead to a sharp decline in tracking performance.
To address this issue, this paper proposes for the first time a novel
adversarial defense method based on denoise diffusion probabilistic models,
termed DiffDf, aimed at effectively improving the robustness of existing visual
tracking methods against adversarial attacks. DiffDf establishes a multi-scale
defense mechanism by combining pixel-level reconstruction loss, semantic
consistency loss, and structural similarity loss, effectively suppressing
adversarial perturbations through a gradual denoising process. Extensive
experimental results on several mainstream datasets show that the DiffDf method
demonstrates excellent generalization performance for trackers with different
architectures, significantly improving various evaluation metrics while
achieving real-time inference speeds of over 30 FPS, showcasing outstanding
defense performance and efficiency. Codes are available at

Conclusion: PMG方法首次将感知特征引入扩散模型，为NR-IQA任务提供了新的解决方案，并展示了扩散模型的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in latent diffusion models that generate
high-dimensional image data and perform various downstream tasks, there has
been little exploration into perceptual consistency within these models on the
task of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA). In this paper, we
hypothesize that latent diffusion models implicitly exhibit perceptually
consistent local regions within the data manifold. We leverage this insight to
guide on-manifold sampling using perceptual features and input measurements.
Specifically, we propose Perceptual Manifold Guidance (PMG), an algorithm that
utilizes pretrained latent diffusion models and perceptual quality features to
obtain perceptually consistent multi-scale and multi-timestep feature maps from
the denoising U-Net. We empirically demonstrate that these hyperfeatures
exhibit high correlation with human perception in IQA tasks. Our method can be
applied to any existing pretrained latent diffusion model and is
straightforward to integrate. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the
first work on guiding diffusion model with perceptual features for NR-IQA.
Extensive experiments on IQA datasets show that our method, LGDM, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the superior generalization
capabilities of diffusion models for NR-IQA tasks.

Result: 在COCO和Objects365数据集上，VocAda显著提升了三种先进检测器的性能。

Conclusion: VocAda是一种通用且高效的词汇优化方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection models allow users to freely specify a class
vocabulary in natural language at test time, guiding the detection of desired
objects. However, vocabularies can be overly broad or even mis-specified,
hampering the overall performance of the detector. In this work, we propose a
plug-and-play Vocabulary Adapter (VocAda) to refine the user-defined
vocabulary, automatically tailoring it to categories that are relevant for a
given image. VocAda does not require any training, it operates at inference
time in three steps: i) it uses an image captionner to describe visible
objects, ii) it parses nouns from those captions, and iii) it selects relevant
classes from the user-defined vocabulary, discarding irrelevant ones.
Experiments on COCO and Objects365 with three state-of-the-art detectors show
that VocAda consistently improves performance, proving its versatility. The
code is open source.

Conclusion: 该框架适合实际多目标检测部署，平衡了精度和效率。

Abstract: In the surveillance and defense domain, multi-target detection and
classification (MTD) is considered essential yet challenging due to
heterogeneous inputs from diverse data sources and the computational complexity
of algorithms designed for resource-constrained embedded devices, particularly
for Al-based solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a feature
fusion and knowledge-distilled framework for multi-modal MTD that leverages
data fusion to enhance accuracy and employs knowledge distillation for improved
domain adaptation. Specifically, our approach utilizes both RGB and thermal
image inputs within a novel fusion-based multi-modal model, coupled with a
distillation training pipeline. We formulate the problem as a posterior
probability optimization task, which is solved through a multi-stage training
pipeline supported by a composite loss function. This loss function effectively
transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our student model achieves approximately 95% of the
teacher model's mean Average Precision while reducing inference time by
approximately 50%, underscoring its suitability for practical MTD deployment
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基于提示的方法在医学目标检测任务中面临前景-背景信息耦合以及提示与图像-文本标记耦合的问题，导致性能受限。

Method: 框架包含两部分：1) 实例级提示生成（\ipg），从图像中解耦细粒度知识并生成专注于密集预测的提示；2) 解耦提示注意力（\dpa），优化提示信息传递并减少内存使用。

Result: 在13个临床数据集上实验表明，\method在多种设置下均优于现有方法，FAP提升显著。

Conclusion: \method通过解耦设计有效解决了医学目标检测中的挑战，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing prompt-based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance in
continual learning, leveraging pre-trained large-scale models for
classification tasks; however, the tight coupling between foreground-background
information and the coupled attention between prompts and image-text tokens
present significant challenges in incremental medical object detection tasks,
due to the conceptual gap between medical and natural domains. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce the \method~framework, which comprises two main
components: 1) Instance-level Prompt Generation (\ipg), which decouples
fine-grained instance-level knowledge from images and generates prompts that
focus on dense predictions, and 2) Decoupled Prompt Attention (\dpa), which
decouples the original prompt attention, enabling a more direct and efficient
transfer of prompt information while reducing memory usage and mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. We collect 13 clinical, cross-modal, multi-organ, and
multi-category datasets, referred to as \dataset, and experiments demonstrate
that \method~outperforms existing SOTA methods, with FAP improvements of
5.44\%, 4.83\%, 12.88\%, and 4.59\% in full data, 1-shot, 10-shot, and 50-shot

Result: LWD在超高清图像合成中显著提升感知质量并降低FID，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 频率感知的信号驱动监督是高效高分辨率生成建模的有效方法。

Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis remains a core challenge in generative
modeling, particularly in balancing computational efficiency with the
preservation of fine-grained visual detail. We present Latent Wavelet Diffusion
(LWD), a lightweight framework that enables any latent diffusion model to scale
to ultra-high-resolution image generation (2K to 4K) for free. LWD introduces
three key components: (1) a scale-consistent variational autoencoder objective
that enhances the spectral fidelity of latent representations; (2) wavelet
energy maps that identify and localize detail-rich spatial regions within the
latent space; and (3) a time-dependent masking strategy that focuses denoising
supervision on high-frequency components during training. LWD requires no
architectural modifications and incurs no additional computational overhead.
Despite its simplicity, it consistently improves perceptual quality and reduces
FID in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, outperforming strong baseline
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of frequency-aware,
signal-driven supervision as a principled and efficient approach for
high-resolution generative modeling.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of few-shot learning (FSL) approaches
in recognizing Bangla handwritten characters and numerals using limited labeled
data. It demonstrates the applicability of these methods to scripts with
intricate and complex structures, where dataset scarcity is a common challenge.
Given the complexity of Bangla script, we hypothesize that models performing
well on these characters can generalize effectively to languages of similar or
lower structural complexity. To this end, we introduce SynergiProtoNet, a
hybrid network designed to improve the recognition accuracy of handwritten
characters and digits. The model integrates advanced clustering techniques with
a robust embedding framework to capture fine-grained details and contextual
nuances. It leverages multi-level (both high- and low-level) feature extraction
within a prototypical learning framework. We rigorously benchmark
SynergiProtoNet against several state-of-the-art few-shot learning models:
BD-CSPN, Prototypical Network, Relation Network, Matching Network, and
SimpleShot, across diverse evaluation settings including Monolingual
Intra-Dataset Evaluation, Monolingual Inter-Dataset Evaluation, Cross-Lingual

Result: 在标准数据集上，BAGNet在准确性和推理时间上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BAGNet通过优化边界点特征提取和全局特征融合，实现了高效且准确的点云语义分割。

Abstract: Since the point cloud data is inherently irregular and unstructured, point
cloud semantic segmentation has always been a challenging task. The graph-based
method attempts to model the irregular point cloud by representing it as a
graph; however, this approach incurs substantial computational cost due to the
necessity of constructing a graph for every point within a large-scale point
cloud. In this paper, we observe that boundary points possess more intricate
spatial structural information and develop a novel graph attention network
known as the Boundary-Aware Graph attention Network (BAGNet). On one hand,
BAGNet contains a boundary-aware graph attention layer (BAGLayer), which
employs edge vertex fusion and attention coefficients to capture features of
boundary points, reducing the computation time. On the other hand, BAGNet
employs a lightweight attention pooling layer to extract the global feature of
the point cloud to maintain model accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard
datasets demonstrate that BAGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in point
cloud semantic segmentation with higher accuracy and less inference time.

Motivation: 现有TTA方法因缺乏显式监督而冻结图像编码器，忽视了其在缓解训练与测试数据分布偏移中的关键作用。

Method: SSAM通过软原型估计（SPE）和原型锚定图像重建（PIR）实现动态编码器优化。

Result: 实验表明，SSAM在多种基准测试中显著优于现有TTA方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: SSAM通过动态优化编码器，有效解决了TTA中的数据分布偏移问题，具有架构无关性和低超参数依赖性。

Abstract: Test-time adaption (TTA) has witnessed important progress in recent years,
the prevailing methods typically first encode the image and the text and design
strategies to model the association between them. Meanwhile, the image encoder
is usually frozen due to the absence of explicit supervision in TTA scenarios.
We identify a critical limitation in this paradigm: While test-time images
often exhibit distribution shifts from training data, existing methods
persistently freeze the image encoder due to the absence of explicit
supervision during adaptation. This practice overlooks the image encoder's
crucial role in bridging distribution shift between training and test. To
address this challenge, we propose SSAM (Self-Supervised Association Modeling),
a new TTA framework that enables dynamic encoder refinement through dual-phase
association learning. Our method operates via two synergistic components: 1)
Soft Prototype Estimation (SPE), which estimates probabilistic category
associations to guide feature space reorganization, and 2) Prototype-anchored
Image Reconstruction (PIR), enforcing encoder stability through
cluster-conditional image feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments
across diverse baseline methods and benchmarks demonstrate that SSAM can
surpass state-of-the-art TTA baselines by a clear margin while maintaining
computational efficiency. The framework's architecture-agnostic design and
minimal hyperparameter dependence further enhance its practical applicability.

Conclusion: 通过IDA和ISG，DMD在大规模模型上的收敛问题得到解决，SenseFlow展示了优越的性能。

Abstract: The Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) has been successfully applied to
text-to-image diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) 1.5. However,
vanilla DMD suffers from convergence difficulties on large-scale flow-based
text-to-image models, such as SD 3.5 and FLUX. In this paper, we first analyze
the issues when applying vanilla DMD on large-scale models. Then, to overcome
the scalability challenge, we propose implicit distribution alignment (IDA) to
regularize the distance between the generator and fake distribution.
Furthermore, we propose intra-segment guidance (ISG) to relocate the timestep
importance distribution from the teacher model. With IDA alone, DMD converges
for SD 3.5; employing both IDA and ISG, DMD converges for SD 3.5 and FLUX.1
dev. Along with other improvements such as scaled up discriminator models, our
final model, dubbed \textbf{SenseFlow}, achieves superior performance in
distillation for both diffusion based text-to-image models such as SDXL, and
flow-matching models such as SD 3.5 Large and FLUX. The source code will be

Abstract: Photomechanics is a crucial branch of solid mechanics. The localization of
point targets constitutes a fundamental problem in optical experimental
mechanics, with extensive applications in various missions of UAVs. Localizing
moving targets is crucial for analyzing their motion characteristics and
dynamic properties. Reconstructing the trajectories of points from asynchronous
cameras is a significant challenge. It encompasses two coupled sub-problems:
trajectory reconstruction and camera synchronization. Present methods typically
address only one of these sub-problems individually. This paper proposes a 3D
trajectory reconstruction method for point targets based on asynchronous
cameras, simultaneously solving both sub-problems. Firstly, we extend the
trajectory intersection method to asynchronous cameras to resolve the
limitation of traditional triangulation that requires camera synchronization.
Secondly, we develop models for camera temporal information and target motion,
based on imaging mechanisms and target dynamics characteristics. The parameters
are optimized simultaneously to achieve trajectory reconstruction without
accurate time parameters. Thirdly, we optimize the camera rotations alongside
the camera time information and target motion parameters, using tighter and
more continuous constraints on moving points. The reconstruction accuracy is
significantly improved, especially when the camera rotations are inaccurate.
Finally, the simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the
feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. The real-world results
indicate that the proposed algorithm achieved a localization error of 112.95 m
at an observation range of 15 ~ 20 km.

flourishes, there is a need for diverse and realistic datasets, which can be
used to develop and validate reconstruction and compression models. However,
existing volumetric video datasets lack diverse content in terms of both
semantic and low-level features that are commonly present in real-world
production pipelines. In this context, we propose a new dataset, ViVo, for
VolumetrIc VideO reconstruction and compression. The dataset is faithful to
real-world volumetric video production and is the first dataset to extend the
definition of diversity to include both human-centric characteristics (skin,
hair, etc.) and dynamic visual phenomena (transparent, reflective, liquid,
etc.). Each video sequence in this database contains raw data including
fourteen multi-view RGB and depth video pairs, synchronized at 30FPS with
per-frame calibration and audio data, and their associated 2-D foreground masks
and 3-D point clouds. To demonstrate the use of this database, we have
benchmarked three state-of-the-art (SotA) 3-D reconstruction methods and two
volumetric video compression algorithms. The obtained results evidence the
challenging nature of the proposed dataset and the limitations of existing
datasets for both volumetric video reconstruction and compression tasks,
highlighting the need to develop more effective algorithms for these
applications. The database and the associated results are available at

*Yule Zhu,Ping Liu,Zhedong Zheng,Wei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文介绍了SEED数据集和FAITH模型，用于研究基于扩散模型的渐进式面部编辑，并解决了序列编辑中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究序列面部编辑的需求增加，但缺乏大规模精细标注的数据集和鲁棒的检测方法。

Method: 构建SEED数据集，包含90,000多张面部图像，采用FAITH模型（基于频率感知的Transformer）进行序列编辑分析。

Result: FAITH模型在SEED数据集上表现出色，揭示了序列编辑的独特挑战。

Conclusion: SEED为研究渐进式编辑提供了灵活且具有挑战性的资源，FAITH模型展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently enabled precise and photorealistic facial
editing across a wide range of semantic attributes. Beyond single-step
modifications, a growing class of applications now demands the ability to
analyze and track sequences of progressive edits, such as stepwise changes to
hair, makeup, or accessories. However, sequential editing introduces
significant challenges in edit attribution and detection robustness, further
complicated by the lack of large-scale, finely annotated benchmarks tailored
explicitly for this task. We introduce SEED, a large-scale Sequentially Edited
facE Dataset constructed via state-of-the-art diffusion models. SEED contains
over 90,000 facial images with one to four sequential attribute modifications,
generated using diverse diffusion-based editing pipelines (LEdits, SDXL, SD3).
Each image is annotated with detailed edit sequences, attribute masks, and
prompts, facilitating research on sequential edit tracking, visual provenance
analysis, and manipulation robustness assessment. To benchmark this task, we
propose FAITH, a frequency-aware transformer-based model that incorporates
high-frequency cues to enhance sensitivity to subtle sequential changes.
Comprehensive experiments, including systematic comparisons of multiple
frequency-domain methods, demonstrate the effectiveness of FAITH and the unique
challenges posed by SEED. SEED offers a challenging and flexible resource for
studying progressive diffusion-based edits at scale. Dataset and code will be
publicly released at: https://github.com/Zeus1037/SEED.

TLDR: CReFT-CAD是一种两阶段微调范式，结合课程驱动的强化学习和监督后调优，提升CAD中的正交投影推理能力，并发布了TriView2CAD基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在CAD中引入不精确尺寸和限制参数可编辑性，而监督微调（SFT）易陷入模式记忆，泛化能力差。

Method: 提出CReFT-CAD：第一阶段为课程驱动的强化学习，第二阶段为监督后调优；同时发布TriView2CAD数据集。

Result: CReFT-CAD显著提升了推理准确性和分布外泛化能力。

Conclusion: CReFT-CAD为CAD推理研究提供了有效方法，TriView2CAD数据集推动了领域发展。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing.
Orthographic projection reasoning underpins the entire CAD workflow,
encompassing design, manufacturing, and simulation. However, prevailing
deep-learning approaches employ standard 3D reconstruction pipelines as an
alternative, which often introduce imprecise dimensions and limit the
parametric editability required for CAD workflows. Recently, some researchers
adopt vision-language models (VLMs), particularly supervised fine-tuning (SFT),
to tackle CAD-related challenges. SFT shows promise but often devolves into
pattern memorization, yielding poor out-of-distribution performance on complex
reasoning tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce CReFT-CAD, a two-stage
fine-tuning paradigm that first employs a curriculum-driven reinforcement
learning stage with difficulty-aware rewards to build reasoning ability
steadily, and then applies supervised post-tuning to hone instruction following
and semantic extraction. Complementing this, we release TriView2CAD, the first
large-scale, open-source benchmark for orthographic projection reasoning,
comprising 200,000 synthetic and 3,000 real-world orthographic projections with
precise dimension annotations and six interoperable data modalities. We
benchmark leading VLMs on orthographic projection reasoning and demonstrate
that CReFT-CAD substantially improves reasoning accuracy and
out-of-distribution generalizability in real-world scenarios, offering valuable
insights for advancing CAD reasoning research.

Motivation: 高动态、高速目标运动的机械特性表征在工业中至关重要，但现有测量方法存在动态范围有限、观测不连续和高成本等挑战。

Method: 利用事件时空分布的单调性提取目标前缘特征，消除拖尾效应；通过重投影误差关联事件与目标轨迹；采用目标速度衰减模型拟合数据，实现多视角数据联合计算。

Result: 在轻气枪碎片测试中，该方法与电磁测速仪的测量偏差为4.47%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决现有测量方法的局限性，提供更准确的高速目标运动测量。

Abstract: The characterization of mechanical properties for high-dynamic, high-velocity
target motion is essential in industries. It provides crucial data for
validating weapon systems and precision manufacturing processes etc. However,
existing measurement methods face challenges such as limited dynamic range,
discontinuous observations, and high costs. This paper presents a new approach
leveraging an event-based multi-view photogrammetric system, which aims to
address the aforementioned challenges. First, the monotonicity in the
spatiotemporal distribution of events is leveraged to extract the target's
leading-edge features, eliminating the tailing effect that complicates motion
measurements. Then, reprojection error is used to associate events with the
target's trajectory, providing more data than traditional intersection methods.
Finally, a target velocity decay model is employed to fit the data, enabling
accurate motion measurements via ours multi-view data joint computation. In a
light gas gun fragment test, the proposed method showed a measurement deviation
of 4.47% compared to the electromagnetic speedometer.

Motivation: 现有S2I方法无法同时保证语义和形状一致性，且在多实体场景下存在属性泄漏问题。

Method: 提出Seg2Any框架，通过语义对齐注意力掩码和实体轮廓图分别控制语义和形状，并引入属性隔离注意力掩码防止属性泄漏。

Result: 在开放集和封闭集S2I任务中表现优异，尤其在细粒度空间和属性控制方面。

Conclusion: Seg2Any解决了现有S2I方法的局限性，为精确空间布局控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion models, top-tier text-to-image (T2I)
models still struggle to achieve precise spatial layout control, i.e.
accurately generating entities with specified attributes and locations.
Segmentation-mask-to-image (S2I) generation has emerged as a promising solution
by incorporating pixel-level spatial guidance and regional text prompts.
However, existing S2I methods fail to simultaneously ensure semantic
consistency and shape consistency. To address these challenges, we propose
Seg2Any, a novel S2I framework built upon advanced multimodal diffusion
transformers (e.g. FLUX). First, to achieve both semantic and shape
consistency, we decouple segmentation mask conditions into regional semantic
and high-frequency shape components. The regional semantic condition is
introduced by a Semantic Alignment Attention Mask, ensuring that generated
entities adhere to their assigned text prompts. The high-frequency shape
condition, representing entity boundaries, is encoded as an Entity Contour Map
and then introduced as an additional modality via multi-modal attention to
guide image spatial structure. Second, to prevent attribute leakage across
entities in multi-entity scenarios, we introduce an Attribute Isolation
Attention Mask mechanism, which constrains each entity's image tokens to attend
exclusively to themselves during image self-attention. To support open-set S2I
generation, we construct SACap-1M, a large-scale dataset containing 1 million
images with 5.9 million segmented entities and detailed regional captions,
along with a SACap-Eval benchmark for comprehensive S2I evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Seg2Any achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both open-set and closed-set S2I benchmarks, particularly in fine-grained
spatial and attribute control of entities.

Abstract: We introduce XYZ-IBD, a bin-picking dataset for 6D pose estimation that
captures real-world industrial complexity, including challenging object
geometries, reflective materials, severe occlusions, and dense clutter. The
dataset reflects authentic robotic manipulation scenarios with
millimeter-accurate annotations. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus
on household objects, which approach saturation,XYZ-IBD represents the unsolved
realistic industrial conditions. The dataset features 15 texture-less,
metallic, and mostly symmetrical objects of varying shapes and sizes. These
objects are heavily occluded and randomly arranged in bins with high density,
replicating the challenges of real-world bin-picking. XYZ-IBD was collected
using two high-precision industrial cameras and one commercially available
camera, providing RGB, grayscale, and depth images. It contains 75 multi-view
real-world scenes, along with a large-scale synthetic dataset rendered under
simulated bin-picking conditions. We employ a meticulous annotation pipeline
that includes anti-reflection spray, multi-view depth fusion, and
semi-automatic annotation, achieving millimeter-level pose labeling accuracy
required for industrial manipulation. Quantification in simulated environments
confirms the reliability of the ground-truth annotations. We benchmark
state-of-the-art methods on 2D detection, 6D pose estimation, and depth
estimation tasks on our dataset, revealing significant performance degradation
in our setups compared to current academic household benchmarks. By capturing
the complexity of real-world bin-picking scenarios, XYZ-IBD introduces more
realistic and challenging problems for future research. The dataset and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从卫星图像生成连续地面视频在模拟、自动驾驶和数字孪生城市中有广泛应用潜力，但现有方法多依赖辅助输入且难以保证时间一致性。

Method: 提出紧凑的三平面表示法直接从卫星图像编码场景几何，并采用基于射线的像素注意力机制和极线约束时间注意力模块确保跨视图和多帧一致性。

Result: 实验表明，SatDreamer360在保真度、连贯性和几何对齐方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SatDreamer360为跨视图视频生成提供了高效解决方案，并在新数据集VIGOR++上验证了其性能。

Abstract: Generating continuous ground-level video from satellite imagery is a
challenging task with significant potential for applications in simulation,
autonomous navigation, and digital twin cities. Existing approaches primarily
focus on synthesizing individual ground-view images, often relying on auxiliary
inputs like height maps or handcrafted projections, and fall short in producing
temporally consistent sequences. In this paper, we propose {SatDreamer360}, a
novel framework that generates geometrically and temporally consistent
ground-view video from a single satellite image and a predefined trajectory. To
bridge the large viewpoint gap, we introduce a compact tri-plane representation
that encodes scene geometry directly from the satellite image. A ray-based
pixel attention mechanism retrieves view-dependent features from the tri-plane,
enabling accurate cross-view correspondence without requiring additional
geometric priors. To ensure multi-frame consistency, we propose an
epipolar-constrained temporal attention module that aligns features across
frames using the known relative poses along the trajectory. To support
evaluation, we introduce {VIGOR++}, a large-scale dataset for cross-view video
generation, with dense trajectory annotations and high-quality ground-view
sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SatDreamer360 achieves
superior performance in fidelity, coherence, and geometric alignment across
diverse urban scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DreamBooth和Textual Inversion）在少量参考图像下容易过拟合，导致生成图像与文本提示不匹配。Direct Consistency Optimization（DCO）虽部分缓解问题，但仍难以处理复杂或风格化提示。

Method: 提出并行重缩放技术，将一致性引导信号分解为与分类器自由引导（CFG）平行和正交的分量，重缩放平行分量以减少干扰，同时保留主题身份。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在挑战性风格化提示下，相比基线方法提升了提示对齐和视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 并行重缩放引导技术为多样化用户输入提供了更稳定和准确的个性化生成方案。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models to specific users or concepts remains
challenging, particularly when only a few reference images are available.
Existing methods such as DreamBooth and Textual Inversion often overfit to
limited data, causing misalignment between generated images and text prompts
when attempting to balance identity fidelity with prompt adherence. While
Direct Consistency Optimization (DCO) with its consistency-guided sampling
partially alleviates this issue, it still struggles with complex or stylized
prompts. In this paper, we propose a parallel rescaling technique for
personalized diffusion models. Our approach explicitly decomposes the
consistency guidance signal into parallel and orthogonal components relative to
classifier free guidance (CFG). By rescaling the parallel component, we
minimize disruptive interference with CFG while preserving the subject's
identity. Unlike prior personalization methods, our technique does not require
additional training data or expensive annotations. Extensive experiments show
improved prompt alignment and visual fidelity compared to baseline methods,
even on challenging stylized prompts. These findings highlight the potential of
parallel rescaled guidance to yield more stable and accurate personalization
for diverse user inputs.

<details>

Motivation: 长尾数据分布不平衡导致深度学习模型偏向头部类别，忽视尾部类别，主要原因是表示空间变形和分类器偏差。

Method: 提出PI-H2T方法，包括置换不变表示融合（PIF）和头到尾特征融合（H2TF），优化表示空间和分类器。

Result: 实验证明PI-H2T有效改善了表示空间和决策边界，提升了尾类多样性。

Conclusion: PI-H2T是一种即插即用的方法，可无缝集成到现有方法中，显著提升性能。

Abstract: The imbalanced distribution of long-tailed data presents a significant
challenge for deep learning models, causing them to prioritize head classes
while neglecting tail classes. Two key factors contributing to low recognition
accuracy are the deformed representation space and a biased classifier,
stemming from insufficient semantic information in tail classes. To address
these issues, we propose permutation-invariant and head-to-tail feature fusion
(PI-H2T), a highly adaptable method. PI-H2T enhances the representation space
through permutation-invariant representation fusion (PIF), yielding more
clustered features and automatic class margins. Additionally, it adjusts the
biased classifier by transferring semantic information from head to tail
classes via head-to-tail fusion (H2TF), improving tail class diversity.
Theoretical analysis and experiments show that PI-H2T optimizes both the
representation space and decision boundaries. Its plug-and-play design ensures
seamless integration into existing methods, providing a straightforward path to
further performance improvements. Extensive experiments on long-tailed
benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of PI-H2T.

Conclusion: 特定模态的视觉语言对齐是高质量3D医学图像生成的关键，该方法为数据增强和临床模拟提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Objective: While recent advances in text-conditioned generative models have
enabled the synthesis of realistic medical images, progress has been largely
confined to 2D modalities such as chest X-rays. Extending text-to-image
generation to volumetric Computed Tomography (CT) remains a significant
challenge, due to its high dimensionality, anatomical complexity, and the
absence of robust frameworks that align vision-language data in 3D medical
imaging. Methods: We introduce a novel architecture for Text-to-CT generation
that combines a latent diffusion model with a 3D contrastive vision-language
pretraining scheme. Our approach leverages a dual-encoder CLIP-style model
trained on paired CT volumes and radiology reports to establish a shared
embedding space, which serves as the conditioning input for generation. CT
volumes are compressed into a low-dimensional latent space via a pretrained
volumetric VAE, enabling efficient 3D denoising diffusion without requiring
external super-resolution stages. Results: We evaluate our method on the
CT-RATE dataset and conduct a comprehensive assessment of image fidelity,
clinical relevance, and semantic alignment. Our model achieves competitive
performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming prior baselines for
text-to-CT generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that CT scans synthesized by
our framework can effectively augment real data, improving downstream
diagnostic performance. Conclusion: Our results show that modality-specific
vision-language alignment is a key component for high-quality 3D medical image
generation. By integrating contrastive pretraining and volumetric diffusion,
our method offers a scalable and controllable solution for synthesizing
clinically meaningful CT volumes from text, paving the way for new applications
in data augmentation, medical education, and automated clinical simulation.

Method: 提出VIDSIG方法，通过部分微调潜在解码器实现生成中水印集成，采用Perturbation-Aware Suppression（PAS）保护视觉质量，并通过轻量级Temporal Alignment模块增强时间一致性。

Result: 实验表明VIDSIG在水印提取、视觉质量和生成效率上表现最佳，并对空间和时间篡改表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VIDSIG是一种实用的生成中水印方法，适用于现实场景，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has
led to significant progress in video generation but also raises serious
concerns about intellectual property protection and reliable content tracing.
Watermarking is a widely adopted solution to this issue, but existing methods
for video generation mainly follow a post-generation paradigm, which introduces
additional computational overhead and often fails to effectively balance the
trade-off between video quality and watermark extraction. To address these
issues, we propose Video Signature (VIDSIG), an in-generation watermarking
method for latent video diffusion models, which enables implicit and adaptive
watermark integration during generation. Specifically, we achieve this by
partially fine-tuning the latent decoder, where Perturbation-Aware Suppression
(PAS) pre-identifies and freezes perceptually sensitive layers to preserve
visual quality. Beyond spatial fidelity, we further enhance temporal
consistency by introducing a lightweight Temporal Alignment module that guides
the decoder to generate coherent frame sequences during fine-tuning.
Experimental results show that VIDSIG achieves the best overall performance in
watermark extraction, visual quality, and generation efficiency. It also
demonstrates strong robustness against both spatial and temporal tampering,
highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

perturbations that alter the input images to cause malicious misclassifications

Abstract: Robust scene segmentation and keyframe extraction are essential preprocessing
steps in video understanding pipelines, supporting tasks such as indexing,
summarization, and semantic retrieval. However, existing methods often lack
generalizability across diverse video types and durations. We present a
unified, adaptive framework for automatic scene detection and keyframe
selection that handles formats ranging from short-form media to long-form
films, archival content, and surveillance footage. Our system dynamically
selects segmentation policies based on video length: adaptive thresholding for
short videos, hybrid strategies for mid-length ones, and interval-based
splitting for extended recordings. This ensures consistent granularity and
efficient processing across domains. For keyframe selection, we employ a
lightweight module that scores sampled frames using a composite metric of
sharpness, luminance, and temporal spread, avoiding complex saliency models
while ensuring visual relevance. Designed for high-throughput workflows, the
system is deployed in a commercial video analysis platform and has processed
content from media, education, research, and security domains. It offers a
scalable and interpretable solution suitable for downstream applications such
as UI previews, embedding pipelines, and content filtering. We discuss
practical implementation details and outline future enhancements, including
audio-aware segmentation and reinforcement-learned frame scoring.

Conclusion: CORTEX提升了VQGM的透明度，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Vector-Quantized Generative Models (VQGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
image generation. However, the key component of VQGMs -- the codebook of
discrete tokens -- is still not well understood, e.g., which tokens are
critical to generate an image of a certain concept? This paper introduces
Concept-Oriented Token Explanation (CORTEX), a novel approach for interpreting
VQGMs by identifying concept-specific token combinations. Our framework employs
two methods: (1) a sample-level explanation method that analyzes token
importance scores in individual images, and (2) a codebook-level explanation
method that explores the entire codebook to find globally relevant tokens.
Experimental results demonstrate CORTEX's efficacy in providing clear
explanations of token usage in the generative process, outperforming baselines
across multiple pretrained VQGMs. Besides enhancing VQGMs transparency, CORTEX
is useful in applications such as targeted image editing and shortcut feature
detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangTianze009/CORTEX.

Motivation: 小型化相机需求推动了对光学复杂度降低的计算成像系统的探索，但简化光学系统通常存在严重像差，难以通过软件完全校正。

Method: 通过可微分光学模型优化DPP变形，局部校正离轴像差，并引入神经网络控制模型以改善仿真与硬件性能对齐。

Conclusion: Fovea Stacking为小型化相机提供了一种高效像差校正方法，适用于监控或虚拟现实等应用。

Abstract: The desire for cameras with smaller form factors has recently lead to a push
for exploring computational imaging systems with reduced optical complexity
such as a smaller number of lens elements. Unfortunately such simplified
optical systems usually suffer from severe aberrations, especially in off-axis
regions, which can be difficult to correct purely in software.
  In this paper we introduce Fovea Stacking, a new type of imaging system that
utilizes emerging dynamic optical components called deformable phase plates
(DPPs) for localized aberration correction anywhere on the image sensor. By
optimizing DPP deformations through a differentiable optical model, off-axis
aberrations are corrected locally, producing a foveated image with enhanced
sharpness at the fixation point - analogous to the eye's fovea. Stacking
multiple such foveated images, each with a different fixation point, yields a
composite image free from aberrations. To efficiently cover the entire field of
view, we propose joint optimization of DPP deformations under imaging budget
constraints. Due to the DPP device's non-linear behavior, we introduce a neural
network-based control model for improved alignment between simulation-hardware
performance.
  We further demonstrated that for extended depth-of-field imaging, fovea
stacking outperforms traditional focus stacking in image quality. By
integrating object detection or eye-tracking, the system can dynamically adjust
the lens to track the object of interest-enabling real-time foveated video
suitable for downstream applications such as surveillance or foveated virtual
reality displays.

Motivation: 研究现代视觉模型是否表现出类似人类视觉的Gestalt原则行为，并探究其训练条件。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers（ViTs）和ConvNeXt模型，通过Masked Autoencoding（MAE）训练，并引入DiSRT测试全局空间扰动敏感性。

Result: 自监督模型（如MAE、CLIP）在DiSRT测试中表现优异，甚至超越人类。ConvNeXt模型也显示类似能力，但分类微调会削弱。Top-K机制可恢复全局敏感性。

Conclusion: MAE等自监督训练能促进Gestalt-like感知，DiSRT可作为模型全局结构敏感性的诊断工具。

Abstract: Human vision organizes local cues into coherent global forms using Gestalt
principles like closure, proximity, and figure-ground assignment -- functions
reliant on global spatial structure. We investigate whether modern vision
models show similar behaviors, and under what training conditions these emerge.
We find that Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained with Masked Autoencoding (MAE)
exhibit activation patterns consistent with Gestalt laws, including illusory
contour completion, convexity preference, and dynamic figure-ground
segregation. To probe the computational basis, we hypothesize that modeling
global dependencies is necessary for Gestalt-like organization. We introduce
the Distorted Spatial Relationship Testbench (DiSRT), which evaluates
sensitivity to global spatial perturbations while preserving local textures.
Using DiSRT, we show that self-supervised models (e.g., MAE, CLIP) outperform
supervised baselines and sometimes even exceed human performance. ConvNeXt
models trained with MAE also exhibit Gestalt-compatible representations,
suggesting such sensitivity can arise without attention architectures. However,
classification finetuning degrades this ability. Inspired by biological vision,
we show that a Top-K activation sparsity mechanism can restore global
sensitivity. Our findings identify training conditions that promote or suppress
Gestalt-like perception and establish DiSRT as a diagnostic for global
structure sensitivity across models.

TLDR: COinCO是一个新的数据集，通过扩散修复技术生成包含上下文一致和不一致场景的图像，用于上下文学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉数据集中缺乏上下文不一致示例的问题。

Method: 使用扩散修复技术替换COCO图像中的对象，并通过多模态大语言模型验证分类。

Result: 揭示了语义先验对修复成功的影响，并支持三种关键任务：上下文分类、对象预测和假检测。

Conclusion: COinCO为上下文感知的视觉理解和图像取证提供了基础。

Abstract: We present Common Inpainted Objects In-N-Out of Context (COinCO), a novel
dataset addressing the scarcity of out-of-context examples in existing vision
datasets. By systematically replacing objects in COCO images through
diffusion-based inpainting, we create 97,722 unique images featuring both
contextually coherent and inconsistent scenes, enabling effective context
learning. Each inpainted object is meticulously verified and categorized as in-
or out-of-context through a multimodal large language model assessment. Our
analysis reveals significant patterns in semantic priors that influence
inpainting success across object categories. We demonstrate three key tasks
enabled by COinCO: (1) training context classifiers that effectively determine
whether existing objects belong in their context; (2) a novel
Objects-from-Context prediction task that determines which new objects
naturally belong in given scenes at both instance and clique levels, and (3)
context-enhanced fake detection on state-of-the-art methods without
fine-tuning. COinCO provides a controlled testbed with contextual variations,
establishing a foundation for advancing context-aware visual understanding in
computer vision and image forensics. Our code and data are at:

Motivation: 农业对全球粮食安全至关重要，但作物病害影响产量和质量。传统CNN模型计算需求高，难以在资源受限设备上部署。

Method: 采用权重剪枝和知识蒸馏进行模型压缩，并融合DenseNet与Involutional Layers以提升空间特征捕捉能力。

Result: 压缩后的ResNet50在PlantVillage和PaddyLeaf数据集上分别达到99.55%和98.99%的准确率；DenseNet模型在高效优化下也表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法支持在资源受限设备上高效部署，促进精准农业和可持续耕作。

Abstract: Agriculture is vital for global food security, but crops are vulnerable to
diseases that impact yield and quality. While Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) accurately classify plant diseases using leaf images, their high
computational demands hinder their deployment in resource-constrained settings
such as smartphones, edge devices, and real-time monitoring systems. This study
proposes a two-step model compression approach integrating Weight Pruning and
Knowledge Distillation, along with the hybridization of DenseNet with
Involutional Layers. Pruning reduces model size and computational load, while
distillation improves the smaller student models performance by transferring
knowledge from a larger teacher network. The hybridization enhances the models
ability to capture spatial features efficiently. These compressed models are
suitable for real-time applications, promoting precision agriculture through
rapid disease identification and crop management. The results demonstrate
ResNet50s superior performance post-compression, achieving 99.55% and 98.99%
accuracy on the PlantVillage and PaddyLeaf datasets, respectively. The
DenseNet-based model, optimized for efficiency, recorded 99.21% and 93.96%
accuracy with a minimal parameter count. Furthermore, the hybrid model achieved
98.87% and 97.10% accuracy, supporting the practical deployment of
energy-efficient devices for timely disease intervention and sustainable
farming practices.

Motivation: 传统3D场景设计需要专业技能和复杂软件，而现有文本到3D生成方法受限于高质量3D数据的稀缺。

Method: 首先生成2D图像，从中提取对象形状和外观信息，再结合几何、位置和姿态信息组装成3D场景。

Result: ArtiScene在布局和美学质量上大幅领先现有方法，用户研究中胜率达74.89%，GPT-4o评估中达95.07%。

Conclusion: ArtiScene通过2D中介实现了高效、多样化的3D场景设计，为文本到3D生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Designing 3D scenes is traditionally a challenging task that demands both
artistic expertise and proficiency with complex software. Recent advances in
text-to-3D generation have greatly simplified this process by letting users
create scenes based on simple text descriptions. However, as these methods
generally require extra training or in-context learning, their performance is
often hindered by the limited availability of high-quality 3D data. In
contrast, modern text-to-image models learned from web-scale images can
generate scenes with diverse, reliable spatial layouts and consistent, visually
appealing styles. Our key insight is that instead of learning directly from 3D
scenes, we can leverage generated 2D images as an intermediary to guide 3D
synthesis. In light of this, we introduce ArtiScene, a training-free automated
pipeline for scene design that integrates the flexibility of free-form
text-to-image generation with the diversity and reliability of 2D intermediary
layouts.
  First, we generate 2D images from a scene description, then extract the shape
and appearance of objects to create 3D models. These models are assembled into
the final scene using geometry, position, and pose information derived from the
same intermediary image. Being generalizable to a wide range of scenes and
styles, ArtiScene outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by a large margin in
layout and aesthetic quality by quantitative metrics. It also averages a 74.89%
winning rate in extensive user studies and 95.07% in GPT-4o evaluation. Project

Abstract: Video processing for real-time analytics in resource-constrained environments
presents a significant challenge in balancing energy consumption and video
semantics. This paper addresses the problem of energy-efficient video
processing by proposing a system that dynamically optimizes processing
configurations to minimize energy usage on the edge, while preserving essential
video features for deep learning inference. We first gather an extensive
offline profile of various configurations consisting of device CPU frequencies,
frame filtering features, difference thresholds, and video bitrates, to
establish apriori knowledge of their impact on energy consumption and inference
accuracy. Leveraging this insight, we introduce an online system that employs
multi-objective Bayesian optimization to intelligently explore and adapt
configurations in real time. Our approach continuously refines processing
settings to meet a target inference accuracy with minimal edge device energy
expenditure. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in
reducing video processing energy use while maintaining high analytical
performance, offering a practical solution for smart devices and edge computing
applications.

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，无需训练或微调。

Conclusion: 首次将单目深度作为独立决策矩阵引入多目标跟踪，显著提升了关联准确性。

Abstract: Current motion-based multiple object tracking (MOT) approaches rely heavily
on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for object association. Without using 3D
features, they are ineffective in scenarios with occlusions or visually similar
objects. To address this, our paper presents a novel depth-aware framework for
MOT. We estimate depth using a zero-shot approach and incorporate it as an
independent feature in the association process. Additionally, we introduce a
Hierarchical Alignment Score that refines IoU by integrating both coarse
bounding box overlap and fine-grained (pixel-level) alignment to improve
association accuracy without requiring additional learnable parameters. To our
knowledge, this is the first MOT framework to incorporate 3D features
(monocular depth) as an independent decision matrix in the association step.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks
without any training nor fine-tuning. The code is available at

Abstract: Medical professionals, especially those in training, often depend on visual
reference materials to support an accurate diagnosis and develop pattern
recognition skills. However, existing resources may lack the diversity and
accessibility needed for broad and effective clinical learning. This paper
presents a system designed to generate realistic medical images from textual
descriptions and validate their accuracy through a classification model. A
pretrained stable diffusion model was fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) on the PathMNIST dataset, consisting of nine colorectal histopathology
tissue types. The generative model was trained multiple times using different
training parameter configurations, guided by domain-specific prompts to capture
meaningful features. To ensure quality control, a ResNet-18 classification
model was trained on the same dataset, achieving 99.76% accuracy in detecting
the correct label of a colorectal histopathological medical image. Generated
images were then filtered using the trained classifier and an iterative
process, where inaccurate outputs were discarded and regenerated until they
were correctly classified. The highest performing version of the generative
model from experimentation achieved an F1 score of 0.6727, with precision and
recall scores of 0.6817 and 0.7111, respectively. Some types of tissue, such as
adipose tissue and lymphocytes, reached perfect classification scores, while
others proved more challenging due to structural complexity. The
self-validating approach created demonstrates a reliable method for
synthesizing domain-specific medical images because of high accuracy in both
the generation and classification portions of the system, with potential
applications in both diagnostic support and clinical education. Future work
includes improving prompt-specific accuracy and extending the system to other
areas of medical imaging.

Conclusion: HSCR为Med-VLMs提供了一种高效、精确的模态对齐方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have achieved success across
various tasks, yet most existing methods overlook the modality misalignment
issue that can lead to untrustworthy responses in clinical settings. In this
paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding (HSCR), a novel
approach that addresses two critical challenges in Med-VLM alignment: 1)
Cost-effective generation of high-quality preference data; 2) Capturing nuanced
and context-aware preferences for improved alignment. HSCR first leverages the
inherent capability of Med-VLMs to generate dispreferred responses with higher
sampling probability. By analyzing output logit shifts after visual token
dropout, we identify modality-coupled tokens that induce misalignment and
derive an implicit alignment reward function. This function guides token
replacement with hallucinated ones during decoding, producing high-quality
dispreferred data. Furthermore, HSCR introduces a multi-level preference
optimization strategy, which extends beyond traditional adjacent-level
optimization by incorporating nuanced implicit preferences, leveraging relative
quality in dispreferred data to capture subtle alignment cues for more precise
and context-aware optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple medical
tasks, including Med-VQA, medical image captioning and instruction following,
demonstrate that HSCR not only enhances zero-shot performance but also
significantly improves modality alignment and trustworthiness with just 2,000
training entries.

Conclusion: TIME在现实多模态学习场景中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Tabular-image multimodal learning, which integrates structured tabular data
with imaging data, holds great promise for a variety of tasks, especially in
medical applications. Yet, two key challenges remain: (1) the lack of a
standardized, pretrained representation for tabular data, as is commonly
available in vision and language domains; and (2) the difficulty of handling
missing values in the tabular modality, which are common in real-world medical
datasets. To address these issues, we propose the TabPFN-Integrated Multimodal
Engine (TIME), a novel multimodal framework that builds on the recently
introduced tabular foundation model, TabPFN. TIME leverages TabPFN as a frozen
tabular encoder to generate robust, strong embeddings that are naturally
resilient to missing data, and combines them with image features from
pretrained vision backbones. We explore a range of fusion strategies and
tabular encoders, and evaluate our approach on both natural and medical
datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TIME consistently outperforms
competitive baselines across both complete and incomplete tabular inputs,
underscoring its practical value in real-world multimodal learning scenarios.

Result: 在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上，L3A表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: L3A是一种无需存储历史样本的有效方法，显著提升了多标签增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes
continually without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Multi-label CIL
(MLCIL) extends CIL to a real-world scenario where each sample may belong to
multiple classes, introducing several challenges: label absence, which leads to
incomplete historical information due to missing labels, and class imbalance,
which results in the model bias toward majority classes. To address these
challenges, we propose Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation (L3A), an
exemplar-free approach without storing past samples. L3A integrates two key
modules. The pseudo-label (PL) module implements label augmentation by
generating pseudo-labels for current phase samples, addressing the label
absence problem. The weighted analytic classifier (WAC) derives a closed-form
solution for neural networks. It introduces sample-specific weights to
adaptively balance the class contribution and mitigate class imbalance.
Experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that L3A outperforms
existing methods in MLCIL tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving remarkable performance in face
restoration. However, the heavy computations of diffusion models make it
difficult to deploy them on devices like smartphones. In this work, we propose
QuantFace, a novel low-bit quantization for one-step diffusion face restoration
models, where the full-precision (\ie, 32-bit) weights and activations are
quantized to 4$\sim$6-bit. We first analyze the data distribution within
activations and find that they are highly variant. To preserve the original
data information, we employ rotation-scaling channel balancing. Furthermore, we
propose Quantization-Distillation Low-Rank Adaptation (QD-LoRA) that jointly
optimizes for quantization and distillation performance. Finally, we propose an
adaptive bit-width allocation strategy. We formulate such a strategy as an
integer programming problem, which combines quantization error and perceptual
metrics to find a satisfactory resource allocation. Extensive experiments on
the synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
QuantFace under 6-bit and 4-bit. QuantFace achieves significant advantages over
recent leading low-bit quantization methods for face restoration. The code is

Conclusion: CAPAA为隐私保护和鲁棒分类器开发提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Projector-based adversarial attack aims to project carefully designed light
patterns (i.e., adversarial projections) onto scenes to deceive deep image
classifiers. It has potential applications in privacy protection and the
development of more robust classifiers. However, existing approaches primarily
focus on individual classifiers and fixed camera poses, often neglecting the
complexities of multi-classifier systems and scenarios with varying camera
poses. This limitation reduces their effectiveness when introducing new
classifiers or camera poses. In this paper, we introduce Classifier-Agnostic
Projector-Based Adversarial Attack (CAPAA) to address these issues. First, we
develop a novel classifier-agnostic adversarial loss and optimization framework
that aggregates adversarial and stealthiness loss gradients from multiple
classifiers. Then, we propose an attention-based gradient weighting mechanism
that concentrates perturbations on regions of high classification activation,
thereby improving the robustness of adversarial projections when applied to
scenes with varying camera poses. Our extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that CAPAA achieves both a higher attack success rate and greater
stealthiness compared to existing baselines. Codes are available at:

Abstract: The generation and editing of audio-conditioned talking portraits guided by

In this paper, we present SkyReels-Audio, a unified framework for synthesizing
high-fidelity and temporally coherent talking portrait videos. Built upon
pretrained video diffusion transformers, our framework supports infinite-length
generation and editing, while enabling diverse and controllable conditioning
through multimodal inputs. We employ a hybrid curriculum learning strategy to
progressively align audio with facial motion, enabling fine-grained multimodal
control over long video sequences. To enhance local facial coherence, we
introduce a facial mask loss and an audio-guided classifier-free guidance
mechanism. A sliding-window denoising approach further fuses latent
representations across temporal segments, ensuring visual fidelity and temporal
consistency across extended durations and diverse identities. More importantly,
we construct a dedicated data pipeline for curating high-quality triplets
consisting of synchronized audio, video, and textual descriptions.
Comprehensive benchmark evaluations show that SkyReels-Audio achieves superior
performance in lip-sync accuracy, identity consistency, and realistic facial
dynamics, particularly under complex and challenging conditions.

Abstract: The synchrotron light source, a cutting-edge large-scale user facility,
requires autonomous synchrotron beamline operations, a crucial technique that
should enable experiments to be conducted automatically, reliably, and safely
with minimum human intervention. However, current state-of-the-art synchrotron
beamlines still heavily rely on human safety oversight. To bridge the gap
between automated and autonomous operation, a computer vision-based system is
proposed, integrating deep learning and multiview cameras for real-time
collision detection. The system utilizes equipment segmentation, tracking, and

Motivation: 解决边缘设备因计算资源受限而无法进行场景特定数据微调的难题，提升行人轨迹预测的适应性和准确性。

Method: 提出时空相似性示例选择（STES）和预测引导示例选择（PG-ES）方法，结合大规模合成数据集训练模型。

Result: TrajICL在多个公共基准测试中表现优异，适应性强，甚至优于微调方法。

Conclusion: TrajICL通过上下文学习和示例选择方法，实现了高效的行人轨迹预测，适用于不同场景和领域。

Abstract: Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for
autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for
adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves
collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via
backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due
to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce
TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory
prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the
scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example
selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed
trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at
corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce
prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on
both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than
relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to
account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of
relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train
our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability
by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain
scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public
benchmarks. The code will be released at

*Yue Zhou,Xinan He,KaiQing Lin,Bin Fan,Feng Ding,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 当前AIGC检测器在训练生成器生成的图像上表现优异，但难以泛化到未见生成器的输出。研究发现潜在先验偏差是原因之一，并提出On-Manifold Adversarial Training (OMAT)方法，通过优化扩散模型的初始噪声生成对抗样本，提升检测器的泛化能力。实验表明，该方法显著提高了跨生成器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AIGC检测器在跨生成器泛化能力上表现不佳，主要原因是潜在先验偏差，即检测器学习的是与初始噪声相关的模式而非鲁棒的生成伪影。

Method: 提出OMAT方法，通过优化扩散模型的初始噪声生成对抗样本，确保其位于生成器的输出流形上，避免像素空间攻击带来的干扰。

Result: 在GenImage++等基准测试中，OMAT显著提升了检测器的跨生成器性能，无需重新设计网络。

Conclusion: OMAT方法有效解决了潜在先验偏差问题，为未来数据集构建和检测器评估提供了重要指导，推动了更鲁棒和泛化的AIGC检测方法的发展。

Abstract: Current AIGC detectors often achieve near-perfect accuracy on images produced
by the same generator used for training but struggle to generalize to outputs
from unseen generators. We trace this failure in part to latent prior bias:
detectors learn shortcuts tied to patterns stemming from the initial noise
vector rather than learning robust generative artifacts. To address this, we
propose On-Manifold Adversarial Training (OMAT): by optimizing the initial
latent noise of diffusion models under fixed conditioning, we generate
on-manifold adversarial examples that remain on the generator's output
manifold-unlike pixel-space attacks, which introduce off-manifold perturbations
that the generator itself cannot reproduce and that can obscure the true
discriminative artifacts. To test against state-of-the-art generative models,
we introduce GenImage++, a test-only benchmark of outputs from advanced
generators (Flux.1, SD3) with extended prompts and diverse styles. We apply our
adversarial-training paradigm to ResNet50 and CLIP baselines and evaluate
across existing AIGC forensic benchmarks and recent challenge datasets.
Extensive experiments show that adversarially trained detectors significantly
improve cross-generator performance without any network redesign. Our findings
on latent-prior bias offer valuable insights for future dataset construction
and detector evaluation, guiding the development of more robust and
generalizable AIGC forensic methodologies.

*Sa Zhu,Huashan Chen,Wanqian Zhang,Jinchao Zhang,Zexian Yang,Xiaoshuai Hao,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种名为UEM的框架，通过PGVS模块和CAER模块改进视频事件建模，解决了固定分割和平均池化的问题，提升了PRVR任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频分割和事件表示上存在模糊边界和不对齐问题，限制了部分相关视频检索（PRVR）的性能。

Method: 提出UEM框架，包含PGVS模块（渐进分组视频分割）和CAER模块（上下文感知事件细化），分别解决事件边界模糊和表示不对齐问题。

Result: 在两个PRVR基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UEM框架通过改进事件建模，显著提升了PRVR任务的准确性和对齐性。

Abstract: Given a text query, partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) aims to
retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant moments, wherein event modeling
is crucial for partitioning the video into smaller temporal events that
partially correspond to the text. Previous methods typically segment videos
into a fixed number of equal-length clips, resulting in ambiguous event
boundaries. Additionally, they rely on mean pooling to compute event
representations, inevitably introducing undesired misalignment. To address
these, we propose an Uneven Event Modeling (UEM) framework for PRVR. We first
introduce the Progressive-Grouped Video Segmentation (PGVS) module, to
iteratively formulate events in light of both temporal dependencies and
semantic similarity between consecutive frames, enabling clear event
boundaries. Furthermore, we also propose the Context-Aware Event Refinement
(CAER) module to refine the event representation conditioned the text's
cross-attention. This enables event representations to focus on the most
relevant frames for a given text, facilitating more precise text-video
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on two PRVR benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别（MER）因数据获取困难而性能受限，需利用大规模预训练模型的语义知识提升性能。

Method: 采用CLIP架构，引入标签编码器将标签作为文本嵌入，设计跨模态解码器对齐多模态特征到共享空间。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MER-CLIP通过标签语义增强特征表示，显著提升多模态情感识别性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify human emotions by
combining data from various modalities such as language, audio, and vision.
Despite the recent advances of MER approaches, the limitations in obtaining
extensive datasets impede the improvement of performance. To mitigate this
issue, we leverage a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based
architecture and its semantic knowledge from massive datasets that aims to
enhance the discriminative multimodal representation. We propose a label
encoder-guided MER framework based on CLIP (MER-CLIP) to learn emotion-related
representations across modalities. Our approach introduces a label encoder that
treats labels as text embeddings to incorporate their semantic information,
leading to the learning of more representative emotional features. To further
exploit label semantics, we devise a cross-modal decoder that aligns each
modality to a shared embedding space by sequentially fusing modality features
based on emotion-related input from the label encoder. Finally, the label
encoder-guided prediction enables generalization across diverse labels by
embedding their semantic information as well as word labels. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods on
the benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑行业设备利用率低导致成本增加和项目延误，需实时监控设备活动。

Method: 提出Edge-IMI框架，包含目标检测、跟踪和空闲状态识别模块，适用于边缘计算设备。

Result: 目标检测F1分数71.75%，空闲识别模块准确区分活动与空闲状态，支持实时处理。

Conclusion: Edge-IMI减少对高带宽云服务和昂贵硬件的依赖，提升现场推理效率。

Abstract: The construction industry faces significant challenges in optimizing
equipment utilization, as underused machinery leads to increased operational
costs and project delays. Accurate and timely monitoring of equipment activity
is therefore key to identifying idle periods and improving overall efficiency.
This paper presents the Edge-IMI framework for detecting idle construction
machinery, specifically designed for integration with surveillance camera
systems. The proposed solution consists of three components: object detection,
tracking, and idle state identification, which are tailored for execution on
resource-constrained, CPU-based edge computing devices. The performance of
Edge-IMI is evaluated using a combined dataset derived from the ACID and MOCS
benchmarks. Experimental results confirm that the object detector achieves an
F1 score of 71.75%, indicating robust real-world detection capabilities. The
logistic regression-based idle identification module reliably distinguishes
between active and idle machinery with minimal false positives. Integrating all
three modules, Edge-IMI enables efficient on-site inference, reducing reliance
on high-bandwidth cloud services and costly hardware accelerators. We also
evaluate the performance of object detection models on Raspberry Pi 5 and an
Intel NUC platforms, as example edge computing platforms. We assess the
feasibility of real-time processing and the impact of model optimization
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法难以同时解决服装图像与目标人体的精确对齐及细粒度纹理保留问题。

Method: DS-VTON采用两阶段设计：首先生成低分辨率试穿结果以捕捉语义对应关系，第二阶段通过残差引导扩散过程重建高分辨率输出。

Result: DS-VTON在多个标准虚拟试穿基准测试中实现了结构对齐和纹理保留的最优性能。

Conclusion: DS-VTON通过双尺度框架和残差扩散方法，显著提升了虚拟试穿的效果。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, most existing virtual try-on methods still struggle
to simultaneously address two core challenges: accurately aligning the garment
image with the target human body, and preserving fine-grained garment textures
and patterns. In this paper, we propose DS-VTON, a dual-scale virtual try-on
framework that explicitly disentangles these objectives for more effective
modeling. DS-VTON consists of two stages: the first stage generates a
low-resolution try-on result to capture the semantic correspondence between
garment and body, where reduced detail facilitates robust structural alignment.
The second stage introduces a residual-guided diffusion process that
reconstructs high-resolution outputs by refining the residual between the two
scales, focusing on texture fidelity. In addition, our method adopts a fully
mask-free generation paradigm, eliminating reliance on human parsing maps or
segmentation masks. By leveraging the semantic priors embedded in pretrained
diffusion models, this design more effectively preserves the person's
appearance and geometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DS-VTON achieves state-of-the-art performance in both structural alignment and
texture preservation across multiple standard virtual try-on benchmarks.

Result: 提供了全面的3D骨架数据集概述和算法性能分析，为领域发展提供了结构化路线图。

Conclusion: 本文通过任务导向的框架和最新技术整合，为3D骨架动作识别领域提供了基础且易理解的综述。

Abstract: With the inherent advantages of skeleton representation, 3D skeleton-based
action recognition has become a prominent topic in the field of computer
vision. However, previous reviews have predominantly adopted a model-oriented
perspective, often neglecting the fundamental steps involved in skeleton-based
action recognition. This oversight tends to ignore key components of
skeleton-based action recognition beyond model design and has hindered deeper,
more intrinsic understanding of the task. To bridge this gap, our review aims
to address these limitations by presenting a comprehensive, task-oriented
framework for understanding skeleton-based action recognition. We begin by
decomposing the task into a series of sub-tasks, placing particular emphasis on
preprocessing steps such as modality derivation and data augmentation. The
subsequent discussion delves into critical sub-tasks, including feature
extraction and spatio-temporal modeling techniques. Beyond foundational action
recognition networks, recently advanced frameworks such as hybrid
architectures, Mamba models, large language models (LLMs), and generative
models have also been highlighted. Finally, a comprehensive overview of public
3D skeleton datasets is presented, accompanied by an analysis of
state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated on these benchmarks. By integrating
task-oriented discussions, comprehensive examinations of sub-tasks, and an
emphasis on the latest advancements, our review provides a fundamental and
accessible structured roadmap for understanding and advancing the field of 3D
skeleton-based action recognition.

Motivation: 人类通过语言结构和视觉线索区分已完成和进行中的动作，但现有视频语言模型是否具备类似能力尚不明确。

Method: 创建了多语言（英语、意大利语、俄语、日语）选择题数据集Perfect Times，结合日常活动视频和完成性标签，测试模型的时间推理能力。

Result: 实验显示，尽管模型在文本任务上表现优异，但在视频中的时间和因果推理上仍难以达到人类水平。

Conclusion: 研究强调需整合多模态线索以捕捉动作持续性和完成性的细微差别，为视频语言模型的时间推理评估设定了新标准。

Abstract: Human perception of events is intrinsically tied to distinguishing between
completed (perfect and telic) and ongoing (durative) actions, a process
mediated by both linguistic structure and visual cues. In this work, we
introduce the \textbf{Perfect Times} dataset, a novel, quadrilingual (English,
Italian, Russian, and Japanese) multiple-choice question-answering benchmark
designed to assess video-language models (VLMs) on temporal reasoning. By
pairing everyday activity videos with event completion labels and
perfectivity-tailored distractors, our dataset probes whether models truly
comprehend temporal dynamics or merely latch onto superficial markers.
Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art models, despite their
success on text-based tasks, struggle to mirror human-like temporal and causal
reasoning grounded in video. This study underscores the necessity of
integrating deep multimodal cues to capture the nuances of action duration and
completion within temporal and causal video dynamics, setting a new standard
for evaluating and advancing temporal reasoning in VLMs.

Result: 在健康主动脉解剖结构上展示了高精度和高效的计算性能。

Conclusion: AD-SVFD在血管形状配准和合成解剖结构生成方面表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This work introduces AD-SVFD, a deep learning model for the deformable
registration of vascular shapes to a pre-defined reference and for the
generation of synthetic anatomies. AD-SVFD operates by representing each
geometry as a weighted point cloud and models ambient space deformations as
solutions at unit time of ODEs, whose time-independent right-hand sides are
expressed through artificial neural networks. The model parameters are
optimized by minimizing the Chamfer Distance between the deformed and reference
point clouds, while backward integration of the ODE defines the inverse
transformation. A distinctive feature of AD-SVFD is its auto-decoder structure,
that enables generalization across shape cohorts and favors efficient weight
sharing. In particular, each anatomy is associated with a low-dimensional code
that acts as a self-conditioning field and that is jointly optimized with the
network parameters during training. At inference, only the latent codes are
fine-tuned, substantially reducing computational overheads. Furthermore, the
use of implicit shape representations enables generative applications: new
anatomies can be synthesized by suitably sampling from the latent space and
applying the corresponding inverse transformations to the reference geometry.
Numerical experiments, conducted on healthy aortic anatomies, showcase the
high-quality results of AD-SVFD, which yields extremely accurate approximations
at competitive computational costs.

TLDR: 提出TIGeR框架，利用文本驱动先验优化3D物体形状和姿态估计，无需预定义模板，提升对遮挡场景的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预定义3D模板在手工交互重建中需大量人工且限制适应性，尤其在遮挡场景下表现不佳。

Method: 两阶段框架：文本指令生成先验，视觉引导细化；通过2D-3D协作注意力校准合成原型。

Result: 在Dex-YCB和Obman数据集上表现优异（Chamfer距离1.979和5.468），超越无模板方法。

Conclusion: TIGeR框架对遮挡鲁棒，兼容多种先验来源，实用性强。

Abstract: Pre-defined 3D object templates are widely used in 3D reconstruction of
hand-object interactions. However, they often require substantial manual
efforts to capture or source, and inherently restrict the adaptability of
models to unconstrained interaction scenarios, e.g., heavily-occluded objects.
To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a new Text-Instructed Generation and
Refinement (TIGeR) framework, harnessing the power of intuitive text-driven
priors to steer the object shape refinement and pose estimation. We use a
two-stage framework: a text-instructed prior generation and vision-guided
refinement. As the name implies, we first leverage off-the-shelf models to
generate shape priors according to the text description without tedious 3D
crafting. Considering the geometric gap between the synthesized prototype and
the real object interacted with the hand, we further calibrate the synthesized
prototype via 2D-3D collaborative attention. TIGeR achieves competitive
performance, i.e., 1.979 and 5.468 object Chamfer distance on the widely-used
Dex-YCB and Obman datasets, respectively, surpassing existing template-free
methods. Notably, the proposed framework shows robustness to occlusion, while
maintaining compatibility with heterogeneous prior sources, e.g., retrieved
hand-crafted prototypes, in practical deployment scenarios.

setting that continual adaptation also enhances zero-shot performance. We also
present a unified baseline algorithm that improves robustness in few-shot

we report three key findings: (1) existing methods show substantial room for
improvement, particularly in pixel-level defect localization; (2) our proposed

Conclusion: IVY-FAKE和IVY-XDETECTOR为AIGC检测提供了统一且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in
visual domains has resulted in highly realistic synthetic images and videos,
driven by sophisticated generative frameworks such as diffusion-based
architectures. While these breakthroughs open substantial opportunities, they
simultaneously raise critical concerns about content authenticity and
integrity. Many current AIGC detection methods operate as black-box binary
classifiers, which offer limited interpretability, and no approach supports
detecting both images and videos in a unified framework. This dual limitation
compromises model transparency, reduces trustworthiness, and hinders practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce IVY-FAKE , a novel,
unified, and large-scale dataset specifically designed for explainable
multimodal AIGC detection. Unlike prior benchmarks, which suffer from
fragmented modality coverage and sparse annotations, IVY-FAKE contains over
150,000 richly annotated training samples (images and videos) and 18,700
evaluation examples, each accompanied by detailed natural-language reasoning
beyond simple binary labels. Building on this, we propose Ivy Explainable
Detector (IVY-XDETECTOR), a unified AIGC detection and explainable architecture
that jointly performs explainable detection for both image and video content.
Our unified vision-language model achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple image and video detection benchmarks, highlighting the significant
advancements enabled by our dataset and modeling framework. Our data is

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Multi-modality Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
driving significant advancements in visual understanding and generation.
Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment of their capabilities, concerning the
fine-grained physical principles especially in geometric optics, remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GOBench, the first benchmark
to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability across two tasks: 1) Generating
Optically Authentic Imagery and 2) Understanding Underlying Optical Phenomena.
We curates high-quality prompts of geometric optical scenarios and use MLLMs to
construct GOBench-Gen-1k dataset.We then organize subjective experiments to
assess the generated imagery based on Optical Authenticity, Aesthetic Quality,
and Instruction Fidelity, revealing MLLMs' generation flaws that violate
optical principles. For the understanding task, we apply crafted evaluation
instructions to test optical understanding ability of eleven prominent MLLMs.
The experimental results demonstrate that current models face significant
challenges in both optical generation and understanding. The top-performing
generative model, GPT-4o-Image, cannot perfectly complete all generation tasks,
and the best-performing MLLM model, Gemini-2.5Pro, attains a mere 37.35\%
accuracy in optical understanding.

Abstract: The emergence of ResNet provides a powerful tool for training extremely deep
networks. The core idea behind it is to change the learning goals of the
network. It no longer learns new features from scratch but learns the
difference between the target and existing features. However, the difference
between the two kinds of features does not have an independent and clear
meaning, and the amount of learning is based on the absolute rather than the
relative difference, which is sensitive to the size of existing features. We
propose a new network that perfectly solves these two problems while still
having the advantages of ResNet. Specifically, it chooses to learn the quotient
of the target features with the existing features, so we call it the quotient
network. In order to enable this network to learn successfully and achieve
higher performance, we propose some design rules for this network so that it
can be trained efficiently and achieve better performance than ResNet.
Experiments on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN datasets prove that this network
can stably achieve considerable improvements over ResNet by simply making tiny
corresponding changes to the original ResNet network without adding new
parameters.

TLDR: FlexSelect是一种灵活高效的令牌选择策略，用于处理长视频，通过跨模态注意力模式识别并保留最相关的语义内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解对视频大语言模型（VideoLLMs）提出了高计算和内存需求的挑战。

Method: FlexSelect包括无训练的令牌排名管道和轻量级选择器，利用跨模态注意力权重估计令牌重要性并过滤冗余内容。

Result: 在多个长视频基准测试中表现优异，显著提升速度（如LLaVA-Video-7B模型速度提升9倍）。

Conclusion: FlexSelect是一种通用且高效的插件模块，可扩展VideoLLMs的时间上下文长度。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding poses a significant challenge for video large
language models (VideoLLMs) due to prohibitively high computational and memory
demands. In this paper, we propose FlexSelect, a flexible and efficient token
selection strategy for processing long videos. FlexSelect identifies and
retains the most semantically relevant content by leveraging cross-modal
attention patterns from a reference transformer layer. It comprises two key
components: (1) a training-free token ranking pipeline that leverages faithful
cross-modal attention weights to estimate each video token's importance, and
(2) a rank-supervised lightweight selector that is trained to replicate these
rankings and filter redundant tokens. This generic approach can be seamlessly
integrated into various VideoLLM architectures, such as LLaVA-Video, InternVL
and Qwen-VL, serving as a plug-and-play module to extend their temporal context
length. Empirically, FlexSelect delivers strong gains across multiple
long-video benchmarks including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVB, and LVBench. Moreover,
it achieves significant speed-ups (for example, up to 9 times on a
LLaVA-Video-7B model), highlighting FlexSelect's promise for efficient
long-form video understanding. Project page available at:

TLDR: TIC-FT是一种高效且通用的方法，用于适应预训练视频扩散模型到多样化的条件生成任务，无需架构修改，仅需少量样本即可实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部编码器或架构修改，需要大数据集且灵活性不足，TIC-FT旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过沿时间轴连接条件和目标帧，并插入噪声逐渐增加的缓冲帧，实现平滑过渡和高效微调。

Result: 在多种任务中表现优于现有基线，条件保真度和视觉质量更高，训练和推理效率均优。

Conclusion: TIC-FT是一种高效、灵活且可扩展的条件生成方法，适用于小样本场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality
video synthesis, but controllable generation remains challenging, particularly
under limited data and compute. Existing fine-tuning methods for conditional
generation often rely on external encoders or architectural modifications,
which demand large datasets and are typically restricted to spatially aligned
conditioning, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce
Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning (TIC-FT), an efficient and versatile approach
for adapting pretrained video diffusion models to diverse conditional
generation tasks. Our key idea is to concatenate condition and target frames
along the temporal axis and insert intermediate buffer frames with
progressively increasing noise levels. These buffer frames enable smooth
transitions, aligning the fine-tuning process with the pretrained model's
temporal dynamics. TIC-FT requires no architectural changes and achieves strong
performance with as few as 10-30 training samples. We validate our method
across a range of tasks, including image-to-video and video-to-video
generation, using large-scale base models such as CogVideoX-5B and Wan-14B.
Extensive experiments show that TIC-FT outperforms existing baselines in both
condition fidelity and visual quality, while remaining highly efficient in both
training and inference. For additional results, visit

TLDR: 论文提出MJ-COCO，一个重新标注的MS-COCO版本，通过四阶段伪标签细化框架解决MS-COCO的标注问题，显著提升模型性能和小目标标注覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MS-COCO作为标准基准数据集存在多种标注问题（如缺失标签、错误类别分配等），影响模型训练和泛化能力。

Method: 采用基于损失和梯度的错误检测，结合四阶段伪标签细化（边界框生成、重复去除、类别验证、空间调整）。

Result: MJ-COCO在多个验证数据集上表现优于MS-COCO，AP和APS指标提升，小目标标注增加20万+。

Conclusion: MJ-COCO通过自动化标注修正显著提升了数据集质量，为模型训练提供了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Benchmark object detection (OD) datasets play a pivotal role in advancing
computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, and surveillance, as
well as in training and evaluating deep learning-based state-of-the-art
detection models. Among them, MS-COCO has become a standard benchmark due to
its diverse object categories and complex scenes. However, despite its wide
adoption, MS-COCO suffers from various annotation issues, including missing
labels, incorrect class assignments, inaccurate bounding boxes, duplicate
labels, and group labeling inconsistencies. These errors not only hinder model
training but also degrade the reliability and generalization of OD models. To
address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive refinement framework and
present MJ-COCO, a newly re-annotated version of MS-COCO. Our approach begins
with loss and gradient-based error detection to identify potentially mislabeled
or hard-to-learn samples. Next, we apply a four-stage pseudo-labeling
refinement process: (1) bounding box generation using invertible
transformations, (2) IoU-based duplicate removal and confidence merging, (3)
class consistency verification via expert objects recognizer, and (4) spatial
adjustment based on object region activation map analysis. This integrated
pipeline enables scalable and accurate correction of annotation errors without
manual re-labeling. Extensive experiments were conducted across four validation
datasets: MS-COCO, Sama COCO, Objects365, and PASCAL VOC. Models trained on
MJ-COCO consistently outperformed those trained on MS-COCO, achieving
improvements in Average Precision (AP) and APS metrics. MJ-COCO also
demonstrated significant gains in annotation coverage: for example, the number
of small object annotations increased by more than 200,000 compared to MS-COCO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像域语义混合与视频之间的差距，实现无需训练的高质量视频合成。

Method: 利用对角去噪调度和类无关分割在潜在空间中检测和跟踪对象，结合动量语义校正和伽马残差噪声稳定确保时间一致性。

Result: 在SSIM、LPIPS和新型指标CASS上表现优异，优于现有基线，实现空间一致性和连贯运动。

Conclusion: MoCA-Video证明扩散噪声轨迹的结构化操作可实现可控、高质量的视频合成。

Abstract: We introduce MoCA-Video (Motion-Aware Concept Alignment in Video), a
training-free framework bridging the gap between image-domain semantic mixing
and video. Given a generated video and a user-provided reference image,
MoCA-Video injects the semantic features of the reference image into a specific
object within the video, while preserving the original motion and visual
context. Our approach leverages a diagonal denoising schedule and
class-agnostic segmentation to detect and track objects in the latent space and
precisely control the spatial location of the blended objects. To ensure
temporal coherence, we incorporate momentum-based semantic corrections and
gamma residual noise stabilization for smooth frame transitions. We evaluate
MoCA's performance using the standard SSIM, image-level LPIPS, temporal LPIPS,
and introduce a novel metric CASS (Conceptual Alignment Shift Score) to
evaluate the consistency and effectiveness of the visual shifts between the
source prompt and the modified video frames. Using self-constructed dataset,
MoCA-Video outperforms current baselines, achieving superior spatial
consistency, coherent motion, and a significantly higher CASS score, despite
having no training or fine-tuning. MoCA-Video demonstrates that structured
manipulation in the diffusion noise trajectory allows for controllable,
high-quality video synthesis.

TLDR: AuralSAM2通过AuralFuser模块将音频与视觉特征融合，优化了SAM2在多模态场景下的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在音频与视觉模态融合上存在效率低或定位不精确的问题，且忽略了多模态间的语义交互。

Method: 提出AuralFuser模块，通过特征金字塔和对比学习实现多模态特征融合与对齐。

Result: 在公开基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AuralSAM2有效提升了多模态分割性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) exhibits strong generalisation for promptable
segmentation in video clips; however, its integration with the audio modality
remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly follow two directions: (1)
injecting adapters into the image encoder to receive audio signals, which
incurs efficiency costs during prompt engineering, and (2) leveraging
additional foundation models to generate visual prompts for the sounding
objects, which are often imprecisely localised, leading to misguidance in SAM2.
Moreover, these methods overlook the rich semantic interplay between
hierarchical visual features and other modalities, resulting in suboptimal
cross-modal fusion. In this work, we propose AuralSAM2, comprising the novel
AuralFuser module, which externally attaches to SAM2 to integrate features from
different modalities and generate feature-level prompts, guiding SAM2's decoder
in segmenting sounding targets. Such integration is facilitated by a feature
pyramid, further refining semantic understanding and enhancing object awareness
in multimodal scenarios. Additionally, the audio-guided contrastive learning is
introduced to explicitly align audio and visual representations and to also
mitigate biases caused by dominant visual patterns. Results on public
benchmarks show that our approach achieves remarkable improvements over the
previous methods in the field. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态MR-US配准对前列腺癌诊断至关重要，但现有方法因模态差异大而难以对齐关键边界。

Method: 通过设计中间伪模态，将MR和US图像转换到该中间域，利用浅层特征保持纹理一致性，深层特征保留边界。

Result: 实验表明，ACMT减少了模态差异并保留了关键解剖边界，定量评估显示其模态相似性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ACMT在多模态前列腺图像配准中表现出色，下游配准实验验证了其稳健性。

Abstract: Multimodal MR-US registration is critical for prostate cancer diagnosis.
However, this task remains challenging due to significant modality
discrepancies. Existing methods often fail to align critical boundaries while
being overly sensitive to irrelevant details. To address this, we propose an
anatomically coherent modality translation (ACMT) network based on a
hierarchical feature disentanglement design. We leverage shallow-layer features
for texture consistency and deep-layer features for boundary preservation.
Unlike conventional modality translation methods that convert one modality into
another, our ACMT introduces the customized design of an intermediate pseudo
modality. Both MR and US images are translated toward this intermediate domain,
effectively addressing the bottlenecks faced by traditional translation methods
in the downstream registration task. Experiments demonstrate that our method
mitigates modality-specific discrepancies while preserving crucial anatomical
boundaries for accurate registration. Quantitative evaluations show superior
modality similarity compared to state-of-the-art modality translation methods.
Furthermore, downstream registration experiments confirm that our translated
images achieve the best alignment performance, highlighting the robustness of
our framework for multi-modal prostate image registration.

Conclusion: MLLMs在导航任务中潜力显著，但时间理解仍是主要挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
generalization in vision-language tasks, yet their ability to understand and
act within embodied environments remains underexplored. We present NavBench, a
benchmark to evaluate the embodied navigation capabilities of MLLMs under
zero-shot settings. NavBench consists of two components: (1) navigation
comprehension, assessed through three cognitively grounded tasks including
global instruction alignment, temporal progress estimation, and local
observation-action reasoning, covering 3,200 question-answer pairs; and (2)
step-by-step execution in 432 episodes across 72 indoor scenes, stratified by
spatial, cognitive, and execution complexity. To support real-world deployment,
we introduce a pipeline that converts MLLMs' outputs into robotic actions. We
evaluate both proprietary and open-source models, finding that GPT-4o performs
well across tasks, while lighter open-source models succeed in simpler cases.
Results also show that models with higher comprehension scores tend to achieve
better execution performance. Providing map-based context improves decision
accuracy, especially in medium-difficulty scenarios. However, most models
struggle with temporal understanding, particularly in estimating progress
during navigation, which may pose a key challenge.

Conclusion: 提出的模型设计和训练策略有效，验证了方法的优越性。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) methods are susceptible
to introducing complex degradations and noticeable artifacts into
high-resolution videos due to their inherent randomness. In this paper, we
propose a noise-robust real-world VSR framework by incorporating
self-supervised learning and Mamba into pre-trained latent diffusion models. To
ensure content consistency across adjacent frames, we enhance the diffusion
model with a global spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Video
State-Space block with a 3D Selective Scan module, which reinforces coherence
at an affordable computational cost. To further reduce artifacts in generated
details, we introduce a self-supervised ControlNet that leverages HR features
as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive
features from LR videos. Finally, a three-stage training strategy based on a
mixture of HR-LR videos is proposed to stabilize VSR training. The proposed
Self-supervised ControlNet with Spatio-Temporal Continuous Mamba based VSR
algorithm achieves superior perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on
real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed
model design and training strategies.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优异，Flevoland 1989数据集上总体准确率达99.70%。

Conclusion: ECP-Mamba在PolSAR分类中实现了高精度与高效计算的平衡，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification
has been greatly promoted by deep neural networks. However,current deep
learning-based PolSAR classification methods encounter difficulties due to its
dependence on extensive labeled data and the computational inefficiency of
architectures like Transformers. This paper presents ECP-Mamba, an efficient
framework integrating multi-scale self-supervised contrastive learning with a
state space model (SSM) backbone. Specifically, ECP-Mamba addresses annotation
scarcity through a multi-scale predictive pretext task based on local-to-global
feature correspondences, which uses a simplified self-distillation paradigm
without negative sample pairs. To enhance computational efficiency,the Mamba
architecture (a selective SSM) is first tailored for pixel-wise PolSAR
classification task by designing a spiral scan strategy. This strategy
prioritizes causally relevant features near the central pixel, leveraging the
localized nature of pixel-wise classification tasks. Additionally, the
lightweight Cross Mamba module is proposed to facilitates complementary
multi-scale feature interaction with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments
across four benchmark datasets demonstrate ECP-Mamba's effectiveness in
balancing high accuracy with resource efficiency. On the Flevoland 1989
dataset, ECP-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall
accuracy of 99.70%, average accuracy of 99.64% and Kappa coefficient of

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多模态任务中表现优异，但对视觉对抗性攻击脆弱，缺乏有效的净化方法。

Result: F3显著提升了净化效果，具有无需训练、易实现和计算高效等优势。

Conclusion: F3适用于大规模工业应用，兼顾鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their
remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language
tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks,
which can substantially compromise their performance. Despite their potential
impact, the development of effective methods for purifying such adversarial
examples has received relatively limited attention. In this paper, we introduce
F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive
"fighting fire with fire" strategy: intentionally introducing simple
perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects.
Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly
perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into
these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting
in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly
paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks
yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct
advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits
significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing
purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for
large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and
operational efficiency are critical priorities. The code will be made publicly
available.

Method: 分析200名受试者的指纹模式（环、涡、弓）和血型，使用卡方检验和皮尔逊相关性评估关联性。

Result: 环状指纹最常见，O+血型最普遍，但指纹模式与血型无显著统计学关联。

Abstract: Identification of a person is central in forensic science, security, and
healthcare. Methods such as iris scanning and genomic profiling are more
accurate but expensive, time-consuming, and more difficult to implement. This
study focuses on the relationship between the fingerprint patterns and the ABO
blood group as a biometric identification tool. A total of 200 subjects were
included in the study, and fingerprint types (loops, whorls, and arches) and
blood groups were compared. Associations were evaluated with statistical tests,
including chi-square and Pearson correlation. The study found that the loops
were the most common fingerprint pattern and the O+ blood group was the most
prevalent. Even though there was some associative pattern, there was no
statistically significant difference in the fingerprint patterns of different
blood groups. Overall, the results indicate that blood group data do not
significantly improve personal identification when used in conjunction with
fingerprinting. Although the study shows weak correlation, it may emphasize the
efforts of multi-modal based biometric systems in enhancing the current
biometric systems. Future studies may focus on larger and more diverse samples,
and possibly machine learning and additional biometrics to improve
identification methods. This study addresses an element of the ever-changing
nature of the fields of forensic science and biometric identification,
highlighting the importance of resilient analytical methods for personal
identification.

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证ACL有效性，取得新的最优性能。

Conclusion: ACL算法成功解决了长尾识别中的梯度问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Aligned Contrastive Learning (ACL) algorithm to
address the long-tailed recognition problem. Our findings indicate that while
multi-view training boosts the performance, contrastive learning does not
consistently enhance model generalization as the number of views increases.
Through theoretical gradient analysis of supervised contrastive learning (SCL),
we identify gradient conflicts, and imbalanced attraction and repulsion
gradients between positive and negative pairs as the underlying issues. Our ACL
algorithm is designed to eliminate these problems and demonstrates strong
performance across multiple benchmarks. We validate the effectiveness of ACL
through experiments on long-tailed CIFAR, ImageNet, Places, and iNaturalist
datasets. Results show that ACL achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

using sparse submanifold convolution to capture robust anatomical
representations, (2) supervised fine-tuning on a comprehensive multi-organ
segmentation dataset to refine feature extraction, and (3) task-specific
fine-tuning on a dedicated GYN-BT dataset to optimize segmentation performance
for clinical applications. The model was evaluated against state-of-the-art
methods using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), 95th percentile Hausdorff
Distance (HD95), and Average Surface Distance (ASD). Results: Our GynBTNet
achieved superior segmentation performance, significantly outperforming nnU-Net
and Swin-UNETR. Notably, it yielded a DSC of 0.837 +/- 0.068 for CTV, 0.940 +/-
0.052 for the bladder, 0.842 +/- 0.070 for the rectum, and 0.871 +/- 0.047 for
the uterus, with reduced HD95 and ASD compared to baseline models.
Self-supervised pretraining led to consistent performance improvements,
particularly for structures with complex boundaries. However, segmentation of
the sigmoid colon remained challenging, likely due to anatomical ambiguities
and inter-patient variability. Statistical significance analysis confirmed that
GynBTNet's improvements were significant compared to baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视觉中心的多模态推理任务中表现不佳，主要依赖逻辑和知识推理，未能有效整合视觉信息。

Method: 提出Cue-Rethinking推理模式，结合两阶段训练流程（模式引导冷启动和激励强化学习），并构建GThinker-11K数据集。

Result: GThinker在M$^3$CoT基准测试中达到81.5%，通用场景推理平均提升2.1%，数学推理性能持平。

Conclusion: GThinker通过视觉线索重新思考和强化学习，显著提升多模态推理能力，填补了通用推理的数据空白。

Abstract: Despite notable advancements in multimodal reasoning, leading Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) still underperform on vision-centric multimodal
reasoning tasks in general scenarios. This shortfall stems from their
predominant reliance on logic- and knowledge-based slow thinking strategies,
while effective for domains like math and science, fail to integrate visual
information effectively during reasoning. Consequently, these models often fail
to adequately ground visual cues, resulting in suboptimal performance in tasks
that require multiple plausible visual interpretations and inferences. To
address this, we present GThinker (General Thinker), a novel reasoning MLLM
excelling in multimodal reasoning across general scenarios, mathematics, and
science. GThinker introduces Cue-Rethinking, a flexible reasoning pattern that
grounds inferences in visual cues and iteratively reinterprets these cues to
resolve inconsistencies. Building on this pattern, we further propose a
two-stage training pipeline, including pattern-guided cold start and incentive
reinforcement learning, designed to enable multimodal reasoning capabilities
across domains. Furthermore, to support the training, we construct
GThinker-11K, comprising 7K high-quality, iteratively-annotated reasoning paths
and 4K curated reinforcement learning samples, filling the data gap toward
general multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GThinker
achieves 81.5% on the challenging comprehensive multimodal reasoning benchmark
M$^3$CoT, surpassing the latest O4-mini model. It also shows an average
improvement of 2.1% on general scenario multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while
maintaining on-par performance in mathematical reasoning compared to
counterpart advanced reasoning models. The code, model, and data will be
released soon at https://github.com/jefferyZhan/GThinker.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的指令调优方法需要大量数据、高质量标注和高计算成本，PROGRESS旨在通过动态样本选择降低这些需求。

Method: PROGRESS通过跟踪模型在各技能上的学习进度，动态选择未掌握且难度适中的样本进行学习，无需额外标注或辅助模型。

Result: 实验表明，PROGRESS在多个数据集上优于现有方法，且数据需求和监督更少，同时具有跨架构的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PROGRESS是一种高效、可扩展的学习框架，适用于视觉语言模型的指令调优。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has been central to the success of recent vision-language
models (VLMs), but it remains expensive-requiring large-scale datasets,
high-quality annotations, and large compute budgets. We propose PRioritized
cOncept learninG via Relative Error-driven Sample Selection (PROGRESS), a data-
and compute-efficient framework that enables VLMs to dynamically select what to
learn next based on their evolving needs during training. At each stage, the
model tracks its learning progress across skills and selects the most
informative samples-those it has not already mastered and that are not too
difficult to learn at the current stage of training. This strategy effectively
controls skill acquisition and the order in which skills are learned.
Specifically, we sample from skills showing the highest learning progress,
prioritizing those with the most rapid improvement. Unlike prior methods,
PROGRESS requires no upfront answer annotations, queries answers only on a need
basis, avoids reliance on additional supervision from auxiliary VLMs, and does
not require compute-heavy gradient computations for data selection. Experiments
across multiple instruction-tuning datasets of varying scales demonstrate that
PROGRESS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with much less
data and supervision. Additionally, we show strong cross-architecture
generalization and transferability to larger models, validating PROGRESS as a
scalable solution for efficient learning.

TLDR: 研究发现，通过合理选择，可以在LLM输入阶段进行视觉令牌压缩，性能损失可忽略。利用可解释性方法评估令牌重要性，并提出一种轻量级卷积网络学习映射，避免全推理过程。实验验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs处理大量视觉令牌导致计算成本高且效率低，传统方法假设所有令牌在浅层均必要，但研究表明输入阶段即可压缩。

Method: 利用可解释性方法评估令牌重要性，提出轻量级卷积网络学习从第一层注意力图到解释结果的映射，避免全推理。

Result: 在10个图像和视频基准测试中，压缩50%视觉令牌仍保留96%以上性能，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 输入阶段令牌压缩可行，轻量级映射网络高效且独立于MLLMs，显著提升效率。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to significant computational costs and inefficiency.
Previous works generally assume that all visual tokens are necessary in the
shallow layers of LLMs, and therefore token compression typically occurs in
intermediate layers. In contrast, our study reveals an interesting insight:
with proper selection, token compression is feasible at the input stage of LLM
with negligible performance loss. Specifically, we reveal that explainability
methods can effectively evaluate the importance of each visual token with
respect to the given instruction, which can well guide the token compression.
Furthermore, we propose to learn a mapping from the attention map of the first
LLM layer to the explanation results, thereby avoiding the need for a full
inference pass and facilitating practical deployment. Interestingly, this
mapping can be learned using a simple and lightweight convolutional network,
whose training is efficient and independent of MLLMs. Extensive experiments on
10 image and video benchmarks across three leading MLLMs (Qwen2-VL,
LLaVA-OneVision, and VILA1.5) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
e.g., pruning 50% visual tokens while retaining more than 96% of the original
performance across all benchmarks for all these three MLLMs. It also exhibits
strong generalization, even when the number of tokens in inference far exceeds
that used in training.

Abstract: We pose keystep recognition as a node classification task, and propose a
flexible graph-learning framework for fine-grained keystep recognition that is
able to effectively leverage long-term dependencies in egocentric videos. Our
approach, termed GLEVR, consists of constructing a graph where each video clip
of the egocentric video corresponds to a node. The constructed graphs are
sparse and computationally efficient, outperforming existing larger models
substantially. We further leverage alignment between egocentric and exocentric
videos during training for improved inference on egocentric videos, as well as
adding automatic captioning as an additional modality. We consider each clip of
each exocentric video (if available) or video captions as additional nodes
during training. We examine several strategies to define connections across
these nodes. We perform extensive experiments on the Ego-Exo4D dataset and show
that our proposed flexible graph-based framework notably outperforms existing
methods.

Conclusion: DeepVerse为几何感知的高保真长期预测提供了有效解决方案，验证了其在多种场景中的有效性。

Abstract: World models serve as essential building blocks toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), enabling intelligent agents to predict future states and
plan actions by simulating complex physical interactions. However, existing
interactive models primarily predict visual observations, thereby neglecting
crucial hidden states like geometric structures and spatial coherence. This
leads to rapid error accumulation and temporal inconsistency. To address these
limitations, we introduce DeepVerse, a novel 4D interactive world model
explicitly incorporating geometric predictions from previous timesteps into
current predictions conditioned on actions. Experiments demonstrate that by
incorporating explicit geometric constraints, DeepVerse captures richer
spatio-temporal relationships and underlying physical dynamics. This capability
significantly reduces drift and enhances temporal consistency, enabling the
model to reliably generate extended future sequences and achieve substantial
improvements in prediction accuracy, visual realism, and scene rationality.
Furthermore, our method provides an effective solution for geometry-aware
memory retrieval, effectively preserving long-term spatial consistency. We
validate the effectiveness of DeepVerse across diverse scenarios, establishing
its capacity for high-fidelity, long-horizon predictions grounded in
geometry-aware dynamics.

Motivation: 农业环境中水果计数的挑战包括视觉遮挡、语义模糊和3D重建的高计算需求。现有方法存在推理速度慢、泛化能力有限和缺乏开放集语义控制的问题。

Method: FruitLangGS采用自适应高斯泼溅管道重建果园场景，每个高斯编码压缩的CLIP对齐语言嵌入，支持3D空间中的语义过滤和分布感知采样。

Result: 实验结果表明，FruitLangGS在渲染速度、语义灵活性和计数准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FruitLangGS为语言驱动的实时神经渲染提供了新视角，适用于开放世界场景。

Abstract: Accurate fruit counting in real-world agricultural environments is a
longstanding challenge due to visual occlusions, semantic ambiguity, and the
high computational demands of 3D reconstruction. Existing methods based on
neural radiance fields suffer from low inference speed, limited generalization,
and lack support for open-set semantic control. This paper presents
FruitLangGS, a real-time 3D fruit counting framework that addresses these
limitations through spatial reconstruction, semantic embedding, and
language-guided instance estimation. FruitLangGS first reconstructs
orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive Gaussian splatting pipeline with
radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization for efficient rendering. To
enable semantic control, each Gaussian encodes a compressed CLIP-aligned
language embedding, forming a compact and queryable 3D representation. At
inference time, prompt-based semantic filtering is applied directly in 3D
space, without relying on image-space segmentation or view-level fusion. The
selected Gaussians are then converted into dense point clouds via
distribution-aware sampling and clustered to estimate fruit counts.
Experimental results on real orchard data demonstrate that FruitLangGS achieves
higher rendering speed, semantic flexibility, and counting accuracy compared to
prior approaches, offering a new perspective for language-driven, real-time
neural rendering across open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Many motion-centric video analysis tasks, such as atomic actions, detecting
atypical motor behavior in individuals with autism, or analyzing articulatory
motion in real-time MRI of human speech, require efficient and interpretable
temporal modeling. Capturing temporal dynamics is a central challenge in video
analysis, often requiring significant computational resources and fine-grained
annotations that are not widely available. This paper presents MOOSE (Motion
Flow Over Spatial Space), a novel temporally-centric video encoder explicitly
integrating optical flow with spatial embeddings to model temporal information
efficiently, inspired by human perception of motion. Unlike prior models, MOOSE
takes advantage of rich, widely available pre-trained visual and optical flow
encoders instead of training video models from scratch. This significantly
reduces computational complexity while enhancing temporal interpretability. Our
primary contributions includes (1) proposing a computationally efficient
temporally-centric architecture for video understanding (2) demonstrating
enhanced interpretability in modeling temporal dynamics; and (3) achieving
state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks, including clinical,
medical, and standard action recognition datasets, confirming the broad
applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Surgical triplet detection has emerged as a pivotal task in surgical video
analysis, with significant implications for performance assessment and the
training of novice surgeons. However, existing datasets such as CholecT50
exhibit critical limitations: they lack precise spatial bounding box
annotations, provide inconsistent and clinically ungrounded temporal labels,
and rely on a single data source, which limits model generalizability.To
address these shortcomings, we introduce ProstaTD, a large-scale,
multi-institutional dataset for surgical triplet detection, developed from the
technically demanding domain of robot-assisted prostatectomy. ProstaTD offers
clinically defined temporal boundaries and high-precision bounding box
annotations for each structured triplet action. The dataset comprises 60,529
video frames and 165,567 annotated triplet instances, collected from 21
surgeries performed across multiple institutions, reflecting a broad range of
surgical practices and intraoperative conditions. The annotation process was
conducted under rigorous medical supervision and involved more than 50
contributors, including practicing surgeons and medically trained annotators,
through multiple iterative phases of labeling and verification. ProstaTD is the
largest and most diverse surgical triplet dataset to date, providing a robust
foundation for fair benchmarking, the development of reliable surgical AI

Conclusion: FlowMo为提升预训练视频扩散模型的时间保真度提供了一种即插即用的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models are notoriously limited in their ability to
model temporal aspects such as motion, physics, and dynamic interactions.
Existing approaches address this limitation by retraining the model or
introducing external conditioning signals to enforce temporal consistency. In
this work, we explore whether a meaningful temporal representation can be
extracted directly from the predictions of a pre-trained model without any
additional training or auxiliary inputs. We introduce \textbf{FlowMo}, a novel
training-free guidance method that enhances motion coherence using only the
model's own predictions in each diffusion step. FlowMo first derives an
appearance-debiased temporal representation by measuring the distance between
latents corresponding to consecutive frames. This highlights the implicit
temporal structure predicted by the model. It then estimates motion coherence
by measuring the patch-wise variance across the temporal dimension and guides
the model to reduce this variance dynamically during sampling. Extensive
experiments across multiple text-to-video models demonstrate that FlowMo
significantly improves motion coherence without sacrificing visual quality or
prompt alignment, offering an effective plug-and-play solution for enhancing
the temporal fidelity of pre-trained video diffusion models.

Result: 在多种形状数据集上表现优异，性能媲美现有方法，同时显著减少可训练参数。

Conclusion: SVarM为形状分析提供了一种高效且通用的框架。

Abstract: Despite progress in the rapidly developing field of geometric deep learning,
performing statistical analysis on geometric data--where each observation is a
shape such as a curve, graph, or surface--remains challenging due to the
non-Euclidean nature of shape spaces, which are defined as equivalence classes
under invariance groups. Building machine learning frameworks that incorporate
such invariances, notably to shape parametrization, is often crucial to ensure
generalizability of the trained models to new observations. This work proposes
SVarM to exploit varifold representations of shapes as measures and their
duality with test functions $h:\mathbb{R}^n \times S^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}$.
This method provides a general framework akin to linear support vector machines
but operating instead over the infinite-dimensional space of varifolds. We
develop classification and regression models on shape datasets by introducing a
neural network-based representation of the trainable test function $h$. This
approach demonstrates strong performance and robustness across various shape
graph and surface datasets, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters.

Conclusion: 提出在对比学习预训练前增加基于人类视觉系统的预训练阶段，以提升最终表示质量并减少收敛时间。

Abstract: David Marr's seminal theory of human perception stipulates that visual
processing is a multi-stage process, prioritizing the derivation of boundary
and surface properties before forming semantic object representations. In
contrast, contrastive representation learning frameworks typically bypass this
explicit multi-stage approach, defining their objective as the direct learning
of a semantic representation space for objects. While effective in general
contexts, this approach sacrifices the inductive biases of vision, leading to
slower convergence speed and learning shortcut resulting in texture bias. In
this work, we demonstrate that leveraging Marr's multi-stage theory-by first
constructing boundary and surface-level representations using perceptual
constructs from early visual processing stages and subsequently training for
object semantics-leads to 2x faster convergence on ResNet18, improved final
representations on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object
recognition, and enhanced robustness and out-of-distribution capability.
Together, we propose a pretraining stage before the general contrastive
representation pretraining to further enhance the final representation quality
and reduce the overall convergence time via inductive bias from human vision
systems.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a fundamental task in affective
computing with applications in human-computer interaction, mental health
analysis, and behavioral understanding. In this paper, we propose SMILE-VLM, a
self-supervised vision-language model for 3D/4D FER that unifies multiview
visual representation learning with natural language supervision. SMILE-VLM
learns robust, semantically aligned, and view-invariant embeddings by proposing
three core components: multiview decorrelation via a Barlow Twins-style loss,
vision-language contrastive alignment, and cross-modal redundancy minimization.
Our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.
We further extend SMILE-VLM to the task of 4D micro-expression recognition
(MER) to recognize the subtle affective cues. The extensive results demonstrate
that SMILE-VLM not only surpasses existing unsupervised methods but also
matches or exceeds supervised baselines, offering a scalable and
annotation-efficient solution for expressive facial behavior understanding.

Abstract: This review provides an in-depth exploration of the field of animal action
recognition, focusing on coarse-grained (CG) and fine-grained (FG) techniques.
The primary aim is to examine the current state of research in animal behaviour
recognition and to elucidate the unique challenges associated with recognising
subtle animal actions in outdoor environments. These challenges differ
significantly from those encountered in human action recognition due to factors
such as non-rigid body structures, frequent occlusions, and the lack of
large-scale, annotated datasets. The review begins by discussing the evolution
of human action recognition, a more established field, highlighting how it
progressed from broad, coarse actions in controlled settings to the demand for
fine-grained recognition in dynamic environments. This shift is particularly
relevant for animal action recognition, where behavioural variability and
environmental complexity present unique challenges that human-centric models
cannot fully address. The review then underscores the critical differences
between human and animal action recognition, with an emphasis on high
intra-species variability, unstructured datasets, and the natural complexity of
animal habitats. Techniques like spatio-temporal deep learning frameworks
(e.g., SlowFast) are evaluated for their effectiveness in animal behaviour
analysis, along with the limitations of existing datasets. By assessing the
strengths and weaknesses of current methodologies and introducing a
recently-published dataset, the review outlines future directions for advancing
fine-grained action recognition, aiming to improve accuracy and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集图像训练模型时可能受到脏标签或干净标签攻击，手动检查不切实际，现有方法耗时。

Method: 利用GAN判别器训练单类模型，通过置信度分数识别错误标签和修改图像。

Result: 在扰动幅度为0.20时，GAN判别器能100%识别测试毒药图像。

Conclusion: 开发者可基于此方法训练判别器，保护高价值类别的CV模型。

Abstract: Gathering enough images to train a deep computer vision model is a constant
challenge. Unfortunately, collecting images from unknown sources can leave your
model s behavior at risk of being manipulated by a dirty-label or clean-label
attack unless the images are properly inspected. Manually inspecting each
image-label pair is impractical and common poison-detection methods that
involve re-training your model can be time consuming. This research uses GAN
discriminators to protect a single class against mislabeled and different
levels of modified images. The effect of said perturbation on a basic
convolutional neural network classifier is also included for reference. The
results suggest that after training on a single class, GAN discriminator s
confidence scores can provide a threshold to identify mislabeled images and
identify 100% of the tested poison starting at a perturbation epsilon magnitude
of 0.20, after decision threshold calibration using in-class samples.
Developers can use this report as a basis to train their own discriminators to
protect high valued classes in their CV models.

Abstract: Multispectral satellite images play a vital role in agriculture, fisheries,

volumes, and diverse spatial resolutions across multiple channels pose
significant challenges for data compression and analysis. This paper presents
ImpliSat, a unified framework specifically designed to address these challenges
through efficient compression and reconstruction of multispectral satellite

satellite images as continuous functions over coordinate space, capturing fine
spatial details across varying spatial resolutions. Furthermore, we introduce a
Fourier modulation algorithm that dynamically adjusts to the spectral and
spatial characteristics of each band, ensuring optimal compression while
preserving critical image details.

TLDR: VS2和VS2++是轻量级测试时方法，通过稀疏特征引导视觉模型，显著提升零样本CLIP性能。PASS进一步通过原型对齐优化稀疏特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态或资源受限环境中，无需重新训练或大量标注数据即可引导视觉基础模型是一个重要但具有挑战性的目标。

Method: VS2利用稀疏自编码器的稀疏特征生成引导向量；VS2++通过检索增强选择性放大相关特征；PASS在训练时引入原型对齐损失。

Result: VS2在多个数据集上超越零样本CLIP，VS2++进一步显著提升性能；PASS在CIFAR-100上比VS2提升6.12%。

Conclusion: 稀疏引导方法能显著提升特定类别的准确性，PASS通过原型对齐进一步优化性能。

Abstract: Steering vision foundation models at inference time without retraining or
access to large labeled datasets is a desirable yet challenging objective,
particularly in dynamic or resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we
introduce Visual Sparse Steering (VS2), a lightweight, test-time method that
guides vision models using steering vectors derived from sparse features
learned by top-$k$ Sparse Autoencoders without requiring contrastive data.
Specifically, VS2 surpasses zero-shot CLIP by 4.12% on CIFAR-100, 1.08% on
CUB-200, and 1.84% on Tiny-ImageNet. We further propose VS2++, a
retrieval-augmented variant that selectively amplifies relevant sparse features
using pseudo-labeled neighbors at inference time. With oracle positive/negative
sets, VS2++ achieves absolute top-1 gains over CLIP zero-shot of up to 21.44%
on CIFAR-100, 7.08% on CUB-200, and 20.47% on Tiny-ImageNet. Interestingly, VS2
and VS2++ raise per-class accuracy by up to 25% and 38%, respectively, showing
that sparse steering benefits specific classes by disambiguating visually or
taxonomically proximate categories rather than providing a uniform boost.
Finally, to better align the sparse features learned through the SAE
reconstruction task with those relevant for downstream performance, we propose
Prototype-Aligned Sparse Steering (PASS). By incorporating a
prototype-alignment loss during SAE training, using labels only during training
while remaining fully test-time unsupervised, PASS consistently, though
modestly, outperforms VS2, achieving a 6.12% gain over VS2 only on CIFAR-100
with ViT-B/32.

TLDR: ReFoCUS是一种通过强化学习优化视频帧选择的新框架，旨在提升视频问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态模型依赖静态启发式或外部检索模块选择帧，可能无法提供查询相关信息。

Method: 采用强化学习训练帧选择策略，利用参考模型的奖励信号优化帧选择，并通过自回归条件选择架构降低复杂性。

Result: 在多个视频问答基准测试中表现优异，无需显式帧级监督。

Conclusion: ReFoCUS通过模型内部效用对齐帧选择，显著提升了视频内容理解能力。

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) has enabled effective
vision-language reasoning, yet the ability to understand video content remains
constrained by suboptimal frame selection strategies. Existing approaches often
rely on static heuristics or external retrieval modules to feed frame
information into video-LLMs, which may fail to provide the query-relevant
information. In this work, we introduce ReFoCUS (Reinforcement-guided Frame
Optimization for Contextual UnderStanding), a novel frame-level policy
optimization framework that shifts the optimization target from textual
responses to visual input selection. ReFoCUS learns a frame selection policy
via reinforcement learning, using reward signals derived from a reference LMM
to reflect the model's intrinsic preferences for frames that best support
temporally grounded responses. To efficiently explore the large combinatorial
frame space, we employ an autoregressive, conditional selection architecture
that ensures temporal coherence while reducing complexity. Our approach does
not require explicit supervision at the frame-level and consistently improves
reasoning performance across multiple video QA benchmarks, highlighting the
benefits of aligning frame selection with model-internal utility.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的评估范式M3STR，用于测试多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在结构化视觉知识理解上的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准忽视了MLLMs对结构化视觉知识的理解能力，作者希望通过M3STR填补这一空白。

Method: 设计基于多模态知识图谱的M3STR基准，生成包含多模态实体及其关系的图像，要求MLLMs识别实体并解析关系拓扑。

Result: 对26个先进MLLMs的测试显示，它们在处理结构化视觉知识时仍存在不足。

Conclusion: M3STR为提升MLLMs的整体推理能力指明了方向，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) incorporate heterogeneous
modalities into LLMs, enabling a comprehensive understanding of diverse
scenarios and objects. Despite the proliferation of evaluation benchmarks and
leaderboards for MLLMs, they predominantly overlook the critical capacity of
MLLMs to comprehend world knowledge with structured abstractions that appear in
visual form. To address this gap, we propose a novel evaluation paradigm and
devise M3STR, an innovative benchmark grounded in the Multi-Modal Map for
STRuctured understanding. This benchmark leverages multi-modal knowledge graphs
to synthesize images encapsulating subgraph architectures enriched with
multi-modal entities. M3STR necessitates that MLLMs not only recognize the
multi-modal entities within the visual inputs but also decipher intricate
relational topologies among them. We delineate the benchmark's statistical
profiles and automated construction pipeline, accompanied by an extensive
empirical analysis of 26 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our findings reveal persistent
deficiencies in processing abstractive visual information with structured
knowledge, thereby charting a pivotal trajectory for advancing MLLMs' holistic
reasoning capacities. Our code and data are released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频理解方法缺乏动态反馈，限制了模型的自我修正和适应能力。现有方法存在高标注成本、低推理效率等问题。

Method: 提出ReAgent-V框架，结合高效帧选择和实时奖励生成，通过多视角反思机制迭代优化答案。

Result: 在12个数据集上的实验显示，ReAgent-V在视频理解、推理增强和模型对齐任务中分别提升6.9%、2.1%和9.8%。

Conclusion: ReAgent-V轻量、模块化且可扩展，显著提升了视频理解的泛化和推理能力。

Abstract: Video understanding is fundamental to tasks such as action recognition, video
reasoning, and robotic control. Early video understanding methods based on
large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically adopt a single-pass reasoning
paradigm without dynamic feedback, limiting the model's capacity to
self-correct and adapt in complex scenarios. Recent efforts have attempted to
address this limitation by incorporating reward models and reinforcement
learning to enhance reasoning, or by employing tool-agent frameworks. However,
these approaches face several challenges, including high annotation costs,
reward signals that fail to capture real-time reasoning states, and low
inference efficiency. To overcome these issues, we propose ReAgent-V, a novel
agentic video understanding framework that integrates efficient frame selection
with real-time reward generation during inference. These reward signals not
only guide iterative answer refinement through a multi-perspective reflection
mechanism-adjusting predictions from conservative, neutral, and aggressive
viewpoints-but also enable automatic filtering of high-quality data for
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and group
relative policy optimization (GRPO). ReAgent-V is lightweight, modular, and
extensible, supporting flexible tool integration tailored to diverse tasks.
Extensive experiments on 12 datasets across three core applications-video
understanding, video reasoning enhancement, and vision-language-action model
alignment-demonstrate significant gains in generalization and reasoning, with
improvements of up to 6.9%, 2.1%, and 9.8%, respectively, highlighting the
effectiveness and versatility of the proposed framework.

Motivation: 扩展基础模型（如SAM）到视频分割领域面临巨大挑战，特别是动态场景中的时间一致性掩码传播问题。

Method: 通过三个关键创新：图像到视频特征提取升级器、内存过滤策略和内存作为提示机制，升级预训练的SAM以支持视频分割。

Conclusion: SAM-I2V为视频分割提供了一种资源高效的解决方案，降低了研究门槛并推动了该领域的应用与发展。

Abstract: Foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have significantly
advanced promptable image segmentation in computer vision. However, extending
these capabilities to videos presents substantial challenges, particularly in
ensuring precise and temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes.
SAM 2 attempts to address this by training a model on massive image and video
data from scratch to learn complex spatiotemporal associations, resulting in
huge training costs that hinder research and practical deployment. In this
paper, we introduce SAM-I2V, an effective image-to-video upgradation method for
cultivating a promptable video segmentation (PVS) model. Our approach
strategically upgrades the pre-trained SAM to support PVS, significantly
reducing training complexity and resource requirements. To achieve this, we
introduce three key innovations: (i) an image-to-video feature extraction
upgrader built upon SAM's static image encoder to enable spatiotemporal video
perception, (ii) a memory filtering strategy that selects the most relevant
past frames for more effective utilization of historical information, and (iii)
a memory-as-prompt mechanism leveraging object memory to ensure temporally
consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves over 90% of SAM 2's performance while
using only 0.2% of its training cost. Our work presents a resource-efficient
pathway to PVS, lowering barriers for further research in PVS model design and
enabling broader applications and advancements in the field. Code and model are

Conclusion: Aesthetic-4K数据集和Diffusion-4K框架为超高清图像合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution image synthesis holds significant potential, yet
remains an underexplored challenge due to the absence of standardized
benchmarks and computational constraints. In this paper, we establish
Aesthetic-4K, a meticulously curated dataset containing dedicated training and
evaluation subsets specifically designed for comprehensive research on
ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. This dataset consists of high-quality 4K
images accompanied by descriptive captions generated by GPT-4o. Furthermore, we
propose Diffusion-4K, an innovative framework for the direct generation of
ultra-high-resolution images. Our approach incorporates the Scale Consistent
Variational Auto-Encoder (SC-VAE) and Wavelet-based Latent Fine-tuning (WLF),
which are designed for efficient visual token compression and the capture of
intricate details in ultra-high-resolution images, thereby facilitating direct
training with photorealistic 4K data. This method is applicable to various
latent diffusion models and demonstrates its efficacy in synthesizing highly
detailed 4K images. Additionally, we propose novel metrics, namely the GLCM
Score and Compression Ratio, to assess the texture richness and fine details in
local patches, in conjunction with holistic measures such as FID, Aesthetics,
and CLIPScore, enabling a thorough and multifaceted evaluation of
ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. Consequently, Diffusion-4K achieves
impressive performance in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, particularly
when powered by state-of-the-art large-scale diffusion models (eg, Flux-12B).

Abstract: We aim to detect the class and orientation of a vehicle by training a model
with synthetic data. However, the distribution of the classes in the training
data is imbalanced, and the model trained on the synthetic image is difficult
to predict in real-world images. We propose a two-stage detection model with
photo-realistic image generation to tackle this issue. Our model mainly takes
four steps to detect the class and orientation of the vehicle. (1) It builds a
table containing the image, class, and location information of objects in the
image, (2) transforms the synthetic images into real-world images style, and
merges them into the meta table. (3) Classify vehicle class and orientation
using images from the meta-table. (4) Finally, the vehicle class and
orientation are detected by combining the pre-extracted location information
and the predicted classes. We achieved 4th place in IEEE BigData Challenge 2022
Vehicle class and Orientation Detection (VOD) with our approach.

Motivation: 卷积神经网络在分类任务中表现出色，但在低对比度图像（如恶劣天气条件下拍摄的图像）上性能下降。传统直方图均衡化（HE）虽常用，但其目标分布固定为均匀分布，可能不是最优选择。

Method: 提出了一种可微分且参数化的HM方法，通过优化目标像素值分布（而非固定均匀分布）来提升分类器性能。该方法仅使用正常天气图像训练，优化目标分布以适应分类器。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用所提HM方法训练的分类器在恶劣天气条件下优于传统预处理方法。

Conclusion: 通过优化目标分布，可显著提升分类器在低对比度图像上的性能，为恶劣天气条件下的图像分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper rethinks image histogram matching (HM) and proposes a
differentiable and parametric HM preprocessing for a downstream classifier.
Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated remarkable achievements in
classification tasks. However, they often exhibit degraded performance on
low-contrast images captured under adverse weather conditions. To maintain
classifier performance under low-contrast images, histogram equalization (HE)
is commonly used. HE is a special case of HM using a uniform distribution as a
target pixel value distribution. In this paper, we focus on the shape of the
target pixel value distribution. Compared to a uniform distribution, a single,
well-designed distribution could have potential to improve the performance of
the downstream classifier across various adverse weather conditions. Based on
this hypothesis, we propose a differentiable and parametric HM that optimizes
the target distribution using the loss function of the downstream classifier.
This method addresses pixel value imbalances by transforming input images with
arbitrary distributions into a target distribution optimized for the
classifier. Our HM is trained on only normal weather images using the
classifier. Experimental results show that a classifier trained with our
proposed HM outperforms conventional preprocessing methods under adverse
weather conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有损失函数（如二元交叉熵和IoU损失）在训练分割模型时，虽然能提取像素级特征或全局图像上下文，但难以提升局部区域检测性能，且对小尺度和低对比度目标的鲁棒性不足。

Method: TDA损失引入了基于块的机制和自适应调整策略，针对目标的尺度和局部对比度进行调整，使模型更关注目标周围局部区域，并特别关注小尺度和低对比度目标。

Result: 在三个IRSTD数据集上的实验表明，TDA损失优于现有损失函数，检测性能显著提升。

Conclusion: TDA损失通过局部区域关注和自适应调整，有效解决了IRSTD中的关键问题，为小目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a target driven adaptive (TDA) loss to enhance the performance of
infrared small target detection (IRSTD). Prior works have used loss functions,
such as binary cross-entropy loss and IoU loss, to train segmentation models
for IRSTD. Minimizing these loss functions guides models to extract pixel-level
features or global image context. However, they have two issues: improving
detection performance for local regions around the targets and enhancing
robustness to small scale and low local contrast. To address these issues, the
proposed TDA loss introduces a patch-based mechanism, and an adaptive
adjustment strategy to scale and local contrast. The proposed TDA loss leads
the model to focus on local regions around the targets and pay particular
attention to targets with smaller scales and lower local contrast. We evaluate
the proposed method on three datasets for IRSTD. The results demonstrate that
the proposed TDA loss achieves better detection performance than existing
losses on these datasets.

Conclusion: CLIP-RPN通过自适应子网络路由和动态优化机制，有效提升了去雨模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Existing deraining models process all rainy images within a single network.
However, different rain patterns have significant variations, which makes it
challenging for a single network to handle diverse types of raindrops and
streaks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CLIP-driven rain
perception network (CLIP-RPN) that leverages CLIP to automatically perceive
rain patterns by computing visual-language matching scores and adaptively
routing to sub-networks to handle different rain patterns, such as varying
raindrop densities, streak orientations, and rainfall intensity. CLIP-RPN
establishes semantic-aware rain pattern recognition through CLIP's cross-modal
visual-language alignment capabilities, enabling automatic identification of
precipitation characteristics across different rain scenarios. This rain
pattern awareness drives an adaptive subnetwork routing mechanism where
specialized processing branches are dynamically activated based on the detected
rain type, significantly enhancing the model's capacity to handle diverse
rainfall conditions. Furthermore, within sub-networks of CLIP-RPN, we introduce
a mask-guided cross-attention mechanism (MGCA) that predicts precise rain masks
at multi-scale to facilitate contextual interactions between rainy regions and
clean background areas by cross-attention. We also introduces a dynamic loss
scheduling mechanism (DLS) to adaptively adjust the gradients for the
optimization process of CLIP-RPN. Compared with the commonly used $l_1$ or
$l_2$ loss, DLS is more compatible with the inherent dynamics of the network
training process, thus achieving enhanced outcomes. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, particularly excelling
in complex mixed datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning-based food image classification enables precise identification
of food categories, further facilitating accurate nutritional analysis.
However, real-world food images often show a skewed distribution, with some
food types being more prevalent than others. This class imbalance can be
problematic, causing models to favor the majority (head) classes with overall
performance degradation for the less common (tail) classes. Recently, synthetic
data augmentation using diffusion-based generative models has emerged as a
promising solution to address this issue. By generating high-quality synthetic
images, these models can help uniformize the data distribution, potentially
improving classification performance. However, existing approaches face
challenges: fine-tuning-based methods need a uniformly distributed dataset,
while pre-trained model-based approaches often overlook inter-class separation
in synthetic data. In this paper, we propose a two-stage synthetic data
augmentation framework, leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for long-tailed
food classification. We generate a reference set conditioned by a positive
prompt on the generation target and then select a class that shares similar
features with the generation target as a negative prompt. Subsequently, we
generate a synthetic augmentation set using positive and negative prompt
conditions by a combined sampling strategy that promotes intra-class diversity
and inter-class separation. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method
on two long-tailed food benchmark datasets, achieving superior performance
compared to previous works in terms of top-1 accuracy.

Result: 该框架无需微调即可生成与文本提示中姿势准确对齐的图像。

Conclusion: PointT2I是首个利用LLM进行关键点引导图像生成的框架，仅依赖文本提示即可实现精确姿势对齐。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation model has made significant advancements,
resulting in high-quality images aligned with an input prompt. However, despite
T2I generation's ability to generate fine-grained images, it still faces
challenges in accurately generating images when the input prompt contains
complex concepts, especially human pose. In this paper, we propose PointT2I, a
framework that effectively generates images that accurately correspond to the
human pose described in the prompt by using a large language model (LLM).
PointT2I consists of three components: Keypoint generation, Image generation,
and Feedback system. The keypoint generation uses an LLM to directly generate
keypoints corresponding to a human pose, solely based on the input prompt,
without external references. Subsequently, the image generation produces images
based on both the text prompt and the generated keypoints to accurately reflect
the target pose. To refine the outputs of the preceding stages, we incorporate
an LLM-based feedback system that assesses the semantic consistency between the
generated contents and the given prompts. Our framework is the first approach
to leveraging LLM for keypoints-guided image generation without any
fine-tuning, producing accurate pose-aligned images based solely on textual
prompts.

DeepSeek-R1, which enhances reasoning in language models through rule-based
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose SVQA-R1, the first framework to extend
R1-style training to spatial VQA. In particular, we introduce Spatial-GRPO, a
novel group-wise RL strategy that constructs view-consistent rewards by
perturbing spatial relations between objects, e.g., mirror flipping, thereby
encouraging the model to develop a consistent and grounded understanding of
space. Our model, SVQA-R1, not only achieves dramatically improved accuracy on
spatial VQA benchmarks but also exhibits interpretable reasoning paths even
without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data. Extensive experiments and
visualization demonstrate the effectiveness of SVQA-R1 across multiple spatial
reasoning benchmarks.

TLDR: McByte是一个无需训练的多目标跟踪框架，通过结合时间传播的分割掩码作为关联线索，提升了跟踪的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体育分析中的多目标跟踪面临快速运动、遮挡和相机移动等挑战，传统方法需要大量调参或难以处理轨迹。

Method: McByte采用基于检测的跟踪框架，利用预训练模型和对象检测器，无需训练，通过时间传播的分割掩码改进关联。

Result: 在SportsMOT、DanceTrack、SoccerNet-tracking 2022和MOT17数据集上表现优异，适用于体育和行人跟踪。

Conclusion: McByte展示了掩码传播对提升多目标跟踪适应性和通用性的优势。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is essential for sports analytics, enabling
performance evaluation and tactical insights. However, tracking in sports is
challenging due to fast movements, occlusions, and camera shifts. Traditional
tracking-by-detection methods require extensive tuning, while
segmentation-based approaches struggle with track processing. We propose
McByte, a tracking-by-detection framework that integrates temporally propagated
segmentation mask as an association cue to improve robustness without per-video
tuning. Unlike many existing methods, McByte does not require training, relying
solely on pre-trained models and object detectors commonly used in the
community. Evaluated on SportsMOT, DanceTrack, SoccerNet-tracking 2022 and
MOT17, McByte demonstrates strong performance across sports and general
pedestrian tracking. Our results highlight the benefits of mask propagation for
a more adaptable and generalizable MOT approach. Code will be made available at

Conclusion: RadarSplat能有效生成高保真雷达数据并提升3D重建质量。

Abstract: High-Fidelity 3D scene reconstruction plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving by enabling novel data generation from existing datasets. This allows
simulating safety-critical scenarios and augmenting training datasets without
incurring further data collection costs. While recent advances in radiance
fields have demonstrated promising results in 3D reconstruction and sensor data
synthesis using cameras and LiDAR, their potential for radar remains largely
unexplored. Radar is crucial for autonomous driving due to its robustness in
adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow, where optical sensors
often struggle. Although the state-of-the-art radar-based neural representation
shows promise for 3D driving scene reconstruction, it performs poorly in
scenarios with significant radar noise, including receiver saturation and
multipath reflection. Moreover, it is limited to synthesizing preprocessed,
noise-excluded radar images, failing to address realistic radar data synthesis.
To address these limitations, this paper proposes RadarSplat, which integrates
Gaussian Splatting with novel radar noise modeling to enable realistic radar
data synthesis and enhanced 3D reconstruction. Compared to the
state-of-the-art, RadarSplat achieves superior radar image synthesis (+3.4 PSNR
/ 2.6x SSIM) and improved geometric reconstruction (-40% RMSE / 1.5x Accuracy),
demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-fidelity radar data and
scene reconstruction. A project page is available at

Conclusion: NFD通过技术创新解决了自回归视频生成的实时性问题，为交互式和流媒体应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video models offer distinct advantages over bidirectional
diffusion models in creating interactive video content and supporting streaming
applications with arbitrary duration. In this work, we present Next-Frame
Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates
block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient
inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless,
achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such
models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion
sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation.
To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency
distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models,
enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage
parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often
share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this
approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and
discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments
on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that
NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling
efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at
over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了主动立体系统的灵活性和便利性，适用于动态场景的3D形状测量。

Abstract: Active-stereo-based 3D shape measurement is crucial for various purposes,
such as industrial inspection, reverse engineering, and medical systems, due to
its strong ability to accurately acquire the shape of textureless objects.
Active stereo systems typically consist of a camera and a pattern projector,
tightly fixed to each other, and precise calibration between a camera and a
projector is required, which in turn decreases the usability of the system. If
a camera and a projector can be freely moved during shape scanning process, it
will drastically increase the convenience of the usability of the system. To
realize it, we propose a technique to recover the shape of the target object by
capturing multiple images while both the camera and the projector are in
motion, and their relative poses are auto-calibrated by our neural
signed-distance-field (NeuralSDF) using novel volumetric differential rendering
technique. In the experiment, the proposed method is evaluated by performing 3D
reconstruction using both synthetic and real images.

Result: 在四个PAR基准测试中表现优异，推理高效。

Conclusion: ViTA-PAR通过多模态提示和对齐技术显著提升了行人属性识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: The Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) task aims to identify various
detailed attributes of an individual, such as clothing, accessories, and
gender. To enhance PAR performance, a model must capture features ranging from
coarse-grained global attributes (e.g., for identifying gender) to fine-grained
local details (e.g., for recognizing accessories) that may appear in diverse
regions. Recent research suggests that body part representation can enhance the
model's robustness and accuracy, but these methods are often restricted to
attribute classes within fixed horizontal regions, leading to degraded
performance when attributes appear in varying or unexpected body locations. In
this paper, we propose Visual and Textual Attribute Alignment with Attribute
Prompting for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition, dubbed as ViTA-PAR, to enhance
attribute recognition through specialized multimodal prompting and
vision-language alignment. We introduce visual attribute prompts that capture
global-to-local semantics, enabling diverse attribute representations. To
enrich textual embeddings, we design a learnable prompt template, termed person
and attribute context prompting, to learn person and attributes context.
Finally, we align visual and textual attribute features for effective fusion.
ViTA-PAR is validated on four PAR benchmarks, achieving competitive performance
with efficient inference. We release our code and model at

<details>

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在遵循复杂指令时表现不佳，尤其是涉及多约束并行、链式和分支结构时。传统链式思维（CoT）因浅层推理而效果有限。

Method: 提出了一种基于强化学习（RL）的方法，通过分解复杂指令、设计可验证的奖励信号，并结合样本对比和行为克隆，提升模型的推理能力。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，1.5B参数的LLM性能提升11.74%，达到与8B参数模型相当的水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了LLMs处理复杂指令时的推理问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex
instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in
paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely
chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of
LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on
performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the
instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for
identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To
this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex
instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First,
we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing
taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we
exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals
to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the
shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via
sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior
cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking
LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive
benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM
achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Codes and data

Motivation: 传统扩散和RF方法在图像编辑中存在噪声累积和重建精度下降的问题，因此需要一种更高效的方法来减少误差。

Result: 实验证明DNAEdit在文本引导的图像编辑中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DNAEdit通过减少误差累积和引入速度引导，显著提升了图像编辑的准确性和可控性。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful generation capability of large-scale pretrained
text-to-image models, training-free methods have demonstrated impressive image
editing results. Conventional diffusion-based methods, as well as recent
rectified flow (RF)-based methods, typically reverse synthesis trajectories by
gradually adding noise to clean images, during which the noisy latent at the
current timestep is used to approximate that at the next timesteps, introducing
accumulated drift and degrading reconstruction accuracy. Considering the fact
that in RF the noisy latent is estimated through direct interpolation between
Gaussian noises and clean images at each timestep, we propose Direct Noise
Alignment (DNA), which directly refines the desired Gaussian noise in the noise
domain, significantly reducing the error accumulation in previous methods.
Specifically, DNA estimates the velocity field of the interpolated noised
latent at each timestep and adjusts the Gaussian noise by computing the
difference between the predicted and expected velocity field. We validate the
effectiveness of DNA and reveal its relationship with existing RF-based
inversion methods. Additionally, we introduce a Mobile Velocity Guidance (MVG)
to control the target prompt-guided generation process, balancing image
background preservation and target object editability. DNA and MVG collectively
constitute our proposed method, namely DNAEdit. Finally, we introduce
DNA-Bench, a long-prompt benchmark, to evaluate the performance of advanced
image editing models. Experimental results demonstrate that our DNAEdit
achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art text-guided editing methods.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖低层次视觉线索（如颜色、纹理）难以实现内容感知的颜色传播，而现有引入语义信息的方法常导致不自然的全局颜色变化。

Method: 从输入图像提取语义调色板，通过优化能量函数生成编辑后的调色板，并将局部编辑准确传播到语义相似区域。

Result: 实验证明该方法能高效且精确地实现像素级颜色编辑，确保颜色传播内容感知。

Conclusion: 该方法克服了传统方法的局限性，实现了更自然的颜色传播效果。

Abstract: Color propagation aims to extend local color edits to similar regions across
the input image. Conventional approaches often rely on low-level visual cues
such as color, texture, or lightness to measure pixel similarity, making it
difficult to achieve content-aware color propagation. While some recent
approaches attempt to introduce semantic information into color editing, but
often lead to unnatural, global color change in color adjustments. To overcome
these limitations, we present a semantic palette-guided approach for color
propagation. We first extract a semantic palette from an input image. Then, we
solve an edited palette by minimizing a well-designed energy function based on
user edits. Finally, local edits are accurately propagated to regions that
share similar semantics via the solved palette. Our approach enables efficient
yet accurate pixel-level color editing and ensures that local color changes are
propagated in a content-aware manner. Extensive experiments demonstrated the
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Sonar imaging is fundamental to underwater exploration, with critical
applications in defense, navigation, and marine research. Shadow regions, in
particular, provide essential cues for object detection and classification, yet
existing studies primarily focus on highlight-based analysis, leaving
shadow-based classification underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a

image processing techniques to extract and integrate discriminative shadow and
highlight features. Our framework introduces a novel shadow-specific classifier
and adaptive shadow segmentation, enabling effective classification based on
the dominant region. This approach ensures optimal feature representation,
improving robustness against noise and occlusions. In addition, we introduce a
Region-aware denoising model that enhances sonar image quality by preserving
critical structural details while suppressing noise. This model incorporates an
explainability-driven optimization strategy, ensuring that denoising is guided
by feature importance, thereby improving interpretability and classification
reliability. Furthermore, we present S3Simulator+, an extended dataset
incorporating naval mine scenarios with physics-informed noise specifically
tailored for the underwater sonar domain, fostering the development of robust
AI models. By combining novel classification strategies with an enhanced

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have revolutionized video generation,
enabling the creation of high-quality, temporally consistent videos. However,
generating high frame-rate (FPS) videos remains a significant challenge due to
issues such as flickering and degradation in long sequences, particularly in
fast-motion scenarios. Existing methods often suffer from computational
inefficiencies and limitations in maintaining video quality over extended

video generation using pre-trained diffusion models. Our method, DiffuseSlide,
introduces a new pipeline that leverages key frames from low FPS videos and
applies innovative techniques, including noise re-injection and sliding window
latent denoising, to achieve smooth, consistent video outputs without the need
for additional fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach significantly improves video quality, offering enhanced temporal
coherence and spatial fidelity. The proposed method is not only computationally
efficient but also adaptable to various video generation tasks, making it ideal
for applications such as virtual reality, video games, and high-quality content

Abstract: Video anomaly retrieval aims to localize anomalous events in videos using
natural language queries to facilitate public safety. However, existing
datasets suffer from severe limitations: (1) data scarcity due to the long-tail
nature of real-world anomalies, and (2) privacy constraints that impede
large-scale collection. To address the aforementioned issues in one go, we
introduce SVTA (Synthetic Video-Text Anomaly benchmark), the first large-scale
dataset for cross-modal anomaly retrieval, leveraging generative models to
overcome data availability challenges. Specifically, we collect and generate
video descriptions via the off-the-shelf LLM (Large Language Model) covering 68
anomaly categories, e.g., throwing, stealing, and shooting. These descriptions
encompass common long-tail events. We adopt these texts to guide the video
generative model to produce diverse and high-quality videos. Finally, our SVTA
involves 41,315 videos (1.36M frames) with paired captions, covering 30 normal
activities, e.g., standing, walking, and sports, and 68 anomalous events, e.g.,
falling, fighting, theft, explosions, and natural disasters. We adopt three
widely-used video-text retrieval baselines to comprehensively test our SVTA,
revealing SVTA's challenging nature and its effectiveness in evaluating a
robust cross-modal retrieval method. SVTA eliminates privacy risks associated
with real-world anomaly collection while maintaining realistic scenarios. The

Abstract: Accurately recognizing and assessing pain in sheep is key to discern animal
health and mitigating harmful situations. However, such accuracy is limited by
the ability to manage automatic monitoring of pain in those animals. Facial
expression scoring is a widely used and useful method to evaluate pain in both
humans and other living beings. Researchers also analyzed the facial
expressions of sheep to assess their health state and concluded that facial
landmark detection and pain level prediction are essential. For this purpose,
we propose a novel weighted graph neural network (WGNN) model to link sheep's
detected facial landmarks and define pain levels. Furthermore, we propose a new
sheep facial landmarks dataset that adheres to the parameters of the Sheep
Facial Expression Scale (SPFES). Currently, there is no comprehensive
performance benchmark that specifically evaluates the use of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on sheep facial landmark data to detect and measure pain
levels. The YOLOv8n detector architecture achieves a mean average precision
(mAP) of 59.30% with the sheep facial landmarks dataset, among seven other
detection models. The WGNN framework has an accuracy of 92.71% for tracking
multiple facial parts expressions with the YOLOv8n lightweight on-board device

Abstract: Accurate surgical phase recognition is crucial for computer-assisted
interventions and surgical video analysis. Annotating long surgical videos is
labor-intensive, driving research toward leveraging unlabeled data for strong
performance with minimal annotations. Although self-supervised learning has
gained popularity by enabling large-scale pretraining followed by fine-tuning
on small labeled subsets, semi-supervised approaches remain largely
underexplored in the surgical domain. In this work, we propose a video
transformer-based model with a robust pseudo-labeling framework. Our method
incorporates temporal consistency regularization for unlabeled data and
contrastive learning with class prototypes, which leverages both labeled data
and pseudo-labels to refine the feature space. Through extensive experiments on
the private RAMIE (Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy) dataset and
the public Cholec80 dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
By incorporating unlabeled data, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on
RAMIE with a 4.9% accuracy increase and obtain comparable results to full
supervision while using only 1/4 of the labeled data on Cholec80. Our findings
establish a strong benchmark for semi-supervised surgical phase recognition,
paving the way for future research in this domain.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了视觉理解和生成的协作共进，将MLLMs从文本到图像任务扩展到统一图像生成领域。

Abstract: Recent endeavors in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) aim to unify
visual comprehension and generation. However, these two capabilities remain
largely independent, as if they are two separate functions encapsulated within
the same model. Consequently, visual comprehension does not enhance visual
generation, and the reasoning mechanisms of LLMs have not been fully integrated
to revolutionize image generation. In this paper, we propose to enable the
collaborative co-evolution of visual comprehension and generation, advancing
image generation into an iterative introspective process. We introduce a
two-stage training approach: supervised fine-tuning teaches the MLLM with the
foundational ability to generate genuine CoT for visual generation, while
reinforcement learning activates its full potential via an
exploration-exploitation trade-off. Ultimately, we unlock the Aha moment in
visual generation, advancing MLLMs from text-to-image tasks to unified image
generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only excels in
text-to-image generation and image editing, but also functions as a superior
image semantic evaluator with enhanced visual comprehension capabilities.

TLDR: 提出FDSG框架，预测未来实体标签、边界框和关系，同时生成观察帧的场景图，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能显式建模时间动态或仅预测关系，限制了视频场景理解。

Method: 利用查询分解和神经随机微分方程建模实体和关系动态，通过跨注意力整合预测和观察信息。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上，FDSG在动态场景图生成、预测和前瞻任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FDSG通过显式建模时间动态，提升了视频场景理解的完整性和预测能力。

Abstract: Dynamic scene graph generation extends scene graph generation from images to
videos by modeling entity relationships and their temporal evolution. However,
existing methods either generate scene graphs from observed frames without
explicitly modeling temporal dynamics, or predict only relationships while
assuming static entity labels and locations. These limitations hinder effective
extrapolation of both entity and relationship dynamics, restricting video scene
understanding. We propose Forecasting Dynamic Scene Graphs (FDSG), a novel
framework that predicts future entity labels, bounding boxes, and
relationships, for unobserved frames, while also generating scene graphs for
observed frames. Our scene graph forecast module leverages query decomposition
and neural stochastic differential equations to model entity and relationship
dynamics. A temporal aggregation module further refines predictions by
integrating forecasted and observed information via cross-attention. To
benchmark FDSG, we introduce Scene Graph Forecasting, a new task for full
future scene graph prediction. Experiments on Action Genome show that FDSG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on dynamic scene graph generation, scene
graph anticipation, and scene graph forecasting. Codes will be released upon
publication.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为SCAD的文本到图像生成对抗网络，通过结合预训练模型和专用判别器，显著降低了训练成本并提升了生成多样性和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模GAN训练成本高，且现有方法在利用预训练模型时牺牲了生成多样性。

Method: 提出SCAD模型，采用两个专用判别器和切片对抗网络（SANs）来优化文本到图像任务。

Result: SCAD在显著降低训练成本的同时，提升了生成多样性和保真度，零样本FID与最新大规模GAN相当。

Conclusion: SCAD通过创新设计实现了高效且高质量的文本到图像生成，为相关研究和应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully
scaled to billion-scale large text-to-image datasets. However, training such
models entails a high training cost, limiting some applications and research
usage. To reduce the cost, one promising direction is the incorporation of
pre-trained models. The existing method of utilizing pre-trained models for a
generator significantly reduced the training cost compared with the other
large-scale GANs, but we found the model loses the diversity of generation for
a given prompt by a large margin. To build an efficient and high-fidelity
text-to-image GAN without compromise, we propose to use two specialized
discriminators with Slicing Adversarial Networks (SANs) adapted for
text-to-image tasks. Our proposed model, called SCAD, shows a notable
enhancement in diversity for a given prompt with better sample fidelity. We
also propose to use a metric called Per-Prompt Diversity (PPD) to evaluate the
diversity of text-to-image models quantitatively. SCAD achieved a zero-shot FID
competitive with the latest large-scale GANs at two orders of magnitude less
training cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型偏好对齐主要关注良性人类偏好（如审美），而对抗性偏好对齐涉及视觉一致性与攻击效果的冲突，导致优化不稳定。

Method: APA采用两阶段框架：第一阶段用LoRA微调提升视觉一致性；第二阶段基于替代分类器反馈优化图像潜在表示或提示嵌入。

Result: 实验表明APA显著提升了攻击迁移性，同时保持高视觉一致性。

Conclusion: APA为对抗性攻击研究提供了新的对齐视角，代码将开源。

Abstract: Preference alignment in diffusion models has primarily focused on benign
human preferences (e.g., aesthetic). In this paper, we propose a novel
perspective: framing unrestricted adversarial example generation as a problem
of aligning with adversary preferences. Unlike benign alignment, adversarial
alignment involves two inherently conflicting preferences: visual consistency
and attack effectiveness, which often lead to unstable optimization and reward
hacking (e.g., reducing visual quality to improve attack success). To address
this, we propose APA (Adversary Preferences Alignment), a two-stage framework
that decouples conflicting preferences and optimizes each with differentiable
rewards. In the first stage, APA fine-tunes LoRA to improve visual consistency
using rule-based similarity reward. In the second stage, APA updates either the
image latent or prompt embedding based on feedback from a substitute
classifier, guided by trajectory-level and step-wise rewards. To enhance
black-box transferability, we further incorporate a diffusion augmentation
strategy. Experiments demonstrate that APA achieves significantly better attack
transferability while maintaining high visual consistency, inspiring further
research to approach adversarial attacks from an alignment perspective. Code
will be available at https://github.com/deep-kaixun/APA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT模型在图像嵌入提取方面表现出色，但计算负担高，需要一种有效的加速方法。

Method: ATF通过令牌过滤模块和过滤策略动态选择重要令牌，减少输入到编码器的令牌数量，无需修改编码器。

Result: 在检索任务中，ATF将ViT模型SigLIP的速度提升了2.8倍，同时保持检索召回率。

Conclusion: ATF是一种高效且无需修改编码器的ViT加速方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) models have made breakthroughs in image embedding
extraction, which provide state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as
zero-shot image classification. However, the models suffer from a high
computational burden. In this paper, we propose a novel speed-up method for ViT
models called Attention-aware Token Filtering (ATF). ATF consists of two main
ideas: a novel token filtering module and a filtering strategy. The token
filtering module is introduced between a tokenizer and a transformer encoder of
the ViT model, without modifying or fine-tuning of the transformer encoder. The
module filters out tokens inputted to the encoder so that it keeps tokens in
regions of specific object types dynamically and keeps tokens in regions that
statically receive high attention in the transformer encoder. This filtering
strategy maintains task accuracy while filtering out tokens inputted to the
transformer encoder. Evaluation results on retrieval tasks show that ATF
provides $2.8\times$ speed-up to a ViT model, SigLIP, while maintaining the
retrieval recall rate.

Conclusion: 连续变量处理种族标签能更准确地反映数据平衡，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Bias has been a constant in face recognition models. Over the years,
researchers have looked at it from both the model and the data point of view.
However, their approach to mitigation of data bias was limited and lacked
insight on the real nature of the problem. Here, in this document, we propose
to revise our use of ethnicity labels as a continuous variable instead of a
discrete value per identity. We validate our formulation both experimentally
and theoretically, showcasing that not all identities from one ethnicity
contribute equally to the balance of the dataset; thus, having the same number
of identities per ethnicity does not represent a balanced dataset. We further
show that models trained on datasets balanced in the continuous space
consistently outperform models trained on data balanced in the discrete space.
We trained more than 65 different models, and created more than 20 subsets of
the original datasets.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of utilizing a large-scale text-to-image
diffusion model to tackle the challenging Inexact Segmentation (IS) task.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely heavily on discriminative-model-based
paradigms or dense visual representations derived from internal attention
mechanisms, our method focuses on the intrinsic generative priors in Stable
Diffusion~(SD). Specifically, we exploit the pattern discrepancies between
original images and mask-conditional generated images to facilitate a
coarse-to-fine segmentation refinement by establishing a semantic
correspondence alignment and updating the foreground probability. Comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness and
superiority of our plug-and-play design, underscoring the potential of
leveraging generation discrepancies to model dense representations and
encouraging further exploration of generative approaches for solving
discriminative tasks.

Motivation: 当前驾驶世界模型在长时预测中存在误差累积问题，且现有基于DiT的模型因训练与推理差距难以生成一致的长视频。

Method: 分层解耦为大幅运动学习和双向连续运动学习，并通过自监督蒸馏方法提升视频流的连贯性。

Result: 在NuScenes基准测试中，FVD提升27%，推理时间减少85%，能生成110+帧的连贯视频。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长时视频生成的连贯性问题，显著提升了性能与效率。

Abstract: Driving world models are used to simulate futures by video generation based
on the condition of the current state and actions. However, current models
often suffer serious error accumulations when predicting the long-term future,
which limits the practical application. Recent studies utilize the Diffusion
Transformer (DiT) as the backbone of driving world models to improve learning
flexibility. However, these models are always trained on short video clips
(high fps and short duration), and multiple roll-out generations struggle to
produce consistent and reasonable long videos due to the training-inference
gap. To this end, we propose several solutions to build a simple yet effective
long-term driving world model. First, we hierarchically decouple world model
learning into large motion learning and bidirectional continuous motion
learning. Then, considering the continuity of driving scenes, we propose a
simple distillation method where fine-grained video flows are self-supervised
signals for coarse-grained flows. The distillation is designed to improve the
coherence of infinite video generation. The coarse-grained and fine-grained
modules are coordinated to generate long-term and temporally coherent videos.
In the public benchmark NuScenes, compared with the state-of-the-art front-view
model, our model improves FVD by $27\%$ and reduces inference time by $85\%$
for the video task of generating 110+ frames. More videos (including 90s
duration) are available at https://Wang-Xiaodong1899.github.io/longdwm/.

Motivation: 解决现有方法中直接输入输出映射导致的推理困难与决策不可解释问题。

Method: 分两阶段：1）形式化CoT监督微调；2）自反思后训练，利用自身推理输出增强监督多样性。

Result: 在VLN基准测试中表现优于现有LLM方法。

Conclusion: EvolveNav通过自改进框架显著提升了导航推理能力与解释性。

Abstract: Building Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents which can navigate following
natural language instructions is a long-standing goal in human-robot
interaction applications. Recent studies have revealed the potential of
training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning
ability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap
between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches
primarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping
learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable.
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational
decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation
task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting
through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel
sElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based
vision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two
stages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model
with formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning
capabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective
Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning
outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A
self-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct
reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results on the
popular VLN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EvolveNav over previous
LLM-based VLN approaches. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决现有双模态方法因缺乏第三模态和现有三模态方法在时空一致性上的不足导致的目标偏移问题。

Method: 提出SAM2-LOVE框架，包含多模态融合模块、令牌传播和累积策略，以增强多模态理解和时空一致性。

Result: 在Ref-AVS基准测试中，SAM2-LOVE比SOTA方法性能提升8.5%。

Conclusion: SAM2-LOVE框架简单有效，显著提升了多模态场景下的像素级分割性能。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to provide a pixel-wise
scene understanding in Language-aided Audio-Visual Scenes (LAVS). This task
requires the model to continuously segment objects referred to by text and
audio from a video. Previous dual-modality methods always fail due to the lack
of a third modality and the existing triple-modality method struggles with
spatio-temporal consistency, leading to the target shift of different frames.
In this work, we introduce a novel framework, termed SAM2-LOVE, which
integrates textual, audio, and visual representations into a learnable token to
prompt and align SAM2 for achieving Ref-AVS in the LAVS. Technically, our
approach includes a multimodal fusion module aimed at improving multimodal
understanding of SAM2, as well as token propagation and accumulation strategies
designed to enhance spatio-temporal consistency without forgetting historical
information. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate that SAM2-LOVE
outperforms the SOTA by 8.5\% in $\mathcal{J\&F}$ on the Ref-AVS benchmark and
showcase the simplicity and effectiveness of the components. Our code will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在人类-物体交互中常忽略场景上下文，导致不合理的穿透，而人类-场景交互方法难以协调精细操作与长距离导航。

Method: HOSIG框架包含三个关键组件：场景感知抓取姿势生成器、启发式导航算法和场景引导运动扩散模型。

Result: 在TRUMANS数据集上的实验表明，HOSIG优于现有方法，支持无限运动长度且需最少人工干预。

Conclusion: HOSIG填补了场景感知导航与灵巧物体操作之间的关键空白，推动了交互合成的前沿。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity full-body human interactions with dynamic objects
and static scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and
animation. Existing methods for human-object interaction often neglect scene
context, leading to implausible penetrations, while human-scene interaction
approaches struggle to coordinate fine-grained manipulations with long-range
navigation. To address these limitations, we propose HOSIG, a novel framework
for synthesizing full-body interactions through hierarchical scene perception.
Our method decouples the task into three key components: 1) a scene-aware grasp
pose generator that ensures collision-free whole-body postures with precise
hand-object contact by integrating local geometry constraints, 2) a heuristic
navigation algorithm that autonomously plans obstacle-avoiding paths in complex
indoor environments via compressed 2D floor maps and dual-component spatial
reasoning, and 3) a scene-guided motion diffusion model that generates
trajectory-controlled, full-body motions with finger-level accuracy by
incorporating spatial anchors and dual-space classifier-free guidance.
Extensive experiments on the TRUMANS dataset demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our framework supports unlimited motion
length through autoregressive generation and requires minimal manual
intervention. This work bridges the critical gap between scene-aware navigation
and dexterous object manipulation, advancing the frontier of embodied
interaction synthesis. Codes will be available after publication. Project page:

Conclusion: MDW为多模态模型训练提供了一种高效、抗噪的数据蒸馏解决方案，适用于多样化需求的应用场景。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal models have shown remarkable versatility in real-world
applications. However, their rapid development encounters two critical data
challenges. First, the training process requires large-scale datasets, leading
to substantial storage and computational costs. Second, these data are
typically web-crawled with inevitable noise, i.e., partially mismatched pairs,
severely degrading model performance. To these ends, we propose Multi-modal
dataset Distillation in the Wild, i.e., MDW, the first framework to distill
noisy multi-modal datasets into compact clean ones for effective and efficient
model training. Specifically, MDW introduces learnable fine-grained
correspondences during distillation and adaptively optimizes distilled data to
emphasize correspondence-discriminative regions, thereby enhancing distilled
data's information density and efficacy. Moreover, to capture robust
cross-modal correspondence prior knowledge from real data, MDW proposes
dual-track collaborative learning to avoid the risky data noise, alleviating
information loss with certifiable noise tolerance. Extensive experiments
validate MDW's theoretical and empirical efficacy with remarkable scalability,
surpassing prior methods by over 15% across various compression ratios,
highlighting its appealing practicality for applications with diverse efficacy
and resource needs.

Abstract: Understanding behavior requires datasets that capture humans while carrying
out complex tasks. The kitchen is an excellent environment for assessing human
motor and cognitive function, as many complex actions are naturally exhibited
in kitchens from chopping to cleaning. Here, we introduce the
EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset, collected in a noninvasive motion capture
platform inside a kitchen environment. Nine static RGB-D cameras, inertial
measurement units (IMUs) and one head-mounted HoloLens~2 headset were used to
capture 3D hand, body, and eye movements. The EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset is
a multi-view action dataset with synchronized exocentric, egocentric, depth,
IMUs, eye gaze, body and hand kinematics spanning 29.7 hours of 16 subjects
cooking four different recipes. Action sequences were densely annotated with
33.78 action segments per minute. Leveraging this multi-modal dataset, we
propose four benchmarks to advance behavior understanding and modeling through
1) a vision-language benchmark, 2) a semantic text-to-motion generation
benchmark, 3) a multi-modal action recognition benchmark, 4) a pose-based
action segmentation benchmark. We expect the EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset to
pave the way for better methods as well as insights to understand the nature of

Motivation: 现有CAM方法依赖全连接层作为分类器，无法直接用于缺乏全连接层的度量学习模型。

Method: 提出SFAM方法，通过通道贡献重要性分数（CIS）衡量特征重要性，并基于CNN特征图构建解释图。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，SFAM能为使用欧氏距离或余弦相似度的CNN模型提供高解释性的视觉解释。

Conclusion: SFAM是一种有效的视觉解释方法，适用于度量学习模型。

Abstract: Visual explanation maps enhance the trustworthiness of decisions made by deep
learning models and offer valuable guidance for developing new algorithms in
image recognition tasks. Class activation maps (CAM) and their variants (e.g.,
Grad-CAM and Relevance-CAM) have been extensively employed to explore the
interpretability of softmax-based convolutional neural networks, which require
a fully connected layer as the classifier for decision-making. However, these
methods cannot be directly applied to metric learning models, as such models
lack a fully connected layer functioning as a classifier. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel visual explanation method termed Similar Feature
Activation Map (SFAM). This method introduces the channel-wise contribution
importance score (CIS) to measure feature importance, derived from the
similarity measurement between two image embeddings. The explanation map is
constructed by linearly combining the proposed importance weights with the
feature map from a CNN model. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show
that SFAM provides highly promising interpretable visual explanations for CNN
models using Euclidean distance or cosine similarity as the similarity metric.

high-resolution images accurately, where fine-grained details are crucial for
complex visual understanding. We introduce Zoom-Refine, a novel training-free
method that enhances MLLM capabilities to address this issue. Zoom-Refine
operates through a synergistic process of \textit{Localized Zoom} and
\textit{Self-Refinement}. In the \textit{Localized Zoom} step, Zoom-Refine
leverages the MLLM to provide a preliminary response to an input query and
identifies the most task-relevant image region by predicting its bounding box
coordinates. During the \textit{Self-Refinement} step, Zoom-Refine then
integrates fine-grained details from the high-resolution crop (identified by
\textit{Localized Zoom}) with its initial reasoning to re-evaluate and refine
its preliminary response. Our method harnesses the MLLM's inherent capabilities
for spatial localization, contextual reasoning and comparative analysis without
requiring additional training or external experts. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of Zoom-Refine on two challenging high-resolution
multimodal benchmarks. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型在地球观测数据理解上表现不足，而这类数据对环境监测至关重要。

Method: 提出Spatial Attention Prompting（SAP）和Cross-modal Fusion，并建立EarthMind-Bench基准。

Result: EarthMind在EarthMind-Bench上表现优异，超越GPT-4o，并在多个公共基准上领先。

Conclusion: EarthMind展示了统一框架处理多粒度和多传感器挑战的潜力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
various vision-language tasks. However, they often struggle to comprehensively
understand Earth Observation (EO) data, which is critical for monitoring the
environment and the effects of human activity on it. In this work, we present
EarthMind, a novel vision-language framework for multi-granular and
multi-sensor EO data understanding. EarthMind features two core components: (1)
Spatial Attention Prompting (SAP), which reallocates attention within the LLM
to enhance pixel-level understanding; and (2) Cross-modal Fusion, which aligns
heterogeneous modalities into a shared space and adaptively reweighs tokens
based on their information density for effective fusion. To facilitate
multi-sensor fusion evaluation, we propose EarthMind-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark with over 2,000 human-annotated multi-sensor image-question pairs,
covering a wide range of perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of EarthMind. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on EarthMind-Bench, surpassing GPT-4o despite being only 4B in
scale. Moreover, EarthMind outperforms existing methods on multiple public EO
benchmarks, showcasing its potential to handle both multi-granular and
multi-sensor challenges in a unified framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前 MLLMs 在细粒度视频运动理解中存在局限，如缺乏帧间差异分析和忽略细微视觉线索，且视觉提示在视频中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出 MotionSight，利用物体中心视觉聚焦和运动模糊作为视觉提示，无需训练即可提升运动理解能力；并构建 MotionVid-QA 数据集。

Result: MotionSight 在开源模型中达到最先进水平，与商业模型竞争；数据集包含 40K 视频片段和 87K 问答对。

Conclusion: MotionSight 和 MotionVid-QA 为细粒度视频运动理解提供了新方法和高质量数据资源，代码和标注将公开。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their
proficiency in fine-grained video motion understanding remains critically
limited. They often lack inter-frame differencing and tend to average or ignore
subtle visual cues. Furthermore, while visual prompting has shown potential in
static images, its application to video's temporal complexities, particularly
for fine-grained motion understanding, remains largely unexplored. We
investigate whether inherent capability can be unlocked and boost MLLMs' motion
perception and enable distinct visual signatures tailored to decouple object
and camera motion cues. In this study, we introduce MotionSight, a novel
zero-shot method pioneering object-centric visual spotlight and motion blur as
visual prompts to effectively improve fine-grained motion understanding without
training. To convert this into valuable data assets, we curated MotionVid-QA,
the first large-scale dataset for fine-grained video motion understanding, with
hierarchical annotations including SFT and preference data, {\Theta}(40K) video
clips and {\Theta}(87K) QAs. Experiments show MotionSight achieves
state-of-the-art open-source performance and competitiveness with commercial
models. In particular, for fine-grained motion understanding we present a novel
zero-shot technique and a large-scale, high-quality dataset. All the code and
annotations will be publicly available.

Method: 提出SteerPose神经网络，通过旋转2D姿态到另一视角，结合可微分匹配，实现相机外参校准和对应点搜索的统一框架，并引入几何一致性损失确保有效性。

Result: 在多样化的野外数据集中验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，并展示了利用现成2D姿态估计器和类无关模型重建新动物3D姿态的能力。

Conclusion: SteerPose为多相机系统提供了一种统一的校准和对应点搜索方法，适用于人类和动物的3D姿态重建。

Abstract: Can freely moving humans or animals themselves serve as calibration targets
for multi-camera systems while simultaneously estimating their correspondences
across views? We humans can solve this problem by mentally rotating the
observed 2D poses and aligning them with those in the target views. Inspired by
this cognitive ability, we propose SteerPose, a neural network that performs
this rotation of 2D poses into another view. By integrating differentiable
matching, SteerPose simultaneously performs extrinsic camera calibration and
correspondence search within a single unified framework. We also introduce a
novel geometric consistency loss that explicitly ensures that the estimated
rotation and correspondences result in a valid translation estimation.
Experimental results on diverse in-the-wild datasets of humans and animals
validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our method can reconstruct the 3D poses of novel animals in
multi-camera setups by leveraging off-the-shelf 2D pose estimators and our
class-agnostic model.

TLDR: InfoMax是一种新颖的数据修剪方法，通过最大化样本信息内容和最小化冗余来提升核心集的信息量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决数据修剪中信息量和冗余的平衡问题，以提升模型学习效率。

Method: 通过重要性评分衡量样本信息，利用样本相似性量化冗余，将问题形式化为离散二次规划任务，并引入高效的梯度求解器。

Result: 实验表明InfoMax在图像分类、视觉语言预训练和大语言模型指令调优等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: InfoMax是一种高效且可扩展的数据修剪方法，适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: In this paper, we present InfoMax, a novel data pruning method, also known as
coreset selection, designed to maximize the information content of selected
samples while minimizing redundancy. By doing so, InfoMax enhances the overall
informativeness of the coreset. The information of individual samples is
measured by importance scores, which capture their influence or difficulty in
model learning. To quantify redundancy, we use pairwise sample similarities,
based on the premise that similar samples contribute similarly to the learning
process. We formalize the coreset selection problem as a discrete quadratic
programming (DQP) task, with the objective of maximizing the total information
content, represented as the sum of individual sample contributions minus the
redundancies introduced by similar samples within the coreset. To ensure
practical scalability, we introduce an efficient gradient-based solver,
complemented by sparsification techniques applied to the similarity matrix and
dataset partitioning strategies. This enables InfoMax to seamlessly scale to
datasets with millions of samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of InfoMax in various data pruning tasks, including image
classification, vision-language pre-training, and instruction tuning for large
language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少标注成本并提升主动学习效果，利用公开数据和VLM的预训练能力。

Method: 结合公开数据检索任务相关示例，对比LP、FT、PT和CT等适应方法，并提出TFS策略。

Result: CT表现最优，结合检索数据和TFS策略显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ALOR方法通过公开数据和TFS策略显著提升主动学习效果，CT是最佳适应方法。

Abstract: Pretrained on web-scale open data, VLMs offer powerful capabilities for
solving downstream tasks after being adapted to task-specific labeled data.
Yet, data labeling can be expensive and may demand domain expertise. Active
Learning (AL) aims to reduce this expense by strategically selecting the most
informative data for labeling and model training. Recent AL methods have
explored VLMs but have not leveraged publicly available open data, such as
VLM's pretraining data. In this work, we leverage such data by retrieving
task-relevant examples to augment the task-specific examples. As expected,
incorporating them significantly improves AL. Given that our method exploits
open-source VLM and open data, we refer to it as Active Learning with Open
Resources (ALOR). Additionally, most VLM-based AL methods use prompt tuning
(PT) for model adaptation, likely due to its ability to directly utilize
pretrained parameters and the assumption that doing so reduces the risk of
overfitting to limited labeled data. We rigorously compare popular adaptation
approaches, including linear probing (LP), finetuning (FT), and contrastive
tuning (CT). We reveal two key findings: (1) All adaptation approaches benefit
from incorporating retrieved data, and (2) CT resoundingly outperforms other
approaches across AL methods. Further analysis of retrieved data reveals a
naturally imbalanced distribution of task-relevant classes, exposing inherent
biases within the VLM. This motivates our novel Tail First Sampling (TFS)
strategy for AL, an embarrassingly simple yet effective method that prioritizes
sampling data from underrepresented classes to label. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our final method, contrastively finetuning VLM on both
retrieved and TFS-selected labeled data, significantly outperforms existing
methods.

TLDR: 论文首次系统研究了基于GRPO的强化学习后训练方法，用于提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频字幕生成中的动作描述能力，提出了VideoCap-R1模型，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视频字幕生成领域尚未充分探索，尤其是动作描述的准确性不足。

Method: 开发了VideoCap-R1模型，采用结构化思维分析视频主题及其属性与动作，并设计两种奖励机制（LLM-free思维评分器和LLM辅助字幕评分器）来优化生成质量。

Result: 实验表明，VideoCap-R1在多个视频字幕基准测试中显著优于基线模型（Qwen2VL-7B）和SFT训练模型，动作和对象描述的F1分数均有提升。

Conclusion: GRPO强化学习方法能有效提升MLLMs的视频字幕生成能力，尤其是在动作描述的准确性方面。

Abstract: While recent advances in reinforcement learning have significantly enhanced
reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), these techniques remain
underexplored in multi-modal LLMs for video captioning. This paper presents the
first systematic investigation of GRPO-based RL post-training for video MLLMs,
with the goal of enhancing video MLLMs' capability of describing actions in
videos. Specifically, we develop the VideoCap-R1, which is prompted to first
perform structured thinking that analyzes video subjects with their attributes
and actions before generating complete captions, supported by two specialized
reward mechanisms: a LLM-free think scorer evaluating the structured thinking
quality and a LLM-assisted caption scorer assessing the output quality. The RL
training framework effectively establishes the connection between structured
reasoning and comprehensive description generation, enabling the model to
produce captions with more accurate actions. Our experiments demonstrate that
VideoCap-R1 achieves substantial improvements over the Qwen2VL-7B baseline
using limited samples (1.5k) across multiple video caption benchmarks (DREAM1K:
+4.4 event F1, VDC: +4.2 Acc, CAREBENCH: +3.1 action F1, +6.9 object F1) while
consistently outperforming the SFT-trained counterparts, confirming GRPO's
superiority in enhancing MLLMs' captioning capabilities.

Result: 实验证明了该框架的有效性，并提供了更好的微调策略。

Conclusion: STORM为MLLMs在视觉评分任务中的研究提供了数据集、基准和预训练模型支持。

Abstract: Visual rating is an essential capability of artificial intelligence (AI) for
multi-dimensional quantification of visual content, primarily applied in
ordinal regression (OR) tasks such as image quality assessment, facial age
estimation, and medical image grading. However, current multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) under-perform in such visual rating ability while also
suffering the lack of relevant datasets and benchmarks. In this work, we
collect and present STORM, a data collection and benchmark for Stimulating
Trustworthy Ordinal Regression Ability of MLLMs for universal visual rating.
STORM encompasses 14 ordinal regression datasets across five common visual
rating domains, comprising 655K image-level pairs and the corresponding
carefully curated VQAs. Importantly, we also propose a coarse-to-fine
processing pipeline that dynamically considers label candidates and provides
interpretable thoughts, providing MLLMs with a general and trustworthy ordinal
thinking paradigm. This benchmark aims to evaluate the all-in-one and zero-shot
performance of MLLMs in scenarios requiring understanding of the essential
common ordinal relationships of rating labels. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and shed light on better
fine-tuning strategies. The STORM dataset, benchmark, and pre-trained models
are available on the following webpage to support further research in this
area. Datasets and codes are released on the project page:

Motivation: 可穿戴XR设备的普及为Egocentric Action Recognition（EAR）系统提供了新机会，但实时算法部署面临便携性、电池寿命和计算资源之间的权衡挑战。

Method: 系统分析RGB视频和3D手部姿态在不同采样频率下对EAR性能和CPU使用的影响，探索多种配置。

Result: 降低RGB帧采样率并辅以高频率3D手部姿态输入，可实现CPU使用降低3倍，同时保持高识别准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态输入策略是实现XR设备上高效实时EAR的可行方法。

Abstract: The increasing availability of wearable XR devices opens new perspectives for
Egocentric Action Recognition (EAR) systems, which can provide deeper human
understanding and situation awareness. However, deploying real-time algorithms
on these devices can be challenging due to the inherent trade-offs between
portability, battery life, and computational resources. In this work, we
systematically analyze the impact of sampling frequency across different input
modalities - RGB video and 3D hand pose - on egocentric action recognition
performance and CPU usage. By exploring a range of configurations, we provide a
comprehensive characterization of the trade-offs between accuracy and
computational efficiency. Our findings reveal that reducing the sampling rate
of RGB frames, when complemented with higher-frequency 3D hand pose input, can
preserve high accuracy while significantly lowering CPU demands. Notably, we
observe up to a 3x reduction in CPU usage with minimal to no loss in
recognition performance. This highlights the potential of multimodal input
strategies as a viable approach to achieving efficient, real-time EAR on XR
devices.

Motivation: 现有方法多为单一任务训练，且高质量标注数据成本高昂，需一种统一且高效的多任务解决方案。

Method: 设计轻量级适配器统一不同任务条件，采用联合图像-视频学习策略，并引入深度图作为3D感知辅助。

Result: 训练出8B和2B两种规模的模型，支持10+任务，8B模型在视频生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了多任务视觉生成与操作的性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in many visual generation
and manipulation tasks. Many existing methods focus on training a model for a
specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other
works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V),
video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However,
training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality
annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can
perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified
framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data
from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single
model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter
to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint
image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch.
Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model
with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth
maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual
generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes
(8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In
particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video
generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines. Our
models and source codes are available at https://github.com/leeruibin/MfM.git.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分割复杂真实世界对象时表现有限，无法处理拥挤图像。

Method: unMORE通过两阶段流程，先学习对象中心表示，再利用网络无关的多对象推理模块发现多个对象。

Result: 在6个真实世界数据集（包括COCO）上取得最优分割结果，尤其在拥挤图像中表现突出。

Conclusion: unMORE为无监督多目标分割提供了高效解决方案，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: We study the challenging problem of unsupervised multi-object segmentation on
single images. Existing methods, which rely on image reconstruction objectives
to learn objectness or leverage pretrained image features to group similar
pixels, often succeed only in segmenting simple synthetic objects or
discovering a limited number of real-world objects. In this paper, we introduce
unMORE, a novel two-stage pipeline designed to identify many complex objects in
real-world images. The key to our approach involves explicitly learning three
levels of carefully defined object-centric representations in the first stage.
Subsequently, our multi-object reasoning module utilizes these learned object
priors to discover multiple objects in the second stage. Notably, this
reasoning module is entirely network-free and does not require human labels.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that unMORE significantly outperforms all
existing unsupervised methods across 6 real-world benchmark datasets, including
the challenging COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art object segmentation
results. Remarkably, our method excels in crowded images where all baselines
collapse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FAS依赖单一视觉模态，泛化能力有限；多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的突破为结合视觉与语言推理提供了可能。

Method: 构建FaceCoT数据集（含14种攻击类型的高质量VQA标注），开发强化学习优化的标注模型，并提出CEPL策略。

Result: 实验表明，基于FaceCoT和CEPL的模型在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FaceCoT和CEPL为FAS任务提供了更鲁棒和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) typically depends on a single visual modality when
defending against presentation attacks such as print attacks, screen replays,
and 3D masks, resulting in limited generalization across devices, environments,
and attack types. Meanwhile, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
recently achieved breakthroughs in image-text understanding and semantic
reasoning, suggesting that integrating visual and linguistic co-inference into
FAS can substantially improve both robustness and interpretability. However,
the lack of a high-quality vision-language multimodal dataset has been a
critical bottleneck. To address this, we introduce FaceCoT (Face
Chain-of-Thought), the first large-scale Visual Question Answering (VQA)
dataset tailored for FAS. FaceCoT covers 14 spoofing attack types and enriches
model learning with high-quality CoT VQA annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a
caption model refined via reinforcement learning to expand the dataset and
enhance annotation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a CoT-Enhanced
Progressive Learning (CEPL) strategy to better leverage the CoT data and boost
model performance on FAS tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained with FaceCoT and CEPL outperform state-of-the-art methods on multiple
benchmark datasets.

Result: R2SM数据集支持模型在用户意图驱动的分割任务中进行微调和评估。

Conclusion: R2SM任务为多模态推理和意图感知分割研究提供了挑战性的测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce a new task, Referring and Reasoning for Selective Masks (R2SM),
which extends text-guided segmentation by incorporating mask-type selection
driven by user intent. This task challenges vision-language models to determine
whether to generate a modal (visible) or amodal (complete) segmentation mask
based solely on natural language prompts. To support the R2SM task, we present
the R2SM dataset, constructed by augmenting annotations of COCOA-cls, D2SA, and
MUVA. The R2SM dataset consists of both modal and amodal text queries, each
paired with the corresponding ground-truth mask, enabling model finetuning and
evaluation for the ability to segment images as per user intent. Specifically,
the task requires the model to interpret whether a given prompt refers to only
the visible part of an object or to its complete shape, including occluded
regions, and then produce the appropriate segmentation. For example, if a
prompt explicitly requests the whole shape of a partially hidden object, the
model is expected to output an amodal mask that completes the occluded parts.
In contrast, prompts without explicit mention of hidden regions should generate
standard modal masks. The R2SM benchmark provides a challenging and insightful
testbed for advancing research in multimodal reasoning and intent-aware
segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成3D场景时，视角变化会导致噪声和失真，限制了场景的探索性。WorldExplorer旨在解决这一问题，实现高质量、稳定的3D场景生成。

Method: 通过多视角一致的360度全景图初始化场景，利用视频扩散模型迭代生成沿预定义轨迹的视频，结合场景记忆和碰撞检测机制，最终通过3D高斯泼溅优化融合所有视图。

Result: WorldExplorer生成的3D场景在相机大范围运动下保持稳定，首次实现了真实且无限制的探索。

Conclusion: WorldExplorer为生成沉浸式、可探索的虚拟3D环境迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Generating 3D worlds from text is a highly anticipated goal in computer
vision. Existing works are limited by the degree of exploration they allow
inside of a scene, i.e., produce streched-out and noisy artifacts when moving
beyond central or panoramic perspectives. To this end, we propose
WorldExplorer, a novel method based on autoregressive video trajectory
generation, which builds fully navigable 3D scenes with consistent visual
quality across a wide range of viewpoints. We initialize our scenes by creating
multi-view consistent images corresponding to a 360 degree panorama. Then, we
expand it by leveraging video diffusion models in an iterative scene generation
pipeline. Concretely, we generate multiple videos along short, pre-defined
trajectories, that explore the scene in depth, including motion around objects.
Our novel scene memory conditions each video on the most relevant prior views,
while a collision-detection mechanism prevents degenerate results, like moving
into objects. Finally, we fuse all generated views into a unified 3D
representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization. Compared to prior
approaches, WorldExplorer produces high-quality scenes that remain stable under
large camera motion, enabling for the first time realistic and unrestricted
exploration. We believe this marks a significant step toward generating
immersive and truly explorable virtual 3D environments.

animation, and controllable character video synthesis. We explore a unified
dynamic content manipulation injection module, which effectively integrates the
requirements of the above tasks. In addition, we design a visual-text
instruction module based on LLaVA, enabling the model to effectively understand
the correspondence between visual content and instructions. Furthermore, we
build a comprehensive multi-task data processing system. Since there is data
overlap among various tasks, this system can efficiently provide data
augmentation. Using this system, we construct a multi-type, multi-scenario
OmniV2V dataset and its corresponding OmniV2V-Test benchmark. Extensive
experiments show that OmniV2V works as well as, and sometimes better than, the
best existing open-source and commercial models for many video generation and
editing tasks.

Abstract: Learning an animatable and clothed human avatar model with vivid dynamics and
photorealistic appearance from multi-view videos is an important foundational
research problem in computer graphics and vision. Fueled by recent advances in
implicit representations, the quality of the animatable avatars has achieved an
unprecedented level by attaching the implicit representation to drivable human
template meshes. However, they usually fail to preserve the highest level of
detail, particularly apparent when the virtual camera is zoomed in and when
rendering at 4K resolution and higher. We argue that this limitation stems from
inaccurate surface tracking, specifically, depth misalignment and surface drift
between character geometry and the ground truth surface, which forces the
detailed appearance model to compensate for geometric errors. To address this,
we propose a latent deformation model and supervising the 3D deformation of the
animatable character using guidance from foundational 2D video point trackers,
which offer improved robustness to shading and surface variations, and are less
prone to local minima than differentiable rendering. To mitigate the drift over
time and lack of 3D awareness of 2D point trackers, we introduce a cascaded
training strategy that generates consistent 3D point tracks by anchoring point
tracks to the rendered avatar, which ultimately supervises our avatar at the
vertex and texel level. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising five multi-view video sequences, each over
10 minutes in duration, captured using 40 calibrated 6K-resolution cameras,
featuring subjects dressed in clothing with challenging texture patterns and
wrinkle deformations. Our approach demonstrates significantly improved
performance in rendering quality and geometric accuracy over the prior state of
the art.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了无接触指纹匹配的准确性和鲁棒性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The increasing demand for hygienic and portable biometric systems has
underscored the critical need for advancements in contactless fingerprint
recognition. Despite its potential, this technology faces notable challenges,
including out-of-focus image acquisition, reduced contrast between fingerprint
ridges and valleys, variations in finger positioning, and perspective
distortion. These factors significantly hinder the accuracy and reliability of
contactless fingerprint matching. To address these issues, we propose a novel
multi-stage transformer-based contactless fingerprint matching approach that
first captures global spatial features and subsequently refines localized
feature alignment across fingerprint samples. By employing a hierarchical
feature extraction and matching pipeline, our method ensures fine-grained,
cross-sample alignment while maintaining the robustness of global feature
representation. We perform extensive evaluations on publicly available datasets
such as HKPolyU and RidgeBase under different evaluation protocols, such as
contactless-to-contact matching and contactless-to-contactless matching and
demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods, including
COTS solutions.

TLDR: MoDA（Modulation Adapter）是一种轻量级模块，通过指令引导的调制优化预对齐的视觉特征，提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂场景中的细粒度视觉概念理解能力。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景中难以准确理解细粒度视觉概念，MoDA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1）通过冻结视觉编码器和适配层对齐图像特征；2）在指令调整阶段使用MoDA适配器细化特征，利用Transformer交叉注意力生成调制掩码。

Result: 实验表明，MoDA提升了视觉定位能力，并生成更符合上下文的响应。

Conclusion: MoDA是一种有效的通用增强模块，适用于基于图像的MLLMs。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on instruction-following tasks by integrating pretrained
visual encoders with large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches
often struggle to ground fine-grained visual concepts in complex scenes. In
this paper, we propose MoDA (Modulation Adapter), a lightweight yet effective
module designed to refine pre-aligned visual features through
instruction-guided modulation. Our approach follows the standard LLaVA training
protocol, consisting of a two-stage process: (1) aligning image features to the
LLMs input space via a frozen vision encoder and adapter layers, and (2)
refining those features using the MoDA adapter during the instructional tuning
stage. MoDA employs a Transformer-based cross-attention mechanism to generate a
modulation mask over the aligned visual tokens, thereby emphasizing
semantically relevant embedding dimensions based on the language instruction.
The modulated features are then passed to the LLM for autoregressive language
generation. Our experimental evaluation shows that MoDA improves visual
grounding and generates more contextually appropriate responses, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a general-purpose enhancement for image-based MLLMs.

Conclusion: ShapeLLM-Omni填补了3D内容处理的多模态模型空白，推动了3D原生AI的发展。

Abstract: Recently, the powerful text-to-image capabilities of ChatGPT-4o have led to
growing appreciation for native multimodal large language models. However, its
multimodal capabilities remain confined to images and text. Yet beyond images,
the ability to understand and generate 3D content is equally crucial. To

First, we train a 3D vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE), which
maps 3D objects into a discrete latent space to achieve efficient and accurate
shape representation and reconstruction. Building upon the 3D-aware discrete
tokens, we innovatively construct a large-scale continuous training dataset
named 3D-Alpaca, encompassing generation, comprehension, and editing, thus
providing rich resources for future research and training. Finally, by
performing instruction-based training of the Qwen-2.5-vl-7B-Instruct model on
the 3D-Alpaca dataset. Our work provides an effective attempt at extending
multimodal models with basic 3D capabilities, which contributes to future
research in 3D-native AI. Project page:

Motivation: 生物医学文本具有复杂且领域特定的语义，而常见的对比学习方法往往忽视这一点，因此需要一种更有效的方法来预训练生物医学视觉语言模型。

Method: 提出扰动报告判别方法，通过扰动文本语义结构并让模型区分原始报告与扰动报告，同时对比注意力加权的图像子区域和子词。

Result: 在多个下游任务中，该方法优于基线方法，学习到更具语义意义和鲁棒性的多模态表示。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提升生物医学视觉语言模型的语义理解能力，为下游任务提供更好的表示。

Abstract: Vision-language models pre-trained on large scale of unlabeled biomedical
images and associated reports learn generalizable semantic representations.
These multi-modal representations can benefit various downstream tasks in the
biomedical domain. Contrastive learning is widely used to pre-train
vision-language models for general natural images and associated captions.
Despite its popularity, we found biomedical texts have complex and
domain-specific semantics that are often neglected by common contrastive
methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, perturbed report
discrimination, for pre-train biomedical vision-language models. First, we
curate a set of text perturbation methods that keep the same words, but disrupt
the semantic structure of the sentence. Next, we apply different types of
perturbation to reports, and use the model to distinguish the original report
from the perturbed ones given the associated image. Parallel to this, we
enhance the sensitivity of our method to higher level of granularity for both
modalities by contrasting attention-weighted image sub-regions and sub-words in
the image-text pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple downstream
tasks, and our method outperforms strong baseline methods. The results
demonstrate that our approach learns more semantic meaningful and robust
multi-modal representations.

Abstract: Understanding real-world videos with complex semantics and long temporal
dependencies remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Recent
progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in vision-language tasks, while reinforcement learning tuning
(RLT) has further improved their reasoning abilities. In this work, we explore
RLT as a post-training strategy to enhance the video-specific reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. Built upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
framework, we propose a dual-reward formulation that supervises both semantic
and temporal reasoning through discrete and continuous reward signals. To
facilitate effective preference-based optimization, we introduce a
variance-aware data selection strategy based on repeated inference to identify
samples that provide informative learning signals. We evaluate our approach
across eight representative video understanding tasks, including VideoQA,
Temporal Video Grounding, and Grounded VideoQA. Our method consistently
outperforms supervised fine-tuning and existing RLT baselines, achieving
superior performance with significantly less training data. These results
underscore the importance of reward design and data selection in advancing
reasoning-centric video understanding with MLLMs. Notably, The initial code
release (two months ago) has now been expanded with updates, including
optimized reward mechanisms and additional datasets. The latest version is

Conclusion: 研究表明，仅通过去噪训练的UNet网络包含丰富且可访问的稀疏图像表示。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models learn probability densities over diverse image
datasets by estimating the score with a neural network trained to remove noise.
Despite their remarkable success in generating high-quality images, the
internal mechanisms of the underlying score networks are not well understood.
Here, we examine a UNet trained for denoising on the ImageNet dataset, to
better understand its internal representation and computation of the score. We
show that the middle block of the UNet decomposes individual images into sparse
subsets of active channels, and that the vector of spatial averages of these
channels can provide a nonlinear representation of the underlying clean images.
We develop a novel algorithm for stochastic reconstruction of images from this
representation and demonstrate that it recovers a sample from a set of images
defined by a target image representation. We then study the properties of the
representation and demonstrate that Euclidean distances in the latent space
correspond to distances between conditional densities induced by
representations as well as semantic similarities in the image space. Applying a
clustering algorithm in the representation space yields groups of images that
share both fine details (e.g., specialized features, textured regions, small
objects), as well as global structure, but are only partially aligned with
object identities. Thus, we show for the first time that a network trained
solely on denoising contains a rich and accessible sparse representation of
images.

Motivation: 传统方法将每个物种视为独立类别，忽略了物种间的视觉相似性。TaxaDiffusion利用分类学层次结构，通过渐进式训练提高生成准确性。

Method: TaxaDiffusion采用分层训练策略，从粗粒度分类（如纲、目）逐步细化到细粒度分类（如科、属、种），利用共享形态特征进行知识迁移。

Conclusion: TaxaDiffusion通过结合分类学知识，显著提升了细粒度动物图像生成的准确性和效率。

Abstract: We propose TaxaDiffusion, a taxonomy-informed training framework for
diffusion models to generate fine-grained animal images with high morphological
and identity accuracy. Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an
independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many
species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in
subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships,
TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across
different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class
and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at
the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures
coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors,
facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for
species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate
generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive
experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms
existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image
generation. Project page: https://amink8.github.io/TaxaDiffusion/

Abstract: Spatial intelligence, encompassing 3D reconstruction, perception, and
reasoning, is fundamental to applications such as robotics, aerial imaging, and
extended reality. A key enabler is the real-time, accurate estimation of core
3D attributes (camera parameters, point clouds, depth maps, and 3D point
tracks) from unstructured or streaming imagery. Inspired by the success of
large foundation models in language and 2D vision, a new class of end-to-end 3D
geometric foundation models (GFMs) has emerged, directly predicting dense 3D
representations in a single feed-forward pass, eliminating the need for slow or
unavailable precomputed camera parameters. Since late 2023, the field has
exploded with diverse variants, but systematic evaluation is lacking. In this
work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for 3D GFMs, covering five
core tasks: sparse-view depth estimation, video depth estimation, 3D
reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, novel view synthesis, and spanning
both standard and challenging out-of-distribution datasets. Our standardized
toolkit automates dataset handling, evaluation protocols, and metric
computation to ensure fair, reproducible comparisons. We evaluate 16
state-of-the-art GFMs, revealing their strengths and limitations across tasks
and domains, and derive key insights to guide future model scaling and
optimization. All code, evaluation scripts, and processed data will be publicly
released to accelerate research in 3D spatial intelligence.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for low-rank personalization of a generic model
for head avatar generation. Prior work proposes generic models that achieve
high-quality face animation by leveraging large-scale datasets of multiple
identities. However, such generic models usually fail to synthesize unique
identity-specific details, since they learn a general domain prior. To adapt to
specific subjects, we find that it is still challenging to capture
high-frequency facial details via popular solutions like low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). This motivates us to propose a specific architecture, a Register
Module, that enhances the performance of LoRA, while requiring only a small
number of parameters to adapt to an unseen identity. Our module is applied to
intermediate features of a pre-trained model, storing and re-purposing
information in a learnable 3D feature space. To demonstrate the efficacy of our
personalization method, we collect a dataset of talking videos of individuals
with distinctive facial details, such as wrinkles and tattoos. Our approach
faithfully captures unseen faces, outperforming existing methods quantitatively
and qualitatively. We will release the code, models, and dataset to the public.

Abstract: Anisotropic rotation averaging has recently been explored as a natural
extension of respective isotropic methods. In the anisotropic formulation,
uncertainties of the estimated relative rotations -- obtained via standard
two-view optimization -- are propagated to the optimization of absolute
rotations. The resulting semidefinite relaxations are able to recover global
minima but scale poorly with the problem size. Local methods are fast and also
admit robust estimation but are sensitive to initialization. They usually
employ minimum spanning trees and therefore suffer from drift accumulation and
can get trapped in poor local minima. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the
gap between optimality, robustness and efficiency of anisotropic rotation
averaging. We analyze a family of block coordinate descent methods initially
proposed to optimize the standard chordal distances, and derive a much simpler
formulation and an anisotropic extension obtaining a fast general solver. We
integrate this solver into the extended anisotropic large-scale robust rotation
averaging pipeline. The resulting algorithm achieves state-of-the-art
performance on public structure-from-motion datasets. Project page:

Abstract: Training large neural networks on large-scale datasets requires substantial
computational resources, particularly for dense prediction tasks such as object
detection. Although dataset distillation (DD) has been proposed to alleviate
these demands by synthesizing compact datasets from larger ones, most existing
work focuses solely on image classification, leaving the more complex detection
setting largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce OD3, a novel
optimization-free data distillation framework specifically designed for object
detection. Our approach involves two stages: first, a candidate selection
process in which object instances are iteratively placed in synthesized images
based on their suitable locations, and second, a candidate screening process
using a pre-trained observer model to remove low-confidence objects. We perform
our data synthesis framework on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC, two popular detection
datasets, with compression ratios ranging from 0.25% to 5%. Compared to the
prior solely existing dataset distillation method on detection and conventional
core set selection methods, OD3 delivers superior accuracy, establishes new
state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior best method by more than 14% on COCO
mAP50 at a compression ratio of 1.0%. Code and condensed datasets are available

Method: 将交互过程分解为三个阶段（交互前、交互中、交互后），分别用主导物体特征建模，并引入外观和形状感知的潜在表示。

Result: 在Bridge V2数据集和实际评估中，RoboMaster表现优于现有方法，达到了轨迹控制视频生成的最新水平。

Conclusion: RoboMaster通过分阶段建模和潜在表示，有效解决了多物体交互问题，为机器人操作视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential
for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further
enabling fine-grained control. However, existing trajectory-based methods
primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture
multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This
limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which
leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a
novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative
trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core
is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction,
interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of
the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and
post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby
mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during
interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency
throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent
representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2
dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance
in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在3D推理中因缺乏明确的3D数据预训练而受限，本文通过评估多视角对应关系揭示3D感知表示质量与下游任务性能的正相关。

Method: 提出3DRS框架，利用预训练的3D基础模型监督对齐MLLMs的视觉特征与3D知识。

Result: 在多个基准测试和MLLMs（如视觉定位、描述和问答）中均表现出一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 3DRS框架有效提升了MLLMs的3D表示能力，从而改善了场景理解任务的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in scene understanding have leveraged multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) for 3D reasoning by capitalizing on their strong 2D
pretraining. However, the lack of explicit 3D data during MLLM pretraining
limits 3D representation capability. In this paper, we investigate the
3D-awareness of MLLMs by evaluating multi-view correspondence and reveal a
strong positive correlation between the quality of 3D-aware representation and
downstream task performance. Motivated by this, we propose 3DRS, a framework
that enhances MLLM 3D representation learning by introducing supervision from
pretrained 3D foundation models. Our approach aligns MLLM visual features with
rich 3D knowledge distilled from 3D models, effectively improving scene
understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and MLLMs --
including visual grounding, captioning, and question answering -- demonstrate
consistent performance gains. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/3drs

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为QL-Edit的新任务，旨在解决多对象场景中图像编辑的精确控制问题，并提出了IMAGHarmony框架和PNS策略，显著提升了编辑的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像编辑方法在多对象场景中难以精确控制对象类别、数量和空间布局，因此需要一种新方法来增强编辑的精细度和结构一致性。

Method: 提出了IMAGHarmony框架，结合和谐感知注意力（HA）和多模态语义，以及偏好引导的噪声选择（PNS）策略，优化初始噪声选择。

Result: IMAGHarmony在结构对齐和语义准确性上优于现有方法，并通过HarmonyBench验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: IMAGHarmony为多对象图像编辑提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了编辑质量和一致性。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models have advanced image editing by enhancing visual
quality and control, supporting broad applications across creative and
personalized domains. However, current image editing largely overlooks
multi-object scenarios, where precise control over object categories, counts,
and spatial layouts remains a significant challenge. To address this, we
introduce a new task, quantity-and-layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit),
which aims to enable fine-grained control of object quantity and spatial
structure in complex scenes. We further propose IMAGHarmony, a structure-aware
framework that incorporates harmony-aware attention (HA) to integrate
multimodal semantics, explicitly modeling object counts and layouts to enhance
editing accuracy and structural consistency. In addition, we observe that
diffusion models are susceptible to initial noise and exhibit strong
preferences for specific noise patterns. Motivated by this, we present a
preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that chooses semantically
aligned initial noise samples based on vision-language matching, thereby
improving generation stability and layout consistency in multi-object editing.
To support evaluation, we construct HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark
covering diverse quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that IMAGHarmony consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in structural alignment and semantic accuracy. The code and model are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成控制方法难以学习新任务，而视觉语言模型（VLM）能够通过上下文学习任务并生成正确输出。

Method: 使用VLM对生成的图像进行评分，并通过反向传播梯度更新图像生成器的权重。

Result: 该方法支持多种新控制任务，如常识推理和视觉提示，用户可快速实现多模态控制（如调色板、线条粗细等）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过文本和图像接口实现了广泛的新控制任务，提升了图像生成器的灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: Prior methods for controlling image generation are limited in their ability
to be taught new tasks. In contrast, vision-language models, or VLMs, can learn
tasks in-context and produce the correct outputs for a given input. We propose
a dual-process distillation scheme that allows feed-forward image generators to
learn new tasks from deliberative VLMs. Our scheme uses a VLM to rate the
generated images and backpropagates this gradient to update the weights of the
image generator. Our general framework enables a wide variety of new control
tasks through the same text-and-image based interface. We showcase a handful of
applications of this technique for different types of control signals, such as
commonsense inferences and visual prompts. With our method, users can implement
multimodal controls for properties such as color palette, line weight, horizon
position, and relative depth within a matter of minutes. Project page:

TLDR: 提出了一种基于区块链智能合约的动态行为惩罚框架，用于实时阻止拍卖欺诈行为，通过Bid Shill Score评估可疑行为并动态调整惩罚费用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线拍卖中的欺诈行为（如托标）带来重大风险，传统事后检测方法无法实时阻止。

Method: 采用区块链智能合约实现动态惩罚机制，通过Bid Shill Score评估九种投标行为，动态调整惩罚费用。

Result: 模拟实验证明该模型有效降低托标盈利性，同时保持诚实投标者的低惩罚，系统性能开销在可接受范围内。

Conclusion: 该框架为去中心化系统中的行为欺诈预防提供了实用方法，无需信任中介即可实现透明拍卖规则。

Abstract: In online auctions, fraudulent behaviors such as shill bidding pose
significant risks. This paper presents a conceptual framework that applies
dynamic, behavior-based penalties to deter auction fraud using blockchain smart
contracts. Unlike traditional post-auction detection methods, this approach
prevents manipulation in real-time by introducing an economic disincentive
system where penalty severity scales with suspicious bidding patterns. The
framework employs the proposed Bid Shill Score (BSS) to evaluate nine distinct
bidding behaviors, dynamically adjusting the penalty fees to make fraudulent
activity financially unaffordable while providing fair competition.
  The system is implemented within a decentralized English auction on the
Ethereum blockchain, demonstrating how smart contracts enforce transparent
auction rules without trusted intermediaries. Simulations confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed model: the dynamic penalty mechanism reduces the
profitability of shill bidding while keeping penalties low for honest bidders.
Performance evaluation shows that the system introduces only moderate gas and
latency overhead, keeping transaction costs and response times within practical
bounds for real-world use. The approach provides a practical method for
behaviour-based fraud prevention in decentralised systems where trust cannot be
assumed.

Motivation: 探讨在战略学习中，代理对评分规则的不完全信息如何导致群体间的不公平结果。

Method: 比较天真代理和贝叶斯代理在不同透明度下的行为，分析群体间效用差异。

Result: 天真代理的效用差异随噪声无限增长，而贝叶斯代理的差异有限；透明度对差异的影响非单调。

Conclusion: 透明度对公平性有复杂影响，中间透明度可能最小化差异；群体间的先验信念差异进一步影响公平性。

Abstract: We study how partial information about scoring rules affects fairness in
strategic learning settings. In strategic learning, a learner deploys a scoring
rule, and agents respond strategically by modifying their features -- at some
cost -- to improve their outcomes. However, in our work, agents do not observe
the scoring rule directly; instead, they receive a noisy signal of said rule.
We consider two different agent models: (i) naive agents, who take the noisy
signal at face value, and (ii) Bayesian agents, who update a prior belief based
on the signal.
  Our goal is to understand how disparities in outcomes arise between groups
that differ in their costs of feature modification, and how these disparities
vary with the level of transparency of the learner's rule. For naive agents, we
show that utility disparities can grow unboundedly with noise, and that the
group with lower costs can, perhaps counter-intuitively, be disproportionately
harmed under limited transparency. In contrast, for Bayesian agents,
disparities remain bounded. We provide a full characterization of disparities
across groups as a function of the level of transparency and show that they can
vary non-monotonically with noise; in particular, disparities are often
minimized at intermediate levels of transparency. Finally, we extend our
analysis to settings where groups differ not only in cost, but also in prior
beliefs, and study how this asymmetry influences fairness.

Motivation: 尽管ICM是现代扑克锦标赛策略的基础，但其在现实世界中的表现尚未得到充分验证，尤其是在大规模场景下。

Method: 作者引入了一个包含上万场扑克锦标赛结果的新数据集，并基于此进行了两项实验：验证ICM相对于基线的准确性，以及分析ICM对不同筹码量玩家的表现偏差。

Result: 实验表明，ICM比基线模型更准确，但存在对筹码较多玩家低估和对筹码较少玩家高估的问题。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来开发扑克锦标赛玩家价值估计算法的研究者提供了参考。

Abstract: The independent chip model (ICM) forms a cornerstone of all modern poker
tournament strategy. However, despite its prominence, the ICM's performance in
the real world has not been sufficiently scrutinized, especially at a large
scale. In this paper, we introduce our new dataset of poker tournaments,
consisting of results of over ten thousand events. Then, using this dataset, we
perform two experiments as part of a large-scale empirical validation of the
ICM. First, we verify that the ICM performs more accurately than a baseline we
propose. Second, we obtain empirical evidence of the ICM underestimating the
performances of players with larger stacks while overestimating those who are
short-stacked. Our contributions may be useful to future researchers developing
new algorithms for estimating a player's value in poker tournaments.

Motivation: 不完全信息象棋（如FoW象棋）是AI研究的重要挑战，因其需要复杂的推理能力，如信息收集、对手知识推断等。

Method: Obscuro引入了不完全信息博弈搜索的先进技术，实现了强大且可扩展的推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，Obscuro在对抗现有最佳AI和人类顶尖玩家时表现显著更强。

Conclusion: FoW象棋是迄今为止不完全信息搜索成功应用的最大规模游戏，标志着AI在不完全信息博弈中的重大突破。

Abstract: Since the advent of AI, games have served as progress benchmarks. Meanwhile,
imperfect-information variants of chess have existed for over a century,
present extreme challenges, and have been the focus of significant AI research.
Beyond calculation needed in regular chess, they require reasoning about
information gathering, the opponent's knowledge, signaling, etc. The most
popular variant, Fog of War (FoW) chess (aka. dark chess) is a recognized
challenge problem in AI after superhuman performance was reached in no-limit
Texas hold'em poker. We present Obscuro, the first superhuman AI for FoW chess.
It introduces advances to search in imperfect-information games, enabling
strong, scalable reasoning. Experiments against the prior state-of-the-art AI
and human players -- including the world's best -- show that Obscuro is
significantly stronger. FoW chess is the largest (by amount of imperfect
information) turn-based game in which superhuman performance has been achieved
and the largest game in which imperfect-information search has been
successfully applied.

Motivation: 设计激励兼容算法的主要挑战在于初始数据获取，高维情境下初始探索阶段可能需要指数级样本复杂度，阻碍高效学习。

Method: 采用线性赌博机模型，假设动作位于欧几里得单位球内，提出激励兼容的探索算法。

Result: 在温和几何条件下，算法样本复杂度与维度等参数呈多项式关系，克服了初始探索的障碍。

Conclusion: 几何条件可以消除探索障碍，激励兼容性与最优遗憾不冲突。

Abstract: In the incentivized exploration model, a principal aims to explore and learn
over time by interacting with a sequence of self-interested agents. It has been
recently understood that the main challenge in designing incentive-compatible
algorithms for this problem is to gather a moderate amount of initial data,
after which one can obtain near-optimal regret via posterior sampling. With
high-dimensional contexts, however, this \emph{initial exploration} phase
requires exponential sample complexity in some cases, which prevents efficient
learning unless initial data can be acquired exogenously. We show that these
barriers to exploration disappear under mild geometric conditions on the set of
available actions, in which case incentive-compatibility does not preclude
regret-optimality. Namely, we consider the linear bandit model with actions in
the Euclidean unit ball, and give an incentive-compatible exploration algorithm
with sample complexity that scales polynomially with the dimension and other
parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨决策者是否应公开分类器，以防止代理操纵特征导致错误分类。

Method: 扩展在线战略分类模型，假设代理基于历史分类器的加权平均进行操纵。

Result: 决策者犯错次数为$(1-\gamma)^{-1}$或$k_{\text{in}}$倍于完全知识场景。

Conclusion: 隐藏分类器可能适得其反，降低决策者在在线战略分类中的性能。

Abstract: Strategic classification addresses a learning problem where a decision-maker
implements a classifier over agents who may manipulate their features in order
to receive favorable predictions. In the standard model of online strategic
classification, in each round, the decision-maker implements and publicly
reveals a classifier, after which agents perfectly best respond based on this
knowledge. However, in practice, whether to disclose the classifier is often
debated -- some decision-makers believe that hiding the classifier can prevent
misclassification errors caused by manipulation.
  In this paper, we formally examine how limiting the agents' access to the
current classifier affects the decision-maker's performance. Specifically, we
consider an extended online strategic classification setting where agents lack
direct knowledge about the current classifier and instead manipulate based on a
weighted average of historically implemented classifiers. Our main result shows
that in this setting, the decision-maker incurs $(1-\gamma)^{-1}$ or
$k_{\text{in}}$ times more mistakes compared to the full-knowledge setting,
where $k_{\text{in}}$ is the maximum in-degree of the manipulation graph
(representing how many distinct feature vectors can be manipulated to appear as
a single one), and $\gamma$ is the discount factor indicating agents' memory of
past classifiers. Our results demonstrate how withholding access to the
classifier can backfire and degrade the decision-maker's performance in online
strategic classification.

Motivation: 解决完全连续POSG中规划问题的计算复杂性，避免离线计算或对玩家信念顺序的假设。

Method: 提出有限历史/视野精炼的POSG模型，利用粒子估计和随机梯度下降进行在线轨迹规划。

Result: 在连续追逃和仓库拾取场景中，方法表现出主动信息收集能力，并优于被动策略。

Conclusion: 该方法为连续POSG中的在线规划提供了有效解决方案，适用于多玩家和复杂环境。

Abstract: Game-theoretic agents must make plans that optimally gather information about
their opponents. These problems are modeled by partially observable stochastic
games (POSGs), but planning in fully continuous POSGs is intractable without
heavy offline computation or assumptions on the order of belief maintained by
each player. We formulate a finite history/horizon refinement of POSGs which
admits competitive information gathering behavior in trajectory space, and
through a series of approximations, we present an online method for computing
rational trajectory plans in these games which leverages particle-based
estimations of the joint state space and performs stochastic gradient play. We
also provide the necessary adjustments required to deploy this method on
individual agents. The method is tested in continuous pursuit-evasion and
warehouse-pickup scenarios (alongside extensions to $N > 2$ players and to more
complex environments with visual and physical obstacles), demonstrating
evidence of active information gathering and outperforming passive competitors.

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了多面体折叠问题的可扩展性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of finding and enumerating polyominos that can be
folded into multiple non-isomorphic boxes. While several computational
approaches have been proposed, including SAT, randomized algorithms, and
decision diagrams, none has been able to perform at scale. We argue that
existing SAT encodings are hindered by the presence of global constraints
(e.g., graph connectivity or acyclicity), which are generally hard to encode
effectively and hard for solvers to reason about. In this work, we propose a
new SAT-based approach that replaces these global constraints with simple local
constraints that have substantially better propagation properties. Our approach
dramatically improves the scalability of both computing and enumerating common
box unfoldings: (i) while previous approaches could only find common unfoldings
of two boxes up to area 88, ours easily scales beyond 150, and (ii) while
previous approaches were only able to enumerate common unfoldings up to area
30, ours scales up to 60. This allows us to rule out 46, 54, and 58 as the
smallest areas allowing a common unfolding of three boxes, thereby refuting a
conjecture of Xu et al. (2017).

Abstract: Accurately predicting gene mutations, mutation subtypes and their exons in
lung cancer is critical for personalized treatment planning and prognostic
assessment. Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high
cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations
and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate
precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning
can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology
slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly
to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled
PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation
sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central
South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links
whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and
tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology
images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early
genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets,
we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in
PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We
benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation,
subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide
valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and
assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted
treatment plans for patients. Code and data are available at

Method: 开发了TrUE-Net模型，结合Transformer和随机森林，利用蒙特卡洛Dropout进行不确定性估计，并将样本分为高方差和低方差组。

Result: 在1050名个体中测试，排除不确定性组后，准确率从0.6263提高到0.7287，F1分数从0.5843提高到0.8205。

Conclusion: 蒙特卡洛Dropout驱动的分类不确定性有助于识别需要进一步临床评估的模糊病例，提高了AD基因组分类的可靠性。

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is genetically complex, complicating
robust classification from genomic data. METHODS: We developed a
transformer-based ensemble model (TrUE-Net) using Monte Carlo Dropout for
uncertainty estimation in AD classification from whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
We combined a transformer that preserves single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
sequence structure with a concurrent random forest using flattened genotypes.
An uncertainty threshold separated samples into an uncertain (high-variance)
group and a more certain (low-variance) group. RESULTS: We analyzed 1050
individuals, holding out half for testing. Overall accuracy and area under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were 0.6514 and 0.6636,
respectively. Excluding the uncertain group improved accuracy from 0.6263 to
0.7287 (10.24% increase) and F1 from 0.5843 to 0.8205 (23.62% increase).
DISCUSSION: Monte Carlo Dropout-driven uncertainty helps identify ambiguous
cases that may require further clinical evaluation, thus improving reliability
in AD genomic classification.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that integrating multimodal data fusion techniques
for imaging and genetic features is beneficial for the etiological analysis and
predictive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there are several
critical flaws in current deep learning methods. Firstly, there has been
insufficient discussion and exploration regarding the selection and encoding of
genetic information. Secondly, due to the significantly superior classification
value of AD imaging features compared to genetic features, many studies in
multimodal fusion emphasize the strengths of imaging features, actively
mitigating the influence of weaker features, thereby diminishing the learning
of the unique value of genetic features. To address this issue, this study
proposes the dynamic multimodal role-swapping network (GenDMR). In GenDMR, we
develop a novel approach to encode the spatial organization of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enhancing the representation of their genomic
context. Additionally, to adaptively quantify the disease risk of SNPs and
brain region, we propose a multi-instance attention module to enhance model
interpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a dominant modality selection
module and a contrastive self-distillation module, combining them to achieve a
dynamic teacher-student role exchange mechanism based on dominant and auxiliary
modalities for bidirectional co-updating of different modal data. Finally,
GenDMR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ADNI public dataset and
visualizes attention to different SNPs, focusing on confirming 12 potential
high-risk genes related to AD, including the most classic APOE and recently
highlighted significant risk genes. This demonstrates GenDMR's interpretable
analytical capability in exploring AD genetic features, providing new insights
and perspectives for the development of multimodal data fusion techniques.

*Abderrahim Bendahi,Benjamin Doerr,Adrien Fradin,Johannes F. Lutzeyer*

Main category: cs.NE

TLDR: 本文提出两种改进的移动接受超启发式算法，通过马尔可夫链和仅接受恶化解的算子，显著提升了在多种基准函数（如Jump和Cliff函数）上的运行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有的移动接受超启发式算法，以更高效地逃离局部最优解，并验证其在经典基准函数上的性能。

Method: 1. 使用两状态马尔可夫链选择接受算子；2. 引入仅接受恶化解的算子。

Result: 改进后的算法在Jump函数上的运行时间从Ω(n^(2m-1))降至O(n^(m+1))，在SEQOPT_k类函数上达到O(n^(k+1) log n)的优异表现。

Conclusion: 新算法通过创新的接受算子设计，显著提升了逃离局部最优的效率，适用于多种复杂优化问题。

Abstract: The move-acceptance hyper-heuristic was recently shown to be able to leave
local optima with astonishing efficiency (Lissovoi et al., Artificial
Intelligence (2023)). In this work, we propose two modifications to this
algorithm that demonstrate impressive performances on a large class of
benchmarks including the classic Cliff$_d$ and Jump$_m$ function classes. (i)
Instead of randomly choosing between the only-improving and any-move acceptance
operator, we take this choice via a simple two-state Markov chain. This
modification alone reduces the runtime on Jump$_m$ functions with gap parameter
$m$ from $\Omega(n^{2m-1})$ to $O(n^{m+1})$. (ii) We then replace the all-moves
acceptance operator with the operator that only accepts worsenings. Such a,
counter-intuitive, operator has not been used before in the literature.
However, our proofs show that our only-worsening operator can greatly help in
leaving local optima, reducing, e.g., the runtime on Jump functions to $O(n^3
\log n)$ independent of the gap size. In general, we prove a remarkably good
runtime of $O(n^{k+1} \log n)$ for our Markov move-acceptance hyper-heuristic
on all members of a new benchmark class SEQOPT$_k$, which contains a large
number of functions having $k$ successive local optima, and which contains the
commonly studied Jump$_m$ and Cliff$_d$ functions for $k=2$.

Method: 使用标准化网表格式，结合遗传操作（交叉、突变和剪枝）优化电路设计。

Result: 在标准单元（反相器、两输入NAND和锁存器）和模拟分类器电路（Iris数据集）设计中表现优异，测试集准确率达89%。

Conclusion: SpiceMixer在多种任务中均优于现有合成方法，展示了其高效性和通用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces SpiceMixer, a genetic algorithm developed to synthesize
novel analog circuits by evolving SPICE netlists. Unlike conventional methods,
SpiceMixer operates directly on netlist lines, enabling compatibility with any
component or subcircuit type and supporting general-purpose genetic operations.
By using a normalized netlist format, the algorithm enhances the effectiveness
of its genetic operators: crossover, mutation, and pruning. We show that
SpiceMixer achieves superior performance in synthesizing standard cells
(inverter, two-input NAND, and latch) and in designing an analog classifier
circuit for the Iris dataset, reaching an accuracy of 89% on the test set.
Across all evaluated tasks, SpiceMixer consistently outperforms existing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对记忆的生物学基础已有大量研究，但记忆的编码、存储和检索机制仍未完全阐明。

Method: 结合细胞神经科学的发现和计算模型（如稀疏正则化、engram门控、稀疏分布式记忆和脉冲神经网络），探讨记忆痕迹的识别、突触可塑性机制及稀疏性对记忆效率的影响。

Result: 研究表明，记忆的效率、容量和稳定性源于可塑性和稀疏性约束的相互作用。

Conclusion: 论文为记忆痕迹研究提供了全面的理论基础，并提出了未来研究的方向，对记忆相关疾病的诊断和治疗具有潜在意义。

Abstract: Despite substantial research into the biological basis of memory, the precise
mechanisms by which experiences are encoded, stored, and retrieved in the brain
remain incompletely understood. A growing body of evidence supports the engram
theory, which posits that sparse populations of neurons undergo lasting
physical and biochemical changes to support long-term memory. Yet, a
comprehensive computational framework that integrates biological findings with
mechanistic models remains elusive. This work synthesizes insights from
cellular neuroscience and computational modeling to address key challenges in
engram research: how engram neurons are identified and manipulated; how
synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to stable memory traces; and how
sparsity promotes efficient, interference-resistant representations. Relevant
computational approaches -- such as sparse regularization, engram gating, and
biologically inspired architectures like Sparse Distributed Memory and spiking
neural networks -- are also examined. Together, these findings suggest that
memory efficiency, capacity, and stability emerge from the interaction of
plasticity and sparsity constraints. By integrating neurobiological and
computational perspectives, this paper provides a comprehensive theoretical
foundation for engram research and proposes a roadmap for future inquiry into
the mechanisms underlying memory, with implications for the diagnosis and
treatment of memory-related disorders.

TLDR: 提出了一种通用方法加速Transducer模型的beam search，优化了ALSD++和AES++算法，显著提升了推理速度和识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transducer模型在端到端ASR系统中表现出色，但beam search会显著降低其推理速度，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用批量操作、树状假设结构、新颖的空白评分和CUDA图执行技术，优化beam search。

Result: 将beam和greedy模式的速度差距缩小至10-20%，WER相对提升14-30%，低资源场景下浅融合提升11%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了Transducer模型的实用性和性能，所有算法已开源。

Abstract: Transducer models have emerged as a promising choice for end-to-end ASR
systems, offering a balanced trade-off between recognition accuracy, streaming
capabilities, and inference speed in greedy decoding. However, beam search
significantly slows down Transducers due to repeated evaluations of key network
components, limiting practical applications. This paper introduces a universal
method to accelerate beam search for Transducers, enabling the implementation
of two optimized algorithms: ALSD++ and AES++. The proposed method utilizes
batch operations, a tree-based hypothesis structure, novel blank scoring for
enhanced shallow fusion, and CUDA graph execution for efficient GPU inference.
This narrows the speed gap between beam and greedy modes to only 10-20% for the
whole system, achieves 14-30% relative improvement in WER compared to greedy
decoding, and improves shallow fusion for low-resource up to 11% compared to
existing implementations. All the algorithms are open sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从复杂ambisonic录音中提取目标声场的挑战，特别是在存在空间接近的次要声源时。

Method: 采用ambisonic-in-ambisonic-out架构，结合空间信息（如目标方向）和语义嵌入（如图像分割和字幕）。

Result: 在合成和真实ambisonic混合物上表现优异，空间和语义信息的结合在复杂场景中更有效。

Conclusion: SoundSculpt通过结合空间和语义信息，显著提升了目标声场提取的性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces SoundSculpt, a neural network designed to extract
target sound fields from ambisonic recordings. SoundSculpt employs an
ambisonic-in-ambisonic-out architecture and is conditioned on both spatial
information (e.g., target direction obtained by pointing at an immersive video)
and semantic embeddings (e.g., derived from image segmentation and captioning).
Trained and evaluated on synthetic and real ambisonic mixtures, SoundSculpt
demonstrates superior performance compared to various signal processing
baselines. Our results further reveal that while spatial conditioning alone can
be effective, the combination of spatial and semantic information is beneficial
in scenarios where there are secondary sound sources spatially close to the
target. Additionally, we compare two different semantic embeddings derived from
a text description of the target sound using text encoders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强制对齐工具仅提供单一边界估计，缺乏对边界不确定性的量化。

Method: 使用10个不同的分段分类神经网络模型进行对齐，通过集成技术计算中位数边界和97.85%置信区间。

Result: 在Buckeye和TIMIT语料库上，集成边界比单一模型略有改进，置信区间被整合到Praat TextGrids中。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究者提供了边界不确定性信息，可用于诊断或分析。

Abstract: Forced alignment is a common tool to align audio with orthographic and
phonetic transcriptions. Most forced alignment tools provide only a single
estimate of a boundary. The present project introduces a method of deriving
confidence intervals for these boundaries using a neural network ensemble
technique. Ten different segment classifier neural networks were previously
trained, and the alignment process is repeated with each model. The alignment
ensemble is then used to place the boundary at the median of the boundaries in
the ensemble, and 97.85% confidence intervals are constructed using order
statistics. On the Buckeye and TIMIT corpora, the ensemble boundaries show a
slight improvement over using just a single model. The confidence intervals are
incorporated into Praat TextGrids using a point tier, and they are also output
as a table for researchers to analyze separately as diagnostics or to
incorporate uncertainty into their analyses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自监督表示的结构，探索语音转换的简单有效方法。

Method: 使用线性变换自监督特征，并通过约束变换类型（如旋转）验证特征空间几何结构；进一步提出基于奇异值分解的内容和说话者信息分离方法。

Result: 仅需100维的线性投影即可实现高质量的语音转换，表明内容信息嵌入在低维子空间中。

Conclusion: LinearVC不仅为语音转换提供了实用方法，还深化了对自监督语音表示的理解。

Abstract: We introduce LinearVC, a simple voice conversion method that sheds light on
the structure of self-supervised representations. First, we show that simple
linear transformations of self-supervised features effectively convert voices.
Next, we probe the geometry of the feature space by constraining the set of
allowed transformations. We find that just rotating the features is sufficient
for high-quality voice conversion. This suggests that content information is
embedded in a low-dimensional subspace which can be linearly transformed to
produce a target voice. To validate this hypothesis, we finally propose a
method that explicitly factorizes content and speaker information using
singular value decomposition; the resulting linear projection with a rank of
just 100 gives competitive conversion results. Our work has implications for
both practical voice conversion and a broader understanding of self-supervised
speech representations. Samples and code: https://www.kamperh.com/linearvc/.

TLDR: CLAP-ART提出了一种基于语义丰富的离散令牌的AAC方法，优于基线EnCLAP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EnCLAP使用的EnCodec令牌旨在重建波形而非捕捉声音的语义，因此需要改进。

Method: CLAP-ART通过向量量化从预训练的音频表示中生成语义丰富的离散令牌，作为BART的输入。

Result: 实验表明，CLAP-ART在两个AAC基准上优于EnCLAP。

Conclusion: 语义丰富的离散令牌对AAC任务有益。

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) aims to describe the semantic contexts of
general sounds, including acoustic events and scenes, by leveraging effective
acoustic features. To enhance performance, an AAC method, EnCLAP, employed
discrete tokens from EnCodec as an effective input for fine-tuning a language
model BART. However, EnCodec is designed to reconstruct waveforms rather than
capture the semantic contexts of general sounds, which AAC should describe. To
address this issue, we propose CLAP-ART, an AAC method that utilizes
``semantic-rich and discrete'' tokens as input. CLAP-ART computes semantic-rich
discrete tokens from pre-trained audio representations through vector
quantization. We experimentally confirmed that CLAP-ART outperforms baseline
EnCLAP on two AAC benchmarks, indicating that semantic-rich discrete tokens
derived from semantically rich AR are beneficial for AAC.

Motivation: 构音障碍语音的高说话者间变异性和慢语速导致ASR系统表现不佳，因此研究如何将其转换为健康语音以提升ASR性能。

Method: 扩展了Rhythm and Voice（RnV）转换框架，引入适合构音障碍语音的音节节奏建模方法，并评估其对ASR的影响。

Result: 实验表明，LF-MMI模型在转换后的语音上显著降低了词错误率，尤其是对严重构音障碍病例；而Whisper模型在转换数据上的微调效果有限。

Conclusion: 无监督的节奏和语音转换在构音障碍ASR中具有潜力。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with dysarthric speech
due to high inter-speaker variability and slow speaking rates. To address this,
we explore dysarthric-to-healthy speech conversion for improved ASR
performance. Our approach extends the Rhythm and Voice (RnV) conversion
framework by introducing a syllable-based rhythm modeling method suited for
dysarthric speech. We assess its impact on ASR by training LF-MMI models and
fine-tuning Whisper on converted speech. Experiments on the Torgo corpus reveal
that LF-MMI achieves significant word error rate reductions, especially for
more severe cases of dysarthria, while fine-tuning Whisper on converted data
has minimal effect on its performance. These results highlight the potential of
unsupervised rhythm and voice conversion for dysarthric ASR. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DSUs方法需要完整语音输入和计算昂贵的自监督语音模型（S3Ms），限制了其在实时语音处理中的应用。

Method: 通过减小注意力窗口和模型规模，降低计算成本。

Result: 在ML-SUPERB 1h数据集上，浮点运算（FLOPs）减少了50%，字符错误率（CER）仅相对增加6.5%。

Conclusion: 改进后的DSUs方法在资源受限环境中具有实时语音处理的潜力。

Abstract: Discrete speech units (DSUs) are derived from clustering the features of
self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). DSUs offer significant advantages for
on-device streaming speech applications due to their rich phonetic information,
high transmission efficiency, and seamless integration with large language
models. However, conventional DSU-based approaches are impractical as they
require full-length speech input and computationally expensive S3Ms. In this
work, we reduce both the attention window and the model size while preserving
the effectiveness of DSUs. Our results demonstrate that we can reduce
floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 50% with only a relative increase of 6.5%
in character error rate (CER) on the ML-SUPERB 1h dataset. These findings
highlight the potential of DSUs for real-time speech processing in
resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了脑肿瘤分割的效率与效果，尤其在挑战性标签上表现突出。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the crucial task of brain tumor segmentation in
medical imaging and propose innovative approaches to enhance its performance.
The current state-of-the-art nnU-Net has shown promising results but suffers
from extensive training requirements and underutilization of pre-trained
weights. To overcome these limitations, we integrate Axial-Coronal-Sagittal
convolutions and pre-trained weights from ImageNet into the nnU-Net framework,
resulting in reduced training epochs, reduced trainable parameters, and
improved efficiency. Two strategies for transferring 2D pre-trained weights to
the 3D domain are presented, ensuring the preservation of learned relationships
and feature representations critical for effective information propagation.
Furthermore, we explore a joint classification and segmentation model that
leverages pre-trained encoders from a brain glioma grade classification proxy
task, leading to enhanced segmentation performance, especially for challenging
tumor labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods in the
fast training settings achieve comparable or even outperform the ensemble of
cross-validation models, a common practice in the brain tumor segmentation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的不确定性度量方法（如体素蒙特卡洛方差）不适合建模表面放置的不确定性，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 通过预测的体素有符号距离函数（SDF）与实际拟合表面的SDF之间的差异来衡量不确定性。

Conclusion: UNSURF为临床脑MRI扫描的表面重建提供了一种有效的不确定性度量方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We propose UNSURF, a novel uncertainty measure for cortical surface
reconstruction of clinical brain MRI scans of any orientation, resolution, and
contrast. It relies on the discrepancy between predicted voxel-wise signed
distance functions (SDFs) and the actual SDFs of the fitted surfaces. Our
experiments on real clinical scans show that traditional uncertainty measures,
such as voxel-wise Monte Carlo variance, are not suitable for modeling the
uncertainty of surface placement. Our results demonstrate that UNSURF estimates
correlate well with the ground truth errors and: \textit{(i)}~enable effective
automated quality control of surface reconstructions at the subject-, parcel-,
mesh node-level; and \textit{(ii)}~improve performance on a downstream
Alzheimer's disease classification task.

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在完全无监督的情况下，实现了优于现有方法的配准精度和物理真实的变形效果。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态成像配准提供了一种高效且无需外部信息的解决方案，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: The diagnosis of prostate cancer increasingly depends on multimodal imaging,
particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasound
(TRUS). However, accurate registration between these modalities remains a
fundamental challenge due to the differences in dimensionality and anatomical
representations. In this work, we present a novel framework that addresses
these challenges through a two-stage process: TRUS 3D reconstruction followed
by cross-modal registration. Unlike existing TRUS 3D reconstruction methods
that rely heavily on external probe tracking information, we propose a totally
probe-location-independent approach that leverages the natural correlation
between sagittal and transverse TRUS views. With the help of our
clustering-based feature matching method, we enable the spatial localization of
2D frames without any additional probe tracking information. For the
registration stage, we introduce an unsupervised diffusion-based framework
guided by modality translation. Unlike existing methods that translate one
modality into another, we map both MR and US into a pseudo intermediate
modality. This design enables us to customize it to retain only
registration-critical features, greatly easing registration. To further enhance
anatomical alignment, we incorporate an anatomy-aware registration strategy
that prioritizes internal structural coherence while adaptively reducing the
influence of boundary inconsistencies. Extensive validation demonstrates that
our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior
registration accuracy with physically realistic deformations in a completely
unsupervised fashion.

Abstract: With the advancement of modern medicine and the development of technologies
such as MRI, CT, and cellular analysis, it has become increasingly critical for
clinicians to accurately interpret various diagnostic images. However, modern
medical education often faces challenges due to limited access to high-quality
teaching materials, stemming from privacy concerns and a shortage of

generated by machine learning models, particularly generative models, presents
a promising solution. These models can create diverse and comparable imaging
datasets without compromising patient privacy, thereby supporting modern
medical education. In this study, we explore the use of convolutional neural

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a key investigation in clinical
cardiovascular medicine and has been used extensively in population research.
However, extracting clinically important measurements such as ejection fraction
for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases remains time-consuming and subjective.
We developed CineMA, a foundation AI model automating these tasks with limited
labels. CineMA is a self-supervised autoencoder model trained on 74,916 cine
CMR studies to reconstruct images from masked inputs. After fine-tuning, it was
evaluated across eight datasets on 23 tasks from four categories: ventricle and
myocardium segmentation, left and right ventricle ejection fraction
calculation, disease detection and classification, and landmark localisation.
CineMA is the first foundation model for cine CMR to match or outperform
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CineMA demonstrated greater label
efficiency than CNNs, achieving comparable or better performance with fewer
annotations. This reduces the burden of clinician labelling and supports
replacing task-specific training with fine-tuning foundation models in future
cardiac imaging applications. Models and code for pre-training and fine-tuning

with restoring real-captured images suffering from complex and unknown
degradations, where both perceptual quality and fidelity were critically
evaluated. The challenge comprised two tracks: (1) the low-light joint
denoising and demosaicing (JDD) task, and (2) the image detail
enhancement/generation task. Each track included two sub-tasks. The first
sub-task involved paired data with available ground truth, enabling
quantitative evaluation. The second sub-task dealt with real-world yet unpaired
images, emphasizing restoration efficiency and subjective quality assessed
through a comprehensive user study. In total, the challenge attracted nearly
300 registrations, with 51 teams submitting more than 600 results. The
top-performing methods advanced the state of the art in image restoration and
received unanimous recognition from all 20+ expert judges. The datasets used in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于RAW图像数据集稀缺且昂贵，而sRGB数据集广泛可用，研究旨在通过逆向ISP转换从sRGB图像恢复RAW图像。

Result: 提出的方法和基准测试确立了生成真实RAW数据的最新技术水平。

Conclusion: 该研究为从sRGB图像生成RAW数据提供了高效解决方案，并推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Numerous low-level vision tasks operate in the RAW domain due to its linear
properties, bit depth, and sensor designs. Despite this, RAW image datasets are
scarce and more expensive to collect than the already large and public sRGB
datasets. For this reason, many approaches try to generate realistic RAW images
using sensor information and sRGB images. This paper covers the second
challenge on RAW Reconstruction from sRGB (Reverse ISP). We aim to recover RAW
sensor images from smartphones given the corresponding sRGB images without
metadata and, by doing this, ``reverse" the ISP transformation. Over 150
participants joined this NTIRE 2025 challenge and submitted efficient models.
The proposed methods and benchmark establish the state-of-the-art for
generating realistic RAW data.

Abstract: Detecting breast cancer early is of the utmost importance to effectively
treat the millions of women afflicted by breast cancer worldwide every year.
Although mammography is the primary imaging modality for screening breast
cancer, there is an increasing interest in adding magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) to screening programmes, particularly for women at high risk. Recent
guidelines by the European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI) recommended
breast MRI as a supplemental screening tool for women with dense breast tissue.
However, acquiring and reading MRI scans requires significantly more time from
expert radiologists. This highlights the need to develop new automated methods
to detect cancer accurately using MRI and Artificial Intelligence (AI), which
have the potential to support radiologists in breast MRI interpretation and
classification and help detect cancer earlier. For this reason, the ODELIA
consortium has made this multi-centre dataset publicly available to assist in
developing AI tools for the detection of breast cancer on MRI.

Conclusion: 傅里叶域中的噪声监督方法为图像修复任务提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Noisy supervision refers to supervising image restoration learning with noisy
targets. It can alleviate the data collection burden and enhance the practical
applicability of deep learning techniques. However, existing methods suffer
from two key drawbacks. Firstly, they are ineffective in handling spatially
correlated noise commonly observed in practical applications such as low-light
imaging and remote sensing. Secondly, they rely on pixel-wise loss functions
that only provide limited supervision information. This work addresses these
challenges by leveraging the Fourier domain. We highlight that the Fourier
coefficients of spatially correlated noise exhibit sparsity and independence,
making them easier to handle. Additionally, Fourier coefficients contain global
information, enabling more significant supervision. Motivated by these
insights, we propose to establish noisy supervision in the Fourier domain. We
first prove that Fourier coefficients of a wide range of noise converge in
distribution to the Gaussian distribution. Exploiting this statistical
property, we establish the equivalence between using noisy targets and clean
targets in the Fourier domain. This leads to a unified learning framework
applicable to various image restoration tasks, diverse network architectures,
and different noise models. Extensive experiments validate the outstanding
performance of this framework in terms of both quantitative indices and
perceptual quality.

Method: 使用率失真损失的分数变化作为比特分配标准，提出FMPQ方法，并引入自适应搜索算法。

Result: 在类似模型大小限制下，BD-Rate性能优于其他量化方法。

Conclusion: FMPQ方法在降低计算复杂度的同时提升了性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Despite its improvements in coding performance compared to traditional
codecs, Learned Image Compression (LIC) suffers from large computational costs
for storage and deployment. Model quantization offers an effective solution to
reduce the computational complexity of LIC models. However, most existing works
perform fixed-precision quantization which suffers from sub-optimal utilization
of resources due to the varying sensitivity to quantization of different layers
of a neural network. In this paper, we propose a Flexible Mixed Precision
Quantization (FMPQ) method that assigns different bit-widths to different
layers of the quantized network using the fractional change in rate-distortion
loss as the bit-assignment criterion. We also introduce an adaptive search
algorithm which reduces the time-complexity of searching for the desired
distribution of quantization bit-widths given a fixed model size. Evaluation of
our method shows improved BD-Rate performance under similar model size
constraints compared to other works on quantization of LIC models. We have made
the source code available at gitlab.com/viper-purdue/fmpq.

Motivation: 现代机器学习为高维和无分箱分析提供了更多信息，但如何将其与物理生成器（如模拟器）结合仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了GBI框架，特别研究了数据驱动生成器的方法，并在共振异常检测中应用了基于机器学习的参数估计。

Result: 在LHCO基准数据集上实现了异常检测灵敏度的新最优性能，统计输出可直接解释。

Conclusion: GBI框架为物理统计推断提供了新工具，数据驱动生成器在异常检测中表现出色。

Abstract: Statistical inference in physics is often based on samples from a generator
(sometimes referred to as a ``forward model") that emulate experimental data
and depend on parameters of the underlying theory. Modern machine learning has
supercharged this workflow to enable high-dimensional and unbinned analyses to
utilize much more information than ever before. We propose a general framework
for describing the integration of machine learning with generators called
Generator Based Inference (GBI). A well-studied special case of this setup is
Simulation Based Inference (SBI) where the generator is a physics-based
simulator. In this work, we examine other methods within the GBI toolkit that
use data-driven methods to build the generator. In particular, we focus on
resonant anomaly detection, where the generator describing the background is
learned from sidebands. We show how to perform machine learning-based parameter
estimation in this context with data-derived generators. This transforms the
statistical outputs of anomaly detection to be directly interpretable and the
performance on the LHCO community benchmark dataset establishes a new
state-of-the-art for anomaly detection sensitivity.

ChEMBL35, with text over 10 times longer than prior datasets. MolTextNet
supports diverse downstream tasks, including property prediction and structure
retrieval. Pretraining CLIP-style models with Graph Neural Networks and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在蛋白质逆折叠中忽视了问题的多解性，需要一种能生成多样序列的模型。

Method: ProtInvTree采用奖励引导的树搜索框架，结合分阶段的位置选择和残基生成策略，以及跳跃式去噪评估。

Result: ProtInvTree在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，生成多样且结构一致的序列。

Conclusion: ProtInvTree为解决蛋白质逆折叠问题提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Designing protein sequences that fold into a target 3D structure, known as
protein inverse folding, is a fundamental challenge in protein engineering.
While recent deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance by
recovering native sequences, they often overlook the one-to-many nature of the
problem: multiple diverse sequences can fold into the same structure. This
motivates the need for a generative model capable of designing diverse
sequences while preserving structural consistency. To address this trade-off,
we introduce ProtInvTree, the first reward-guided tree-search framework for
protein inverse folding. ProtInvTree reformulates sequence generation as a
deliberate, step-wise decision-making process, enabling the exploration of
multiple design paths and exploitation of promising candidates through
self-evaluation, lookahead, and backtracking. We propose a two-stage
focus-and-grounding action mechanism that decouples position selection and
residue generation. To efficiently evaluate intermediate states, we introduce a
jumpy denoising strategy that avoids full rollouts. Built upon pretrained
protein language models, ProtInvTree supports flexible test-time scaling by
expanding the search depth and breadth without retraining. Empirically,
ProtInvTree outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks,
generating structurally consistent yet diverse sequences, including those far
from the native ground truth.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs),
have become an important tool for a wide range of applications, from computer
vision to natural language processing. However, the computational complexity of
DNN inference poses a significant challenge, particularly for processing on
resource-constrained edge devices. One promising approach to address this
challenge is the exploitation of sparsity in DNN operator weights.
  In this work, we present FlexiSAGA, an architecturally configurable and
dataflow-flexible AI hardware accelerator for the sparse and dense processing
of general matrix multiplications (GEMMs). FlexiSAGA supports seven different
sparse and dense dataflows, enabling efficient processing of resource intensive
DNN operators. Additionally, we propose a DNN pruning method specifically
tailored towards the FlexiSAGA architecture, allowing for near-optimal
processing of dense and sparse convolution and fully-connected operators,
facilitating a DNN/HW co-design flow. Our results show a whole DNN
sparse-over-dense inference speedup ranging from 1.41 up to 4.28, outperforming
commercial and literature-reported accelerator platforms.

Motivation: 研究分支切割算法中数据驱动方法在切割平面选择上的有效性，特别是两种评分函数的样本复杂度。

Method: 提出新的样本复杂度下界，适用于广泛的函数类，并通过图神经网络在整数规划模型中进行实证验证。

Result: 样本复杂度下界与已知上界接近，间隙闭合评分是分支切割树大小的有效代理。

Conclusion: 首次对两种评分函数进行理论和计算分析，为学习切割框架提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: In the recent years, branch-and-cut algorithms have been the target of
data-driven approaches designed to enhance the decision making in different
phases of the algorithm such as branching, or the choice of cutting planes
(cuts). In particular, for cutting plane selection two score functions have
been proposed in the literature to evaluate the quality of a cut:
branch-and-cut tree size and gap closed. In this paper, we present new sample
complexity lower bounds, valid for both scores. We show that for a wide family
of classes $\mathcal{F}$ that maps an instance to a cut, learning over an
unknown distribution of the instances to minimize those scores requires at
least (up to multiplicative constants) as many samples as learning from the
same class function $\mathcal{F}$ any generic target function (using square
loss). Our results also extend to the case of learning from a restricted set of
cuts, namely those from the Simplex tableau. To the best of our knowledge,
these constitute the first lower bounds for the learning-to-cut framework. We
compare our bounds to known upper bounds in the case of neural networks and
show they are nearly tight. We illustrate our results with a graph neural
network selection evaluated on set covering and facility location integer
programming models and we empirically show that the gap closed score is an
effective proxy to minimize the branch-and-cut tree size. Although the gap
closed score has been extensively used in the integer programming literature,
this is the first principled analysis discussing both scores at the same time
both theoretically and computationally.

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法比非引导数据生成少用一个数量级的数据样本即可学习控制器。

Conclusion: 该方法为在边缘情况和极限状态下稳定系统提供了可能，这些情况下数据收集通常困难且不稳定性高。

Abstract: Learning stabilizing controllers from data is an important task in
engineering applications; however, collecting informative data is challenging
because unstable systems often lead to rapidly growing or erratic trajectories.
In this work, we propose an adaptive sampling scheme that generates data while
simultaneously stabilizing the system to avoid instabilities during the data
collection. Under mild assumptions, the approach provably generates data sets
that are informative for stabilization and have minimal size. The numerical
experiments demonstrate that controller inference with the novel adaptive
sampling approach learns controllers with up to one order of magnitude fewer
data samples than unguided data generation. The results show that the proposed
approach opens the door to stabilizing systems in edge cases and limit states
where instabilities often occur and data collection is inherently difficult.

Motivation: PINNs在模拟地震波场时需对不同速度模型重新训练且收敛慢，限制了其效率。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著加速训练并在分布内外速度场景下保持高精度。

Conclusion: 潜在扩散策略有效提升了PINNs的初始化速度和适应性。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a powerful framework for
seismic wavefield modeling, yet they typically require time-consuming
retraining when applied to different velocity models. Moreover, their training
can suffer from slow convergence due to the complexity of of the wavefield
solution. To address these challenges, we introduce a latent diffusion-based
strategy for rapid and effective PINN initialization. First, we train multiple
PINNs to represent frequency-domain scattered wavefields for various velocity
models, then flatten each trained network's parameters into a one-dimensional
vector, creating a comprehensive parameter dataset. Next, we employ an
autoencoder to learn latent representations of these parameter vectors,
capturing essential patterns across diverse PINN's parameters. We then train a
conditional diffusion model to store the distribution of these latent vectors,
with the corresponding velocity models serving as conditions. Once trained,
this diffusion model can generate latent vectors corresponding to new velocity
models, which are subsequently decoded by the autoencoder into complete PINN
parameters. Experimental results indicate that our method significantly
accelerates training and maintains high accuracy across in-distribution and
out-of-distribution velocity scenarios.

Abstract: Defects are ubiquitous in solids and strongly influence materials' mechanical
and functional properties. However, non-destructive characterization and
quantification of defects, especially when multiple types coexist, remain a
long-standing challenge. Here we introduce DefectNet, a foundation machine
learning model that predicts the chemical identity and concentration of
substitutional point defects with multiple coexisting elements directly from
vibrational spectra, specifically phonon density-of-states (PDoS). Trained on
over 16,000 simulated spectra from 2,000 semiconductors, DefectNet employs a
tailored attention mechanism to identify up to six distinct defect elements at
concentrations ranging from 0.2% to 25%. The model generalizes well to unseen
crystals across 56 elements and can be fine-tuned on experimental data.
Validation using inelastic scattering measurements of SiGe alloys and MgB$_2$
superconductor demonstrates its accuracy and transferability. Our work
establishes vibrational spectroscopy as a viable, non-destructive probe for
point defect quantification in bulk materials, and highlights the promise of
foundation models in data-driven defect engineering.

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is a powerful technique for imaging
surfaces with atomic resolution, providing insight into physical and chemical
processes at the level of single atoms and molecules. A regular task of STM
image analysis is the identification and labelling of features of interest
against a uniform background. Performing this manually is a labour-intensive
task, requiring significant human effort. To reduce this burden, we propose an
automated approach to the segmentation of STM images that uses both few-shot
learning and unsupervised learning. Our technique offers greater flexibility
compared to previous supervised methods; it removes the requirement for large
manually annotated datasets and is thus easier to adapt to an unseen surface
while still maintaining a high accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by using it to recognise atomic features on three distinct
surfaces: Si(001), Ge(001), and TiO$_2$(110), including adsorbed AsH$_3$
molecules on the silicon and germanium surfaces. Our model exhibits strong
generalisation capabilities, and following initial training, can be adapted to
unseen surfaces with as few as one additional labelled data point. This work is
a significant step towards efficient and material-agnostic, automatic
segmentation of STM images.

Conclusion: 论文提出了AI工具的设计指南，强调保护人际联系和临床自主性，为高风险的临床环境提供了设计考虑。

Abstract: Serious illness conversations (SICs), discussions between clinical care teams
and patients with serious, life-limiting illnesses about their values, goals,
and care preferences, are critical for patient-centered care. Without these
conversations, patients often receive aggressive interventions that may not
align with their goals. Clinical care teams face significant barriers when
conducting serious illness conversations with older adult patients in Emergency
Department (ED) settings, where most older adult patients lack documented
treatment goals. To understand current practices and identify AI support
opportunities, we conducted interviews with two domain experts and nine ED
clinical care team members. Through thematic analysis, we characterized a
four-phase serious illness conversation workflow (identification, preparation,
conduction, documentation) and identified key needs and challenges at each
stage. Clinical care teams struggle with fragmented EHR data access, time
constraints, emotional preparation demands, and documentation burdens. While
participants expressed interest in AI tools for information synthesis,
conversational support, and automated documentation, they emphasized preserving
human connection and clinical autonomy. We present design guidelines for AI
tools supporting SIC workflows that fit within existing clinical practices.
This work contributes empirical understanding of ED-based serious illness
conversations and provides design considerations for AI in high-stakes clinical
environments.

*Mina Huh,Zihui Xue,Ujjaini Das,Kumar Ashutosh,Kristen Grauman,Amy Pavel*

Main category: cs.HC

TLDR: Vid2Coach是一个将教学视频转化为可穿戴设备辅助工具的系统，帮助盲人和低视力人群通过AI视觉辅助完成学习任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲人和低视力人群难以通过视觉比较学习视频内容，需要非视觉替代方案。

Method: 系统从视频生成详细指令，结合非视觉替代方案，并通过智能眼镜监控用户进度，提供反馈。

Result: 使用Vid2Coach的参与者错误率降低58.5%，并希望将其融入日常生活。

Conclusion: Vid2Coach展示了AI视觉辅助如何增强而非取代非视觉专业知识。

Abstract: People use videos to learn new recipes, exercises, and crafts. Such videos
remain difficult for blind and low vision (BLV) people to follow as they rely
on visual comparison. Our observations of visual rehabilitation therapists
(VRTs) guiding BLV people to follow how-to videos revealed that VRTs provide
both proactive and responsive support including detailed descriptions,
non-visual workarounds, and progress feedback. We propose Vid2Coach, a system
that transforms how-to videos into wearable camera-based assistants that
provide accessible instructions and mixed-initiative feedback. From the video,
Vid2Coach generates accessible instructions by augmenting narrated instructions
with demonstration details and completion criteria for each step. It then uses
retrieval-augmented-generation to extract relevant non-visual workarounds from
BLV-specific resources. Vid2Coach then monitors user progress with a camera
embedded in commercial smart glasses to provide context-aware instructions,
proactive feedback, and answers to user questions. BLV participants (N=8) using
Vid2Coach completed cooking tasks with 58.5\% fewer errors than when using
their typical workflow and wanted to use Vid2Coach in their daily lives.
Vid2Coach demonstrates an opportunity for AI visual assistance that strengthens
rather than replaces non-visual expertise.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于拓扑学的有限对话语义框架，通过将话语映射到固定语义空间中的开集，构建联合满足性的神经复合体，并提取关键组合不变量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为有限对话提供简洁且拓扑学驱动的语义解释，结合经典对偶理论和拓扑语义学，解决对话合并和逻辑一致性等问题。

Method: 将话语映射为开集，构建神经复合体，提取负神经、全局解释子空间等不变量，并通过Wolfram语言实现算法。

Result: 提出了负神经和全局解释子空间等工具，能够有效检测不一致性并枚举对话的逻辑后果，展示了计算可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架结合经典理论与现代拓扑数据分析，为对话语义提供了新的理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: We introduce a concise, topologically-motivated semantics for finite
dialogues by mapping each utterance to an open set in a fixed semantic space,
building the corresponding nerve complex of joint satisfiability, and
extracting fundamental combinatorial invariants:
  1. The negative nerve, which enumerates all finite collections of utterances
whose
  opens have empty intersection, providing a straightforward criterion for
merging
  separate transcripts without contradiction.
  2. The global interpretation subspace, the unique minimal open in which all
asserted
  utterances hold simultaneously, enabling effective enumeration of all logical
  consequences of the entire dialogue.
  3. A practical demonstration in the Wolfram Language, with algorithms for
constructing
  nerves, detecting inconsistencies, and computing the global interpretation,
thereby
  illustrating computational feasibility.
  Our framework is grounded in classical duality and topological semantics
(Stone duality, Priestley duality, Tarski's semantics, coherence-space methods,
Scott domains, topos semantics, and homotopy type theory) while drawing on
recent advances in topological data analysis and dialogue-based semantics.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于无约束连续优化的混合SAT求解方法，通过惩罚项处理非CNF约束，并展示了其在混合基准测试中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多应用需要处理非CNF约束（如XOR、基数约束等），但现有方法依赖盒约束，限制了无约束优化器的使用。

Method: 采用无约束连续优化和惩罚项来表示混合约束，结合理论分析和实验验证。

Result: 实验证明，无约束优化器（如Adam）能提升混合SAT求解的性能。

Conclusion: 结合连续优化和机器学习方法，为混合SAT求解提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem lies at the core of many
applications in combinatorial optimization, software verification,
cryptography, and machine learning. While state-of-the-art solvers have
demonstrated high efficiency in handling conjunctive normal form (CNF)
formulas, numerous applications require non-CNF (hybrid) constraints, such as
XOR, cardinality, and Not-All-Equal constraints. Recent work leverages
polynomial representations to represent such hybrid constraints, but it relies
on box constraints that can limit the use of powerful unconstrained optimizers.
In this paper, we propose unconstrained continuous optimization formulations
for hybrid SAT solving by penalty terms. We provide theoretical insights into
when these penalty terms are necessary and demonstrate empirically that
unconstrained optimizers (e.g., Adam) can enhance SAT solving on hybrid
benchmarks. Our results highlight the potential of combining continuous
optimization and machine-learning-based methods for effective hybrid SAT
solving.

Abstract: Can AI effectively perform complex econometric analysis traditionally
requiring human expertise? This paper evaluates an agentic AI's capability to
master econometrics, focusing on empirical analysis performance. We develop an
``Econometrics AI Agent'' built on the open-source MetaGPT framework. This
agent exhibits outstanding performance in: (1) planning econometric tasks
strategically, (2) generating and executing code, (3) employing error-based
reflection for improved robustness, and (4) allowing iterative refinement
through multi-round conversations. We construct two datasets from academic
coursework materials and published research papers to evaluate performance
against real-world challenges. Comparative testing shows our domain-specialized
agent significantly outperforms both benchmark large language models (LLMs) and
general-purpose AI agents. This work establishes a testbed for exploring AI's
impact on social science research and enables cost-effective integration of
domain expertise, making advanced econometric methods accessible to users with
minimal coding expertise. Furthermore, our agent enhances research
reproducibility and offers promising pedagogical applications for econometrics

Motivation: 新兴经济体（如MINT国家）在全球股市中影响力上升，但其仍受发达国家（如G7）经济条件影响，理解这些关系对投资者和政策制定者至关重要。

Method: 采用MTGNN算法分析2012至2024年G7和MINT国家的主要股市指数，考虑多元时间序列的复杂时空关系。

Result: MTGNN显示美国和加拿大在G7中最具影响力，印尼和土耳其在MINT中最具影响力，且MTGNN预测效果优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 研究为经济区块市场提供了有价值的见解，并展示了MTGNN在分析全球股市动态中的潜力。

Abstract: Emerging economies, particularly the MINT countries (Mexico, Indonesia,
Nigeria, and T\"urkiye), are gaining influence in global stock markets,
although they remain susceptible to the economic conditions of developed
countries like the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United
Kingdom, and the United States). This interconnectedness and sensitivity of
financial markets make understanding these relationships crucial for investors
and policymakers to predict stock price movements accurately. To this end, we
examined the main stock market indices of G7 and MINT countries from 2012 to
2024, using a recent graph neural network (GNN) algorithm called multivariate
time series forecasting with graph neural network (MTGNN). This method allows
for considering complex spatio-temporal connections in multivariate time
series. In the implementations, MTGNN revealed that the US and Canada are the
most influential G7 countries regarding stock indices in the forecasting
process, and Indonesia and T\"urkiye are the most influential MINT countries.
Additionally, our results showed that MTGNN outperformed traditional methods in
forecasting the prices of stock market indices for MINT and G7 countries.
Consequently, the study offers valuable insights into economic blocks' markets
and presents a compelling empirical approach to analyzing global stock market
dynamics using MTGNN.

*Yuan Gan,Jiaxu Miao,Yunze Wang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.GR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Silencer的两阶段方法，用于主动保护肖像隐私，防止基于LDM的说话头动画技术滥用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于基于LDM的说话头动画技术可能被滥用于诈骗、政治操纵和虚假信息，解决这些伦理问题成为AI安全领域的紧迫任务。

Method: Silencer通过两阶段方法：1）提出零化损失以忽略音频控制；2）在LDM中应用抗净化损失，优化潜在特征以生成鲁棒扰动。

Result: 实验证明Silencer能有效保护肖像隐私。

Conclusion: 该研究旨在提高AI安全社区对说话头生成技术相关伦理问题的关注。

Abstract: Advances in talking-head animation based on Latent Diffusion Models (LDM)
enable the creation of highly realistic, synchronized videos. These fabricated
videos are indistinguishable from real ones, increasing the risk of potential
misuse for scams, political manipulation, and misinformation. Hence, addressing
these ethical concerns has become a pressing issue in AI security. Recent
proactive defense studies focused on countering LDM-based models by adding
perturbations to portraits. However, these methods are ineffective at
protecting reference portraits from advanced image-to-video animation. The
limitations are twofold: 1) they fail to prevent images from being manipulated
by audio signals, and 2) diffusion-based purification techniques can
effectively eliminate protective perturbations. To address these challenges, we
propose Silencer, a two-stage method designed to proactively protect the
privacy of portraits. First, a nullifying loss is proposed to ignore audio
control in talking-head generation. Second, we apply anti-purification loss in
LDM to optimize the inverted latent feature to generate robust perturbations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Silencer in proactively
protecting portrait privacy. We hope this work will raise awareness among the
AI security community regarding critical ethical issues related to talking-head
generation techniques. Code: https://github.com/yuangan/Silencer.

Main category: cs.GR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的文本引导3D编辑方法Pro3D-Editor，通过渐进式视图范式解决多视图编辑不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多视图编辑中存在不一致性，无法充分利用不同视图间的依赖关系。

Method: 提出Pro3D-Editor框架，包括Primary-view Sampler、Key-view Render和Full-view Refiner三部分，通过渐进式传播编辑语义实现一致编辑。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在编辑准确性和空间一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 渐进式视图范式能有效提升3D编辑的一致性和准确性。

Abstract: Text-guided 3D editing aims to precisely edit semantically relevant local 3D
regions, which has significant potential for various practical applications
ranging from 3D games to film production. Existing methods typically follow a
view-indiscriminate paradigm: editing 2D views indiscriminately and projecting
them back into 3D space. However, they overlook the different cross-view
interdependencies, resulting in inconsistent multi-view editing. In this study,
we argue that ideal consistent 3D editing can be achieved through a
\textit{progressive-views paradigm}, which propagates editing semantics from
the editing-salient view to other editing-sparse views. Specifically, we
propose \textit{Pro3D-Editor}, a novel framework, which mainly includes
Primary-view Sampler, Key-view Render, and Full-view Refiner. Primary-view
Sampler dynamically samples and edits the most editing-salient view as the
primary view. Key-view Render accurately propagates editing semantics from the
primary view to other key views through its Mixture-of-View-Experts Low-Rank
Adaption (MoVE-LoRA). Full-view Refiner edits and refines the 3D object based
on the edited multi-views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing methods in editing accuracy and spatial consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法在分布表示上无法同时实现快速和表达力强，因此需要一种更优的解决方案。

Method: 将2D分布分解为两个1D概率分布函数，用神经网络建模离散坐标的分布，并通过插值实现任意位置的评估和采样。训练时最大化学习分布与目标分布的相似性，并使用额外网络缓存入射辐射以减少梯度方差。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂光传输场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在表达力和效率上取得了平衡，适用于复杂渲染任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural path guiding method to aid with Monte
Carlo (MC) integration in rendering. Existing neural methods utilize
distribution representations that are either fast or expressive, but not both.
We propose a simple, but effective, representation that is sufficiently
expressive and reasonably fast. Specifically, we break down the 2D distribution
over the directional domain into two 1D probability distribution functions
(PDF). We propose to model each 1D PDF using a neural network that estimates
the distribution at a set of discrete coordinates. The PDF at an arbitrary
location can then be evaluated and sampled through interpolation. To train the
network, we maximize the similarity of the learned and target distributions. To
reduce the variance of the gradient during optimizations and estimate the
normalization factor, we propose to cache the incoming radiance using an
additional network. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our
approach is better than the existing methods, particularly in challenging
scenes with complex light transport.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字创作者在将创意转化为精确的相机运动时面临瓶颈，现有系统通常忽略主体的方向和体积，限制了空间感知能力。

Method: LensCraft 结合了数据驱动的方法，使用高保真模拟框架生成训练数据，并通过先进的神经模型实现对脚本的忠实执行和对主体动态行为的感知。

Result: LensCraft 在静态和动态场景中表现出前所未有的准确性和一致性，同时降低了计算复杂度并提高了推理速度。

Conclusion: LensCraft 为智能相机系统设定了新的基准，提供了灵活的输入控制和高质量输出，相关资源已公开。

Abstract: Digital creators, from indie filmmakers to animation studios, face a
persistent bottleneck: translating their creative vision into precise camera
movements. Despite significant progress in computer vision and artificial
intelligence, current automated filming systems struggle with a fundamental
trade-off between mechanical execution and creative intent. Crucially, almost
all previous works simplify the subject to a single point-ignoring its
orientation and true volume-severely limiting spatial awareness during filming.
LensCraft solves this problem by mimicking the expertise of a professional
cinematographer, using a data-driven approach that combines cinematographic
principles with the flexibility to adapt to dynamic scenes in real time. Our
solution combines a specialized simulation framework for generating
high-fidelity training data with an advanced neural model that is faithful to
the script while being aware of the volume and dynamic behavior of the subject.
Additionally, our approach allows for flexible control via various input
modalities, including text prompts, subject trajectory and volume, key points,
or a full camera trajectory, offering creators a versatile tool to guide camera
movements in line with their vision. Leveraging a lightweight real time
architecture, LensCraft achieves markedly lower computational complexity and
faster inference while maintaining high output quality. Extensive evaluation
across static and dynamic scenarios reveals unprecedented accuracy and
coherence, setting a new benchmark for intelligent camera systems compared to
state-of-the-art models. Extended results, the complete dataset, simulation
environment, trained model weights, and source code are publicly accessible on
LensCraft Webpage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D动画制作需要专业技能且耗时，现有生成方法计算量大且速度慢。

Method: 将3D动画转化为场预测任务，利用LLMs和VLMs生成函数，通过文本指令实时更新3D高斯属性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能通过简单文本指令生成动态VFX，显著减少手动操作。

Conclusion: 该方法为语言驱动的3D内容创作提供了快速且易用的途径，有望进一步普及VFX制作。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are key to immersion in modern films, games, and AR/VR.
Creating 3D effects requires specialized expertise and training in 3D animation
software and can be time consuming. Generative solutions typically rely on
computationally intense methods such as diffusion models which can be slow at
4D inference. We reformulate 3D animation as a field prediction task and
introduce a text-driven framework that infers a time-varying 4D flow field
acting on 3D Gaussians. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) for function generation, our approach interprets
arbitrary prompts (e.g., "make the vase glow orange, then explode") and
instantly updates color, opacity, and positions of 3D Gaussians in real time.
This design avoids overheads such as mesh extraction, manual or physics-based
simulations and allows both novice and expert users to animate volumetric
scenes with minimal effort on a consumer device even in a web browser.
Experimental results show that simple textual instructions suffice to generate
compelling time-varying VFX, reducing the manual effort typically required for
rigging or advanced modeling. We thus present a fast and accessible pathway to
language-driven 3D content creation that can pave the way to democratize VFX
further.

Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在生成高质量图像时，常因提示中的概念组合与学习先验矛盾而失败。

Method: 使用大语言模型分析目标提示，生成代理提示序列，确保语义连贯并与去噪阶段对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种挑战性提示下显著提高了图像与文本的对齐度。

Conclusion: 通过阶段感知的提示分解，实现了对语义的精细控制和准确的图像生成。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse
images from natural language prompts. However, they often fail to produce
semantically accurate results when the prompt contains concept combinations
that contradict their learned priors. We define this failure mode as contextual
contradiction, where one concept implicitly negates another due to entangled
associations learned during training. To address this, we propose a stage-aware
prompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a
sequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the
semantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while
ensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a
large language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify
contradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original
intent while resolving contextual conflicts. By aligning prompt information
with the denoising progression, our method enables fine-grained semantic
control and accurate image generation in the presence of contextual
contradictions. Experiments across a variety of challenging prompts show
substantial improvements in alignment to the textual prompt.

Abstract: Multi-agent large language models (MA-LLMs) are a rapidly growing research
area that leverages multiple interacting language agents to tackle complex

to address the lack of direct comparisons in the field, illustrating how
factors like scalability, communication structure, and decision-making
processes influence MA-LLM performance. By examining frequent practices and
outlining current challenges, the review reveals that multi-agent approaches

Motivation: 探讨当前对‘Agentic AI’和‘Multiagentic AI’的滥用，澄清其与已有AI概念的混淆，促进科学严谨性。

Method: 回顾‘agentic’的理论起源（如Bandura和Dennett的研究），总结智能代理和多代理系统的基础工作，分析经典代理架构，并讨论基于大语言模型（LLM）的最新发展。

Conclusion: 提倡在LLM为基础的AI代理研究中，采用已有术语和知识，避免重复发明轮子。

Abstract: The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in
discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe
autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the
use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in
AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers
a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical
origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical
notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational
works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and
others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to
Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy,
reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then
discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms
based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source
multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is
often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI
Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades
of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The
article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of
established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the
wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system
platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms,
agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual
organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of
LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.

Main category: stat.ML

TLDR: MOVDA是一种改进传统评分系统的方法，通过利用真实胜利分差与模型预期之间的差异，提供更精确的技能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评分系统（如ELO）仅关注二元结果，忽略了胜利分差等关键信息。MOVDA旨在通过整合这些信息提升评分准确性。

Method: MOVDA引入一个领域特定的非线性函数（缩放双曲正切函数）预测预期胜利分差，并利用真实与预期分差的差异更新评分。

Result: 在NBA数据上的实验表明，MOVDA显著优于ELO和贝叶斯基线，预测误差降低1.54%，准确性提高0.58%，收敛速度加快13.5%。

Conclusion: MOVDA提供了一种理论合理、实证优越且计算高效的方法，适用于NBA等竞争环境中的技能评分。

Abstract: Knowledge of accurate relative skills in any competitive system is essential,
but foundational approaches such as ELO discard extremely relevant performance
data by concentrating exclusively on binary outcomes. While margin of victory
(MOV) extensions exist, they often lack a definitive method for incorporating
this information. We introduce Margin of Victory Differential Analysis (MOVDA),
a framework that enhances traditional rating systems by using the deviation
between the true MOV and a $\textit{modeled expectation}$. MOVDA learns a
domain-specific, non-linear function (a scaled hyperbolic tangent that captures
saturation effects and home advantage) to predict expected MOV based on rating
differentials. Crucially, the $\textit{difference}$ between the true and
expected MOV provides a subtle and weighted signal for rating updates,
highlighting informative deviations in all levels of contests. Extensive
experiments on professional NBA basketball data (from 2013 to 2023, with 13,619
games) show that MOVDA significantly outperforms standard ELO and Bayesian
baselines. MOVDA reduces Brier score prediction error by $1.54\%$ compared to
TrueSkill, increases outcome accuracy by $0.58\%$, and most importantly
accelerates rating convergence by $13.5\%$, while maintaining the computational
efficiency of the original ELO updates. MOVDA offers a theoretically motivated,
empirically superior, and computationally lean approach to integrating
performance magnitude into skill rating for competitive environments like the
NBA.

Motivation: 研究椭圆微分算子特征对的估计问题，特别是在无监督学习中广泛使用的图拉普拉斯算子的近似性能。

Method: 假设分布$ho$属于特定族且流形$M$具有有界几何，分析极小极大风险率，并验证图拉普拉斯算子在数据极限下的表现。

Result: 证明了特征对估计的极小极大风险率为$n^{-2/(d+4)}$，并验证了图拉普拉斯算子在更强正则条件下的性能。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了图基学习的文献，提供了更强的误差度量范式和更广泛的收敛速率适用范围。

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating eigenpairs of elliptic differential
operators from samples of a distribution $\rho$ supported on a manifold $M$.
The operators discussed in the paper are relevant in unsupervised learning and
in particular are obtained by taking suitable scaling limits of widely used
graph Laplacians over data clouds. We study the minimax risk for this eigenpair
estimation problem and explore the rates of approximation that can be achieved
by commonly used graph Laplacians built from random data. More concretely,
assuming that $\rho$ belongs to a certain family of distributions with
controlled second derivatives, and assuming that the $d$-dimensional manifold
$M$ where $\rho$ is supported has bounded geometry, we prove that the
statistical minimax rate for approximating eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the
$H^1(M)$-sense is $n^{-2/(d+4)}$, a rate that matches the minimax rate for a
closely related density estimation problem. We then revisit the literature
studying Laplacians over proximity graphs in the large data limit and prove
that, under slightly stronger regularity assumptions on the data generating
model, eigenpairs of graph Laplacians induce manifold agnostic estimators with
an error of approximation that, up to logarithmic corrections, matches our
lower bounds. Our analysis allows us to expand the existing literature on
graph-based learning in at least two significant ways: 1) we consider stronger
norms to measure the error of approximation than the ones that had been
analyzed in the past; 2) our rates of convergence are uniform over a family of
smooth distributions and do not just apply to densities with special
symmetries, and, as a consequence of our lower bounds, are essentially sharp
when the connectivity of the graph is sufficiently high.

*Atsushi Suzuki*

Main category: stat.ML

TLDR: 研究探讨了机器学习模型规模扩大是否持续带来成功，提出了一种新的泛化误差上界，仅依赖于数据的Rényi熵，表明即使模型规模极大，只要数据量足够，仍能保持低泛化误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大规模机器学习模型的泛化误差行为，传统方法无法完全解释超大模型的成功。

Method: 建立模型无关的泛化误差上界，适用于仅由数据直方图决定的算法（如经验风险最小化或梯度方法），并证明其仅依赖于数据分布的Rényi熵。

Result: 泛化误差上界仅与Rényi熵相关，数据量足够时，即使模型规模极大也能保持低误差；噪声注入导致性能下降与Rényi熵增加相关。

Conclusion: 数据分布的Rényi熵是泛化误差的关键因素，数据量与之匹配时学习才能成功，提出的泛化误差上界具有紧致性。

Abstract: Will further scaling up of machine learning models continue to bring success?
A significant challenge in answering this question lies in understanding
generalization error, which is the impact of overfitting. Understanding
generalization error behavior of increasingly large-scale machine learning
models remains a significant area of investigation, as conventional analyses
often link error bounds to model complexity, failing to fully explain the
success of extremely large architectures. This research introduces a novel
perspective by establishing a model-independent upper bound for generalization
error applicable to algorithms whose outputs are determined solely by the
data's histogram, such as empirical risk minimization or gradient-based
methods. Crucially, this bound is shown to depend only on the R\'enyi entropy
of the data-generating distribution, suggesting that a small generalization
error can be maintained even with arbitrarily large models, provided the data
quantity is sufficient relative to this entropy. This framework offers a direct
explanation for the phenomenon where generalization performance degrades
significantly upon injecting random noise into data, where the performance
degrade is attributed to the consequent increase in the data distribution's
R\'enyi entropy. Furthermore, we adapt the no-free-lunch theorem to be
data-distribution-dependent, demonstrating that an amount of data corresponding
to the R\'enyi entropy is indeed essential for successful learning, thereby
highlighting the tightness of our proposed generalization bound.

Motivation: 传统PCA假设数据位于欧几里得空间，而实际数据（如医学图像）可能位于黎曼流形上，缺乏向量空间操作。现有方法（如PGA）对一般数据集适用性有限。

Method: 提出了一种广义框架R-PCA，通过为数据表配备局部度量，将PCA方法扩展到黎曼流形上。

Result: R-PCA提供了一种统一的降维和统计分析方法，适用于具有局部距离结构的数据集。

Conclusion: R-PCA扩展了PCA的适用范围，为具有内在几何特性的数据集提供了新的分析可能性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative extension of Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) that transcends the traditional assumption of data lying in Euclidean
space, enabling its application to data on Riemannian manifolds. The primary
challenge addressed is the lack of vector space operations on such manifolds.
Fletcher et al., in their work {\em Principal Geodesic Analysis for the Study
of Nonlinear Statistics of Shape}, proposed Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA)
as a geometric approach to analyze data on Riemannian manifolds, particularly
effective for structured datasets like medical images, where the manifold's
intrinsic structure is apparent. However, PGA's applicability is limited when
dealing with general datasets that lack an implicit local distance notion. In
this work, we introduce a generalized framework, termed {\em Riemannian
Principal Component Analysis (R-PCA)}, to extend PGA for any data endowed with
a local distance structure. Specifically, we adapt the PCA methodology to
Riemannian manifolds by equipping data tables with local metrics, enabling the
incorporation of manifold geometry. This framework provides a unified approach
for dimensionality reduction and statistical analysis directly on manifolds,
opening new possibilities for datasets with region-specific or part-specific
distance notions, ensuring respect for their intrinsic geometric properties.

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模功能数据分析提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Varying coefficient models are popular for estimating nonlinear regression
functions in functional data models. Their Bayesian variants have received
limited attention in large data applications, primarily due to prohibitively
slow posterior computations using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.
We introduce Bayesian data sketching for varying coefficient models to obviate
computational challenges presented by large sample sizes. To address the
challenges of analyzing large data, we compress the functional response vector
and predictor matrix by a random linear transformation to achieve dimension
reduction and conduct inference on the compressed data. Our approach
distinguishes itself from several existing methods for analyzing large
functional data in that it requires neither the development of new models or
algorithms, nor any specialized computational hardware while delivering fully
model-based Bayesian inference. Well-established methods and algorithms for
varying coefficient regression models can be applied to the compressed data.

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，LR-FFS在不同客户端环境下表现优异，且能控制假发现率。

Conclusion: LR-FFS是一种高效、鲁棒且隐私保护的特征筛选方法，适用于标签偏移的联邦学习场景。

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are important tools for high-dimensional
classification of large datasets. To reduce computational costs and overcome
the curse of dimensionality, feature screening plays a pivotal role in
eliminating irrelevant features during data preprocessing. However, data
heterogeneity, particularly label shifting across different clients, presents
significant challenges for feature screening. This paper introduces a general
framework that unifies existing screening methods and proposes a novel utility,
label-shift robust federated feature screening (LR-FFS), along with its
federated estimation procedure. The framework facilitates a uniform analysis of
methods and systematically characterizes their behaviors under label shift
conditions. Building upon this framework, LR-FFS leverages conditional
distribution functions and expectations to address label shift without adding
computational burdens and remains robust against model misspecification and
outliers. Additionally, the federated procedure ensures computational
efficiency and privacy protection while maintaining screening effectiveness
comparable to centralized processing. We also provide a false discovery rate
(FDR) control method for federated feature screening. Experimental results and
theoretical analyses demonstrate LR-FFS's superior performance across diverse
client environments, including those with varying class distributions, sample
sizes, and missing categorical data.

Method: 引入两个新假设（排名无直接影响和用户行为模型在排名嵌入空间），并提出GMIPS估计器及其变体MRIPS。

Result: GMIPS在实验中表现出最低的MSE，MRIPS在偏差和方差之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: GMIPS和MRIPS为大规模排名动作空间中的离策略评估提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) in ranking settings with large ranking action
spaces, which stems from an increase in both the number of unique actions and
length of the ranking, is essential for assessing new recommender policies
using only logged bandit data from previous versions. To address the high
variance issues associated with existing estimators, we introduce two new
assumptions: no direct effect on rankings and user behavior model on ranking
embedding spaces. We then propose the generalized marginalized inverse
propensity score (GMIPS) estimator with statistically desirable properties
compared to existing ones. Finally, we demonstrate that the GMIPS achieves the
lowest MSE. Notably, among GMIPS variants, the marginalized reward interaction
IPS (MRIPS) incorporates a doubly marginalized importance weight based on a
cascade behavior assumption on ranking embeddings. MRIPS effectively balances
the trade-off between bias and variance, even as the ranking action spaces
increase and the above assumptions may not hold, as evidenced by our
experiments.

Method: 提出两种分数匹配变体：重要性加权（IW）方法和变分方法，分别针对不同数据维度和样本量场景。

Result: IW方法在低维小样本中表现优异，变分方法在高维复杂数据中效果显著，并在图形模型估计任务中验证。

Conclusion: 两种方法在不同场景下各有优势，为缺失数据下的分数匹配提供了灵活解决方案。

Abstract: Score matching is a vital tool for learning the distribution of data with
applications across many areas including diffusion processes, energy based
modelling, and graphical model estimation. Despite all these applications,
little work explores its use when data is incomplete. We address this by
adapting score matching (and its major extensions) to work with missing data in
a flexible setting where data can be partially missing over any subset of the
coordinates. We provide two separate score matching variations for general use,
an importance weighting (IW) approach, and a variational approach. We provide
finite sample bounds for our IW approach in finite domain settings and show it
to have especially strong performance in small sample lower dimensional cases.
Complementing this, we show our variational approach to be strongest in more
complex high-dimensional settings which we demonstrate on graphical model
estimation tasks on both real and simulated data.

Result: 算法在奖励标签有限或昂贵的情况下，提高了样本效率，并具有理论保证。

Conclusion: GLMDP框架和算法为非线性奖励场景提供了有效的解决方案，扩展了线性MDP的适用性。

Abstract: The linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework offers a principled
foundation for reinforcement learning (RL) with strong theoretical guarantees
and sample efficiency. However, its restrictive assumption-that both transition
dynamics and reward functions are linear in the same feature space-limits its
applicability in real-world domains, where rewards often exhibit nonlinear or
discrete structures. Motivated by applications such as healthcare and
e-commerce, where data is scarce and reward signals can be binary or
count-valued, we propose the Generalized Linear MDP (GLMDP) framework-an
extension of the linear MDP framework-that models rewards using generalized
linear models (GLMs) while maintaining linear transition dynamics. We establish
the Bellman completeness of GLMDPs with respect to a new function class that
accommodates nonlinear rewards and develop two offline RL algorithms:
Generalized Pessimistic Value Iteration (GPEVI) and a semi-supervised variant
(SS-GPEVI) that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled trajectories. Our
algorithms achieve theoretical guarantees on policy suboptimality and
demonstrate improved sample efficiency in settings where reward labels are
expensive or limited.

Abstract: Density ratio estimation (DRE) is a paramount task in machine learning, for
its broad applications across multiple domains, such as covariate shift
adaptation, causal inference, independence tests and beyond. Parametric methods
for estimating the density ratio possibly lead to biased results if models are
misspecified, while conventional non-parametric methods suffer from the curse
of dimensionality when the dimension of data is large. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel approach for DRE based on the
projection pursuit (PP) approximation. The proposed method leverages PP to
mitigate the impact of high dimensionality while retaining the model
flexibility needed for the accuracy of DRE. We establish the consistency and
the convergence rate for the proposed estimator. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing alternatives in
various applications.

Abstract: Integral equations are widely used in fields such as applied modeling,
medical imaging, and system identification, providing a powerful framework for
solving deterministic problems. While parameter identification for differential
equations has been extensively studied, the focus on integral equations,
particularly stochastic Volterra integral equations, remains limited. This
research addresses the parameter identification problem, also known as the
equation reconstruction problem, in Volterra integral equations driven by
Gaussian noise. We propose an improved deep neural networks framework for
estimating unknown parameters in the drift term of these equations. The network
represents the primary variables and their integrals, enhancing parameter
estimation accuracy by incorporating inter-output relationships into the loss
function. Additionally, the framework extends beyond parameter identification
to predict the system's behavior outside the integration interval. Prediction
accuracy is validated by comparing predicted and true trajectories using a 95%
confidence interval. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed deep neural networks framework in both parameter identification and
prediction tasks, showing robust performance under varying noise levels and
providing accurate solutions for modeling stochastic systems.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models are often trained in a setting where the
number of parameters exceeds the number of training samples. To understand the
implicit bias of gradient descent in such overparameterized models, prior work
has studied diagonal linear neural networks in the regression setting. These
studies have shown that, when initialized with small weights, gradient descent
tends to favor solutions with minimal $\ell^1$-norm - an effect known as
implicit regularization. In this paper, we investigate implicit regularization
in diagonal linear neural networks of depth $D\ge 2$ for overparameterized
linear regression problems. We focus on analyzing the approximation error
between the limit point of gradient flow trajectories and the solution to the
$\ell^1$-minimization problem. By deriving tight upper and lower bounds on the
approximation error, we precisely characterize how the approximation error
depends on the scale of initialization $\alpha$. Our results reveal a
qualitative difference between depths: for $D \ge 3$, the error decreases
linearly with $\alpha$, whereas for $D=2$, it decreases at rate
$\alpha^{1-\varrho}$, where the parameter $\varrho \in [0,1)$ can be explicitly
characterized. Interestingly, this parameter is closely linked to so-called
null space property constants studied in the sparse recovery literature. We
demonstrate the asymptotic tightness of our bounds through explicit examples.
Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings and suggest that
deeper networks, i.e., $D \ge 3$, may lead to better generalization,
particularly for realistic initialization scales.

Abstract: Despite tremendous advancements of machine learning models and algorithms in
various application domains, they are known to be vulnerable to subtle, natural
or intentionally crafted perturbations in future input data, known as
adversarial attacks. While numerous adversarial learning methods have been
proposed, fundamental questions about their statistical optimality in robust
loss remain largely unanswered. In particular, the minimax rate of convergence
and the construction of rate-optimal estimators under future $X$-attacks are
yet to be worked out.
  In this paper, we address this issue in the context of nonparametric
regression, under suitable assumptions on the smoothness of the regression
function and the geometric structure of the input perturbation set. We first
establish the minimax rate of convergence under adversarial $L_q$-risks with $1
\leq q \leq \infty$ and propose a piecewise local polynomial estimator that
achieves the minimax optimality. The established minimax rate elucidates how
the smoothness level and perturbation magnitude affect the fundamental limit of
adversarial learning under future $X$-attacks. Furthermore, we construct a
data-driven adaptive estimator that is shown to achieve, within a logarithmic
factor, the optimal rate across a broad scale of nonparametric and adversarial
classes.

Abstract: We study the problem of clustering $T$ trajectories of length $H$, each
generated by one of $K$ unknown ergodic Markov chains over a finite state space
of size $S$. The goal is to accurately group trajectories according to their
underlying generative model. We begin by deriving an instance-dependent,
high-probability lower bound on the clustering error rate, governed by the
weighted KL divergence between the transition kernels of the chains. We then
present a novel two-stage clustering algorithm. In Stage~I, we apply spectral
clustering using a new injective Euclidean embedding for ergodic Markov chains
-- a contribution of independent interest that enables sharp concentration
results. Stage~II refines the initial clusters via a single step of
likelihood-based reassignment. Our method achieves a near-optimal clustering
error with high probability, under the conditions $H =
\tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} (S^2 \vee \pi_{\min}^{-1}))$ and $TH =
\tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} S^2 )$, where $\pi_{\min}$ is the
minimum stationary probability of a state across the $K$ chains and
$\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}$ is the minimum pseudo-spectral gap. These requirements
provide significant improvements, if not at least comparable, to the
state-of-the-art guarantee (Kausik et al., 2023), and moreover, our algorithm
offers a key practical advantage: unlike existing approach, it requires no
prior knowledge of model-specific quantities (e.g., separation between kernels
or visitation probabilities). We conclude by discussing the inherent gap
between our upper and lower bounds, providing insights into the unique
structure of this clustering problem.

Conclusion: sig-MMD是有效的路径空间分布比较工具，但需注意数据限制下的错误风险，并采用相应技术优化。

Abstract: Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is a widely used concept in machine learning
research which has gained popularity in recent years as a highly effective tool
for comparing (finite-dimensional) distributions. Since it is designed as a
kernel-based method, the MMD can be extended to path space valued distributions
using the signature kernel. The resulting signature MMD (sig-MMD) can be used
to define a metric between distributions on path space. Similarly to the
original use case of the MMD as a test statistic within a two-sample testing
framework, the sig-MMD can be applied to determine if two sets of paths are
drawn from the same stochastic process. This work is dedicated to understanding
the possibilities and challenges associated with applying the sig-MMD as a
statistical tool in practice. We introduce and explain the sig-MMD, and provide
easily accessible and verifiable examples for its practical use. We present
examples that can lead to Type 2 errors in the hypothesis test, falsely
indicating that samples have been drawn from the same underlying process (which
generally occurs in a limited data setting). We then present techniques to
mitigate the occurrence of this type of error.

Result: 算法理论严谨，可与神经网络无缝集成，无需数据即可学习目标轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法为后验路径测度采样提供了理论支持，并展示了与神经网络结合的潜力。

Abstract: We propose algorithms for sampling from posterior path measures $P(C([0, T],
\mathbb{R}^d))$ under a general prior process. This leverages ideas from (1)
controlled equilibrium dynamics, which gradually transport between two path
measures, and (2) optimization in $\infty$-dimensional probability space
endowed with a Wasserstein metric, which can be used to evolve a density curve
under the specified likelihood. The resulting algorithms are theoretically
grounded and can be integrated seamlessly with neural networks for learning the
target trajectory ensembles, without access to data.

*Aladin Djuhera,Swanand Ravindra Kadhe,Farhan Ahmed,Syed Zawad,Holger Boche,Walid Saad*

Main category: cs.CY

TLDR: 研究发现，电信领域微调的大语言模型（LLMs）可能损害模型安全性，即使使用无害数据集也会导致安全退化。通过实验验证了三种安全重对齐防御方法的有效性，提出安全电信模型（SafeCOMM）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨电信领域微调LLMs时可能引发的安全性退化问题，并提出解决方案。

Method: 使用三种电信数据集（如3GPP标准）分析安全性退化，并评估三种防御方法（SafeInstruct、SafeLoRA、SafeMERGE）。

Result: 实验证明防御方法能有效恢复模型安全性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 强调安全感知的微调对电信LLMs的重要性，并提供实用指南。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for telecom tasks and datasets is a
common practice to adapt general-purpose models to the telecom domain. However,
little attention has been paid to how this process may compromise model safety.
Recent research has shown that even benign fine-tuning can degrade the safety
alignment of LLMs, causing them to respond to harmful or unethical user
queries. In this paper, we investigate this issue for telecom-tuned LLMs using
three representative datasets featured by the GenAINet initiative. We show that
safety degradation persists even for structured and seemingly harmless datasets
such as 3GPP standards and tabular records, indicating that telecom-specific
data is not immune to safety erosion during fine-tuning. We further extend our
analysis to publicly available Telecom LLMs trained via continual pre-training,
revealing that safety alignment is often severely lacking, primarily due to the
omission of safety-focused instruction tuning. To address these issues in both
fine-tuned and pre-trained models, we conduct extensive experiments and
evaluate three safety realignment defenses (SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, and
SafeMERGE) using established red-teaming benchmarks. The results show that,
across all settings, the proposed defenses can effectively restore safety after
harmful degradation without compromising downstream task performance, leading
to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models. In a nutshell, our work serves as
a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety realignment in telecom-tuned
LLMs, and emphasizes the importance of safety-aware instruction and fine-tuning
for real-world deployments of Telecom LLMs.

TLDR: 研究评估了针对成人语音的匿名化技术在儿童语音上的效果，发现其能保护隐私但实用性下降明显，且自动评估方法在儿童语音质量上存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童在语音技术中代表性不足且隐私易受侵犯，但针对其语音的匿名化技术研究较少，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用三个儿童数据集和六种匿名化方法，结合客观和主观评价指标进行评估。

Result: 现有成人匿名化系统能保护儿童语音隐私，但实用性显著下降；主观研究显示自动评估方法在儿童语音质量上存在不足。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以改进儿童语音匿名化技术及其评估方法。

Abstract: Children are one of the most under-represented groups in speech technologies,
as well as one of the most vulnerable in terms of privacy. Despite this,
anonymization techniques targeting this population have received little
attention. In this study, we seek to bridge this gap, and establish a baseline
for the use of voice anonymization techniques designed for adult speech when
applied to children's voices. Such an evaluation is essential, as children's
speech presents a distinct set of challenges when compared to that of adults.
This study comprises three children's datasets, six anonymization methods, and
objective and subjective utility metrics for evaluation. Our results show that
existing systems for adults are still able to protect children's voice privacy,
but suffer from much higher utility degradation. In addition, our subjective
study displays the challenges of automatic evaluation methods for speech
quality in children's speech, highlighting the need for further research.

TLDR: 政府允许公司使用AI进行年龄验证将导致系统易被绕过且对少数群体和低收入用户分类不公，类似系统（如面部识别和远程监考软件）已证明此问题难以解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI年龄验证系统的潜在问题，尤其是其偏见和易被绕过的缺陷。

Method: 通过类比其他类似系统（如面部识别和远程监考软件）的历史问题，预测AI年龄验证系统的局限性。

Result: AI年龄验证系统在技术和硬件限制下难以克服偏见，成本效益低于基于政府ID的验证。

Conclusion: 在短期内部署AI年龄验证系统是不明智的。

Abstract: In the near future a governmental body will be asked to allow companies to
use AI for age verification. If they allow it the resulting system will both be
easily circumvented and disproportionately misclassify minorities and low
socioeconomic status users. This is predictable by showing that other very
similar systems (facial recognition and remote proctoring software) have
similar issues despite years of efforts to mitigate their biases. These biases
are due to technical limitations both of the AI models themselves and the
physical hardware they are running on that will be difficult to overcome below
the cost of government ID-based age verification. Thus in, the near future,
deploying an AI system for age verification is folly.

Conclusion: 早期讨论有助于平衡自动化产品开发的机遇与风险，推动理解和规范制定。

Abstract: Humanity is progressing towards automated product development, a trend that
promises faster creation of better products and thus the acceleration of
technological progress. However, increasing reliance on non-human agents for
this process introduces many risks. This perspective aims to initiate a
discussion on these risks and appropriate mitigation strategies. To this end,
we outline a set of principles for safer AI-driven product development which
emphasize human oversight, accountability, and explainable design, among
others. The risk assessment covers both technical risks which affect product
quality and safety, and sociotechnical risks which affect society. While
AI-driven product development is still in its early stages, this discussion
will help balance its opportunities and risks without delaying essential
progress in understanding, norm-setting, and regulation.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的兴起，提示工程师这一新职位逐渐受到关注，但对其技能需求和市场普及度尚缺乏深入了解。

Method: 通过分析LinkedIn上的20,662个职位发布（含72个提示工程师职位），研究其技能需求和市场占比。

Result: 提示工程师职位占比不足0.5%，但技能组合独特，包括AI知识、提示设计、沟通能力和创造性解决问题能力。

Conclusion: 提示工程师正成为独立职业，研究结果有助于求职者、雇主和教育机构更好地理解这一新兴领域。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created a new job role: the
Prompt Engineer. Despite growing interest in this position, we still do not
fully understand what skills this new job role requires or how common these
jobs are. We analyzed 20,662 job postings on LinkedIn, including 72 prompt
engineer positions, to learn more about this emerging role. We found that
prompt engineering is still rare (less than 0.5% of sampled job postings) but
has a unique skill profile. Prompt engineers need AI knowledge (22.8%), prompt
design skills (18.7%), good communication (21.9%), and creative problem-solving
(15.8%) skills. These requirements significantly differ from those of
established roles, such as data scientists and machine learning engineers,
showing that prompt engineering is becoming its own profession. Our findings
help job seekers, employers, and educational institutions in better
understanding the emerging field of prompt engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨隐私保护、本地部署的开源LLMs在临床影像报告自动分析中的可行性。

Method: 评估了九种开源LLMs对109份CMR报告的诊断分类能力，使用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数等指标。

Result: Gemma2模型表现最佳（F1=0.98），部分模型优于心脏病专家（F1=0.94）。

Conclusion: 开源LLMs可用于临床影像报告的快速、准确诊断分类。

Abstract: Purpose: We investigated the utilization of privacy-preserving,
locally-deployed, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
diagnostic information from free-text cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)
reports. Materials and Methods: We evaluated nine open-source LLMs on their
ability to identify diagnoses and classify patients into various cardiac
diagnostic categories based on descriptive findings in 109 clinical CMR
reports. Performance was quantified using standard classification metrics
including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also employed confusion
matrices to examine patterns of misclassification across models. Results: Most
open-source LLMs demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying reports
into different diagnostic categories. Google's Gemma2 model achieved the
highest average F1 score of 0.98, followed by Qwen2.5:32B and DeepseekR1-32B
with F1 scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. All other evaluated models
attained average scores above 0.93, with Mistral and DeepseekR1-7B being the
only exceptions. The top four LLMs outperformed our board-certified
cardiologist (F1 score of 0.94) across all evaluation metrics in analyzing CMR
reports. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of implementing
open-source, privacy-preserving LLMs in clinical settings for automated
analysis of imaging reports, enabling accurate, fast and resource-efficient
diagnostic categorization.

Motivation: 探讨提示工程技术如何影响LLMs在医学任务中的表现，特别是准确性和置信度的关系。

Method: 使用波斯医学考试数据集，评估五种LLM在不同配置（温度、提示风格、置信度尺度）下的表现，采用AUC-ROC、Brier Score和ECE等指标。

Result: Chain-of-Thought提示提高准确性但导致过度自信，情感提示进一步增加置信度；小模型表现较差，专有模型准确性高但置信度校准不足。

Conclusion: 提示工程技术需同时优化准确性和不确定性校准，以适用于高风险的医学任务。

Abstract: This paper investigates how prompt engineering techniques impact both
accuracy and confidence elicitation in Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to
medical contexts. Using a stratified dataset of Persian board exam questions
across multiple specialties, we evaluated five LLMs - GPT-4o, o3-mini,
Llama-3.3-70b, Llama-3.1-8b, and DeepSeek-v3 - across 156 configurations. These
configurations varied in temperature settings (0.3, 0.7, 1.0), prompt styles
(Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot, Emotional, Expert Mimicry), and confidence scales
(1-10, 1-100). We used AUC-ROC, Brier Score, and Expected Calibration Error
(ECE) to evaluate alignment between confidence and actual performance.
Chain-of-Thought prompts improved accuracy but also led to overconfidence,
highlighting the need for calibration. Emotional prompting further inflated
confidence, risking poor decisions. Smaller models like Llama-3.1-8b
underperformed across all metrics, while proprietary models showed higher
accuracy but still lacked calibrated confidence. These results suggest prompt
engineering must address both accuracy and uncertainty to be effective in
high-stakes medical tasks.

Result: 结果显示所有模型均存在不一致性和偏见，mixtral-8x7b最稳定，llama3.1-70b变异性最高，模型普遍偏向资深学者，存在性别和种族偏见。

Conclusion: 结论指出需要改进LLM以提高学术推荐的可靠性和公平性。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of six open-weight LLMs (llama3-8b,
llama3.1-8b, gemma2-9b, mixtral-8x7b, llama3-70b, llama3.1-70b) in recommending
experts in physics across five tasks: top-k experts by field, influential
scientists by discipline, epoch, seniority, and scholar counterparts. The
evaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender,
ethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data
from the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly
benchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records. Our
analysis reveals inconsistencies and biases across all models. mixtral-8x7b
produces the most stable outputs, while llama3.1-70b shows the highest
variability. Many models exhibit duplication, and some, particularly gemma2-9b
and llama3.1-8b, struggle with formatting errors. LLMs generally recommend real
scientists, but accuracy drops in field-, epoch-, and seniority-specific
queries, consistently favoring senior scholars. Representation biases persist,
replicating gender imbalances (reflecting male predominance),
under-representing Asian scientists, and over-representing White scholars.
Despite some diversity in institutional and collaboration networks, models
favor highly cited and productive scholars, reinforcing the rich-getricher
effect while offering limited geographical representation. These findings
highlight the need to improve LLMs for more reliable and equitable scholarly
recommendations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电视网络在节目决策时面临高财务风险，通常依赖有限的历史数据预测收视率，因此需要更准确的预测方法。

Method: 通过提取剧集对话中的情感基调、认知复杂性和叙事结构等NLP特征，结合SARIMAX、滚动XGBoost和特征选择模型进行预测。

Result: NLP特征在某些剧集中显著提升了预测准确性，同时提出了一种基于对话向量相似性的节目内容比较方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在不同类型节目中表现出色，为编剧、高管和营销人员提供了可解释的数据驱动洞察。

Abstract: Television networks face high financial risk when making programming
decisions, often relying on limited historical data to forecast episodic
viewership. This study introduces a machine learning framework that integrates
natural language processing (NLP) features from over 25000 television episodes
with traditional viewership data to enhance predictive accuracy. By extracting
emotional tone, cognitive complexity, and narrative structure from episode
dialogue, we evaluate forecasting performance using SARIMAX, rolling XGBoost,
and feature selection models. While prior viewership remains a strong baseline
predictor, NLP features contribute meaningful improvements for some series. We
also introduce a similarity scoring method based on Euclidean distance between
aggregate dialogue vectors to compare shows by content. Tested across diverse
genres, including Better Call Saul and Abbott Elementary, our framework reveals
genre-specific performance and offers interpretable metrics for writers,
executives, and marketers seeking data-driven insight into audience behavior.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在高风险决策（如器官分配）中与人类道德价值观的对齐问题。

Method: 系统评估多个知名LLMs在肾脏分配场景中的行为，并与人类偏好对比。

Result: LLMs在属性优先级上与人类价值观存在显著偏差，且倾向于确定性决策而非不确定性表达。少量样本的监督微调可改善其表现。

Conclusion: 在道德/伦理领域，LLMs需要明确的价值观对齐策略。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes
decision-making -- such as allocating scarce resources like donor organs --
raises critical questions about their alignment with human moral values. We
systematically evaluate the behavior of several prominent LLMs against human
preferences in kidney allocation scenarios and show that LLMs: i) exhibit stark
deviations from human values in prioritizing various attributes, and ii) in
contrast to humans, LLMs rarely express indecision, opting for deterministic
decisions even when alternative indecision mechanisms (e.g., coin flipping) are
provided. Nonetheless, we show that low-rank supervised fine-tuning with few
samples is often effective in improving both decision consistency and
calibrating indecision modeling. These findings illustrate the necessity of
explicit alignment strategies for LLMs in moral/ethical domains.

Method: 利用BERTopic分析10万+用户评论，提取与AI治理相关的潜在主题。

Result: 发现与技术（如数据管理）和非技术（如项目管理）相关的治理主题，部分与现有框架重叠，但也揭示被忽视的领域。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁更基于实证和用户中心的AI治理方法，以补充现有规范框架，推动更具操作性的治理实践。

Abstract: With the growing importance of AI governance, numerous high-level frameworks
and principles have been articulated by policymakers, institutions, and expert
communities to guide the development and application of AI. While such
frameworks offer valuable normative orientation, they may not fully capture the
practical concerns of those who interact with AI systems in organizational and
operational contexts. To address this gap, this study adopts a bottom-up
approach to explore how governance-relevant themes are expressed in user
discourse. Drawing on over 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2.com, we
apply BERTopic to extract latent themes and identify those most semantically
related to AI governance. The analysis reveals a diverse set of
governance-relevant topics spanning both technical and non-technical domains.
These include concerns across organizational processes-such as planning,
coordination, and communication-as well as stages of the AI value chain,
including deployment infrastructure, data handling, and analytics. The findings
show considerable overlap with institutional AI governance and ethics
frameworks on issues like privacy and transparency, but also surface overlooked
areas such as project management, strategy development, and customer
interaction. This highlights the need for more empirically grounded,
user-centered approaches to AI governance-approaches that complement normative
models by capturing how governance unfolds in applied settings. By
foregrounding how governance is enacted in practice, this study contributes to
more inclusive and operationally grounded approaches to AI governance and
digital policy.

Motivation: 解决用户过度依赖LLM导致的社会问题，如作业代写或敏感文档处理。

Method: 在文档中注入幻影标记，使LLM生成错误但看似合理的输出。

Result: 实证评估显示TRAPDOC对专有LLM有效。

Conclusion: TRAPDOC为促进更负责任地使用语言模型提供了基础。

Abstract: The reasoning, writing, text-editing, and retrieval capabilities of
proprietary large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, providing users
with an ever-expanding set of functionalities. However, this growing utility
has also led to a serious societal concern: the over-reliance on LLMs. In
particular, users increasingly delegate tasks such as homework, assignments, or
the processing of sensitive documents to LLMs without meaningful engagement.
This form of over-reliance and misuse is emerging as a significant social
issue. In order to mitigate these issues, we propose a method injecting
imperceptible phantom tokens into documents, which causes LLMs to generate
outputs that appear plausible to users but are in fact incorrect. Based on this
technique, we introduce TRAPDOC, a framework designed to deceive over-reliant
LLM users. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework on proprietary LLMs, comparing its impact against several
baselines. TRAPDOC serves as a strong foundation for promoting more responsible
and thoughtful engagement with language models. Our code is available at

explores how AI challenges traditional notions of creativity, originality and
intellectual labour. Using an autoethnographic approach, the authors reflect on
their year-long experiences with AI tools, revealing a transition from initial
guilt and reluctance to empowerment through skill-building and transparency.
Key findings highlight the importance of basic academic skills, advanced AI
literacy and honest engagement with AI results. The c(ai)borg vision advocates
for a future where AI is openly embraced as a collaborative partner, fostering
innovation and equity while addressing issues of access and agency. By
reframing guilt as growth, the paper calls for a thoughtful and inclusive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPB疾病的高发病率和死亡率需要更精准的诊断工具，但现有大语言模型在HPB领域的评估不足。

Method: 通过整合公开数据集和合成数据，构建涵盖ICD-10中33大类465小类的HPB评估基准，并评估商业和开源大语言模型的表现。

Result: 商业大语言模型在医学考试题上表现良好，但在HPB复杂临床诊断任务中表现显著下降，医疗大语言模型的泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在HPB疾病领域的局限性明显，未来需提升其处理复杂临床诊断的能力。

Abstract: Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) disorders represent a global public health
challenge due to their high morbidity and mortality. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in general medical
question-answering tasks, the current evaluation benchmarks are mostly derived
from standardized examinations or manually designed questions, lacking HPB
coverage and clinical cases. To address these issues, we systematically
eatablish an HPB disease evaluation benchmark comprising 3,535 closed-ended
multiple-choice questions and 337 open-ended real diagnosis cases, which
encompasses all the 33 main categories and 465 subcategories of HPB diseases
defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th
Revision (ICD-10). The multiple-choice questions are curated from public
datasets and synthesized data, and the clinical cases are collected from
prestigious medical journals, case-sharing platforms, and collaborating
hospitals. By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on
our established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial
LLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial
performance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex,
inpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability
to HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in
the domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical
LLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical
exam questions. The benchmark will be released at the homepage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的发展，其在地理信息表示上的可信度成为重要问题，研究旨在评估LLMs在地理任务中的表现。

Method: 研究评估了GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash在三个地理空间任务中的表现：地理编码、海拔估计和反向地理编码。

Result: GPT-4o在地理编码中偏差较大，Gemini 2.0 Flash更精确但有系统性偏移；海拔估计中两者均低估，但Gemini在东部表现更好；反向地理编码中Gemini整体更准确。

Conclusion: LLMs可近似地理信息，但准确性不一致，需针对地理信息进行优化以提高其在GIScience和地理信息学中的实用性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, questions about their
trustworthiness in delivering factual information have become increasingly
important. This concern also applies to their ability to accurately represent
the geographic world. With recent advancements in this field, it is relevant to
consider whether and to what extent LLMs' representations of the geographical
world can be trusted. This study evaluates the performance of GPT-4o and Gemini
2.0 Flash in three key geospatial tasks: geocoding, elevation estimation, and
reverse geocoding. In the geocoding task, both models exhibited systematic and
random errors in estimating the coordinates of St. Anne's Column in Innsbruck,
Austria, with GPT-4o showing greater deviations and Gemini 2.0 Flash
demonstrating more precision but a significant systematic offset. For elevation
estimation, both models tended to underestimate elevations across Austria,
though they captured overall topographical trends, and Gemini 2.0 Flash
performed better in eastern regions. The reverse geocoding task, which involved
identifying Austrian federal states from coordinates, revealed that Gemini 2.0
Flash outperformed GPT-4o in overall accuracy and F1-scores, demonstrating
better consistency across regions. Despite these findings, neither model
achieved an accurate reconstruction of Austria's federal states, highlighting
persistent misclassifications. The study concludes that while LLMs can
approximate geographic information, their accuracy and reliability are
inconsistent, underscoring the need for fine-tuning with geographical
information to enhance their utility in GIScience and Geoinformatics.

Method: 研究通过与临床专家合作验证了8种常见错误信息，并开发了MythTriage标注流程，结合轻量级模型和大型语言模型（LLM）进行高效标注。

Result: MythTriage在标注效率上表现出色，宏F1分数达0.86，预计可减少76%的标注时间和成本。分析了2.9K搜索结果和343K推荐内容，揭示了错误信息的传播机制。

Conclusion: 研究为公共健康和平台内容审核提供了可操作的见解，展示了高效标注流程在大规模错误信息分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding the prevalence of misinformation in health topics online can
inform public health policies and interventions. However, measuring such
misinformation at scale remains a challenge, particularly for high-stakes but
understudied topics like opioid-use disorder (OUD)--a leading cause of death in
the U.S. We present the first large-scale study of OUD-related myths on
YouTube, a widely-used platform for health information. With clinical experts,
we validate 8 pervasive myths and release an expert-labeled video dataset. To
scale labeling, we introduce MythTriage, an efficient triage pipeline that uses
a lightweight model for routine cases and defers harder ones to a
high-performing, but costlier, large language model (LLM). MythTriage achieves
up to 0.86 macro F1-score while estimated to reduce annotation time and
financial cost by over 76% compared to experts and full LLM labeling. We
analyze 2.9K search results and 343K recommendations, uncovering how myths
persist on YouTube and offering actionable insights for public health and
platform moderation.

*Matthew Brophy*

Main category: cs.CY

TLDR: 论文提出用广泛反思平衡方法（MWRE）改进现有大语言模型（LLM）对齐技术，强调动态修订和伦理基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLM有益、安全且符合人类价值观，当前对齐技术（如CAI）复杂且缺乏动态修订和伦理基础。

Method: 采用广泛反思平衡方法（MWRE），通过协调道德判断、原则和背景理论，增强动态修订和程序合法性。

Result: MWRE能更有效地指导LLM对齐，提供更稳健和伦理可辩护的结果。

Conclusion: MWRE是分析和改进LLM对齐的有价值启发式方法，有助于开发更伦理合理的AI系统。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more powerful and pervasive across
society, ensuring these systems are beneficial, safe, and aligned with human
values is crucial. Current alignment techniques, like Constitutional AI (CAI),
involve complex iterative processes. This paper argues that the Method of Wide
Reflective Equilibrium (MWRE) -- a well-established coherentist moral
methodology -- offers a uniquely apt framework for understanding current LLM
alignment efforts. Moreover, this methodology can substantively augment these
processes by providing concrete pathways for improving their dynamic
revisability, procedural legitimacy, and overall ethical grounding. Together,
these enhancements can help produce more robust and ethically defensible
outcomes. MWRE, emphasizing the achievement of coherence between our considered
moral judgments, guiding moral principles, and relevant background theories,
arguably better represents the intricate reality of LLM alignment and offers a
more robust path to justification than prevailing foundationalist models or
simplistic input-output evaluations. While current methods like CAI bear a
structural resemblance to MWRE, they often lack its crucial emphasis on
dynamic, bi-directional revision of principles and the procedural legitimacy
derived from such a process. While acknowledging various disanalogies (e.g.,
consciousness, genuine understanding in LLMs), the paper demonstrates that MWRE
serves as a valuable heuristic for critically analyzing current alignment
efforts and for guiding the future development of more ethically sound and
justifiably aligned AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育者在教授入门级大学工程课程时，难以准确识别学生最困难的主题以及如何有效支持多样化的学生需求。

Method: 采用分层贝叶斯模型，利用大规模学生反应数据，量化技能难度和学生能力，并识别学习轨迹中的学生子群。

Result: 研究发现某些概念持续具有挑战性，需要针对性教学支持，而其他概念则易于掌握，适合扩展活动。分层贝叶斯方法提供了直观可靠的指标。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了统计严谨性和可解释性，为教育者提供了可操作的见解，以支持多样化学生群体，提升教学效果。

Abstract: Educators teaching entry-level university engineering modules face the
challenge of identifying which topics students find most difficult and how to
support diverse student needs effectively. This study demonstrates a rigorous
yet interpretable statistical approach -- hierarchical Bayesian modeling --
that leverages detailed student response data to quantify both skill difficulty
and individual student abilities. Using a large-scale dataset from an
undergraduate Statics course, we identified clear patterns of skill mastery and
uncovered distinct student subgroups based on their learning trajectories. Our
analysis reveals that certain concepts consistently present challenges,
requiring targeted instructional support, while others are readily mastered and
may benefit from enrichment activities. Importantly, the hierarchical Bayesian
method provides educators with intuitive, reliable metrics without sacrificing
predictive accuracy. This approach allows for data-informed decisions, enabling
personalized teaching strategies to improve student engagement and success. By
combining robust statistical methods with clear interpretability, this study
equips educators with actionable insights to better support diverse learner
populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代奴隶法案要求企业披露反奴隶措施，但验证这些声明的复杂性和数据稀缺性带来了挑战。

Method: 开发AIMSCheck框架，将合规评估任务分解为三个层次，并创建跨司法管辖区数据集。

Result: 实验表明，基于澳大利亚数据训练的模型在英加司法管辖区表现良好。

Conclusion: AIMSCheck和数据集有望推动AI在合规评估中的应用，并促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Modern Slavery Acts mandate that corporations disclose their efforts to
combat modern slavery, aiming to enhance transparency and strengthen practices
for its eradication. However, verifying these statements remains challenging
due to their complex, diversified language and the sheer number of statements
that must be reviewed. The development of NLP tools to assist in this task is
also difficult due to a scarcity of annotated data. Furthermore, as modern
slavery transparency legislation has been introduced in several countries, the
generalizability of such tools across legal jurisdictions must be studied. To
address these challenges, we work with domain experts to make two key
contributions. First, we present AIMS.uk and AIMS.ca, newly annotated datasets
from the UK and Canada to enable cross-jurisdictional evaluation. Second, we
introduce AIMSCheck, an end-to-end framework for compliance validation.
AIMSCheck decomposes the compliance assessment task into three levels,
enhancing interpretability and practical applicability. Our experiments show
that models trained on an Australian dataset generalize well across UK and
Canadian jurisdictions, demonstrating the potential for broader application in
compliance monitoring. We release the benchmark datasets and AIMSCheck to the
public to advance AI-adoption in compliance assessment and drive further
research in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球AI监管对系统安全性的关注增加，‘可争议性’成为一项强制但定义模糊的保障措施，亟需明确其定义和实现方法。

Method: 通过系统文献综述，提出‘可争议性’的形式化定义，并设计模块化框架和评估量表（Contestability Assessment Scale）。

Result: 案例研究表明，现有系统在‘可争议性’方面存在不足，而本文框架能有效推动针对性改进。

Conclusion: 本文工作将‘可争议性’从监管理论转化为实践工具，为AI系统嵌入真正的追责机制提供了支持。

Abstract: As AI regulations around the world intensify their focus on system safety,
contestability has become a mandatory, yet ill-defined, safeguard. In XAI,
"contestability" remains an empty promise: no formal definition exists, no
algorithm guarantees it, and practitioners lack concrete guidance to satisfy
regulatory requirements. Grounded in a systematic literature review, this paper
presents the first rigorous formal definition of contestability in explainable
AI, directly aligned with stakeholder requirements and regulatory mandates. We
introduce a modular framework of by-design and post-hoc mechanisms spanning
human-centered interfaces, technical architectures, legal processes, and
organizational workflows. To operationalize our framework, we propose the
Contestability Assessment Scale, a composite metric built on more than twenty
quantitative criteria. Through multiple case studies across diverse application
domains, we reveal where state-of-the-art systems fall short and show how our
framework drives targeted improvements. By converting contestability from
regulatory theory into a practical framework, our work equips practitioners
with the tools to embed genuine recourse and accountability into AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI公司缺乏详细的结构化方法来识别和分析危害，STPA作为一种系统性方法，有望提升AI系统的安全性和可追溯性。

Method: 应用STPA方法分析AI控制安全案例中的威胁模型和场景，识别不安全控制行为及其潜在损失场景。

Result: STPA能识别传统非结构化危害分析方法遗漏的因果因素，提升安全性的稳健性。

Conclusion: STPA可作为现有AI治理技术的补充，提升前沿AI系统的安全保证，同时支持通过LLMs实现分析的可扩展性。

Abstract: All of the frontier AI companies have published safety frameworks where they
define capability thresholds and risk mitigations that determine how they will
safely develop and deploy their models. Adoption of systematic approaches to
risk modelling, based on established practices used in safety-critical
industries, has been recommended, however frontier AI companies currently do
not describe in detail any structured approach to identifying and analysing
hazards. STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis) is a systematic methodology
for identifying how complex systems can become unsafe, leading to hazards. It
achieves this by mapping out controllers and controlled processes then
analysing their interactions and feedback loops to understand how harmful
outcomes could occur (Leveson & Thomas, 2018). We evaluate STPA's ability to
broaden the scope, improve traceability and strengthen the robustness of safety
assurance for frontier AI systems. Applying STPA to the threat model and
scenario described in 'A Sketch of an AI Control Safety Case' (Korbak et al.,
2025), we derive a list of Unsafe Control Actions. From these we select a
subset and explore the Loss Scenarios that lead to them if left unmitigated. We
find that STPA is able to identify causal factors that may be missed by
unstructured hazard analysis methodologies thereby improving robustness. We
suggest STPA could increase the safety assurance of frontier AI when used to
complement or check coverage of existing AI governance techniques including
capability thresholds, model evaluations and emergency procedures. The
application of a systematic methodology supports scalability by increasing the
proportion of the analysis that could be conducted by LLMs, reducing the burden
on human domain experts.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探讨企业如何应对即将全面实施的AIA，分析其可能采取的规避策略，为监管机构提供‘红队’测试框架。

Method: 通过将‘avoision’策略分为三个层级（在AIA范围内、豁免于AIA条款、受更高监管审查），并分析每种策略的组织和技术表现形式。

Result: 提出了一个系统化的框架，用于识别和分类企业在不同监管层级下可能采取的规避行为。

Conclusion: 该研究为监管机构提供了一个对抗性框架，以预测和应对企业可能的规避行为，从而完善AI监管。

Abstract: The shape of AI regulation is beginning to emerge, most prominently through
the EU AI Act (the "AIA"). By 2027, the AIA will be in full effect, and firms
are starting to adjust their behavior in light of this new law. In this paper,
we present a framework and taxonomy for reasoning about "avoision" -- conduct
that walks the line between legal avoidance and evasion -- that firms might
engage in so as to minimize the regulatory burden the AIA poses. We organize
these avoision strategies around three "tiers" of increasing AIA exposure that
regulated entities face depending on: whether their activities are (1) within
scope of the AIA, (2) exempted from provisions of the AIA, or are (3) placed in
a category with higher regulatory scrutiny. In each of these tiers and for each
strategy, we specify the organizational and technological forms through which
avoision may manifest. Our goal is to provide an adversarial framework for "red
teaming" the AIA and AI regulation on the horizon.

*Sarthak Kumar Maharana,Saksham Singh Kushwaha,Baoming Zhang,Adrian Rodriguez,Songtao Wei,Yapeng Tian,Yunhui Guo*

Main category: cs.SD

TLDR: 论文提出了一个名为AVROBUSTBENCH的基准测试，用于评估音频-视觉模型在测试时的鲁棒性，并发现现有模型在双模态干扰下性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中音频和视觉模态可能同时发生分布偏移，现有基准测试仅关注单模态，无法全面评估音频-视觉模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 设计了包含四个数据集（AUDIOSET-2C、VGGSOUND-2C、KINETICS-2C、EPICKITCHENS-2C）的AVROBUSTBENCH，引入75种双模态干扰，并提出AV2C方法进行在线测试时适应。

Result: 现有模型在干扰严重时鲁棒性下降，测试时适应方法在双模态干扰下改进有限，AV2C方法在VGGSOUND-2C上表现更好。

Conclusion: AVROBUSTBENCH有助于推动更有效的音频-视觉测试时适应方法的发展。

Abstract: While recent audio-visual models have demonstrated impressive performance,
their robustness to distributional shifts at test-time remains not fully
understood. Existing robustness benchmarks mainly focus on single modalities,
making them insufficient for thoroughly assessing the robustness of
audio-visual models. Motivated by real-world scenarios where shifts can occur
$\textit{simultaneously}$ in both audio and visual modalities, we introduce
$\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
test-time robustness of audio-visual recognition models.
$\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ comprises four audio-visual benchmark datasets,
$\texttt{AUDIOSET-2C}$, $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$, $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, and
$\texttt{EPICKITCHENS-2C}$, each incorporating 75 bimodal audio-visual
corruptions that are $\textit{co-occurring}$ and $\textit{correlated}$. Through
extensive evaluations, we observe that state-of-the-art supervised and
self-supervised audio-visual models exhibit declining robustness as corruption
severity increases. Furthermore, online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, on
$\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$ and $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, offer minimal improvements
in performance under bimodal corruptions. We further propose $\texttt{AV2C}$, a
simple TTA approach enabling on-the-fly cross-modal fusion by penalizing
high-entropy samples, which achieves improvements on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$. We
hope that $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ will steer the development of more effective
and robust audio-visual TTA approaches. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经音频编解码器主要优化重建质量，但牺牲了编码令牌的下游可建模性，MagiCodec旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多阶段训练管道，结合高斯噪声注入和潜在正则化，分析噪声注入在频域的效果。

Result: MagiCodec在重建质量和下游任务中优于现有技术，生成的令牌呈现类似自然语言的Zipf分布。

Conclusion: MagiCodec在语义表达和重建质量上表现优异，适用于基于语言模型的生成架构。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs have made significant strides in efficiently mapping raw
audio waveforms into discrete token representations, which are foundational for
contemporary audio generative models. However, most existing codecs are
optimized primarily for reconstruction quality, often at the expense of the
downstream modelability of the encoded tokens. Motivated by the need to
overcome this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{MagiCodec}$, a novel
single-layer, streaming Transformer-based audio codec. MagiCodec is designed
with a multistage training pipeline that incorporates Gaussian noise injection
and latent regularization, explicitly targeting the enhancement of semantic
expressiveness in the generated codes while preserving high reconstruction
fidelity. We analytically derive the effect of noise injection in the frequency
domain, demonstrating its efficacy in attenuating high-frequency components and
fostering robust tokenization. Extensive experimental evaluations show that
MagiCodec surpasses state-of-the-art codecs in both reconstruction quality and
downstream tasks. Notably, the tokens produced by MagiCodec exhibit Zipf-like
distributions, as observed in natural languages, thereby improving
compatibility with language-model-based generative architectures. The code and
pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Ereboas/MagiCodec.

Motivation: 音频深度伪造技术快速发展，导致公众面临金融诈骗、身份盗窃和虚假信息等风险。现有检测器在相同生成模型下表现优异，但在跨领域测试中性能不足。

Method: 通过构建XMAD-Bench数据集，包含668.8小时的真实和伪造语音，训练和测试数据在说话者、生成方法和音频来源上完全独立。

Result: 实验显示，检测器在相同领域内准确率可达100%，但在跨领域测试中性能接近随机猜测。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发具有跨语言、说话者和生成方法泛化能力的鲁棒音频深度伪造检测器的必要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation led to an increasing number of deepfakes,
making the general public more vulnerable to financial scams, identity theft,
and misinformation. Audio deepfake detectors promise to alleviate this issue,
with many recent studies reporting accuracy rates close to 99%. However, these
methods are typically tested in an in-domain setup, where the deepfake samples
from the training and test sets are produced by the same generative models. To
this end, we introduce XMAD-Bench, a large-scale cross-domain multilingual
audio deepfake benchmark comprising 668.8 hours of real and deepfake speech. In
our novel dataset, the speakers, the generative methods, and the real audio
sources are distinct across training and test splits. This leads to a
challenging cross-domain evaluation setup, where audio deepfake detectors can
be tested ``in the wild''. Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments indicate
a clear disparity between the in-domain performance of deepfake detectors,
which is usually as high as 100%, and the cross-domain performance of the same
models, which is sometimes similar to random chance. Our benchmark highlights
the need for the development of robust audio deepfake detectors, which maintain
their generalization capacity across different languages, speakers, generative
methods, and data sources. Our benchmark is publicly released at
https://github.com/ristea/xmad-bench/.

Motivation: 音乐表演的密集连续音频和视听整合特性为多模态场景理解和推理带来挑战，现有方法存在信息冗余和效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出Sparsify框架，集成三种稀疏化策略，并设计关键子集选择算法以提高数据效率。

Result: Sparsify在Music AVQA数据集上达到最优性能，训练时间减少28.32%，同时保持准确性；关键子集算法仅使用25%数据即可保留70-80%性能。

Conclusion: Sparsify框架通过稀疏化和数据选择显著提升了Music AVQA任务的效率和性能。

Abstract: Music performances, characterized by dense and continuous audio as well as
seamless audio-visual integration, present unique challenges for multimodal
scene understanding and reasoning. Recent Music Performance Audio-Visual
Question Answering (Music AVQA) datasets have been proposed to reflect these
challenges, highlighting the continued need for more effective integration of
audio-visual representations in complex question answering. However, existing
Music AVQA methods often rely on dense and unoptimized representations, leading
to inefficiencies in the isolation of key information, the reduction of
redundancy, and the prioritization of critical samples. To address these
challenges, we introduce Sparsify, a sparse learning framework specifically
designed for Music AVQA. It integrates three sparsification strategies into an
end-to-end pipeline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music AVQA
datasets. In addition, it reduces training time by 28.32% compared to its fully
trained dense counterpart while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating clear
efficiency gains. To further improve data efficiency, we propose a key-subset
selection algorithm that selects and uses approximately 25% of MUSIC-AVQA v2.0
training data and retains 70-80% of full-data performance across models.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能通过文本提示生成音频，尽管其训练主要基于文本数据。

Method: 采用三阶段方法（音符、环境声音、人类语音），通过代码作为中介生成音频，并使用FAD和CLAP评分评估质量。

Result: LLMs能生成基本音频，但复杂度增加时性能下降。

Conclusion: LLMs对音频世界有潜在理解，但生成能力有限，需进一步研究提升质量与多样性。

Abstract: How does textual representation of audio relate to the Large Language Model's
(LLMs) learning about the audio world? This research investigates the extent to
which LLMs can be prompted to generate audio, despite their primary training in
textual data. We employ a three-tier approach, progressively increasing the
complexity of audio generation: 1) Musical Notes, 2) Environmental Sounds, and
3) Human Speech. To bridge the gap between text and audio, we leverage code as
an intermediary, prompting LLMs to generate code that, when executed, produces
the desired audio output. To evaluate the quality and accuracy of the generated
audio, we employ FAD and CLAP scores. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can
generate basic audio features, their performance deteriorates as the complexity
of the audio increases. This suggests that while LLMs possess a latent
understanding of the auditory world, their ability to translate this
understanding into tangible audio output remains rudimentary. Further research
into techniques that can enhance the quality and diversity of LLM-generated
audio can lead to an improvement in the performance of text-based LLMs in
generating audio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖额外模块或训练，难以实现事后调整；传统发音校正依赖词典，资源受限时效果差。

Method: 引入反事实激活编辑，通过操纵预训练模型的内部表征实现韵律和发音控制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效调整韵律特征并校正发音，同时保持合成质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为无需重新训练的TTS输出优化提供了可能，填补了预训练模型与可编辑语音合成间的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have significantly improved speech
naturalness, increasing the demand for precise prosody control and
mispronunciation correction. Existing approaches for prosody manipulation often
depend on specialized modules or additional training, limiting their capacity
for post-hoc adjustments. Similarly, traditional mispronunciation correction
relies on grapheme-to-phoneme dictionaries, making it less practical in
low-resource settings. We introduce Counterfactual Activation Editing, a
model-agnostic method that manipulates internal representations in a
pre-trained TTS model to achieve post-hoc control of prosody and pronunciation.
Experimental results show that our method effectively adjusts prosodic features
and corrects mispronunciations while preserving synthesis quality. This opens
the door to inference-time refinement of TTS outputs without retraining,
bridging the gap between pre-trained TTS models and editable speech synthesis.

Motivation: 现有系统在多说话人对话生成中难以保持说话人一致性、建模重叠语音并高效合成连贯对话，CoVoMix2旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用流匹配生成模型直接从多流转录预测mel频谱图，提出转录级说话人解耦、句子级对齐和提示级随机掩码策略。

Conclusion: CoVoMix2在真实语音生成场景中表现出强泛化能力，适用于重叠语音和精确时序控制。

Abstract: Generating natural-sounding, multi-speaker dialogue is crucial for
applications such as podcast creation, virtual agents, and multimedia content
generation. However, existing systems struggle to maintain speaker consistency,
model overlapping speech, and synthesize coherent conversations efficiently. In
this paper, we introduce CoVoMix2, a fully non-autoregressive framework for
zero-shot multi-talker dialogue generation. CoVoMix2 directly predicts
mel-spectrograms from multi-stream transcriptions using a flow-matching-based
generative model, eliminating the reliance on intermediate token
representations. To better capture realistic conversational dynamics, we
propose transcription-level speaker disentanglement, sentence-level alignment,
and prompt-level random masking strategies. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines like MoonCast and
Sesame in speech quality, speaker consistency, and inference speed. Notably,
CoVoMix2 operates without requiring transcriptions for the prompt and supports
controllable dialogue generation, including overlapping speech and precise
timing control, demonstrating strong generalizability to real-world speech

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频空间化方法在复杂多对象交互环境中缺乏灵活性和交互控制，需改进。

Method: 构建SpatialTAS数据集（37.6万样本），利用3D空间位置和相对位置提示引导模型学习双耳差异，辅以翻转声道音频。

Conclusion: 文本提示为双耳音频生成提供了灵活交互控制，TAS框架在质量和一致性上表现优异。

Abstract: To enhance immersive experiences, binaural audio offers spatial awareness of
sounding objects in AR, VR, and embodied AI applications. While existing audio
spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to
binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control
needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this,
we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes
flexible text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and
comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of premium and
large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses
376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our
model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and
relative position prompts, augmented by flipped-channel audio. It outperforms
existing methods on both simulated and real-recorded datasets, demonstrating
superior generalization and accuracy. Besides, we develop an assessment model
based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the spatial semantic coherence between
our generated binaural audio and text prompts through a spatial reasoning task.
Results demonstrate that text prompts provide flexible and interactive control
to generate binaural audio with excellent quality and semantic consistency in
spatial locations. Dataset is available at

Main category: cs.SD

TLDR: 提出了一种自监督训练方法GRAMs，用于提升音频基础模型在真实世界场景中的表现，特别是在空间音频表示学习方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频基础模型在非空间、单源音频上表现良好，但在真实世界场景中表现受限，缺乏空间感知能力。

Method: 采用自监督训练方法GRAMs，适用于任何基于掩码的深度学习模型，并在Transformer和Mamba架构上进行了验证。

Result: GRAMs在自然声音场景和声音定位任务中表现优异，缩小了与理想场景的性能差距，并超越了现有模型。

Conclusion: GRAMs方法显著提升了音频基础模型在真实世界应用中的性能，特别是在空间音频表示学习方面。

Abstract: While audio foundation models perform well on myriad of tasks from sound
classification to speech analysis, these models are trained and tested on dry,
non-spatial, single-source audio clips. This limits their success in real-world
situations and results in spatially unaware audio embeddings. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised training approach for
General-Purpose, Real-world Audio Models (GRAMs). The GRAM training approach
enables robust spatial audio representation learning for naturalistic, noisy
sound scenes and can be applied to any masking-based deep learning model. We
demonstrate the success of our approach by training two state-of-the-art
models, one with a transformer and one with a mamba backbone. We assess the
quality of the extracted audio representations from GRAMs using the original
version of the HEAR benchmark, a newly synthesized, naturalistic version of the
HEAR benchmark, and novel sound localization tasks based on HEAR benchmark
datasets. The results show that our approach minimizes the performance gap
between dry, non-spatial, single-source sound scenes and naturalistic sound
scenes for crucial tasks such as auditory scene analysis, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art audio foundation models at a fraction of the training
steps. Moreover, GRAMs show state-of-the-art performance on sound localization
tasks, exceeding even supervised sound localization models. In sum, the
proposed approach represents a significant advancement towards robust audio
foundation models for real-world applications with state-of-the-art performance
on naturalistic sound scenes as well as spatial audio representation learning.

Motivation: 充分利用目标TF点及其周围TF点的信息，以提高单通道语音增强的效果。

Method: 结合子带模块和深度滤波模块，分两阶段解耦滤波的时频成分，并引入TAConv模块增强卷积特征提取。

Result: 实验表明，HDF-Net能有效利用周围TF点信息，性能优于其他先进系统，且资源消耗更少。

Conclusion: HDF-Net通过分层深度滤波和子带处理，显著提升了单通道语音增强的性能和效率。

Abstract: This paper proposes a model that integrates sub-band processing and deep
filtering to fully exploit information from the target time-frequency (TF) bin
and its surrounding TF bins for single-channel speech enhancement. The sub-band
module captures surrounding frequency bin information at the input, while the
deep filtering module applies filtering at the output to both the target TF bin
and its surrounding TF bins. To further improve the model performance, we
decouple deep filtering into temporal and frequency components and introduce a
two-stage framework, reducing the complexity of filter coefficient prediction
at each stage. Additionally, we propose the TAConv module to strengthen
convolutional feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed hierarchical deep filtering network (HDF-Net) effectively utilizes
surrounding TF bin information and outperforms other advanced systems while
using fewer resources.

comparing multiclass classification objectives with multilabel objectives.
Despite weak labeling, we demonstrate that iNatSounds serves as a useful
pretraining resource by benchmarking it on strongly labeled downstream
evaluation datasets. The dataset is available as a single, freely accessible
archive, promoting accessibility and research in this important domain. We
envision models trained on this data powering next-generation public engagement

Motivation: 研究MFCC和预训练模型特征在语音活动检测中的有效性，探索特征融合策略以提升性能。

Method: 提出FusionVAD框架，采用三种融合策略（拼接、加法、交叉注意力）结合MFCC和预训练模型特征。

Result: 简单融合（加法）优于复杂方法，融合模型在多个数据集上超越现有技术，平均提升2.04%。

Conclusion: 简单特征融合能增强语音活动检测的鲁棒性，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) plays a key role in speech processing, often
utilizing hand-crafted or neural features. This study examines the
effectiveness of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and pre-trained
model (PTM) features, including wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, UniSpeech, MMS, and
Whisper. We propose FusionVAD, a unified framework that combines both feature
types using three fusion strategies: concatenation, addition, and
cross-attention (CA). Experimental results reveal that simple fusion
techniques, particularly addition, outperform CA in both accuracy and
efficiency. Fusion-based models consistently surpass single-feature models,
highlighting the complementary nature of MFCCs and PTM features. Notably, our
best-performing fusion model exceeds the state-of-the-art Pyannote across
multiple datasets, achieving an absolute average improvement of 2.04%. These
results confirm that simple feature fusion enhances VAD robustness while
maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频字幕生成方法缺乏细粒度和上下文准确性，受限于单模态或浅层多模态信息。

Method: 使用预训练模型提取多模态上下文线索（如语音、音乐、视频视觉信息），再通过大语言模型合成生成详细字幕。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂音频环境的自动化理解提供了更细致和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality, large-scale audio captioning is crucial for advancing audio
understanding, yet current automated methods often generate captions that lack
fine-grained detail and contextual accuracy, primarily due to their reliance on
limited unimodal or superficial multimodal information. Drawing inspiration
from human auditory perception, which adeptly integrates cross-modal cues and
performs sophisticated auditory scene analysis, we introduce a novel two-stage
automated pipeline. This pipeline first employs specialized pretrained models
to extract diverse contextual cues (e.g., speech, music, general sounds, and
visual information from associated video). A large language model (LLM) then
synthesizes these rich, multimodal inputs to generate detailed and
context-aware audio captions. Key contributions of this work include: (1) the
proposed scalable method for fine-grained audio caption generation; (2)
FusionAudio, a new large-scale dataset comprising 1.2 million such detailed
captions, combined with 6 million QA pairs; and (3) enhanced audio models
developed using FusionAudio, specifically a CLAP-based audio encoder with
superior audio-text alignment and instruction following. This paper paves the
way for more nuanced and accurate automated understanding of complex audio
environments. Code and data can be found in

TLDR: 提出了一种在音频自编码器的潜在空间中直接进行音频处理的框架，避免了解码到原始音频格式的需求，显著提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频处理方法通常在原始波形或频谱表示上操作，效率低下，而潜在空间处理可以更高效地保留感知重要信息。

Method: 在潜在空间中直接执行音频处理操作，仅使用潜在L1重建项和一个潜在对抗判别器简化训练。

Result: 在带宽扩展和单声道到立体声上混实验中，计算效率提高了100倍，同时保持与原始音频后处理相当的质量。

Conclusion: 该框架为已采用自编码器的音频处理流程提供了更高效的范式，显著提升了各种音频任务的工作效率。

Abstract: Neural audio autoencoders create compact latent representations that preserve
perceptually important information, serving as the foundation for both modern
audio compression systems and generation approaches like next-token prediction
and latent diffusion. Despite their prevalence, most audio processing
operations, such as spatial and spectral up-sampling, still inefficiently
operate on raw waveforms or spectral representations rather than directly on
these compressed representations. We propose a framework that performs audio
processing operations entirely within an autoencoder's latent space,
eliminating the need to decode to raw audio formats. Our approach dramatically
simplifies training by operating solely in the latent domain, with a latent L1
reconstruction term, augmented by a single latent adversarial discriminator.
This contrasts sharply with raw-audio methods that typically require complex
combinations of multi-scale losses and discriminators. Through experiments in
bandwidth extension and mono-to-stereo up-mixing, we demonstrate computational
efficiency gains of up to 100x while maintaining quality comparable to
post-processing on raw audio. This work establishes a more efficient paradigm
for audio processing pipelines that already incorporate autoencoders, enabling
significantly faster and more resource-efficient workflows across various audio
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非线性动力学、部分观测和增量闭环稳定性要求（收缩性和Lipschitz性）的组合问题，为学习控制器提供内置稳定性保证。

Method: 结合非线性Youla-Kučera参数化和鲁棒神经网络（如REN），通过一阶优化方法搜索参数化结构。

Result: 在两种困难条件下，收缩性和Lipschitz性参数能保证闭环稳定性；但在三种条件下，增量稳定性可能丢失，需采用较弱的d-tube收缩性和Lipschitz性。

Conclusion: 提出的参数化方法适用于非线性系统的稳定控制器学习，并在数值实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We study parameterizations of stabilizing nonlinear policies for
learning-based control. We propose a structure based on a nonlinear version of
the Youla-Ku\v{c}era parameterization combined with robust neural networks such
as the recurrent equilibrium network (REN). The resulting parameterizations are
unconstrained, and hence can be searched over with first-order optimization
methods, while always ensuring closed-loop stability by construction. We study
the combination of (a) nonlinear dynamics, (b) partial observation, and (c)
incremental closed-loop stability requirements (contraction and Lipschitzness).
We find that with any two of these three difficulties, a contracting and
Lipschitz Youla parameter always leads to contracting and Lipschitz closed
loops. However, if all three hold, then incremental stability can be lost with
exogenous disturbances. Instead, a weaker condition is maintained, which we
call d-tube contraction and Lipschitzness. We further obtain converse results
showing that the proposed parameterization covers all contracting and Lipschitz
closed loops for certain classes of nonlinear systems. Numerical experiments
illustrate the utility of our parameterization when learning controllers with
built-in stability certificates for: i) ``economic'' rewards without
stabilizing effects; ii) short training horizons; and iii) uncertain systems.

Motivation: 深度强化学习（DRL）在家庭能源管理系统中的应用因黑盒性质而受限，可解释强化学习（XRL）技术试图解决这一问题。软DDT因其清晰的决策规则而受到关注，但传统方法需要深度且完全对称的树，降低了可解释性。

Result: 非对称DDT在家庭能源管理系统中实现了透明、高效且高性能的决策。

Conclusion: 非对称软DDT方法在提升解释性和性能方面具有潜力，为家庭能源管理系统提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have gained
traction in home energy management systems. However, their adoption by energy
management companies remains limited due to the black-box nature of DRL, which
fails to provide transparent decision-making feedback. To address this,
explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) techniques have emerged, aiming to
make DRL decisions more transparent. Among these, soft differential decision
tree (DDT) distillation provides a promising approach due to the clear decision
rules they are based on, which can be efficiently computed. However, achieving
high performance often requires deep, and completely full, trees, which reduces
interpretability. To overcome this, we propose a novel asymmetric soft DDT
construction method. Unlike traditional soft DDTs, our approach adaptively
constructs trees by expanding nodes only when necessary. This improves the
efficient use of decision nodes, which require a predetermined depth to
construct full symmetric trees, enhancing both interpretability and
performance. We demonstrate the potential of asymmetric DDTs to provide
transparent, efficient, and high-performing decision-making in home energy
management systems.

Result: 在Kuramoto-Sivashinsky方程中成功实时估计并抑制混沌动态。

Conclusion: DA-MIRL为部分可观测混沌系统的控制提供了新途径。

Abstract: The control of spatio-temporally chaos is challenging because of high
dimensionality and unpredictability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL)
discovers optimal control policies by interacting with the system, typically
requiring observations of the full physical state.In practice, sensors often
provide only partial and noisy measurements (observations) of the system. The
objective of this paper is to develop a framework that enables the control of
chaotic systems with partial and noisy observability. The proposed method,
data-assimilated model-informed reinforcement learning (DA-MIRL), integrates
(i) low-order models to approximate high-dimensional dynamics; (ii) sequential
data assimilation to correct the model prediction when observations become
available; and (iii) an off-policy actor-critic RL algorithm to adaptively
learn an optimal control strategy based on the corrected state estimates. We
test DA-MIRL on the spatiotemporally chaotic solutions of the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We estimate the full state of the environment
with (i) a physics-based model, here, a coarse-grained model; and (ii) a
data-driven model, here, the control-aware echo state network, which is
proposed in this paper. We show that DA-MIRL successfully estimates and
suppresses the chaotic dynamics of the environment in real time from partial
observations and approximate models. This work opens opportunities for the
control of partially observable chaotic systems.

Abstract: Selection bias, arising from the systematic inclusion or exclusion of certain
samples, poses a significant challenge to the validity of causal inference.
While Bareinboim et al. introduced methods for recovering unbiased
observational and interventional distributions from biased data using partial
external information, the complexity of the backdoor adjustment and the
method's strong reliance on observational data limit its applicability in many
practical settings. In this paper, we formally discover the recoverability of
$P(Y^*_{x^*})$ under selection bias with experimental data. By explicitly
constructing counterfactual worlds via Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we
analyze how selection mechanisms in the observational world propagate to the
counterfactual domain. We derive a complete set of graphical and theoretical
criteria to determine that the experimental distribution remain unaffected by
selection bias. Furthermore, we propose principled methods for leveraging
partially unbiased observational data to recover $P(Y^*_{x^*})$ from biased
experimental datasets. Simulation studies replicating realistic research
scenarios demonstrate the practical utility of our approach, offering concrete
guidance for mitigating selection bias in applied causal inference.

Abstract: Psoriasis is a long-term inflammatory skin disease that remains difficult to
treat. In this study, we developed a new topical treatment by combining metal
oxide nanoparticles: cerium oxide (CeO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), and silver (Ag),
with natural plant extracts in a gel made from fish collagen and agar. The
nanoparticles were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light
scattering (DLS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), showing good stability and a uniform particle size
distribution (ZnO averaged 66 nm).
  To enhance therapeutic potential, the gel was enriched with plant-derived
antioxidants from bitter melon, ginger, and neem. This formulation was tested
on an animal model of psoriasis. The treated group exhibited faster wound
healing and reduced inflammation compared to both placebo and untreated groups,
with statistically significant results (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001) observed from
Day 3, becoming more pronounced by Day 14.
  These results indicate that the combination of nanoparticles with plant-based
components in a topical gel may provide a promising new approach to psoriasis
treatment. Further studies are recommended to evaluate long-term safety and
therapeutic effectiveness.

Abstract: Estimating the density of a distribution from its samples is a fundamental
problem in statistics. Hypothesis selection addresses the setting where, in
addition to a sample set, we are given $n$ candidate distributions -- referred
to as hypotheses -- and the goal is to determine which one best describes the
underlying data distribution. This problem is known to be solvable very
efficiently, requiring roughly $O(\log n)$ samples and running in
$\tilde{O}(n)$ time. The quality of the output is measured via the total
variation distance to the unknown distribution, and the approximation factor of
the algorithm determines how large this distance is compared to the optimal
distance achieved by the best candidate hypothesis. It is known that $\alpha =
3$ is the optimal approximation factor for this problem. We study hypothesis
selection under the constraint of differential privacy. We propose a
differentially private algorithm in the central model that runs in
nearly-linear time with respect to the number of hypotheses, achieves the
optimal approximation factor, and incurs only a modest increase in sample
complexity, which remains polylogarithmic in $n$. This resolves an open
question posed by [Bun, Kamath, Steinke, Wu, NeurIPS 2019]. Prior to our work,
existing upper bounds required quadratic time.

Abstract: Randomized dimensionality reduction is a widely-used algorithmic technique
for speeding up large-scale Euclidean optimization problems. In this paper, we
study dimension reduction for a variety of maximization problems, including
max-matching, max-spanning tree, max TSP, as well as various measures for
dataset diversity. For these problems, we show that the effect of dimension
reduction is intimately tied to the \emph{doubling dimension} $\lambda_X$ of
the underlying dataset $X$ -- a quantity measuring intrinsic dimensionality of
point sets. Specifically, we prove that a target dimension of $O(\lambda_X)$
suffices to approximately preserve the value of any near-optimal solution,which
we also show is necessary for some of these problems. This is in contrast to
classical dimension reduction results, whose dependence increases with the
dataset size $|X|$. We also provide empirical results validating the quality of
solutions found in the projected space, as well as speedups due to
dimensionality reduction.

Abstract: The Fourier representation for the uniform distribution over the Boolean cube
has found numerous applications in algorithms and complexity analysis. Notably,
in learning theory, learnability of Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) under uniform
as well as product distributions has been established through such
representations. This paper makes five main contributions. First, it introduces
a generalized Fourier expansion that can be used with any distribution $D$
through the representation of the distribution as a Bayesian network (BN).
Second, it shows that the main algorithmic tools for learning with the Fourier
representation, that use membership queries to approximate functions by
recovering their heavy Fourier coefficients, can be used with slight
modifications with the generalized expansion. These results hold for any
distribution. Third, it analyzes the $L_1$ spectral norm of conjunctions under
the new expansion, showing that it is bounded for a class of distributions
which can be represented by difference bounded tree BN, where a parent node in
the BN representation can change the conditional expectation of a child node by
at most $\alpha<0.5$. Lower bounds are presented to show that such constraints
are necessary. The fourth contribution uses these results to show the
learnability of DNF with membership queries under difference bounded tree BN.
The final contribution is to develop an algorithm for learning
difference-bounded tree BN distributions, thus extending the DNF learnability
result to cases where the distribution is not known in advance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癌症是一种基因疾病，高维微阵列数据分类存在过拟合问题，需要改进方法。

Method: 采用FSWOR技术和投影方法，结合Kendall统计检验和集成分类器（LDA投影和朴素贝叶斯）。

Abstract: Cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease characterized by genetic and
epigenetic alterations that disrupt normal gene expression, leading to
uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis. High-dimensional microarray datasets
pose challenges for classification models due to the "small n, large p"
problem, resulting in overfitting. This study makes three different key
contributions: 1) we propose a machine learning-based approach integrating the
Feature Selection Without Re-placement (FSWOR) technique and a projection
method to improve classification accuracy. 2) We apply the Kendall statistical
test to identify the most significant genes from the brain cancer mi-croarray
dataset (GSE50161), reducing the feature space from 54,675 to 20,890 genes.3)
we apply machine learning models using k-fold cross validation techniques in
which our model incorpo-rates ensemble classifiers with LDA projection and
Na\"ive Bayes, achieving a test score of 96%, outperforming existing methods by
9.09%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our ap-proach in
high-dimensional gene expression analysis, improving classification accuracy
while mitigating overfitting. This study contributes to cancer biomarker
discovery, offering a robust computational method for analyzing microarray
data.

TLDR: LatMixSol通过潜在空间增强和聚类引导插值提升分子溶解度预测性能。


<details>

Motivation: 解决分子溶解度预测中标记数据有限和高维分子描述符的挑战。

Method: 使用自编码器压缩特征至潜在空间，通过谱聚类分组相似分子并进行插值生成合成样本。

Result: 在Huuskonen基准测试中，RMSE降低3.2-7.6%，R-squared提升0.5-1.5%。

Conclusion: 潜在空间增强在保持化学有效性的同时提升模型性能，适用于资源受限的药物发现流程。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular solubility is a cornerstone of early-stage
drug discovery, yet conventional machine learning models face significant
challenges due to limited labeled data and the high-dimensional nature of
molecular descriptors. To address these issues, we propose LatMixSol, a novel
latent space augmentation framework that combines autoencoder-based feature
compression with guided interpolation to enrich training data. Our approach
first encodes molecular descriptors into a low-dimensional latent space using a
two-layer autoencoder. Spectral clustering is then applied to group chemically
similar molecules, enabling targeted MixUp-style interpolation within clusters.
Synthetic samples are generated by blending latent vectors of cluster members
and decoding them back to the original feature space. Evaluated on the
Huuskonen solubility benchmark, LatMixSol demonstrates consistent improvements
across three of four gradient-boosted regressors (CatBoost, LightGBM,
HistGradientBoosting), achieving RMSE reductions of 3.2-7.6% and R-squared
increases of 0.5-1.5%. Notably, HistGradientBoosting shows the most significant
enhancement with a 7.6% RMSE improvement. Our analysis confirms that
cluster-guided latent space augmentation preserves chemical validity while
expanding dataset diversity, offering a computationally efficient strategy to
enhance predictive models in resource-constrained drug discovery pipelines.

*Mohammadhossein Homaei,Mehran Tarif,Agustin Di Bartolo,Oscar Mogollon Gutierrez,Mar Avila*

Main category: cs.NI

TLDR: RL-RPL-UA是一种基于强化学习的水下路由协议，显著提升了水下物联网的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路由协议（如RPL）在水下环境中表现不佳，因带宽低、延迟高、移动性强和能源有限。

Method: 每个节点配备轻量级RL代理，根据本地信息（如包投递率、缓冲区水平、链路质量和剩余能量）选择最佳父节点，并保持与标准RPL消息的兼容性。

Result: 仿真显示，RL-RPL-UA将包投递率提升9.2%，每包能耗降低14.8%，网络寿命延长80秒。

Conclusion: RL-RPL-UA是一种高效且节能的水下网络路由解决方案。

Abstract: The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) faces major challenges such as low
bandwidth, high latency, mobility, and limited energy resources. Traditional
routing protocols like RPL, which were designed for land-based networks, do not
perform well in these underwater conditions. This paper introduces RL-RPL-UA, a
new routing protocol that uses reinforcement learning to improve performance in
underwater environments. Each node includes a lightweight RL agent that selects
the best parent node based on local information such as packet delivery ratio,
buffer level, link quality, and remaining energy. RL-RPL-UA keeps full
compatibility with standard RPL messages and adds a dynamic objective function
to support real-time decision-making. Simulations using Aqua-Sim show that
RL-RPL-UA increases packet delivery by up to 9.2%, reduces energy use per
packet by 14.8%, and extends network lifetime by 80 seconds compared to
traditional methods. These results suggest that RL-RPL-UA is a promising and
energy-efficient routing solution for underwater networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过结合客观网络参数和用户反馈，实现对用户感知视频质量的准确评估，无需依赖视频内容或客户端工具。

Method: 开发了基于机器学习的客观模型预测视频质量，并利用大语言模型处理用户评论以提取主观评分。构建了包含47,894条评论的数据集，支持运营商级分析。

Result: 提出了一种delta MOS指标，用于检测局部服务质量下降。通过模拟中断验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实时分析性能偏差，并与客观QoE估计进行比较，为运营商提供实用工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces a dual-layer framework for network operator-side
quality of experience (QoE) assessment that integrates both objective network
modeling and subjective user perception extracted from live-streaming
platforms. On the objective side, we develop a machine learning model trained
on mean opinion scores (MOS) computed via the ITU-T P.1203 reference
implementation, allowing accurate prediction of user-perceived video quality
using only network parameters such as packet loss, delay, jitter, and
throughput without reliance on video content or client-side instrumentation. On
the subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that
processes user comments from live streams to extract performance-related
feedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to
filtered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support
scalable and interpretable analysis, we construct a labeled dataset of 47,894
live-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant
through multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated
Internet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic
timestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level
aggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS
metric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from
platform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in
the absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation
confirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions
through comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its
own subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling
real-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with
objective network-based QoE estimates.

Abstract: In this study, we compare the performance of randomized classical and quantum
neural networks (NNs) as well as classical and quantum-classical hybrid
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of binary image
classification. We use two distinct methodologies: using randomized NNs on
dimensionality-reduced data, and applying CNNs to full image data. We evaluate
these approaches on three data sets of increasing complexity: an artificial
hypercube dataset, MNIST handwritten digits and real-world industrial images.
We analyze correlations between classification accuracy and quantum model
hyperparameters, including the number of trainable parameters, feature encoding
methods, circuit layers, entangling gate type and structure, gate entangling
power, and measurement operators. For random quantum NNs, we compare their
performance against literature models. Classical and quantum/hybrid models
achieved statistically equivalent classification accuracies across most
datasets, with no approach demonstrating consistent superiority. We observe
that quantum models show lower variance with respect to initial training
parameters, suggesting better training stability. Among the hyperparameters
analyzed, only the number of trainable parameters showed a positive correlation
with the model performance. Around 94% of the best-performing quantum NNs had
entangling gates, although for hybrid CNNs, models without entanglement
performed equally well but took longer to converge. Cross-dataset performance
analysis revealed limited transferability of quantum models between different
classification tasks. Our study provides an industry perspective on quantum
machine learning for practical image classification tasks, highlighting both
current limitations and potential avenues for further research in quantum
circuit design, entanglement utilization, and model transferability across
varied applications.

Abstract: Efficiently compiling quantum operations remains a major bottleneck in
scaling quantum computing. Today's state-of-the-art methods achieve low
compilation error by combining search algorithms with gradient-based parameter
optimization, but they incur long runtimes and require multiple calls to
quantum hardware or expensive classical simulations, making their scaling
prohibitive. Recently, machine-learning models have emerged as an alternative,
though they are currently restricted to discrete gate sets. Here, we introduce
a multimodal denoising diffusion model that simultaneously generates a
circuit's structure and its continuous parameters for compiling a target
unitary. It leverages two independent diffusion processes, one for discrete
gate selection and one for parameter prediction. We benchmark the model over
different experiments, analyzing the method's accuracy across varying qubit
counts, circuit depths, and proportions of parameterized gates. Finally, by
exploiting its rapid circuit generation, we create large datasets of circuits
for particular operations and use these to extract valuable heuristics that can
help us discover new insights into quantum circuit synthesis.

Abstract: The characterization of Hamiltonians and other components of open quantum
dynamical systems plays a crucial role in quantum computing and other
applications. Scientific machine learning techniques have been applied to this
problem in a variety of ways, including by modeling with deep neural networks.
However, the majority of mathematical models describing open quantum systems
are linear, and the natural nonlinearities in learnable models have not been
incorporated using physical principles. We present a data-driven model for open
quantum systems that includes learnable, thermodynamically consistent terms.
The trained model is interpretable, as it directly estimates the system
Hamiltonian and linear components of coupling to the environment. We validate
the model on synthetic two and three-level data, as well as experimental
two-level data collected from a quantum device at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory.

Conclusion: RAG系统应优先选择与多信号融合和LLM对齐兼容的嵌入模型，而非单纯追求模型规模。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of embedding models in tri-modal hybrid
retrieval for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. We investigate the
fusion of dense semantic, sparse lexical, and graph-based embeddings, focusing
on the performance of the MiniLM-v6 and BGE-Large architectures. Contrary to
conventional assumptions, our results show that the compact MiniLM-v6
outperforms the larger BGE-Large when integrated with LLM-based re-ranking
within our tri-modal hybrid framework. Experiments conducted on the SciFact,
FIQA, and NFCorpus datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval
quality with the MiniLM-v6 configuration. The performance difference is
particularly pronounced in agentic re-ranking scenarios, indicating better
alignment between MiniLM-v6's embedding space and LLM reasoning. Our findings
suggest that embedding model selection for RAG systems should prioritize
compatibility with multi-signal fusion and LLM alignment, rather than relying
solely on larger models. This approach may reduce computational requirements
while improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: RLMultimodalRec兼具性能、可扩展性和可解释性，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate
the cold-start and sparsity problems in collaborative filtering by
incorporating rich content information, such as product images and textual
descriptions. However, effectively integrating heterogeneous modalities into a
unified recommendation framework remains a challenge. Existing approaches often
rely on fixed fusion strategies or complex architectures , which may fail to
adapt to modality quality variance or introduce unnecessary computational
overhead.
  In this work, we propose RLMultimodalRec, a lightweight and modular
recommendation framework that combines graph-based user modeling with adaptive
multimodal item encoding. The model employs a gated fusion module to
dynamically balance the contribution of visual and textual modalities, enabling
fine-grained and content-aware item representations. Meanwhile, a two-layer
LightGCN encoder captures high-order collaborative signals by propagating
embeddings over the user-item interaction graph without relying on nonlinear
transformations.
  We evaluate our model on a real-world dataset from the Amazon product domain.
Experimental results demonstrate that RLMultimodalRec consistently outperforms
several competitive baselines, including collaborative filtering, visual-aware,
and multimodal GNN-based methods. The proposed approach achieves significant
improvements in top-K recommendation metrics while maintaining scalability and
interpretability, making it suitable for practical deployment.

Conclusion: GLEN通过创新的索引学习和推理方法，有效解决了生成式检索的挑战，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Generative retrieval shed light on a new paradigm of document retrieval,
aiming to directly generate the identifier of a relevant document for a query.
While it takes advantage of bypassing the construction of auxiliary index
structures, existing studies face two significant challenges: (i) the
discrepancy between the knowledge of pre-trained language models and
identifiers and (ii) the gap between training and inference that poses
difficulty in learning to rank. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel generative retrieval method, namely Generative retrieval via LExical
iNdex learning (GLEN). For training, GLEN effectively exploits a dynamic
lexical identifier using a two-phase index learning strategy, enabling it to
learn meaningful lexical identifiers and relevance signals between queries and
documents. For inference, GLEN utilizes collision-free inference, using
identifier weights to rank documents without additional overhead. Experimental
results prove that GLEN achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance
against existing generative retrieval methods on various benchmark datasets,
e.g., NQ320k, MS MARCO, and BEIR. The code is available at

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance large language models (LLMs) by conditioning generation on external
evidence retrieved at inference time. While RAG addresses critical limitations
of parametric knowledge storage-such as factual inconsistency and domain
inflexibility-it introduces new challenges in retrieval quality, grounding
fidelity, pipeline efficiency, and robustness against noisy or adversarial
inputs. This survey provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent advances in
RAG systems, offering a taxonomy that categorizes architectures into
retriever-centric, generator-centric, hybrid, and robustness-oriented designs.
We systematically analyze enhancements across retrieval optimization, context
filtering, decoding control, and efficiency improvements, supported by
comparative performance analyses on short-form and multi-hop question answering
tasks. Furthermore, we review state-of-the-art evaluation frameworks and
benchmarks, highlighting trends in retrieval-aware evaluation, robustness
testing, and federated retrieval settings. Our analysis reveals recurring
trade-offs between retrieval precision and generation flexibility, efficiency
and faithfulness, and modularity and coordination. We conclude by identifying
open challenges and future research directions, including adaptive retrieval
architectures, real-time retrieval integration, structured reasoning over
multi-hop evidence, and privacy-preserving retrieval mechanisms. This survey
aims to consolidate current knowledge in RAG research and serve as a foundation
for the next generation of retrieval-augmented language modeling systems.

Abstract: Text embedding models enable semantic search, powering several NLP
applications like Retrieval Augmented Generation by efficient information
retrieval (IR). However, text embedding models are commonly studied in
scenarios where the training data is static, thus limiting its applications to
dynamic scenarios where new training data emerges over time. IR methods
generally encode a huge corpus of documents to low-dimensional embeddings and
store them in a database index. During retrieval, a semantic search over the
corpus is performed and the document whose embedding is most similar to the
query embedding is returned. When updating an embedding model with new training
data, using the already indexed corpus is suboptimal due to the
non-compatibility issue, since the model which was used to obtain the
embeddings of the corpus has changed. While re-indexing of old corpus documents
using the updated model enables compatibility, it requires much higher
computation and time. Thus, it is critical to study how the already indexed
corpus can still be effectively used without the need of re-indexing. In this
work, we establish a continual learning benchmark with large-scale datasets and
continually train dense retrieval embedding models on query-document pairs from
new datasets in each task and observe forgetting on old tasks due to
significant drift of embeddings. We employ embedding distillation on both query
and document embeddings to maintain stability and propose a novel query drift
compensation method during retrieval to project new model query embeddings to
the old embedding space. This enables compatibility with previously indexed
corpus embeddings extracted using the old model and thus reduces the

*Seongwan Park,Taeklim Kim,Youngjoong Ko*

Main category: cs.IR

TLDR: 提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAEs）的框架，用于分解DPR模型的密集嵌入，生成可解释的潜在概念，并进一步提出了概念级稀疏检索（CL-SR）方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPR模型性能强大但缺乏可解释性，需要一种方法使其密集嵌入可解释。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器分解密集嵌入为潜在概念，并为每个概念生成自然语言描述；提出CL-SR框架，直接使用潜在概念作为索引单元。

Result: CL-SR在保持性能的同时，实现了高效的索引空间和计算效率，并能应对词汇和语义不匹配问题。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了密集嵌入的语义表达能力和稀疏表示的透明性与效率。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) models suffer
from a lack of interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel
interpretability framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to
decompose previously uninterpretable dense embeddings from DPR models into
distinct, interpretable latent concepts. We generate natural language
descriptions for each latent concept, enabling human interpretations of both
the dense embeddings and the query-document similarity scores of DPR models. We
further introduce Concept-Level Sparse Retrieval (CL-SR), a retrieval framework
that directly utilizes the extracted latent concepts as indexing units. CL-SR
effectively combines the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the
transparency and efficiency of sparse representations. We show that CL-SR
achieves high index-space and computational efficiency while maintaining robust
performance across vocabulary and semantic mismatches.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for recommendation systems,
but they often struggle under data sparsity and noise. To address these issues,
we implemented LightGCL, a graph contrastive learning model that uses Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) for robust graph augmentation, preserving semantic
integrity without relying on stochastic or heuristic perturbations. LightGCL
enables structural refinement and captures global collaborative signals,
achieving significant gains over state-of-the-art models across benchmark

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索器依赖纯文本预训练的语言模型，导致领域不对齐和结构忽视，限制了其在GRAG中的效果。

Method: 提出GPR，直接在知识图谱上预训练，通过LLM引导的图增强对齐自然语言问题与相关子图，并采用结构感知目标学习细粒度检索策略。

Result: 在两个数据集、三个LLM主干和五个基线上的实验表明，GPR显著提升了检索质量和下游生成效果。

Conclusion: GPR是一种针对GRAG的鲁棒检索解决方案，有效解决了领域不对齐和结构忽视的问题。

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GRAG) places high demands on
graph-specific retrievers. However, existing retrievers often rely on language
models pretrained on plain text, limiting their effectiveness due to domain
misalignment and structure ignorance. To address these challenges, we propose
GPR, a graph-based retriever pretrained directly on knowledge graphs. GPR
aligns natural language questions with relevant subgraphs through LLM-guided
graph augmentation and employs a structure-aware objective to learn
fine-grained retrieval strategies. Experiments on two datasets, three LLM
backbones, and five baselines show that GPR consistently improves both
retrieval quality and downstream generation, demonstrating its effectiveness as
a robust retrieval solution for GRAG.

TLDR: BMEmbed是一种新方法，通过利用BM25的关键词检索技术，将通用文本嵌入模型适配到私有数据集，显著提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用文本嵌入模型在私有数据集上表现不佳，因为这些数据包含专业术语和行话。

Result: 在多个领域、数据集和模型上均表现出检索性能的显著提升。

Conclusion: BM25信号通过促进对齐和均匀性改进嵌入，为领域特定数据适配模型提供了价值。

Abstract: Text embedding models play a cornerstone role in AI applications, such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While general-purpose text embedding
models demonstrate strong performance on generic retrieval benchmarks, their
effectiveness diminishes when applied to private datasets (e.g.,
company-specific proprietary data), which often contain specialized terminology
and lingo. In this work, we introduce BMEmbed, a novel method for adapting
general-purpose text embedding models to private datasets. By leveraging the
well-established keyword-based retrieval technique (BM25), we construct
supervisory signals from the ranking of keyword-based retrieval results to
facilitate model adaptation. We evaluate BMEmbed across a range of domains,
datasets, and models, showing consistent improvements in retrieval performance.
Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how BM25-based signals contribute
to improving embeddings by fostering alignment and uniformity, highlighting the
value of this approach in adapting models to domain-specific data. We release
the source code available at https://github.com/BaileyWei/BMEmbed for the
research community.

Main category: cs.IR

TLDR: Conv2Query框架通过将对话上下文映射为ad-hoc查询，解决了PSC中输入不匹配的问题，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PSC方法直接使用对话上下文作为ad-hoc检索器的输入，但由于输入长度和噪声差异，检索质量受限。

Method: 提出Conv2Query框架，将对话上下文转换为ad-hoc查询，适配ad-hoc检索器。

Result: 在两个PSC数据集上的实验表明，Conv2Query显著提升了检索性能。

Conclusion: Conv2Query有效解决了PSC中的输入不匹配问题，提升了检索效果。

Abstract: Proactive search in conversations (PSC) aims to reduce user effort in
formulating explicit queries by proactively retrieving useful relevant
information given conversational context. Previous work in PSC either directly
uses this context as input to off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or further
fine-tunes them on PSC data. However, ad-hoc retrievers are pre-trained on
short and concise queries, while the PSC input is longer and noisier. This
input mismatch between ad-hoc search and PSC limits retrieval quality. While
fine-tuning on PSC data helps, its benefits remain constrained by this input
gap. In this work, we propose Conv2Query, a novel conversation-to-query
framework that adapts ad-hoc retrievers to PSC by bridging the input gap
between ad-hoc search and PSC. Conv2Query maps conversational context into
ad-hoc queries, which can either be used as input for off-the-shelf ad-hoc
retrievers or for further fine-tuning on PSC data. Extensive experiments on two
PSC datasets show that Conv2Query significantly improves ad-hoc retrievers'
performance, both when used directly and after fine-tuning on PSC.

Method: 采用离线嵌入和多切片总结策略，生成可泛化的用户表示，支持极长用户序列建模（平均40,000，最长70,000）。

Result: DV365嵌入在Instagram的先进用户序列模型上表现出显著增量效果，已在15个模型中部署并验证超过1年。

Conclusion: DV365是一种高效且成本可控的长用户历史建模解决方案，已在生产中验证其有效性。

Abstract: Long user history is highly valuable signal for recommendation systems, but
effectively incorporating it often comes with high cost in terms of data center
power consumption and GPU. In this work, we chose offline embedding over
end-to-end sequence length optimization methods to enable extremely long user
sequence modeling as a cost-effective solution, and propose a new user
embedding learning strategy, multi-slicing and summarization, that generates
highly generalizable user representation of user's long-term stable interest.
History length we encoded in this embedding is up to 70,000 and on average
40,000. This embedding, named as DV365, is proven highly incremental on top of
advanced attentive user sequence models deployed in Instagram. Produced by a
single upstream foundational model, it is launched in 15 different models
across Instagram and Threads with significant impact, and has been production
battle-proven for >1 year since our first launch.

Motivation: 现有生成式推荐方法在隐含项目关系和冗长项目信息利用方面存在不足。

Method: 提出GRAM模型，包括语义到词汇的翻译和多粒度延迟融合技术。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，GRAM在Recall@5和NDCG@5指标上显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: GRAM通过创新方法有效提升了生成式推荐的性能。

Abstract: Generative recommendation is an emerging paradigm that leverages the
extensive knowledge of large language models by formulating recommendations
into a text-to-text generation task. However, existing studies face two key
limitations in (i) incorporating implicit item relationships and (ii) utilizing
rich yet lengthy item information. To address these challenges, we propose a
Generative Recommender via semantic-Aware Multi-granular late fusion (GRAM),
introducing two synergistic innovations. First, we design semantic-to-lexical
translation to encode implicit hierarchical and collaborative item
relationships into the vocabulary space of LLMs. Second, we present
multi-granular late fusion to integrate rich semantics efficiently with minimal
information loss. It employs separate encoders for multi-granular prompts,
delaying the fusion until the decoding stage. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that GRAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art generative
recommendation models, achieving significant improvements of 11.5-16.0% in
Recall@5 and 5.3-13.6% in NDCG@5. The source code is available at

Motivation: 现实世界中的文档库持续变化，可能导致检索性能下降，因此需要及时检测是否需要更新检索器。

Method: 提出GradNormIR方法，利用梯度范数检测文档库是否超出原始训练分布（OOD）。

Result: 在BEIR基准测试中，GradNormIR显著提升了检索的鲁棒性和效率。

Conclusion: GradNormIR能够有效预测是否需要更新密集检索器，从而提升检索系统的性能。

Abstract: Dense retrievers encode texts into embeddings to efficiently retrieve
relevant documents from large databases in response to user queries. However,
real-world corpora continually evolve, leading to a shift from the original
training distribution of the retriever. Without timely updates or retraining,
indexing newly emerging documents can degrade retrieval performance for future
queries. Thus, identifying when a dense retriever requires an update is
critical for maintaining robust retrieval systems. In this paper, we propose a
novel task of predicting whether a corpus is out-of-distribution (OOD) relative
to a dense retriever before indexing. Addressing this task allows us to
proactively manage retriever updates, preventing potential retrieval failures.
We introduce GradNormIR, an unsupervised approach that leverages gradient norms
to detect OOD corpora effectively. Experiments on the BEIR benchmark
demonstrate that GradNormIR enables timely updates of dense retrievers in
evolving document collections, significantly enhancing retrieval robustness and
efficiency.

TLDR: 论文提出Breaker模型，通过用户表示聚类和多塔结构解决单槽推荐系统中用户内在倾向导致的偏好挖掘不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单槽推荐系统只能采用逐点建模，无法直接捕捉物品间的排序信息，用户内在倾向成为模型捷径偏差，导致用户-物品偏好挖掘不足。

Method: 引入Breaker模型，结合用户表示聚类的辅助任务和多塔结构进行聚类特异性偏好建模，提出延迟参数更新机制以增强训练稳定性。

Result: 离线和在线实验表明，该方法优于基线，已在美团平台部署并服务数千万用户。

Conclusion: Breaker模型通过聚类和多塔结构有效消除用户内在倾向的捷径偏差，提升推荐效果。

Abstract: In a single-slot recommendation system, users are only exposed to one item at
a time, and the system cannot collect user feedback on multiple items
simultaneously. Therefore, only pointwise modeling solutions can be adopted,
focusing solely on modeling the likelihood of clicks or conversions for items
by users to learn user-item preferences, without the ability to capture the
ranking information among different items directly. However, since user-side
information is often much more abundant than item-side information, the model
can quickly learn the differences in user intrinsic tendencies, which are
independent of the items they are exposed to. This can cause these intrinsic
tendencies to become a shortcut bias for the model, leading to insufficient
mining of the most concerned user-item preferences. To solve this challenge, we
introduce the Breaker model. Breaker integrates an auxiliary task of user
representation clustering with a multi-tower structure for cluster-specific
preference modeling. By clustering user representations, we ensure that users
within each cluster exhibit similar characteristics, which increases the
complexity of the pointwise recommendation task on the user side. This forces
the multi-tower structure with cluster-driven parameter learning to better
model user-item preferences, ultimately eliminating shortcut biases related to
user intrinsic tendencies. In terms of training, we propose a delayed parameter
update mechanism to enhance training stability and convergence, enabling
end-to-end joint training of the auxiliary clustering and classification tasks.
Both offline and online experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the
baselines. It has already been deployed and is actively serving tens of
millions of users daily on Meituan, one of the most popular e-commerce
platforms for services.

Method: 将一维光谱转换为二维图像，利用预训练的ViT模型进行微调，应用于恒星分类和红移估计任务。

Result: 分类准确率高于支持向量机和随机森林，红移估计的R²值与AstroCLIP相当，且能泛化到多种天体类型。

Conclusion: 预训练的视觉模型在天文光谱数据分析中表现出色，首次成功应用于大规模真实光谱数据。

Abstract: We apply pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs), originally developed for
image recognition, to the analysis of astronomical spectral data. By converting
traditional one-dimensional spectra into two-dimensional image representations,
we enable ViTs to capture both local and global spectral features through
spatial self-attention. We fine-tune a ViT pretrained on ImageNet using
millions of spectra from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, represented as spectral
plots. Our model is evaluated on key tasks including stellar object
classification and redshift ($z$) estimation, where it demonstrates strong
performance and scalability. We achieve classification accuracy higher than
Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, and attain $R^2$ values comparable
to AstroCLIP's spectrum encoder, even when generalizing across diverse object
types. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using pretrained vision
models for spectroscopic data analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first
application of ViTs to large-scale, which also leverages real spectroscopic
data and does not rely on synthetic inputs.

Abstract: Air pollution can be studied in the urban structure regulated by transport

Our study finds geometric patterns of pollution-indicated transport networks
through 0.3 million image interpretations of global cities. These are then
described as part of 12 indices to investigate the network-pollution
correlation. Strategies such as improved connectivity, more balanced road types
and the avoidance of extreme clustering coefficient are identified as
beneficial for alleviated pollution. As a graph-only study, it informs superior
urban planning by separating the impact of permanent infrastructure from that

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the adoption of AI
techniques to enhance electronic design automation. In particular, the
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant interest in
LLM-assisted hardware design generation, spanning applications from classical
digital circuits to quantum computing. Despite substantial progress in this
direction, the quality of LLM-generated hardware design still cannot meet the
requirements for practical deployment. In this work, we identify three critical
challenges hindering the development of LLM-assisted hardware design
generation: 1) limited data availability, 2) varied data quality, 3) inadequate
inference-time efficiency. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper
introduces a two-stage framework for AI-assisted hardware design by exploring
decentralized training and personalized inference. In the first stage, we
propose to harness private domain design sources through a hierarchical
decentralized training mechanism that addresses data-sharing constraints. To
mitigate the impact of low-quality data, we identify optimization opportunities
in hardware generation tasks, using user-defined metrics for model aggregation.
The second stage focuses on client personalization to enhance both speed and
quality. We introduce a new metric, Trueput, to analyze LLM-assisted hardware
generation efficiency. To optimize Trueput, we implement personalized
inference-time acceleration and customized sampling strategies. Evaluating both
classical and quantum benchmarks, our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed two-stage framework can significantly improve the model capability for
hardware design generation. As orthogonal enhancements to existing methods, our
framework can achieve $33\% \sim 50\%$ semantic accuracy improvement and $2.3$
times speedup, depending on the difficulty of the generation tasks.

Conclusion: 需更复杂训练方法结合电路模型，以提升AIMC硬件上大型神经网络的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Analog In-Memory Compute (AIMC) can improve the energy efficiency of Deep
Learning by orders of magnitude. Yet analog-domain device and circuit
non-idealities -- within the analog ``Tiles'' performing Matrix-Vector Multiply
(MVM) operations -- can degrade neural-network task accuracy. We quantify the
impact of low-level distortions and noise, and develop a mathematical model for
Multiply-ACcumulate (MAC) operations mapped to analog tiles.
Instantaneous-current IR-drop (the most significant circuit non-ideality), and
ADC quantization effects are fully captured by this model, which can predict
MVM tile-outputs both rapidly and accurately, as compared to much slower
rigorous circuit simulations. A statistical model of PCM read noise at
nanosecond timescales is derived from -- and matched against -- experimental
measurements. We integrate these (statistical) device and (deterministic)
circuit effects into a PyTorch-based framework to assess the accuracy impact on
the BERT and ALBERT Transformer networks. We show that hardware-aware
fine-tuning using simple Gaussian noise provides resilience against ADC
quantization and PCM read noise effects, but is less effective against IR-drop.
This is because IR-drop -- although deterministic -- is non-linear, is changing
significantly during the time-integration window, and is ultimately dependent
on all the excitations being introduced in parallel into the analog tile. The
apparent inability of simple Gaussian noise applied during training to properly
prepare a DNN network for IR-drop during inference implies that more complex
training approaches -- incorporating advances such as the Tile-circuit model
introduced here -- will be critical for resilient deployment of large neural
networks onto AIMC hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用非结构化稀疏性提升DNN加速器效率，尤其适用于边缘AI应用。

Method: 提出VUSA架构，根据稀疏性动态扩展脉动阵列，使用相同物理MAC单元完成更大矩阵乘法。

Result: 在16纳米工艺下，面积和能效分别提升37%和68%，同时支持任意稀疏度的DNN加速。

Conclusion: VUSA是一种通用、高效的AI加速架构，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Leveraging high degrees of unstructured sparsity is a promising approach to
enhance the efficiency of deep neural network DNN accelerators - particularly
important for emerging Edge-AI applications. We introduce VUSA, a
systolic-array architecture that virtually grows based on the present sparsity
to perform larger matrix multiplications with the same number of physical
multiply-accumulate MAC units. The proposed architecture achieves saving by 37%
and 68% in area and power efficiency, respectively, at the same
peak-performance, compared to a baseline systolic array architecture in a
commercial 16-nm technology. Still, the proposed architecture supports
acceleration for any DNN with any sparsity - even no sparsity at all. Thus, the
proposed architecture is application-independent, making it viable for
general-purpose AI acceleration.

Main category: cs.RO

TLDR: 论文提出Robot-R1框架，通过强化学习优化机器人控制中的具身推理任务，性能优于监督微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调（SFT）在机器人控制中存在数据集构造不优化、灾难性遗忘和泛化性能下降的问题。

Method: Robot-R1利用强化学习，基于当前场景图像和环境元数据预测下一个关键点状态，并通过采样和强化推理响应提升准确性。

Result: 实验表明，Robot-R1在具身推理任务中优于SFT方法，甚至在低级别动作控制任务上超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: Robot-R1为机器人控制中的具身推理提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown great promise in
advancing robotics by combining embodied reasoning with robot control. A common
approach involves training on embodied reasoning tasks related to robot control
using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, SFT datasets are often
heuristically constructed and not explicitly optimized for improving robot
control. Furthermore, SFT often leads to issues such as catastrophic forgetting
and reduced generalization performance. To address these limitations, we
introduce Robot-R1, a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning to
enhance embodied reasoning specifically for robot control. Robot-R1 learns to
predict the next keypoint state required for task completion, conditioned on
the current scene image and environment metadata derived from expert
demonstrations. Inspired by the DeepSeek-R1 learning approach, Robot-R1 samples
reasoning-based responses and reinforces those that lead to more accurate
predictions. Our experiments show that models trained with Robot-R1 outperform
SFT methods on embodied reasoning tasks. Despite having only 7B parameters,
Robot-R1 even surpasses GPT-4o on reasoning tasks related to low-level action
control, such as spatial and primitive movement reasoning.

facilitate smoother, real-time robot operations, which are crucial for
industrial automation and precision tasks.

TLDR: Hi-Dyna Graph是一种分层动态场景图架构，结合全局布局与局部动态语义，用于机器人自主操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决服务机器人在动态环境中理解和决策的挑战，现有方法无法高效建模瞬态对象关系或计算成本过高。

Method: 提出Hi-Dyna Graph，通过全局拓扑图和动态子图结合，利用语义和空间约束更新场景，并借助LLM生成指令。

Result: 实验显示Hi-Dyna Graph在场景表示上表现优越，实际部署验证了其在动态场景中的实用性。

Conclusion: Hi-Dyna Graph为机器人自主操作提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous operation of service robotics in human-centric scenes remains
challenging due to the need for understanding of changing environments and
context-aware decision-making. While existing approaches like topological maps
offer efficient spatial priors, they fail to model transient object
relationships, whereas dense neural representations (e.g., NeRF) incur
prohibitive computational costs. Inspired by the hierarchical scene
representation and video scene graph generation works, we propose Hi-Dyna
Graph, a hierarchical dynamic scene graph architecture that integrates
persistent global layouts with localized dynamic semantics for embodied robotic
autonomy. Our framework constructs a global topological graph from posed RGB-D
inputs, encoding room-scale connectivity and large static objects (e.g.,
furniture), while environmental and egocentric cameras populate dynamic
subgraphs with object position relations and human-object interaction patterns.
A hybrid architecture is conducted by anchoring these subgraphs to the global
topology using semantic and spatial constraints, enabling seamless updates as
the environment evolves. An agent powered by large language models (LLMs) is
employed to interpret the unified graph, infer latent task triggers, and
generate executable instructions grounded in robotic affordances. We conduct
complex experiments to demonstrate Hi-Dyna Grap's superior scene representation
effectiveness. Real-world deployments validate the system's practicality with a
mobile manipulator: robotics autonomously complete complex tasks with no
further training or complex rewarding in a dynamic scene as cafeteria
assistant. See https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Hi-Dyna-Graph-B326 for video

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的具身智能体面临长时程任务，现有方法在规划和协调方面存在不足，影响了性能。

Method: LoHoVLA利用预训练的视觉语言模型作为骨干，联合生成语言和动作令牌，并通过分层闭环控制机制减少错误。

Result: 实验表明，LoHoVLA在Ravens模拟器中显著优于分层和标准VLA方法。

Conclusion: 统一架构在提升具身智能的通用性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Real-world embodied agents face long-horizon tasks, characterized by
high-level goals demanding multi-step solutions beyond single actions.
Successfully navigating these requires both high-level task planning (i.e.,
decomposing goals into sub-tasks) and low-level motion control (i.e.,
generating precise robot actions). While existing vision language action (VLA)
models and hierarchical architectures offer potential in embodied tasks, the
former often falter in planning, and the latter can suffer from coordination
issues, both hampering performance. We introduce a new unified VLA framework
for long-horizon tasks, dubbed LoHoVLA, to overcome these limitations. LoHoVLA
leverages a large pretrained vision language model (VLM) as the backbone to
jointly generate language and action tokens for sub-task generation and robot
action prediction, respectively. This shared representation promotes better
generalization across tasks. Additionally, LoHoVLA embraces a hierarchical
closed-loop control mechanism to mitigate errors originating from both
high-level planning and low-level control. To train LoHoVLA, we introduce
LoHoSet, a dataset built on the Ravens simulator, containing 20 long-horizon
tasks, each with 1,000 expert demonstrations composed of visual observations,
linguistic goals, sub-tasks, and robot actions. Experimental results show that
LoHoVLA significantly surpasses both hierarchical and standard VLA approaches
on long-horizon embodied tasks in the Ravens simulator. These findings
underscore the promise of unified architectures for advancing generalizable
embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: GaussianFusion提供了一种高效且直观的多传感器融合解决方案，适用于自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion is crucial for improving the performance and robustness
of end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing methods predominantly adopt
either attention-based flatten fusion or bird's eye view fusion through
geometric transformations. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
interpretability or dense computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce
GaussianFusion, a Gaussian-based multi-sensor fusion framework for end-to-end
autonomous driving. Our method employs intuitive and compact Gaussian
representations as intermediate carriers to aggregate information from diverse
sensors. Specifically, we initialize a set of 2D Gaussians uniformly across the
driving scene, where each Gaussian is parameterized by physical attributes and
equipped with explicit and implicit features. These Gaussians are progressively
refined by integrating multi-modal features. The explicit features capture rich
semantic and spatial information about the traffic scene, while the implicit
features provide complementary cues beneficial for trajectory planning. To
fully exploit rich spatial and semantic information in Gaussians, we design a
cascade planning head that iteratively refines trajectory predictions through
interactions with Gaussians. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and
Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the
proposed GaussianFusion framework. The source code will be released at

Method: 提出Generative Behavior Control (GBC)框架，利用LLMs生成层次化行为计划，结合任务和运动规划控制人类运动。

Result: GBC能生成更多样、目的性更强的高质量运动，运动时长是现有方法的10倍。

Conclusion: GBC为未来人类运动行为建模研究奠定了基础，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Human motion generative modeling or synthesis aims to characterize
complicated human motions of daily activities in diverse real-world
environments. However, current research predominantly focuses on either
low-level, short-period motions or high-level action planning, without taking
into account the hierarchical goal-oriented nature of human activities. In this
work, we take a step forward from human motion generation to human behavior
modeling, which is inspired by cognitive science. We present a unified
framework, dubbed Generative Behavior Control (GBC), to model diverse human
motions driven by various high-level intentions by aligning motions with
hierarchical behavior plans generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
insight is that human motions can be jointly controlled by task and motion
planning in robotics, but guided by LLMs to achieve improved motion diversity
and physical fidelity. Meanwhile, to overcome the limitations of existing
benchmarks, i.e., lack of behavioral plans, we propose GBC-100K dataset
annotated with a hierarchical granularity of semantic and motion plans driven
by target goals. Our experiments demonstrate that GBC can generate more diverse
and purposeful high-quality human motions with 10* longer horizons compared
with existing methods when trained on GBC-100K, laying a foundation for future
research on behavioral modeling of human motions. Our dataset and source code
will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Effective robotic autonomy in unknown environments demands proactive

upon a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) mapping backbone, our approach employs
semantic and geometric uncertainty quantification, coupled with a sparse

enhances mapping completeness, accuracy, and robustness to noisy semantic data,
ultimately supporting more adaptive scene exploration. Our experiments on the
Replica and Matterport3D datasets highlight the effectiveness of ActiveSGM in
active semantic mapping tasks.

Abstract: Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for
autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL
methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute
odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor
resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning
method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization
accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset
construction pipelines with vision-language models (VLMs) This generative
process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the
limitations of both current olfactory datasets and the training data of VLMs,
enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously
documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using
advanced olfactory sensors which emulate human olfactory recognition through
electronic sensor arrays. By integrating visual analysis, language processing,
and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of
olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their
correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making in
environments where olfactory cues are essential. Our methodology represents a
foundational advancement in the field of robotic olfaction, offering a scalable
solution to the challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor
ambiguities.

Main category: cs.RO

TLDR: 该研究通过有限元法（FEM）和多层感知器（MLP）预测软Fin-Ray夹持器的接触力和位移，并利用NSGA-II算法进行多目标优化，以平衡夹持力和精细操作的需求。


<details>

Motivation: Fin-Ray夹持器在精细操作中表现优异，但其非线性的夹持力和变形行为难以建模，且高刚性夹持器在施加高力时会牺牲精细操作能力，因此需要解决这一多目标优化问题。

Method: 使用FEM模拟Fin-Ray夹持器的变形和接触力，构建MLP预测模型，并采用NSGA-II算法进行多目标优化设计。

Result: 研究成功优化了Fin-Ray夹持器的设计，实现了夹持力和精细操作之间的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法可提升软机器人夹持器的设计和性能，适用于精细夹持和高力应用场景。

Abstract: Soft Fin-Ray grippers can perform delicate and careful manipulation, which
has caused notable attention in different fields. These grippers can handle
objects of various forms and sizes safely. The internal structure of the
Fin-Ray finger plays a significant role in its adaptability and grasping
performance. However, modeling the non-linear grasp force and deformation
behaviors for design purposes is challenging. Moreover, when the Fin-Ray finger
becomes more rigid and capable of exerting higher forces, it becomes less
delicate in handling objects. The contrast between these two objectives gives
rise to a multi-objective optimization problem. In this study, we employ finite
element method (FEM) to estimate the deflections and contact forces of the
Fin-Ray, grasping cylindrical objects. This dataset is then used to construct a
multilayer perception (MLP) for prediction of the contact force and the tip
displacement. The FEM dataset consists of three input and four target features.
The three input features of the MLP and optimization design variables are the
thickness of the front and supporting beams, the thickness of the cross beams,
and the equal spacing between the cross beams. In addition, the target features
are the maximum contact forces and maximum tip displacements in x- and
y-directions. The magnitude of maximum contact force and magnitude of maximum
tip displacement are the two objectives, showing the trade-off between force
and delicate manipulation in soft Fin-Ray grippers. Furthermore, the optimized
set of solutions are found using multi-objective optimal techniques. We use
non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) method for this purpose. Our
findings demonstrate that our methodologies can be used to improve the design
and gripping performance of soft robotic grippers, helping us to choose a
design not only for delicate grasping but also for high-force applications.

Result: 在CARLA的Longest6基准测试中取得70.1的驾驶分数，且推理速度影响较小。

Conclusion: 集成扩散作为传统点估计轨迹规划的替代方案，能有效建模轨迹分布的不确定性，提升驾驶安全性。

Abstract: End-to-end planning systems for autonomous driving are improving rapidly,
especially in closed-loop simulation environments like CARLA. Many such driving
systems either do not consider uncertainty as part of the plan itself, or
obtain it by using specialized representations that do not generalize. In this
paper, we propose EnDfuser, an end-to-end driving system that uses a diffusion
model as the trajectory planner. EnDfuser effectively leverages complex
perception information like fused camera and LiDAR features, through combining
attention pooling and trajectory planning into a single diffusion transformer
module. Instead of committing to a single plan, EnDfuser produces a
distribution of candidate trajectories (128 for our case) from a single
perception frame through ensemble diffusion. By observing the full set of
candidate trajectories, EnDfuser provides interpretability for uncertain,
multi-modal future trajectory spaces, where there are multiple plausible
options. EnDfuser achieves a competitive driving score of 70.1 on the Longest6
benchmark in CARLA with minimal concessions on inference speed. Our findings
suggest that ensemble diffusion, used as a drop-in replacement for traditional
point-estimate trajectory planning modules, can help improve the safety of
driving decisions by modeling the uncertainty of the posterior trajectory
distribution.

Abstract: We introduce OG-VLA, a novel architecture and learning framework that
combines the generalization strengths of Vision Language Action models (VLAs)
with the robustness of 3D-aware policies. We address the challenge of mapping
natural language instructions and multi-view RGBD observations to quasi-static
robot actions. 3D-aware robot policies achieve state-of-the-art performance on
precise robot manipulation tasks, but struggle with generalization to unseen
instructions, scenes, and objects. On the other hand, VLAs excel at
generalizing across instructions and scenes, but can be sensitive to camera and
robot pose variations. We leverage prior knowledge embedded in language and
vision foundation models to improve generalization of 3D-aware keyframe
policies. OG-VLA projects input observations from diverse views into a point
cloud which is then rendered from canonical orthographic views, ensuring input
view invariance and consistency between input and output spaces. These
canonical views are processed with a vision backbone, a Large Language Model
(LLM), and an image diffusion model to generate images that encode the next
position and orientation of the end-effector on the input scene. Evaluations on
the Arnold and Colosseum benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization
to unseen environments, with over 40% relative improvements while maintaining
robust performance in seen settings. We also show real-world adaption in 3 to 5
demonstrations along with strong generalization. Videos and resources at

Motivation: 真实世界测试机器人策略昂贵，手工模拟难以准确反映真实条件，导致模拟评估与真实结果相关性差。

Method: 训练动作条件视频生成模型作为环境代理，提出块状自回归扩散变换器（Blockwise-Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer）以减少误差积累，使用VLM作为奖励函数进行蒙特卡洛模拟。

Result: WPE对分布内动作估值偏低，对分布外动作估值偏高，但能保留策略的相对排名；模拟机器人动作时表现良好，但物体交互模拟仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 世界模型可作为机器人策略评估的起点，尽管存在局限性，但为真实部署前的评估提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Robotics has broad applications from automating house chores to taking care
of patients. However, evaluating robot control policies is challenging, as
real-world testing is expensive, while handcrafted simulations often fail to
accurately reflect real-world conditions, resulting in poor correlation between
simulated evaluation and real-world outcomes. In this work, we investigate
World-model-based Policy Evaluation (WPE). We first train an action-conditioned
video generation model as a proxy to real-world environments. To enable
efficient rollouts of hundreds of interactive steps while mitigating error
accumulation in the world model, we propose an inference scheme which we call
Blockwise-Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer with adjustable context and
decoding horizon lengths. To ensure that the world model indeed follows action
input, we propose metrics based on the agreement between the ground truth video
and generated video conditioned on the same sequence of actions to evaluate the
world model. We then use the world model for policy evaluation by performing
Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model while employing a vision-language model
(VLM) as a reward function. Interestingly, we found that WPE tends to
underestimate the policy values for in-distribution actions and overestimate
policy values for out-of-distribution actions. Nevertheless, WPE preserves the
relative rankings of different policies. In emulating real robot executions,
WPE achieves high fidelity in mimicing robot arm movements as in real videos,
while emulating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging.
Despite this limitation, we show that a world model can serve as a starting
point for evaluating robot policies before real-world deployment.

Abstract: World model based planning has significantly improved decision-making in
complex environments by enabling agents to simulate future states and make
informed choices. However, ensuring the prediction accuracy of world models
often demands substantial computational resources, posing a major challenge for
real-time applications. This computational burden is particularly restrictive
in robotics, where resources are severely constrained. To address this
limitation, we propose a Sparse Imagination for Efficient Visual World Model
Planning, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of
tokens processed during forward prediction. Our method leverages a sparsely
trained vision-based world model based on transformers with randomized grouped
attention strategy, allowing the model to adaptively adjust the number of
tokens processed based on the computational resource. By enabling sparse
imagination (rollout), our approach significantly accelerates planning while
maintaining high control fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that sparse
imagination preserves task performance while dramatically improving inference
efficiency, paving the way for the deployment of world models in real-time
decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: Visual Semantic Navigation (VSN) is a fundamental problem in robotics, where
an agent must navigate toward a target object in an unknown environment, mainly
using visual information. Most state-of-the-art VSN models are trained in
simulation environments, where rendered scenes of the real world are used, at
best. These approaches typically rely on raw RGB data from the virtual scenes,
which limits their ability to generalize to real-world environments due to
domain adaptation issues. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose
SEMNAV, a novel approach that leverages semantic segmentation as the main
visual input representation of the environment to enhance the agent's
perception and decision-making capabilities. By explicitly incorporating
high-level semantic information, our model learns robust navigation policies
that improve generalization across unseen environments, both in simulated and
real world settings. We also introduce a newly curated dataset, i.e. the SEMNAV
dataset, designed for training semantic segmentation-aware navigation models
like SEMNAV. Our approach is evaluated extensively in both simulated
environments and with real-world robotic platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that SEMNAV outperforms existing state-of-the-art VSN models,
achieving higher success rates in the Habitat 2.0 simulation environment, using
the HM3D dataset. Furthermore, our real-world experiments highlight the
effectiveness of semantic segmentation in mitigating the sim-to-real gap,
making our model a promising solution for practical VSN-based robotic
applications. We release SEMNAV dataset, code and trained models at

TLDR: 提出了一种基于频域表示的新型视觉运动策略学习方法，通过分层建模频率分量和连续潜在表示，显著提升了机器人操作的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动作表示和网络架构上存在固有局限，频域表示能更有效地捕捉动作的结构化特性，且不同复杂度的任务需要不同频段的建模精度。

Method: 采用频域自回归框架，分层建模频率分量，并引入连续潜在表示以保持动作空间的平滑性和连续性。

Result: 在多种2D和3D机器人操作基准测试中，方法在精度和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 频域自回归框架结合连续潜在表示，为广义机器人操作提供了潜力。

Abstract: Learning effective visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation is
challenging, as it requires generating precise actions while maintaining
computational efficiency. Existing methods remain unsatisfactory due to
inherent limitations in the essential action representation and the basic
network architectures. We observe that representing actions in the frequency
domain captures the structured nature of motion more effectively: low-frequency
components reflect global movement patterns, while high-frequency components
encode fine local details. Additionally, robotic manipulation tasks of varying
complexity demand different levels of modeling precision across these frequency
bands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel paradigm for visuomotor policy
learning that progressively models hierarchical frequency components. To
further enhance precision, we introduce continuous latent representations that
maintain smoothness and continuity in the action space. Extensive experiments
across diverse 2D and 3D robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency,
showcasing the potential of a frequency-domain autoregressive framework with
continuous tokens for generalized robotic manipulation.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在泛化性和物理动作生成上的不足，如模仿学习缺乏泛化性，视觉语言模型无法生成物理动作。

Method: 使用高斯点云构建真实到模拟再到真实的管道，无需专家演示；从开放词汇检测器中提取密集奖励信号；利用潜在世界模型预测动态和奖励。

Conclusion: WoMAP通过创新的数据生成和奖励信号提取方法，显著提升了开放词汇对象定位的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Language-instructed active object localization is a critical challenge for
robots, requiring efficient exploration of partially observable environments.
However, state-of-the-art approaches either struggle to generalize beyond
demonstration datasets (e.g., imitation learning methods) or fail to generate
physically grounded actions (e.g., VLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce WoMAP (World Models for Active Perception): a recipe for training
open-vocabulary object localization policies that: (i) uses a Gaussian
Splatting-based real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for scalable data generation
without the need for expert demonstrations, (ii) distills dense rewards signals
from open-vocabulary object detectors, and (iii) leverages a latent world model
for dynamics and rewards prediction to ground high-level action proposals at
inference time. Rigorous simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate
WoMAP's superior performance in a broad range of zero-shot object localization
tasks, with more than 9x and 2x higher success rates compared to VLM and
diffusion policy baselines, respectively. Further, we show that WoMAP achieves
strong generalization and sim-to-real transfer on a TidyBot.

Motivation: 解决现有自动驾驶系统不透明、缺乏可解释性和安全性保障的问题，同时提升对动态驾驶场景的适应性。

Method: 结合对比视觉语言模型编码器、动态提示生成、分层安全模块和预测世界模型，构建统一的语义奖励框架。

Conclusion: DriveMind展示了跨域对齐的潜力，为实际部署提供了可能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems map sensor data directly to control
commands, but remain opaque, lack interpretability, and offer no formal safety
guarantees. While recent vision-language-guided reinforcement learning (RL)
methods introduce semantic feedback, they often rely on static prompts and
fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to dynamic driving scenes. We present
DriveMind, a unified semantic reward framework that integrates: (i) a
contrastive Vision-Language Model (VLM) encoder for stepwise semantic
anchoring; (ii) a novelty-triggered VLM encoder-decoder, fine-tuned via
chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation, for dynamic prompt generation upon
semantic drift; (iii) a hierarchical safety module enforcing kinematic
constraints (e.g., speed, lane centering, stability); and (iv) a compact
predictive world model to reward alignment with anticipated ideal states.
DriveMind achieves 19.4 +/- 2.3 km/h average speed, 0.98 +/- 0.03 route
completion, and near-zero collisions in CARLA Town 2, outperforming baselines
by over 4% in success rate. Its semantic reward generalizes zero-shot to real
dash-cam data with minimal distributional shift, demonstrating robust
cross-domain alignment and potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is a crucial yet highly complex challenge in humanoid
robotics, demanding precise, adaptable, and sample-efficient learning methods.
As humanoid robots are usually designed to operate in human-centric
environments and interact with everyday objects, mastering dexterous
manipulation is critical for real-world deployment. Traditional approaches,
such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning, have made significant
strides, but they often struggle due to the unique challenges of real-world
dexterous manipulation, including high-dimensional control, limited training
data, and covariate shift. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
these challenges and reviews existing learning-based methods for dexterous
manipulation, spanning imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and hybrid
approaches. A promising yet underexplored direction is interactive imitation
learning, where human feedback actively refines a robot's behavior during
training. While interactive imitation learning has shown success in various
robotic tasks, its application to dexterous manipulation remains limited. To
address this gap, we examine current interactive imitation learning techniques
applied to other robotic tasks and discuss how these methods can be adapted to
enhance dexterous manipulation. By synthesizing state-of-the-art research, this
paper highlights key challenges, identifies gaps in current methodologies, and
outlines potential directions for leveraging interactive imitation learning to
improve dexterous robotic skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人共设计方法因使用固定奖励函数而容易收敛到次优设计，未能探索适合不同形态的多样化运动模式。

Method: RoboMoRe采用双阶段优化：粗优化阶段通过LLM生成多样化的形态-奖励对并探索其分布；细优化阶段通过交替的LLM引导奖励和形态梯度更新迭代优化候选方案。

Result: 在八项任务中，RoboMoRe无需任务特定提示或预定义模板，显著优于人工设计和其他方法。

Conclusion: RoboMoRe通过LLM驱动的形态和奖励共优化，有效解决了机器人共设计中的局限性。

Abstract: Robot co-design, jointly optimizing morphology and control policy, remains a
longstanding challenge in the robotics community, where many promising robots
have been developed. However, a key limitation lies in its tendency to converge
to sub-optimal designs due to the use of fixed reward functions, which fail to
explore the diverse motion modes suitable for different morphologies. Here we
propose RoboMoRe, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework that integrates
morphology and reward shaping for co-optimization within the robot co-design
loop. RoboMoRe performs a dual-stage optimization: in the coarse optimization
stage, an LLM-based diversity reflection mechanism generates both diverse and
high-quality morphology-reward pairs and efficiently explores their
distribution. In the fine optimization stage, top candidates are iteratively
refined through alternating LLM-guided reward and morphology gradient updates.
RoboMoRe can optimize both efficient robot morphologies and their suited motion
behaviors through reward shaping. Results demonstrate that without any
task-specific prompting or predefined reward/morphology templates, RoboMoRe
significantly outperforms human-engineered designs and competing methods across
eight different tasks.

Abstract: Robots with multi-modal locomotion are an active research field due to their
versatility in diverse environments. In this context, additional actuation can
provide humanoid robots with aerial capabilities. Flying humanoid robots face
challenges in modeling and control, particularly with aerodynamic forces. This
paper addresses these challenges from a technological and scientific
standpoint. The technological contribution includes the mechanical design of
iRonCub-Mk1, a jet-powered humanoid robot, optimized for jet engine
integration, and hardware modifications for wind tunnel experiments on humanoid
robots for precise aerodynamic forces and surface pressure measurements. The
scientific contribution offers a comprehensive approach to model and control
aerodynamic forces using classical and learning techniques. Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) simulations calculate aerodynamic forces, validated through wind
tunnel experiments on iRonCub-Mk1. An automated CFD framework expands the
aerodynamic dataset, enabling the training of a Deep Neural Network and a
linear regression model. These models are integrated into a simulator for
designing aerodynamic-aware controllers, validated through flight simulations
and balancing experiments on the iRonCub-Mk1 physical prototype.

Abstract: Many core problems in robotics can be framed as constrained optimization
problems. Often on these problems, the robotic system has uncertainty, or it
would be advantageous to identify multiple high quality feasible solutions. To
enable this, we present two novel frameworks for applying principles of
constrained optimization to the new variational inference algorithm Stein
variational gradient descent. Our general framework supports multiple types of
constrained optimizers and can handle arbitrary constraints. We demonstrate on
a variety of problems that we are able to learn to approximate distributions
without violating constraints. Specifically, we show that we can build
distributions of: robot motion plans that exactly avoid collisions, robot arm
joint angles on the SE(3) manifold with exact table placement constraints, and
object poses from point clouds with table placement constraints.

Result: 在形状组装任务中，LAMARL样本效率平均提升185.9%，任务完成率提高；结构化提示（CoT和API）使LLM输出成功率提升28.5%-67.5%。

Conclusion: LAMARL展示了LLM与MARL结合的潜力，显著提升了多机器人系统的效率和自动化程度。

Abstract: Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is effective for complex
multi-robot tasks, it suffers from low sample efficiency and requires iterative
manual reward tuning. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
single-robot settings, but their application in multi-robot systems remains
largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel LLM-Aided MARL (LAMARL)
approach, which integrates MARL with LLMs, significantly enhancing sample
efficiency without requiring manual design. LAMARL consists of two modules: the
first module leverages LLMs to fully automate the generation of prior policy
and reward functions. The second module is MARL, which uses the generated
functions to guide robot policy training effectively. On a shape assembly
benchmark, both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the unique
advantages of LAMARL. Ablation studies show that the prior policy improves
sample efficiency by an average of 185.9% and enhances task completion, while
structured prompts based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and basic APIs improve LLM
output success rates by 28.5%-67.5%. Videos and code are available at

Result: 在合成和真实数据（包括LBR iiwa机器人测试）上的实验表明，RTW在平均和分类任务中均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: RTW为黎曼流形上的信号对齐提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal alignment of multiple signals through time warping is crucial in
many fields, such as classification within speech recognition or robot motion
learning. Almost all related works are limited to data in Euclidean space.
Although an attempt was made in 2011 to adapt this concept to unit quaternions,
a general extension to Riemannian manifolds remains absent. Given its
importance for numerous applications in robotics and beyond, we introduce
Riemannian Time Warping~(RTW). This novel approach efficiently aligns multiple
signals by considering the geometric structure of the Riemannian manifold in
which the data is embedded. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
data, including tests with an LBR iiwa robot, demonstrate that RTW consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both averaging and classification
tasks.

Abstract: Controlling fine-grained forces during manipulation remains a core challenge
in robotics. While robot policies learned from robot-collected data or
simulation show promise, they struggle to generalize across the diverse range
of real-world interactions. Learning directly from humans offers a scalable
solution, enabling demonstrators to perform skills in their natural embodiment
and in everyday environments. However, visual demonstrations alone lack the
information needed to infer precise contact forces. We present FeelTheForce
(FTF): a robot learning system that models human tactile behavior to learn
force-sensitive manipulation. Using a tactile glove to measure contact forces
and a vision-based model to estimate hand pose, we train a closed-loop policy
that continuously predicts the forces needed for manipulation. This policy is
re-targeted to a Franka Panda robot with tactile gripper sensors using shared
visual and action representations. At execution, a PD controller modulates
gripper closure to track predicted forces-enabling precise, force-aware
control. Our approach grounds robust low-level force control in scalable human
supervision, achieving a 77% success rate across 5 force-sensitive manipulation
tasks. Code and videos are available at https://feel-the-force-ftf.github.io.

Result: 在Java Maven生态系统中验证了方法的有效性，能够量化漏洞影响。

Conclusion: 该方法能全面评估漏洞传播影响，为供应链安全提供实用工具。

Abstract: Identifying the impact scope and scale is critical for software supply chain
vulnerability assessment. However, existing studies face substantial
limitations. First, prior studies either work at coarse package-level
granularity, producing many false positives, or fail to accomplish
whole-ecosystem vulnerability propagation analysis. Second, although
vulnerability assessment indicators like CVSS characterize individual
vulnerabilities, no metric exists to specifically quantify the dynamic impact
of vulnerability propagation across software supply chains. To address these
limitations and enable accurate and comprehensive vulnerability impact
assessment, we propose a novel approach: (i) a hierarchical worklist-based
algorithm for whole-ecosystem and call-graph-level vulnerability propagation
analysis and (ii) the Vulnerability Propagation Scoring System (VPSS), a
dynamic metric to quantify the scope and evolution of vulnerability impacts in
software supply chains. We implement a prototype of our approach in the Java
Maven ecosystem and evaluate it on 100 real-world vulnerabilities. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach enables effective ecosystem-wide
vulnerability propagation analysis, and provides a practical, quantitative
measure of vulnerability impact through VPSS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构评估方法依赖人工，耗时且效率低，需要更高效的工具支持。

Method: 使用MS Copilot分析学生提出的质量场景，并与人工评估结果对比。

Result: LLM在大多数情况下能更准确地分析质量场景的风险、敏感点和权衡。

Conclusion: 生成式AI有潜力部分自动化架构评估任务，提升决策效率。

Abstract: Architecture evaluation methods have long been used to evaluate software
designs. Several evaluation methods have been proposed and used to analyze
tradeoffs between different quality attributes. Having competing qualities
leads to conflicts for selecting which quality-attribute scenarios are the most
suitable ones that an architecture should tackle and for prioritizing the
scenarios required by the stakeholders. In this context, architecture
evaluation is carried out manually, often involving long brainstorming sessions
to decide which are the most adequate quality scenarios. To reduce this effort
and make the assessment and selection of scenarios more efficient, we suggest
the usage of LLMs to partially automate evaluation activities. As a first step
to validate this hypothesis, this work studies MS Copilot as an LLM tool to
analyze quality scenarios suggested by students in a software architecture
course and compares the students' results with the assessment provided by the
LLM. Our initial study reveals that the LLM produces in most cases better and
more accurate results regarding the risks, sensitivity points and tradeoff
analysis of the quality scenarios. Overall, the use of generative AI has the
potential to partially automate and support the architecture evaluation tasks,
improving the human decision-making process.

across specification documents and source code, a task beyond the capabilities
of traditional static analysis tools. This paper introduces RFCScan, an
autonomous agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect
functional bugs by checking conformance between network protocol
implementations and their RFC specifications. Inspired by the human auditing
procedure, RFCScan comprises two key components: an indexing agent and a
detection agent. The former hierarchically summarizes protocol code semantics,
generating semantic indexes that enable the detection agent to narrow down the
scanning scope. The latter employs demand-driven retrieval to iteratively
collect additional relevant data structures and functions, eventually
identifying potential inconsistencies with the RFC specifications effectively.
We evaluate RFCScan across six real-world network protocol implementations.
RFCScan identifies 47 functional bugs with 81.9% precision, of which 20 bugs
have been confirmed or fixed by developers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码推理基准多依赖合成数据或教育性问题，难以评估LLMs在实际软件工程任务中的表现。

Method: 从真实仓库收集Python、C和Java项目，通过执行测试生成执行轨迹，构建细粒度语义推理任务的数据集。

Result: 实验显示LLMs在细粒度推理任务上表现不佳，提示技术虽有帮助，但缺乏代码语义仍是根本限制。

Conclusion: CodeSense为未来基准构建和模型训练提供了工具和数据集，推动了代码语义推理研究。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about code semantics is essential for enhancing
code LLMs' abilities to solve real-world software engineering (SE) tasks.
Although several code reasoning benchmarks exist, most rely on synthetic
datasets or educational coding problems and focus on coarse-grained reasoning
tasks such as input/output prediction, limiting their effectiveness in
evaluating LLMs in practical SE contexts. To bridge this gap, we propose
CodeSense, the first benchmark that makes available a spectrum of fine-grained
code reasoning tasks concerned with the software engineering of real-world
code. We collected Python, C and Java software projects from real-world
repositories. We executed tests from these repositories, collected their
execution traces, and constructed a ground truth dataset for fine-grained
semantic reasoning tasks. We then performed comprehensive evaluations on
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results show a clear performance gap for the models
to handle fine-grained reasoning tasks. Although prompting techniques such as
chain-of-thought and in-context learning helped, the lack of code semantics in
LLMs fundamentally limit models' capabilities of code reasoning. Besides
dataset, benchmark and evaluation, our work produced an execution tracing
framework and tool set that make it easy to collect ground truth for
fine-grained SE reasoning tasks, offering a strong basis for future benchmark
construction and model post training. Our code and data are located at

Main category: cs.SE

TLDR: 研究评估了九种大型语言模型（LLM）在从自然语言用例中为无方法的UML类图生成行为方法的能力，发现LLM能生成结构良好的方法，但需要人工监督以确保准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化从自然语言用例中为UML类图生成行为方法是一个重要挑战，研究旨在评估LLM在此任务中的表现。

Method: 研究使用21个结构化废物管理用例，评估了九种LLM在生成方法时的表现，通过六项指标（如方法数量、签名丰富度等）进行分析。

Result: 所有LLM均能生成符合UML规范的PlantUML图，部分模型在方法覆盖率和注释准确性上表现优异，但签名和注释一致性仍需改进。

Conclusion: LLM可作为软件设计的协作工具，支持敏捷开发，但需结合人工监督以确保语义对齐和准确性。

Abstract: Automating the enrichment of UML class diagrams with behavioral methods from
natural language use cases is a significant challenge. This study evaluates
nine large language models (LLMs) in augmenting a methodless UML diagram (21
classes, 17 relationships) using 21 structured waste-management use cases. A
total of 90 diagrams (3,373 methods) were assessed across six metrics: method
quantity, signature richness (visibility, names, parameters, return types),
annotation completeness (linking to use cases/actions), structural fidelity,
syntactic correctness (PlantUML compilation), and naming convergence (across
models). All LLMs produced valid PlantUML diagrams adhering to UML conventions.
Some models excelled in method coverage and annotation accuracy, while others
showed richer parameterization but weaker traceability. These results
demonstrate that LLMs can generate well-structured methods with consistent
naming, advancing automated behavioral modeling. However, inconsistencies in
annotations and signatures highlight the need for improved prompt engineering
and model selection. The rapid generation of these methods supports Agile
practices by enabling faster design iterations. Despite their capabilities,
human oversight is essential to ensure accuracy, appropriateness, and semantic
alignment. This positions LLMs as collaborative partners in software design.
All experimental artifacts (\texttt{.puml}, \texttt{.png}, \texttt{.csv}) are
publicly available for reproducibility.

Motivation: 手动问题分类效率低且难以扩展，传统机器学习方法依赖大量数据。研究希望通过LLMs减少数据需求并提高分类可靠性。

Method: 研究选择了两种主流LLMs（GPT-4o和DeepSeek R1），在多个数据集上比较其性能，并评估了数据集大小对结果的影响。

Result: GPT-4o在NLBSE 2024数据集上表现最优，F1分数达80.7%，比DeepSeek R1高20%。增加数据集规模未显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LLMs（尤其是GPT-4o）能有效减少对大规模数据的依赖，为问题分类提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Effective prioritization of issue reports in software engineering helps to
optimize resource allocation and information recovery. However, manual issue
classification is laborious and lacks scalability. As an alternative, many open
source software (OSS) projects employ automated processes for this task, yet
this method often relies on large datasets for adequate training.
Traditionally, machine learning techniques have been used for issue
classification. More recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as
powerful tools for addressing a range of software engineering challenges,
including code and test generation, mapping new requirements to legacy software
endpoints, and conducting code reviews. The following research investigates an
automated approach to issue classification based on LLMs. By leveraging the
capabilities of such models, we aim to develop a robust system for prioritizing
issue reports, mitigating the necessity for extensive training data while also
maintaining reliability in classification. In our research, we developed an
LLM-based approach for accurately labeling issues by selecting two of the most
prominent large language models. We then compared their performance across
multiple datasets. Our findings show that GPT-4o achieved the best results in
classifying issues from the NLBSE 2024 competition. Moreover, GPT-4o
outperformed DeepSeek R1, achieving an F1 score 20% higher when both models
were trained on the same dataset from the NLBSE 2023 competition, which was ten
times larger than the NLBSE 2024 dataset. The fine-tuned GPT-4o model attained
an average F1 score of 80.7%, while the fine-tuned DeepSeek R1 model achieved
59.33%. Increasing the dataset size did not improve the F1 score, reducing the
dependence on massive datasets for building an efficient solution to issue
classification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various software engineering tasks; however, their effectiveness in code
migration, adapting code to run in different environments, remains
insufficiently studied. In this work, we introduce CODEMENV: Code Migration
Across Environment, a new benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs'
abilities in code migration scenarios. CODEMENV consists of 922 examples
spanning 19 Python and Java packages, and covers three core tasks: (1)
identifying functions incompatible with specific versions, (2) detecting
changes in function definitions, and (3) adapting code to target environments.
Experimental evaluation with seven LLMs on CODEMENV yields an average pass@1
rate of 26.50%, with GPT-4O achieving the highest score at 43.84%. Key findings
include: (i) LLMs tend to be more proficient with newer function versions,
which aids in migrating legacy code, and (ii) LLMs sometimes exhibit logical
inconsistencies by identifying function changes irrelevant to the intended
migration environment. The datasets are available at

Conclusion: LLMs可在严格审查下辅助生成合规智能合约的初始代码，提出的指标为自动化和自改进开发流程奠定了基础。

Abstract: Smart contracts can implement and automate parts of legal contracts, but
ensuring their legal compliance remains challenging. Existing approaches such
as formal specification, verification, and model-based development require
expertise in both legal and software development domains, as well as extensive
manual effort. Given the recent advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
code generation, we investigate their ability to generate legally compliant
smart contracts directly from natural language legal contracts, addressing
these challenges. We propose a novel suite of metrics to quantify legal
compliance based on modeling both legal and smart contracts as processes and
comparing their behaviors. We select four LLMs, generate 20 smart contracts
based on five legal contracts, and analyze their legal compliance. We find that
while all LLMs generate syntactically correct code, there is significant
variance in their legal compliance with larger models generally showing higher
levels of compliance. We also evaluate the proposed metrics against properties
of software metrics, showing they provide fine-grained distinctions, enable
nuanced comparisons, and are applicable across domains for code from any
source, LLM or developer. Our results suggest that LLMs can assist in
generating starter code for legally compliant smart contracts with strict
reviews, and the proposed metrics provide a foundation for automated and
self-improving development workflows.

Abstract: The large underlying assumption of climate models today relies on the basis
of a "confident" initial condition, a reasonably plausible snapshot of the
Earth for which all future predictions depend on. However, given the inherently
chaotic nature of our system, this assumption is complicated by sensitive
dependence, where small uncertainties in initial conditions can lead to
exponentially diverging outcomes over time. This challenge is particularly
salient at global spatial scales and over centennial timescales, where data
gaps are not just common but expected. The source of uncertainty is two-fold:
(1) sparse, noisy observations from satellites and ground stations, and (2)
internal variability stemming from the simplifying approximations within the
models themselves.
  In practice, data assimilation methods are used to reconcile this missing
information by conditioning model states on partial observations. Our work
builds on this idea but operates at the extreme end of sparsity. We propose a
conditional data imputation framework that reconstructs full temperature fields
from as little as 1% observational coverage. The method leverages a diffusion
model guided by a prekriged mask, effectively inferring the full-state fields
from minimal data points. We validate our framework over the Southern Great
Plains, focusing on afternoon (12:00-6:00 PM) temperature fields during the
summer months of 2018-2020. Across varying observational densities--from swath
data to isolated in-situ sensors--our model achieves strong reconstruction
accuracy, highlighting its potential to fill in critical data gaps in both
historical reanalysis and real-time forecasting pipelines.

Abstract: The growing importance of intraday electricity trading in Europe calls for
improved price forecasting and tailored decision-support tools. In this paper,
we propose a novel generative neural network model to generate probabilistic
path forecasts for intraday electricity prices and use them to construct
effective trading strategies for Germany's continuous-time intraday market. Our
method demonstrates competitive performance in terms of statistical evaluation
metrics compared to two state-of-the-art statistical benchmark approaches. To
further assess its economic value, we consider a realistic fixed-volume trading
scenario and propose various strategies for placing market sell orders based on
the path forecasts. Among the different trading strategies, the price paths
generated by our generative model lead to higher profit gains than the
benchmark methods. Our findings highlight the potential of generative machine
learning tools in electricity price forecasting and underscore the importance
of economic evaluation.

Abstract: Coordinated human movement depends on the integration of multisensory inputs,
sensorimotor transformation, and motor execution, as well as sensory feedback
resulting from body-environment interaction. Building dynamic models of the
sensory-musculoskeletal system is essential for understanding movement control
and investigating human behaviours. Here, we report a human
sensory-musculoskeletal model, termed SMS-Human, that integrates precise
anatomical representations of bones, joints, and muscle-tendon units with
multimodal sensory inputs involving visual, vestibular, proprioceptive, and
tactile components. A stage-wise hierarchical deep reinforcement learning
framework was developed to address the inherent challenges of high-dimensional
control in musculoskeletal systems with integrated multisensory information.
Using this framework, we demonstrated the simulation of three representative
movement tasks, including bipedal locomotion, vision-guided object
manipulation, and human-machine interaction during bicycling. Our results
showed a close resemblance between natural and simulated human motor
behaviours. The simulation also revealed musculoskeletal dynamics that could
not be directly measured. This work sheds deeper insights into the sensorimotor
dynamics of human movements, facilitates quantitative understanding of human
behaviours in interactive contexts, and informs the design of systems with
embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Autonomy is a hallmark of animal intelligence, enabling adaptive and
intelligent behavior in complex environments without relying on external reward
or task structure. Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in
sparse reward and reward-free environments, including class of methods known as
intrinsic motivation, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and thus fail
to produce robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems
neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing
instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external
reward rather than engaging in unconstrained, naturalistic and task-independent
behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic
drive explicitly designed to capture robust autonomous exploration observed in
animals. Our method (3M-Progress) motivates naturalistic behavior by tracking
divergence between the agent's current world model and an ethological prior. We
demonstrate that artificial embodied agents trained with 3M-Progress capture
the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial
dynamics recorded from autonomously-behaving larval zebrafish, introducing the
first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation. Our
findings establish a computational framework connecting model-based intrinsic
motivation to naturalistic behavior, providing a foundation for building
artificial agents with animal-like autonomy.

top of centralised templates, policies and governance. The core innovation is
an efficient method to leverage immutable container operating systems and

Our proposed approach can serve as a repeatable, portable and cost-efficient

Abstract: Neural network (NN)-based end-to-end (E2E) communication systems, in which
each system component may consist of a portion of a neural network, have been
investigated as potential tools for developing artificial intelligence
(Al)-native E2E systems. In this paper, we propose an NN-based bitwise receiver
that improves computational efficiency while maintaining performance comparable
to baseline demappers. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel
symbol-wise autoencoder (AE)-based E2E system that jointly optimizes the
transmitter and receiver at the physical layer. We evaluate the proposed
NN-based receiver using bit-error rate (BER) analysis to confirm that the
numerical BER achieved by NN-based receivers or transceivers is accurate.
Results demonstrate that the AE-based system outperforms baseline
architectures, particularly for higher-order modulation schemes. We further
show that the training signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly affects the
performance of the systems when inference is conducted at different SNR levels.

Conclusion: A-MMSE及其扩展为信道估计方法设定了新的性能与复杂度平衡标准。

Abstract: In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel
estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing based approaches, such as
minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order
statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural
networks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often
suffer from high complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE
(A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter
via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel
through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear
activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To
enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention
encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure.
Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible
trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive
simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE
consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE
across a wide range of SNR conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its
rank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance complexity
trade-off, redefining the standard for practical channel estimation methods.

Method: 采用幂次二（PoT）量化方法，对线性层权重和转换器表进行量化，将乘法转换为位移操作以减少计算量。

Result: 在Nano-GPT和124-M GPT-2模型上的初步结果显示，PoT量化在4-6位表示时，交叉熵损失仅增加约1.3-0.88。

Conclusion: PoT量化在减少内存和计算量方面表现出色，为边缘设备上的LLM实现提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Complexity of Neural Networks is increasing rapidly due to the massive
increase in model parameters. Specifically, in Large Language Models (LLMs),
the number of model parameters has grown exponentially in the past few years,
for example, from 1.5 billion parameters in GPT2 to 175 billion in GPT3. This
raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices
where memory and processing power are very limited. In this work, we
investigate reducing LLM complexity with special type of quantization, power of
two (PoT), for linear layers weights and transformer tables. PoT not only
provides memory reduction but more importantly provides significant
computational reduction through converting multiplication to bit shifting. We
obtained preliminary results of PoT quantization on Nano-GPT implementation
using Shakespeare dataset. We then extended results to 124-M GPT-2 model. The
PoT quantization results are shown to be very promising with cross entropy loss
degradation $\approx$[1.3-0.88] with number of bits range [4-6] to represent
power levels.

Motivation: 低空经济网络在多个领域具有潜力，但面临频谱管理、干扰缓解和实时协调等挑战，需通过智能技术解决。

Method: 采用机器学习进行频谱感知与共存、AI优化资源分配与轨迹规划，并通过测试平台验证和标准化。

Result: 联邦学习和强化学习支持去中心化决策，实际平台如AERPAW填补仿真与部署间的差距。

Conclusion: 研究为构建高效、互操作的AI驱动LAE生态系统提供了前瞻性路线图。

Abstract: Low Altitude Economy (LAE) networks own transformative potential in urban
mobility, emergency response, and aerial logistics. However, these networks
face significant challenges in spectrum management, interference mitigation,
and real-time coordination across dynamic and resource-constrained
environments. After addressing these challenges, this study explores three core
elements for enabling intelligent LAE networks as follows machine
learning-based spectrum sensing and coexistence, artificial intelligence
(AI)-optimized resource allocation and trajectory planning, and testbed-driven
validation and standardization. We highlight how federated and reinforcement
learning techniques support decentralized, adaptive decision-making under
mobility and energy constraints. In addition, we discuss the role of real-world
platforms such as AERPAW in bridging the gap between simulation and deployment
and enabling iterative system refinement under realistic conditions. This study
aims to provide a forward-looking roadmap toward developing efficient and
interoperable AI-driven LAE ecosystems.

TLDR: RIGOR是一种基于LLM的方法，通过结合数据库模式、文档、领域本体库和核心本体，自动生成丰富的OWL本体，显著减少人工干预。


<details>

Motivation: 提升语义互操作性，减少从关系数据库生成本体所需的手动工作。

Method: 结合RAG技术，利用LLM生成增量本体片段，并通过法官-LLM进行迭代优化。

Result: 生成的O本体在准确性、完整性、简洁性等方面表现优异，同时大幅降低人工成本。

Conclusion: RIGOR为关系数据库到知识图谱的转换提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Transforming relational databases into knowledge graphs with enriched
ontologies enhances semantic interoperability and unlocks advanced graph-based
learning and reasoning over data. However, previous approaches either demand
significant manual effort to derive an ontology from a database schema or
produce only a basic ontology. We present RIGOR, Retrieval-augmented Iterative
Generation of RDB Ontologies, an LLM-driven approach that turns relational
schemas into rich OWL ontologies with minimal human effort. RIGOR combines
three sources via RAG, the database schema and its documentation, a repository
of domain ontologies, and a growing core ontology, to prompt a generative LLM
for producing successive, provenance-tagged delta ontology fragments. Each
fragment is refined by a judge-LLM before being merged into the core ontology,
and the process iterates table-by-table following foreign key constraints until
coverage is complete. Applied to real-world databases, our approach outputs
ontologies that score highly on standard quality dimensions such as accuracy,
completeness, conciseness, adaptability, clarity, and consistency, while
substantially reducing manual effort.

TLDR: SIFBench是一个开源的大规模基准数据库，旨在支持基于机器学习的应力强度因子（SIF）预测，填补了高质量数据集的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疲劳裂纹生长是结构失效的主要原因，而SIF的准确预测对评估疲劳寿命至关重要。当前机器学习在SIF预测中的应用因缺乏高质量数据集而受限。

Method: 通过高保真有限元模拟生成超过500万种裂纹和组件几何形状，构建SIFBench数据库，并提供统一的Python接口。

Result: 使用多种机器学习模型（如随机森林、支持向量机等）进行基线测试，并提供了评估指标和模板代码。

Conclusion: SIFBench降低了机器学习在损伤容限设计和预测性维护中的应用门槛，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Fatigue-induced crack growth is a leading cause of structural failure across
critical industries such as aerospace, civil engineering, automotive, and
energy. Accurate prediction of stress intensity factors (SIFs) -- the key
parameters governing crack propagation in linear elastic fracture mechanics --
is essential for assessing fatigue life and ensuring structural integrity.
While machine learning (ML) has shown great promise in SIF prediction, its
advancement has been severely limited by the lack of rich, transparent,
well-organized, and high-quality datasets.
  To address this gap, we introduce SIFBench, an open-source, large-scale
benchmark database designed to support ML-based SIF prediction. SIFBench
contains over 5 million different crack and component geometries derived from
high-fidelity finite element simulations across 37 distinct scenarios, and
provides a unified Python interface for seamless data access and customization.
We report baseline results using a range of popular ML models -- including
random forests, support vector machines, feedforward neural networks, and
Fourier neural operators -- alongside comprehensive evaluation metrics and
template code for model training, validation, and assessment. By offering a
standardized and scalable resource, SIFBench substantially lowers the entry
barrier and fosters the development and application of ML methods in damage
tolerance design and predictive maintenance.

Conclusion: 需改进AI聊天机器人以更好支持心理健康需求。

Abstract: Many people suffer from mental health problems but not everyone seeks
professional help or has access to mental health care. AI chatbots have
increasingly become a go-to for individuals who either have mental disorders or
simply want someone to talk to. This paper presents a study on participants who
have previously used chatbots and a scenario-based testing of large language
model (LLM) chatbots. Our findings indicate that AI chatbots were primarily
utilized as a "Five minute therapist" or as a non-judgmental companion.
Participants appreciated the anonymity and lack of judgment from chatbots.
However, there were concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive
information. The scenario-based testing of LLM chatbots highlighted additional
issues. Some chatbots were consistently reassuring, used emojis and names to
add a personal touch, and were quick to suggest seeking professional help.
However, there were limitations such as inconsistent tone, occasional
inappropriate responses (e.g., casual or romantic), and a lack of crisis
sensitivity, particularly in recognizing red flag language and escalating
responses appropriately. These findings can inform both the technology and
mental health care industries on how to better utilize AI chatbots to support
individuals during challenging emotional periods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造数据集缺乏大规模、语义驱动的基准数据，特别是针对人物和场景的上下文感知修改。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLM）生成845,286张图像，通过语义指令修改人物、场景和交互。

Result: 实验表明，现有深度伪造检测模型和人类观察者难以识别这些语义修改。

Conclusion: MultiFakeVerse填补了语义驱动深度伪造数据集的空白，为未来研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GenAI technology over the past few years has
significantly contributed towards highly realistic deepfake content generation.
Despite ongoing efforts, the research community still lacks a large-scale and
reasoning capability driven deepfake benchmark dataset specifically tailored
for person-centric object, context and scene manipulations. In this paper, we
address this gap by introducing MultiFakeVerse, a large scale person-centric
deepfake dataset, comprising 845,286 images generated through manipulation
suggestions and image manipulations both derived from vision-language models
(VLM). The VLM instructions were specifically targeted towards modifications to
individuals or contextual elements of a scene that influence human perception
of importance, intent, or narrative. This VLM-driven approach enables semantic,
context-aware alterations such as modifying actions, scenes, and human-object
interactions rather than synthetic or low-level identity swaps and
region-specific edits that are common in existing datasets. Our experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art deepfake detection models and human
observers struggle to detect these subtle yet meaningful manipulations. The
code and dataset are available on
\href{https://github.com/Parul-Gupta/MultiFakeVerse}{GitHub}.
