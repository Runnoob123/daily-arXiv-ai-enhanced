TLDR: InjectLab是一个开源安全框架，用于对抗针对大型语言模型（LLMs）的提示攻击，提供检测、缓解和测试工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的普及，提示攻击风险增加，需要系统化解决方案。

Method: 基于MITRE ATT&CK设计，InjectLab包含25种技术，分6类战术，提供检测指导和YAML测试。

Result: 框架覆盖多种威胁（如指令覆盖、身份交换），并支持Python工具测试。

Conclusion: InjectLab为社区驱动的LLM安全提供了实用基础，未来将继续扩展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way people interact with
technology. Tools like ChatGPT and Claude AI are now common in business,
research, and everyday life. But with that growth comes new risks, especially
prompt-based attacks that exploit how these models process language. InjectLab
is a security framework designed to address that problem. This paper introduces
InjectLab as a structured, open-source matrix that maps real-world techniques
used to manipulate LLMs. The framework is inspired by MITRE ATT&CK and focuses
specifically on adversarial behavior at the prompt layer. It includes over 25
techniques organized under six core tactics, covering threats like instruction
override, identity swapping, and multi-agent exploitation. Each technique in
InjectLab includes detection guidance, mitigation strategies, and YAML-based
simulation tests. A Python tool supports easy execution of prompt-based test
cases. This paper outlines the framework's structure, compares it to other AI
threat taxonomies, and discusses its future direction as a practical,
community-driven foundation for securing language models.

Abstract: The implementation of blockchain technology in tax administration offers
promising improvements in security, transparency, and efficiency. This paper
presents the design of a blockchain-based e-Faktur system aimed at addressing
the challenges of issuing and verifying tax invoices within Indonesia's VAT
reporting process. Utilizing Hyperledger Fabric, a private permissioned
blockchain, integrated with Hyperledger FireFly, this system ensures data
immutability, access control, and decentralized transaction processing. The
proposed system streamlines the issuance of NSFP and validates invoices while
reducing reliance on centralized servers, eliminating single points of failure,
and enhancing auditability. Hypothetical cyberattack scenarios were explored to
assess the system's robustness. The results demonstrate that blockchain
technology mitigates potential vulnerabilities and improves the resilience of
tax reporting systems. The findings highlight the feasibility of blockchain in
public tax administration and provide a foundation for future research on
large-scale implementations.

### [4] [Quantum-Resilient Blockchain for Secure Transactions in UAV-Assisted Smart Agriculture Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18206)
*Taimoor Ahmad*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种量子抗性的区块链框架，用于保护无人机辅助智能农业网络中的数据与资源交易，结合后量子密码学技术，实现了高效、安全的交易验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在智能农业中的应用面临高移动性、去中心化和低功耗通信带来的安全挑战，尤其是交易完整性和信任问题。

Method: 采用基于格的数字签名和密钥封装机制，设计轻量级共识协议，并通过信任分层的多级账本处理交易验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在交易吞吐量、能源效率和抗量子攻击方面优于现有方案。

Conclusion: 该系统为精准农业提供了可扩展、安全且可持续的解决方案，支持后量子时代的可信自动化和弹性数据共享。

Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into smart agriculture has
enabled real-time monitoring, data collection, and automated farming
operations. However, the high mobility, decentralized nature, and low-power
communication of UAVs pose significant security challenges, particularly in
ensuring transaction integrity and trust. This paper presents a
quantum-resilient blockchain framework designed to secure data and resource
transactions in UAV-assisted smart agriculture networks. The proposed solution
incorporates post-quantum cryptographic primitives-specifically lattice-based
digital signatures and key encapsulation mechanisms to achieve tamper-proof,
low-latency consensus without relying on traditional computationally intensive
proof-of-work schemes. A lightweight consensus protocol tailored for UAV
communication constraints is developed, and transaction validation is handled
through a trust-ranked, multi-layer ledger maintained by edge nodes.
Experimental results from simulations using NS-3 and custom blockchain testbeds
show that the framework outperforms existing schemes in terms of transaction
throughput, energy efficiency, and resistance to quantum attacks. The proposed
system provides a scalable, secure, and sustainable solution for precision
agriculture, enabling trusted automation and resilient data sharing in
post-quantum eras.

### [5] [Privacy-Preserving Bathroom Monitoring for Elderly Emergencies Using PIR and LiDAR Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18242)
*Youssouf Sidibé,Julia Gersey*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种低成本、保护隐私的老年人居家监测系统，使用PIR和LiDAR传感器检测紧急事件（如跌倒或长时间静止），并在浴室环境中进行了实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 居家老年人监测需要既能检测紧急事件（如跌倒）又能保护隐私且无需用户输入的系统。

Method: 采用被动红外（PIR）和激光雷达（LiDAR）传感器，开发基于规则的检测系统，并通过模拟老年人行为的实验进行验证。

Result: 系统能够检测危险状态（如静止跌倒），并通过非视觉传感保护隐私。

Conclusion: 该系统为低成本、隐私保护的老年人居家监测提供了一种可行解决方案。

Abstract: In-home elderly monitoring requires systems that can detect emergency events
- such as falls or prolonged inactivity - while preserving privacy and
requiring no user input. These systems must be embedded into the surrounding
environment, capable of capturing activity, and responding promptly. This paper
presents a low-cost, privacy-preserving solution using Passive Infrared (PIR)
and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors to track entries, sitting,
exits, and emergency scenarios within a home bathroom setting. We developed and
evaluated a rule-based detection system through five real-world experiments
simulating elderly behavior. Annotated time-series graphs demonstrate the
system's ability to detect dangerous states, such as motionless collapses,
while maintaining privacy through non-visual sensing.

### [6] [Architectural Backdoors for Within-Batch Data Stealing and Model Inference Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18323)
*Nicolas Küchler,Ivan Petrov,Conrad Grobler,Ilia Shumailov*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新型神经网络后门攻击，针对批处理推理，能够窃取用户数据并操纵模型响应。作者还提出了一种确定性缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络后门攻击的实际影响，尤其是针对批处理推理的新攻击方式。

Method: 通过设计架构后门，利用批处理推理实现数据窃取和操纵，并提出基于信息流控制的缓解策略。

Result: 攻击可行且高效，200多个Hugging Face模型存在信息泄漏风险。

Conclusion: 新型后门攻击威胁严重，提出的缓解策略能有效防御。

Abstract: For nearly a decade the academic community has investigated backdoors in
neural networks, primarily focusing on classification tasks where adversaries
manipulate the model prediction. While demonstrably malicious, the immediate
real-world impact of such prediction-altering attacks has remained unclear. In
this paper we introduce a novel and significantly more potent class of
backdoors that builds upon recent advancements in architectural backdoors. We
demonstrate how these backdoors can be specifically engineered to exploit
batched inference, a common technique for hardware utilization, enabling
large-scale user data manipulation and theft. By targeting the batching
process, these architectural backdoors facilitate information leakage between
concurrent user requests and allow attackers to fully control model responses
directed at other users within the same batch. In other words, an attacker who
can change the model architecture can set and steal model inputs and outputs of
other users within the same batch. We show that such attacks are not only
feasible but also alarmingly effective, can be readily injected into prevalent
model architectures, and represent a truly malicious threat to user privacy and
system integrity. Critically, to counteract this new class of vulnerabilities,
we propose a deterministic mitigation strategy that provides formal guarantees
against this new attack vector, unlike prior work that relied on Large Language
Models to find the backdoors. Our mitigation strategy employs a novel
Information Flow Control mechanism that analyzes the model graph and proves
non-interference between different user inputs within the same batch. Using our
mitigation strategy we perform a large scale analysis of models hosted through
Hugging Face and find over 200 models that introduce (unintended) information
leakage between batch entries due to the use of dynamic quantization.

### [7] [An Attack to Break Permutation-Based Private Third-Party Inference Schemes for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18332)
*Rahul Thomas,Louai Zahran,Erica Choi,Akilesh Potti,Micah Goldblum,Arka Pal*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的重建技术，能够从隐藏状态中几乎完美地恢复原始提示，并证明了对三种隐私方案的不安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的第三方推理服务引发隐私问题，现有加密方法效率低且不适用于现代LLM，统计混淆方法的安全性存疑。

Method: 引入一种重建技术，从隐藏状态恢复原始提示，并扩展攻击方法以逆转混淆后的隐藏状态。

Result: 攻击方法对多种LLM几乎完美有效，揭示了三种隐私方案的不安全性。

Conclusion: 强调了隐私保护LLM推理中严格安全分析的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the widespread
adoption of third-party inference services, raising critical privacy concerns.
Existing methods of performing private third-party inference, such as Secure
Multiparty Computation (SMPC), often rely on cryptographic methods. However,
these methods are thousands of times slower than standard unencrypted
inference, and fail to scale to large modern LLMs. Therefore, recent lines of
work have explored the replacement of expensive encrypted nonlinear
computations in SMPC with statistical obfuscation methods - in particular,
revealing permuted hidden states to the third parties, with accompanying strong
claims of the difficulty of reversal into the unpermuted states. In this work,
we begin by introducing a novel reconstruction technique that can recover
original prompts from hidden states with nearly perfect accuracy across
multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. We then show that extensions of our attack are
nearly perfectly effective in reversing permuted hidden states of LLMs,
demonstrating the insecurity of three recently proposed privacy schemes. We
further dissect the shortcomings of prior theoretical `proofs' of permuation
security which allow our attack to succeed. Our findings highlight the
importance of rigorous security analysis in privacy-preserving LLM inference.

### [8] [A Critical Evaluation of Defenses against Prompt Injection Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18333)
*Yuqi Jia,Zedian Shao,Yupei Liu,Jinyuan Jia,Dawn Song,Neil Zhenqiang Gong*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文指出现有大语言模型（LLM）防御提示注入攻击的研究缺乏系统性评估方法，并提出从有效性和通用性两个维度全面评估防御措施。研究发现现有防御措施并不如之前报道的那样成功。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对提示注入攻击的防御评估缺乏系统性，导致防御措施的实际效果被高估。

Method: 提出从有效性和通用性两个维度评估防御措施，并采用多样化的提示注入攻击进行测试。

Result: 研究发现现有防御措施在系统性评估下效果不如预期。

Conclusion: 本文为未来防御措施的评估和开发提供了基础框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, and
several defenses have recently been proposed, often claiming to mitigate these
attacks successfully. However, we argue that existing studies lack a principled
approach to evaluating these defenses. In this paper, we argue the need to
assess defenses across two critical dimensions: (1) effectiveness, measured
against both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks involving diverse
target and injected prompts, and (2) general-purpose utility, ensuring that the
defense does not compromise the foundational capabilities of the LLM. Our
critical evaluation reveals that prior studies have not followed such a
comprehensive evaluation methodology. When assessed using this principled
approach, we show that existing defenses are not as successful as previously
reported. This work provides a foundation for evaluating future defenses and
guiding their development. Our code and data are available at:

### [9] [Dynamic Risk Assessments for Offensive Cybersecurity Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18384)
*Boyi Wei,Benedikt Stroebl,Jiacen Xu,Joie Zhang,Zhou Li,Peter Henderson*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文探讨了基础模型在自主编程能力提升后可能带来的网络安全风险，提出当前审计方法未充分考虑对手的实际自由度，并通过实验证明即使在小规模计算预算下，对手也能显著提升攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示基础模型作为自主编程工具可能被用于恶意网络攻击的风险，并指出现有风险评估方法的不足。

Method: 通过实验验证，在有限计算预算（8 H100 GPU小时）下，对手能够通过迭代改进提升模型在网络安全任务（如InterCode CTF）中的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，对手可将模型的网络安全攻击能力提升40%以上，无需外部协助。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要动态评估模型的网络安全风险，以更真实地反映潜在威胁。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly becoming better autonomous programmers,
raising the prospect that they could also automate dangerous offensive
cyber-operations. Current frontier model audits probe the cybersecurity risks
of such agents, but most fail to account for the degrees of freedom available
to adversaries in the real world. In particular, with strong verifiers and
financial incentives, agents for offensive cybersecurity are amenable to
iterative improvement by would-be adversaries. We argue that assessments should
take into account an expanded threat model in the context of cybersecurity,
emphasizing the varying degrees of freedom that an adversary may possess in
stateful and non-stateful environments within a fixed compute budget. We show
that even with a relatively small compute budget (8 H100 GPU Hours in our
study), adversaries can improve an agent's cybersecurity capability on
InterCode CTF by more than 40\% relative to the baseline -- without any
external assistance. These results highlight the need to evaluate agents'
cybersecurity risk in a dynamic manner, painting a more representative picture
of risk.

### [10] [Modeling interdependent privacy threats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18386)
*Shuaishuai Liu,Gergely Biczók*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种专注于相互依赖隐私（IDP）的威胁建模方法IDPA，弥补现有框架的不足，并通过微信案例验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着在线社交网络和第三方应用的普及，数据共享成为趋势，但现有隐私威胁建模方法忽视了相互依赖隐私（IDP）问题，低估了隐私风险。

Method: 提出IDPA方法，专门针对IDP威胁建模，并通过微信案例验证其有效性。

Result: IDPA能够有效识别和解决IDP相关威胁，适用于第三方应用及其他系统。

Conclusion: IDPA填补了现有威胁建模的空白，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The rise of online social networks, user-gene-rated content, and third-party
apps made data sharing an inevitable trend, driven by both user behavior and
the commercial value of personal information. As service providers amass vast
amounts of data, safeguarding individual privacy has become increasingly
challenging. Privacy threat modeling has emerged as a critical tool for
identifying and mitigating risks, with methodologies such as LINDDUN, xCOMPASS,
and PANOPTIC offering systematic approaches. However, these frameworks
primarily focus on threats arising from interactions between a single user and
system components, often overlooking interdependent privacy (IDP); the
phenomenon where one user's actions affect the privacy of other users and even
non-users. IDP risks are particularly pronounced in third-party applications,
where platform permissions, APIs, and user behavior can lead to unintended and
unconsented data sharing, such as in the Cambridge Analytica case. We argue
that existing threat modeling approaches are limited in exposing IDP-related
threats, potentially underestimating privacy risks. To bridge this gap, we
propose a specialized methodology that explicitly focuses on interdependent
privacy. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we identify IDP-specific
challenges and limitations in current threat modeling frameworks, (ii) we
create IDPA, a threat modeling approach tailored to IDP threats, and (iii) we
validate our approach through a case study on WeChat. We believe that IDPA can
operate effectively on systems other than third-party apps and may motivate
further research on specialized threat modeling.

### [11] [Towards Anonymous Neural Network Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18398)
*Liao Peiyuan*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: Funion是一个提供端到端发送者-接收者不可链接性的神经网络推理系统，利用Pigeonhole存储协议和BACAP方案实现匿名化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络推理中发送者与接收者之间的隐私保护问题，确保输入与输出方的不可链接性。

Method: 结合Pigeonhole存储协议和BACAP方案，采用存储-计算-存储模式，量化执行时间以隐藏网络流量和计算负载特征。

Result: Funion继承了Echomix的强元数据隐私保证，并在生产规模工作负载下引入可接受的性能开销。

Conclusion: Funion为云服务中的匿名化推理查询提供了可行平台。

Abstract: We introduce funion, a system providing end-to-end sender-receiver
unlinkability for neural network inference. By leveraging the Pigeonhole
storage protocol and BACAP (blinding-and-capability) scheme from the Echomix
anonymity system, funion inherits the provable security guarantees of modern
mixnets. Users can anonymously store input tensors in pseudorandom storage
locations, commission compute services to process them via the neural network,
and retrieve results with no traceable connection between input and output
parties. This store-compute-store paradigm masks both network traffic patterns
and computational workload characteristics, while quantizing execution timing
into public latency buckets. Our security analysis demonstrates that funion
inherits the strong metadata privacy guarantees of Echomix under largely the
same trust assumptions, while introducing acceptable overhead for
production-scale workloads. Our work paves the way towards an accessible
platform where users can submit fully anonymized inference queries to cloud
services.

### [12] [AI/ML for 5G and Beyond Cybersecurity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18402)
*Sandeep Pirbhulal,Habtamu Abie,Martin Jullum,Didrik Nielsen,Anders Løland*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文探讨了5G及未来通信技术和物联网（IoT）中AI/ML系统的安全挑战，强调需研究AI/ML威胁与传统威胁的区别，并提出利用AI/ML技术预测和缓解安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着5G及未来通信技术和IoT的发展，AI/ML系统的安全威胁日益突出，但目前缺乏对AI/ML威胁的明确定义和应对方法。

Method: 通过文献综述，分析AI/ML在5G及未来IoT安全中的作用，并提出预测和缓解安全风险的AI/ML技术视角。

Result: 研究指出AI/ML技术在5G及未来IoT安全中的重要性，但需进一步明确威胁定义和应对策略。

Conclusion: 需深入研究AI/ML威胁，以确保5G及未来IoT系统的安全开发和部署，同时利用AI/ML技术实时监控和降低风险。

Abstract: The advancements in communication technology (5G and beyond) and global
connectivity Internet of Things (IoT) also come with new security problems that
will need to be addressed in the next few years. The threats and
vulnerabilities introduced by AI/ML based 5G and beyond IoT systems need to be
investigated to avoid the amplification of attack vectors on AI/ML. AI/ML
techniques are playing a vital role in numerous applications of cybersecurity.
Despite the ongoing success, there are significant challenges in ensuring the
trustworthiness of AI/ML systems. However, further research is needed to define
what is considered an AI/ML threat and how it differs from threats to
traditional systems, as currently there is no common understanding of what
constitutes an attack on AI/ML based systems, nor how it might be created,
hosted and propagated [ETSI, 2020]. Therefore, there is a need for studying the
AI/ML approach to ensure safe and secure development, deployment, and operation
of AI/ML based 5G and beyond IoT systems. For 5G and beyond, it is essential to
continuously monitor and analyze any changing environment in real-time to
identify and reduce intentional and unintentional risks. In this study, we will
review the role of the AI/ML technique for 5G and beyond security. Furthermore,
we will provide our perspective for predicting and mitigating 5G and beyond
security using AI/ML techniques.

*Guoheng Sun,Ziyao Wang,Xuandong Zhao,Bowei Tian,Zheyu Shen,Yexiao He,Jinming Xing,Ang Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文探讨了商业不透明大语言模型服务（COLS）中的问责挑战，提出了数量膨胀和质量降级两大风险，并提出了多种审计策略和三层次审计框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型服务（如多步推理和多智能体协作）的内部操作对用户不透明，导致用户无法验证计费或质量，引发问责问题。

Method: 提出了多种审计策略（如基于承诺、预测、行为和签名的方法）和三层次审计框架（执行、安全日志和用户可审计性）。

Result: 提出了增强COLS可验证性的方法，包括水印和可信执行环境，并设计了模块化审计框架。

Conclusion: 呼吁进一步研究和政策制定，以提升商业大语言模型服务的透明度、可审计性和问责性。

Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) services increasingly rely on complex,
often abstract operations, such as multi-step reasoning and multi-agent
collaboration, to generate high-quality outputs. While users are billed based
on token consumption and API usage, these internal steps are typically not
visible. We refer to such systems as Commercial Opaque LLM Services (COLS).
This position paper highlights emerging accountability challenges in COLS:
users are billed for operations they cannot observe, verify, or contest. We
formalize two key risks: \textit{quantity inflation}, where token and call
counts may be artificially inflated, and \textit{quality downgrade}, where
providers might quietly substitute lower-cost models or tools. Addressing these
risks requires a diverse set of auditing strategies, including
commitment-based, predictive, behavioral, and signature-based methods. We
further explore the potential of complementary mechanisms such as watermarking
and trusted execution environments to enhance verifiability without
compromising provider confidentiality. We also propose a modular three-layer
auditing framework for COLS and users that enables trustworthy verification
across execution, secure logging, and user-facing auditability without exposing
proprietary internals. Our aim is to encourage further research and policy
development toward transparency, auditability, and accountability in commercial
LLM services.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Wi-Fi认证方法存在安全性不足、用户隐私泄露、管理成本高和计费困难等问题，需要改进。

Method: 设计基于ERC1155标准的SFWT代币，并开发基于SFWT的Wi-Fi访问控制系统，用于安全验证和管理用户访问权限。

Result: 实验表明，SFWT及其验证流程能显著降低Wi-Fi运营成本和认证时间，满足用户安全便捷访问的需求。

Conclusion: 基于区块链和SFWT的方案有效解决了传统Wi-Fi认证的问题，提升了安全性和效率。

Abstract: Current Wi-Fi authentication methods face issues such as insufficient
security, user privacy leakage, high management costs, and difficulty in
billing. To address these challenges, a Wi-Fi access control solution based on
blockchain smart contracts is proposed. Firstly, semi-fungible Wi-Fi tokens
(SFWTs) are designed using the ERC1155 token standard as credentials for users
to access Wi-Fi. Secondly, a Wi-Fi access control system based on SFWTs is
developed to securely verify and manage the access rights of Wi-Fi users.
Experimental results demonstrate that SFWTs, designed based on the ERC1155
standard, along with the SFWT access right verification process, can
significantly reduce Wi-Fi operating costs and authentication time, effectively
meeting users' needs for safe and convenient Wi-Fi access.

Result: 框架生成的变体能逃逸98%以上流行杀毒软件的检测，并可作为抗原改进恶意软件检测算法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效生成多样化恶意软件变体，为改进杀毒软件检测能力提供了实用工具。

Abstract: It is well known that anti-malware scanners depend on malware signatures to
identify malware. However, even minor modifications to malware code structure
results in a change in the malware signature thus enabling the variant to evade
detection by scanners. Therefore, there exists the need for a proactively
generated malware variant dataset to aid detection of such diverse variants by
automated antivirus scanners. This paper proposes and demonstrates a generic
assembly source code based framework that facilitates any evolutionary
algorithm to generate diverse and potential variants of an input malware, while
retaining its maliciousness, yet capable of evading antivirus scanners. Generic
code transformation functions and a novelty search supported quality metric
have been proposed as components of the framework to be used respectively as
variation operators and fitness function, for evolutionary algorithms. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in generating diverse
variants and the generated variants have been shown to evade over 98% of
popular antivirus scanners. The malware variants evolved by the framework can
serve as antigens to assist malware analysis engines to improve their malware
detection algorithms.

TLDR: 论文提出了首个针对RAG系统的全面基准框架，评估了13种投毒攻击方法和7种防御机制，发现现有攻击在标准QA数据集上有效，但在扩展版本中效果下降，且当前防御技术无法提供稳健保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在缓解大语言模型幻觉方面有效，但引入了新的安全漏洞（如投毒攻击），现有研究缺乏对其实际威胁的全面评估。

Method: 提出了一个涵盖5个标准QA数据集和10个扩展变体的基准框架，评估了13种投毒攻击方法和7种防御机制。

Result: 现有攻击在标准数据集上表现良好，但在扩展版本中效果显著下降；多种RAG架构仍易受攻击，当前防御技术不足。

Conclusion: 亟需开发更具弹性和泛化能力的防御策略以应对RAG系统的投毒攻击威胁。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in mitigating
hallucinations in large language models by incorporating external knowledge
during inference. However, this integration introduces new security
vulnerabilities, particularly to poisoning attacks. Although prior work has
explored various poisoning strategies, a thorough assessment of their practical
threat to RAG systems remains missing. To address this gap, we propose the
first comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating poisoning attacks on
RAG. Our benchmark covers 5 standard question answering (QA) datasets and 10
expanded variants, along with 13 poisoning attack methods and 7 defense
mechanisms, representing a broad spectrum of existing techniques. Using this
benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of all included attacks and
defenses across the full dataset spectrum. Our findings show that while
existing attacks perform well on standard QA datasets, their effectiveness
drops significantly on the expanded versions. Moreover, our results demonstrate
that various advanced RAG architectures, such as sequential, branching,
conditional, and loop RAG, as well as multi-turn conversational RAG, multimodal
RAG systems, and RAG-based LLM agent systems, remain susceptible to poisoning
attacks. Notably, current defense techniques fail to provide robust protection,
underscoring the pressing need for more resilient and generalizable defense
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集在时间范围、多样性和规模上不足，无法系统评估概念漂移对恶意软件检测性能的影响。

Method: 构建LAMDA数据集，涵盖12年数据、100万样本和1380个恶意软件家族，并进行实证分析。

Result: LAMDA展示了标准ML模型随时间性能下降的现象，并分析了特征稳定性。

Conclusion: LAMDA是目前最全面的Android恶意软件数据集，支持深入研究概念漂移、泛化性和检测挑战。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based malware detection systems often fail to account
for the dynamic nature of real-world training and test data distributions. In
practice, these distributions evolve due to frequent changes in the Android
ecosystem, adversarial development of new malware families, and the continuous
emergence of both benign and malicious applications. Prior studies have shown
that such concept drift -- distributional shifts in benign and malicious
samples, leads to significant degradation in detection performance over time.
Despite the practical importance of this issue, existing datasets are often
outdated and limited in temporal scope, diversity of malware families, and
sample scale, making them insufficient for the systematic evaluation of concept
drift in malware detection.
  To address this gap, we present LAMDA, the largest and most temporally
diverse Android malware benchmark to date, designed specifically for concept
drift analysis. LAMDA spans 12 years (2013-2025, excluding 2015), includes over
1 million samples (approximately 37% labeled as malware), and covers 1,380
malware families and 150,000 singleton samples, reflecting the natural
distribution and evolution of real-world Android applications. We empirically
demonstrate LAMDA's utility by quantifying the performance degradation of
standard ML models over time and analyzing feature stability across years. As
the most comprehensive Android malware dataset to date, LAMDA enables in-depth
research into temporal drift, generalization, explainability, and evolving
detection challenges. The dataset and code are available at:

Abstract: Ransomware remains a critical threat to cybersecurity, yet publicly available
datasets for training machine learning-based ransomware detection models are
scarce and often have limited sample size, diversity, and reproducibility. In
this paper, we introduce MLRan, a behavioural ransomware dataset, comprising
over 4,800 samples across 64 ransomware families and a balanced set of goodware
samples. The samples span from 2006 to 2024 and encompass the four major types
of ransomware: locker, crypto, ransomware-as-a-service, and modern variants. We
also propose guidelines (GUIDE-MLRan), inspired by previous work, for
constructing high-quality behavioural ransomware datasets, which informed the
curation of our dataset. We evaluated the ransomware detection performance of
several machine learning (ML) models using MLRan. For this purpose, we
performed feature selection by conducting mutual information filtering to
reduce the initial 6.4 million features to 24,162, followed by recursive
feature elimination, yielding 483 highly informative features. The ML models
achieved an accuracy, precision and recall of up to 98.7%, 98.9%, 98.5%,
respectively. Using SHAP and LIME, we identified critical indicators of
malicious behaviour, including registry tampering, strings, and API misuse. The
dataset and source code for feature extraction, selection, ML training, and
evaluation are available publicly to support replicability and encourage future
research, which can be found at https://github.com/faithfulco/mlran.

Conclusion: 建议针对性教育、更清晰的技术指导及加强监管者、研究者和行业的合作，以弥合法律规范与技术现实的差距。

Abstract: Anonymization is a foundational principle of data privacy regulation, yet its
practical application remains riddled with ambiguity and inconsistency. This
paper introduces the concept of anonymity-washing -- the misrepresentation of
the anonymity level of ``sanitized'' personal data -- as a critical privacy
concern. While both legal and technical critiques of anonymization exist, they
tend to address isolated aspects of the problem. In contrast, this paper offers
a comprehensive overview of the conditions that enable anonymity-washing. It
synthesizes fragmented legal interpretations, technical misunderstandings, and
outdated regulatory guidance and complements them with a systematic review of
national and international resources, including legal cases, data protection
authority guidelines, and technical documentation. Our findings reveal a lack
of coherent support for practitioners, contributing to the persistent misuse of
pseudonymization and obsolete anonymization techniques. We conclude by
recommending targeted education, clearer technical guidance, and closer
cooperation between regulators, researchers, and industry to bridge the gap
between legal norms and technical reality.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一个可插拔的动态DoS防御框架（PD³F），通过两阶段方法防御LLMs的资源消耗攻击，显著提升了模型在对抗性负载下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）的高计算需求，容易受到资源消耗攻击，现有工作缺乏有效的缓解策略，导致实际部署中存在安全风险。

Method: PD³F采用两阶段防御：输入侧通过资源索引指导动态请求轮询调度，输出侧引入自适应终止机制抑制恶意生成。

Result: 在六种模型上的实验表明，PD³F显著缓解了资源消耗攻击，用户访问能力在对抗性负载下提升了500%。

Conclusion: PD³F为LLMs的弹性和资源感知部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), due to substantial computational requirements,
are vulnerable to resource consumption attacks, which can severely degrade
server performance or even cause crashes, as demonstrated by denial-of-service
(DoS) attacks designed for LLMs. However, existing works lack mitigation
strategies against such threats, resulting in unresolved security risks for
real-world LLM deployments. To this end, we propose the Pluggable and Dynamic
DoS-Defense Framework ($PD^3F$), which employs a two-stage approach to defend
against resource consumption attacks from both the input and output sides. On
the input side, we propose the Resource Index to guide Dynamic Request Polling
Scheduling, thereby reducing resource usage induced by malicious attacks under
high-concurrency scenarios. On the output side, we introduce the Adaptive
End-Based Suppression mechanism, which terminates excessive malicious
generation early. Experiments across six models demonstrate that $PD^3F$
significantly mitigates resource consumption attacks, improving users' access
capacity by up to 500% during adversarial load. $PD^3F$ represents a step
toward the resilient and resource-aware deployment of LLMs against resource
consumption attacks.

Result: 在连续Android恶意软件检测中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MADCAT能有效应对概念漂移，并与现有方法协同提升检测效果。

Abstract: We present MADCAT, a self-supervised approach designed to address the concept
drift problem in malware detection. MADCAT employs an encoder-decoder
architecture and works by test-time training of the encoder on a small,
balanced subset of the test-time data using a self-supervised objective. During
test-time training, the model learns features that are useful for detecting
both previously seen (old) data and newly arriving samples. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of MADCAT in continuous Android malware detection settings.
MADCAT consistently outperforms baseline methods in detection performance at
test time. We also show the synergy between MADCAT and prior approaches in
addressing concept drift in malware detection

Motivation: 开源项目维护者难以评估外部贡献者的网络安全影响，需要一种方法来辅助决策。

Method: 从行业标准中提取七种安全信号，映射现有指标和工具，设计研究以优化ARMS。

Result: 提出了ARMS的概念框架，并讨论了其潜在优缺点。

Conclusion: ARMS有望帮助开源生态提升网络安全评估能力，但需进一步研究和验证。

Abstract: Many critical information technology and cyber-physical systems rely on a
supply chain of open-source software projects. OSS project maintainers often
integrate contributions from external actors. While maintainers can assess the
correctness of a change request, assessing a change request's cybersecurity
implications is challenging. To help maintainers make this decision, we propose
that the open-source ecosystem should incorporate Actor Reputation Metrics
(ARMS). This capability would enable OSS maintainers to assess a prospective
contributor's cybersecurity reputation. To support the future instantiation of
ARMS, we identify seven generic security signals from industry standards; map
concrete metrics from prior work and available security tools, describe study
designs to refine and assess the utility of ARMS, and finally weigh its pros
and cons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIAs难以扩展到大型LLMs，弱攻击效果不稳定，强攻击在小规模模型上的结论不适用于LLMs，因此需要验证MIAs在LLMs上的根本有效性。

Method: 扩展LiRA攻击方法，应用于GPT-2架构（参数规模从10M到1B），并在C4数据集上训练超过20B token的参考模型。

Result: 强MIAs在LLMs上可行，但实际效果有限（如AUC<0.7），且MIA成功与隐私指标的关系复杂。

Conclusion: MIAs在LLMs上有效但受限，攻击设计与隐私指标的关系需进一步研究。

Abstract: State-of-the-art membership inference attacks (MIAs) typically require
training many reference models, making it difficult to scale these attacks to
large pre-trained language models (LLMs). As a result, prior research has
either relied on weaker attacks that avoid training reference models (e.g.,
fine-tuning attacks), or on stronger attacks applied to small-scale models and
datasets. However, weaker attacks have been shown to be brittle - achieving
close-to-arbitrary success - and insights from strong attacks in simplified
settings do not translate to today's LLMs. These challenges have prompted an
important question: are the limitations observed in prior work due to attack
design choices, or are MIAs fundamentally ineffective on LLMs? We address this
question by scaling LiRA - one of the strongest MIAs - to GPT-2 architectures
ranging from 10M to 1B parameters, training reference models on over 20B tokens
from the C4 dataset. Our results advance the understanding of MIAs on LLMs in
three key ways: (1) strong MIAs can succeed on pre-trained LLMs; (2) their
effectiveness, however, remains limited (e.g., AUC<0.7) in practical settings;
and, (3) the relationship between MIA success and related privacy metrics is
not as straightforward as prior work has suggested.

Motivation: 现有机器学习模型在恶意软件检测中缺乏鲁棒性，且易受攻击。GAN生成的对抗性恶意软件样本虽能提升鲁棒性，但现有GAN模型存在训练不稳定和对抗样本弱的问题。

Method: 设计了Mal-D2GAN模型，采用双检测器和最小二乘损失函数，并在20,000个样本的数据集上进行了测试。

Result: Mal-D2GAN模型降低了8个恶意软件检测器的检测准确率（真阳性率），性能优于现有的MalGAN和Mal-LSGAN模型。

Conclusion: Mal-D2GAN模型有效解决了现有GAN模型的局限性，提升了对抗性恶意软件生成的效果。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been developed to detect malware in recent years.
Most researchers focused their efforts on improving the detection performance
but ignored the robustness of the ML models. In addition, many machine learning
algorithms are very vulnerable to intentional attacks. To solve these problems,
adversarial malware examples are generated by GANs to enhance the robustness of
the malware detector. However, since current GAN models suffer from limitations
such as unstable training and weak adversarial examples, we propose the
Mal-D2GAN model to address these problems. Specifically, the Mal-D2GAN
architecture was designed with double-detector and a least square loss function
and tested on a dataset of 20,000 samples. The results show that the Mal-D2GAN
model reduced the detection accuracy (true positive rate) in 8 malware
detectors. The performance was then compared with that of the existing MalGAN
and Mal- LSGAN models.

Abstract: As electronic signatures (e-signatures) become increasingly integral to
secure digital transactions, understanding their usability and security
perception from an end-user perspective has become crucial. This study
empirically evaluates and compares two major e-signature systems -- token-based
and remote signatures -- through a controlled user experience study with 20
participants. Participants completed tasks involving acquisition, installation,
and document signing using both methods, followed by structured surveys and
qualitative feedback. Statistical analyses revealed that remote e-signatures
were perceived as significantly more usable than token-based ones, due to their
minimal setup and platform-independent accessibility. In contrast, token-based
signatures were rated as significantly more secure, highlighting users' trust
in hardware-based protection. Although more participants preferred remote
e-signatures for document signing, the preference did not reach statistical
significance, indicating a trend toward favoring convenience in real-world
scenarios. These findings underline the fundamental trade-off between usability
and perceived security in digital signing systems. By bridging the gap between
theoretical frameworks and real user experience, this study contributes
valuable insights to the design and policymaking of qualified electronic
signature solutions.

Conclusion: 本文首次系统综述了6G中LLM辅助的APT检测，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Sixth Generation (6G) wireless networks, which are expected to be deployed in
the 2030s, have already created great excitement in academia and the private
sector with their extremely high communication speed and low latency rates.
However, despite the ultra-low latency, high throughput, and AI-assisted
orchestration capabilities they promise, they are vulnerable to stealthy and
long-term Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Large Language Models (LLMs)
stand out as an ideal candidate to fill this gap with their high success in
semantic reasoning and threat intelligence. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive systematic review and taxonomy study for LLM-assisted APT
detection in 6G networks. We address five research questions, namely, semantic
merging of fragmented logs, encrypted traffic analysis, edge distribution
constraints, dataset/modeling techniques, and reproducibility trends, by
leveraging most recent studies on the intersection of LLMs, APTs, and 6G
wireless networks. We identify open challenges such as explainability gaps,
data scarcity, edge hardware limitations, and the need for real-time
slicing-aware adaptation by presenting various taxonomies such as granularity,
deployment models, and kill chain stages. We then conclude the paper by
providing several research gaps in 6G infrastructures for future researchers.
To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first comprehensive systematic
review and classification study on LLM-based APT detection in 6G networks.

Result: 该系统不仅提升了安全性，还符合GDPR和FCRA等法规，同时保持了良好的用户体验。

Conclusion: 通过实施此系统，金融机构可以显著降低身份盗窃风险，防止未经授权的信用检查，并增强客户对信用验证系统的信任。

Abstract: Unauthorized credit inquiries are also a central entry point for identity
theft, with Social Security Numbers (SSNs) being widely utilized in fraudulent
cases. Traditional credit inquiry systems do not usually possess strict user
authentication, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access. This paper
proposes a real-time user authorization system to enhance security by enforcing
explicit user approval before processing any credit inquiry. The system employs
real-time verification and approval techniques. This ensures that the
authorized user only approves or rejects a credit check request. It minimizes
the risks of interference by third parties. Apart from enhancing security, this
system complies with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) while maintaining a seamless
user experience. This article discusses the technical issues, scaling-up
issues, and ways of implementing real-time user authorization in financial
systems. Through this framework, financial institutions can drastically
minimize the risk of identity theft, avert unauthorized credit checks, and
increase customer trust in the credit verification system.

Abstract: With constant threats to the safety of personal data in the United States,
privacy literacy has become an increasingly important competency among
university students, one that ties intimately to the information sharing
behavior of these students. This survey based study examines how university
students in the United States perceive personal data privacy and how their
privacy literacy influences their understanding and behaviors. Students
responses to a privacy literacy scale were categorized into high and low
privacy literacy groups, revealing that high literacy individuals demonstrate a
broader range of privacy practices, including multi factor authentication, VPN
usage, and phishing awareness, whereas low literacy individuals rely on more
basic security measures. Statistical analyses suggest that high literacy
respondents display greater diversity in recommendations and engagement in
privacy discussions. These findings suggest the need for enhanced educational
initiatives to improve data privacy awareness at the university level to create
a better cyber safe population.

Motivation: 随着LLMs能力的提升，其安全漏洞引发了新的担忧，论文旨在全面梳理这些威胁并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过分类威胁（如提示注入、对抗攻击等）并分析近年学术与工业研究，总结防御措施及其局限性。

Result: 揭示了LLMs的多重安全风险，如目标错位、欺骗行为等，并指出当前防御措施的不足。

Conclusion: 强调需发展多层次安全策略以确保LLMs的安全性与有益性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 (and its recent iterations like
GPT-4o and the GPT-4.1 series), Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude 3 models,
and xAI's Grok have caused a revolution in natural language processing, but
their capabilities also introduce new security vulnerabilities. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging security concerns around
LLMs, categorizing threats into prompt injection and jailbreaking, adversarial
attacks (including input perturbations and data poisoning), misuse by malicious
actors (e.g., for disinformation, phishing, and malware generation), and
worrisome risks inherent in autonomous LLM agents. A significant focus has been
recently placed on the latter, exploring goal misalignment, emergent deception,
self-preservation instincts, and the potential for LLMs to develop and pursue
covert, misaligned objectives (scheming), which may even persist through safety
training. We summarize recent academic and industrial studies (2022-2025) that
exemplify each threat, analyze proposed defenses and their limitations, and
identify open challenges in securing LLM-based applications. We conclude by
emphasizing the importance of advancing robust, multi-layered security

*Hyunwoo Kim,Jaeseong Lee,Sunpyo Hong,Changmin Han*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: Secure IVSHMEM协议通过三种技术实现高性能和安全性的平衡，适用于对安全和延迟要求高的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IVSHMEM实现缺乏安全控制，易受窃听或篡改攻击。

Method: 结合通道分离与内核模块访问控制、虚拟机监控程序中介的握手认证，以及应用级集成。

Result: 握手时间低于200ms，数据平面往返延迟仅比基线高5%，带宽开销可忽略。

Conclusion: Secure IVSHMEM适用于汽车系统等对性能和安全性要求高的领域。

Abstract: In-host shared memory (IVSHMEM) enables high-throughput, zero-copy
communication between virtual machines, but today's implementations lack any
security control, allowing any application to eavesdrop or tamper with the
IVSHMEM region. This paper presents Secure IVSHMEM, a protocol that provides
end-to-end mutual authentication and fine-grained access enforcement with
negligible performance cost. We combine three techniques to ensure security:
(1) channel separation and kernel module access control, (2)hypervisor-mediated
handshake for end-to-end service authentication, and (3)application-level
integration for abstraction and performance mitigation. In microbenchmarks,
Secure IVSHMEM completes its one-time handshake in under 200ms and sustains
data-plane round-trip latencies within 5\% of the unmodified baseline, with
negligible bandwidth overhead. We believe this design is ideally suited for
safety and latency-critical in-host domains, such as automotive systems, where
both performance and security are paramount.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种定量安全概念，用于衡量攻击单个组件如何放大整个系统的经济损失，并分析了借贷协议和去中心化交易所组合的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化应用（尤其是DeFi）中，智能合约的互联性导致攻击单个组件可能引发系统性经济损失，现有安全概念无法量化这种影响。

Method: 引入了一种定量安全概念，研究其基本性质，并应用于评估关键组合（如借贷协议与去中心化交易所）的安全性。

Result: 通过分析，量化了攻击单个组件对系统整体经济安全的放大效应，特别研究了抵押不足贷款攻击。

Conclusion: 提出的定量安全概念有助于更全面地评估DeFi系统的经济安全性，尤其是在组件互联的场景下。

Abstract: Decentralized applications are often composed of multiple interconnected
smart contracts. This is especially evident in DeFi, where protocols are
heavily intertwined and rely on a variety of basic building blocks such as
tokens, decentralized exchanges and lending protocols. A crucial security
challenge in this setting arises when adversaries target individual components
to cause systemic economic losses. Existing security notions focus on
determining the existence of these attacks, but fail to quantify the effect of
manipulating individual components on the overall economic security of the
system. In this paper, we introduce a quantitative security notion that
measures how an attack on a single component can amplify economic losses of the
overall system. We study the fundamental properties of this notion and apply it
to assess the security of key compositions. In particular, we analyse
under-collateralized loan attacks in systems made of lending protocols and
decentralized exchanges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Move语言与EVM字节码集成时引入了新的混合漏洞，现有分类系统无法完全覆盖。

Method: 提出包含37种漏洞类型的分类系统（MWC-100至MWC-136），涵盖六个语义框架，并通过真实合约分析验证。

Result: 现有验证工具常忽略这些混合风险，分类系统为形式化方法和LLM审计提供了基础。

Conclusion: MWC为下一代区块链系统中的智能合约审计提供了更安全、可验证的基础。

Abstract: We introduce the MoveEVM Weakness Classification (MWC) system -- a dedicated
vulnerability taxonomy for smart contracts built with Move and executed in
EVM-compatible environments. While Move was originally designed to prevent
common security flaws via linear resource types and strict ownership, its
integration with EVM bytecode introduces novel hybrid vulnerabilities not
captured by existing systems like the SWC registry. Our taxonomy spans 37
categorized vulnerability types (MWC-100 to MWC-136) across six semantic
frames, addressing issues such as hybrid gas metering, capability misuse,
meta-transaction spoofing, and AI-integrated logic. Through analysis of
real-world contracts from Aptos and Sui, we demonstrate that current
verification tools often miss these hybrid risks. We also explore how formal
methods and LLM-based audit agents can operationalize this classification,
enabling scalable, logic-aware smart contract auditing. MWC lays the foundation
for more secure and verifiable contracts in next-generation blockchain systems.

TLDR: 提出ALRPHFS框架，通过离线对抗自学习和在线分层推理，填补LLM代理安全检测的语义鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全检测方法难以应对复杂语义风险，导致与实际风险之间存在显著差距。

Method: ALRPHFS包含离线对抗自学习循环和在线分层快速与慢速推理引擎。

Result: 实验显示ALRPHFS平均准确率达80%，优于现有基线，且泛化性强。

Conclusion: ALRPHFS有效提升LLM代理的安全性，填补了语义鸿沟。

Abstract: LLM Agents are becoming central to intelligent systems. However, their
deployment raises serious safety concerns. Existing defenses largely rely on
"Safety Checks", which struggle to capture the complex semantic risks posed by
harmful user inputs or unsafe agent behaviors - creating a significant semantic
gap between safety checks and real-world risks. To bridge this gap, we propose
a novel defense framework, ALRPHFS (Adversarially Learned Risk Patterns with
Hierarchical Fast & Slow Reasoning). ALRPHFS consists of two core components:
(1) an offline adversarial self-learning loop to iteratively refine a
generalizable and balanced library of risk patterns, substantially enhancing
robustness without retraining the base LLM, and (2) an online hierarchical fast
& slow reasoning engine that balances detection effectiveness with
computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves superior overall performance compared to existing baselines, achieving
a best-in-class average accuracy of 80% and exhibiting strong generalizability
across agents and tasks.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯的安全依赖图（BSAGIoT），用于分析物联网网络中的安全威胁和漏洞，并量化其影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网安全是一个重要问题，但现有研究多集中于攻击分类而非全面威胁分析。本文旨在提供一种通用模型，帮助专家在攻击发生前分析网络安全性。

Method: 提出BSAGIoT模型，涵盖数据、访问控制、标准、网络和损失五类安全方面，并通过贝叶斯图展示其关系。实验验证了模型在不同场景下的可行性。

Result: 实验结果表明，BSAGIoT能有效量化安全方面的影响，帮助识别根因、评估风险，并缓解物联网网络的安全缺陷。

Conclusion: BSAGIoT为物联网安全提供了一种通用分析工具，能够提前识别和解决潜在威胁。

Abstract: IoT is a dynamic network of interconnected things that communicate and
exchange data, where security is a significant issue. Previous studies have
mainly focused on attack classifications and open issues rather than presenting
a comprehensive overview on the existing threats and vulnerabilities. This
knowledge helps analyzing the network in the early stages even before any
attack takes place. In this paper, the researchers have proposed different
security aspects and a novel Bayesian Security Aspects Dependency Graph for IoT
(BSAGIoT) to illustrate their relations. The proposed BSAGIoT is a generic
model applicable to any IoT network and contains aspects from five categories
named data, access control, standard, network, and loss. This proposed Bayesian
Security Aspect Graph (BSAG) presents an overview of the security aspects in
any given IoT network. The purpose of BSAGIoT is to assist security experts in
analyzing how a successful compromise and/or a failed breach could impact the
overall security and privacy of the respective IoT network. In addition, root
cause identification of security challenges, how they affect one another, their
impact on IoT networks via topological sorting, and risk assessment could be
achieved. Hence, to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method,
experimental results with various scenarios has been presented, in which the
security aspects have been quantified based on the network configurations. The
results indicate the impact of the aspects on each other and how they could be
utilized to mitigate and/or eliminate the security and privacy deficiencies in
IoT networks.

*Ken Huang,Vineeth Sai Narajala,John Yeoh,Ramesh Raskar,Youssef Harkati,Jerry Huang,Idan Habler,Chris Hughes*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新型的Agentic AI IAM框架，以解决传统IAM系统在多代理系统（MAS）中的不足，包括动态身份管理、细粒度访问控制和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IAM系统设计用于人类用户或静态机器身份，无法满足多代理系统中动态、相互依赖且短暂存在的AI代理的需求。

Method: 提出基于去中心化标识符（DIDs）和可验证凭证（VCs）的框架，包括代理命名服务（ANS）、动态细粒度访问控制机制和全局会话管理层，并利用零知识证明（ZKPs）实现隐私保护。

Result: 框架提供了动态身份管理、细粒度访问控制和隐私保护功能，为多代理系统建立了信任和安全基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为Agentic AI和多代理系统的复杂生态系统提供了必要的信任、问责和安全性。

Abstract: Traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, primarily designed
for human users or static machine identities via protocols such as OAuth,
OpenID Connect (OIDC), and SAML, prove fundamentally inadequate for the
dynamic, interdependent, and often ephemeral nature of AI agents operating at
scale within Multi Agent Systems (MAS), a computational system composed of
multiple interacting intelligent agents that work collectively.
  This paper posits the imperative for a novel Agentic AI IAM framework: We
deconstruct the limitations of existing protocols when applied to MAS,
illustrating with concrete examples why their coarse-grained controls,
single-entity focus, and lack of context-awareness falter. We then propose a
comprehensive framework built upon rich, verifiable Agent Identities (IDs),
leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs),
that encapsulate an agents capabilities, provenance, behavioral scope, and
security posture.
  Our framework includes an Agent Naming Service (ANS) for secure and
capability-aware discovery, dynamic fine-grained access control mechanisms, and
critically, a unified global session management and policy enforcement layer
for real-time control and consistent revocation across heterogeneous agent
communication protocols. We also explore how Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
enable privacy-preserving attribute disclosure and verifiable policy
compliance.
  We outline the architecture, operational lifecycle, innovative contributions,
and security considerations of this new IAM paradigm, aiming to establish the
foundational trust, accountability, and security necessary for the burgeoning
field of agentic AI and the complex ecosystems they will inhabit.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为RADEP的多层防御框架，用于保护MLaaS模型免受模型提取攻击，通过渐进式对抗训练、恶意查询检测和自适应响应机制等方法，显著降低了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLaaS服务易受模型提取攻击，现有防御策略存在高计算成本、适应性差和性能下降等问题，因此需要一种更有效的保护框架。

Method: RADEP采用渐进式对抗训练增强模型抗攻击能力，结合不确定性量化和行为模式分析检测恶意查询，并通过自适应响应机制和所有权验证（水印和后门触发器）保护模型。

Result: 实验表明，RADEP显著降低了模型提取成功率，同时保持高检测精度，对合法查询影响极小。

Conclusion: RADEP是一种可靠的安全框架，能有效防御模型提取攻击，并适应对抗性攻击的演变。

Abstract: Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) enables users to leverage powerful
machine learning models through cloud-based APIs, offering scalability and ease
of deployment. However, these services are vulnerable to model extraction
attacks, where adversaries repeatedly query the application programming
interface (API) to reconstruct a functionally similar model, compromising
intellectual property and security. Despite various defense strategies being
proposed, many suffer from high computational costs, limited adaptability to
evolving attack techniques, and a reduction in performance for legitimate
users. In this paper, we introduce a Resilient Adaptive Defense Framework for
Model Extraction Attack Protection (RADEP), a multifaceted defense framework
designed to counteract model extraction attacks through a multi-layered
security approach. RADEP employs progressive adversarial training to enhance
model resilience against extraction attempts. Malicious query detection is
achieved through a combination of uncertainty quantification and behavioral
pattern analysis, effectively identifying adversarial queries. Furthermore, we
develop an adaptive response mechanism that dynamically modifies query outputs
based on their suspicion scores, reducing the utility of stolen models.
Finally, ownership verification is enforced through embedded watermarking and
backdoor triggers, enabling reliable identification of unauthorized model use.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that RADEP significantly reduces
extraction success rates while maintaining high detection accuracy with minimal
impact on legitimate queries. Extensive experiments show that RADEP effectively
defends against model extraction attacks and remains resilient even against
adaptive adversaries, making it a reliable security framework for MLaaS models.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: VADER是一个评估大型语言模型（LLM）在软件漏洞处理方面表现的基准，涵盖评估、检测、解释和修复四个维度。结果显示当前LLM表现中等，修复质量与分类和测试计划准确性高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建强大且安全的软件系统需要LLM能够有效处理软件漏洞。

Method: 使用174个真实漏洞案例，通过单次提示策略评估6种先进LLM，并由安全专家根据评分标准评估。

Result: 当前LLM在VADER上表现中等（准确率49-54%），修复质量与分类和测试计划准确性高度相关（Pearson r > 0.97）。

Conclusion: VADER为社区提供了可解释、可复现的基准，推动漏洞感知LLM的发展。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) can effectively assess, detect,
explain, and remediate software vulnerabilities is critical for building robust
and secure software systems. We introduce VADER, a human-evaluated benchmark
designed explicitly to assess LLM performance across four key
vulnerability-handling dimensions: assessment, detection, explanation, and
remediation. VADER comprises 174 real-world software vulnerabilities, each
carefully curated from GitHub repositories and annotated by security experts.
For each vulnerability case, models are tasked with identifying the flaw,
classifying it using Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), explaining its
underlying cause, proposing a patch, and formulating a test plan. Using a
one-shot prompting strategy, we benchmark six state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, Grok 3 Beta, and o3) on VADER, and
human security experts evaluated each response according to a rigorous scoring
rubric emphasizing remediation (quality of the code fix, 50%), explanation
(20%), and classification and test plan (30%) according to a standardized
rubric. Our results show that current state-of-the-art LLMs achieve only
moderate success on VADER - OpenAI's o3 attained 54.7% accuracy overall, with
others in the 49-54% range, indicating ample room for improvement. Notably,
remediation quality is strongly correlated (Pearson r > 0.97) with accurate
classification and test plans, suggesting that models that effectively
categorize vulnerabilities also tend to fix them well. VADER's comprehensive
dataset, detailed evaluation rubrics, scoring tools, and visualized results
with confidence intervals are publicly released, providing the community with
an interpretable, reproducible benchmark to advance vulnerability-aware LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管网页中的JavaScript包含安全性已得到广泛研究，但浏览器扩展中的此类包含安全性尚未被充分调查。

Method: 采用静态和动态分析的混合方法，对36,324个Chrome扩展进行了系统测量。

Result: 发现了350,784个JavaScript包含，其中22个远程包含存在漏洞，且扩展中普遍使用了易受攻击的过时库。

Conclusion: 浏览器扩展中的JavaScript包含存在安全隐患，尤其是远程包含和过时库的使用，可能被恶意利用。

Abstract: JavaScript, a scripting language employed to augment the capabilities of web
browsers within web pages or browser extensions, utilizes code segments termed
JavaScript inclusions. While the security aspects of JavaScript inclusions in
web pages have undergone substantial scrutiny, a thorough investigation into
the security of such inclusions within browser extensions remains absent,
despite the divergent security paradigms governing these environments. This
study presents a systematic measurement of JavaScript inclusions in Chrome
extensions, employing a hybrid methodology encompassing static and dynamic
analysis to identify these inclusions. The analysis of 36,324 extensions
revealed 350,784 JavaScript inclusions. Subsequent security assessment
indicated that, although the majority of these inclusions originate from local
files within the extensions rather than external servers, 22 instances of
vulnerable remote JavaScript inclusions were identified. These remote
inclusions present potential avenues for malicious actors to execute arbitrary
code within the extension's execution context. Furthermore, an analysis of
JavaScript library utilization within Chrome extensions disclosed the prevalent
use of susceptible and outdated libraries, notably within numerous widely
adopted extensions.

Motivation: 加密流量增加导致传统分析方法难以分类应用和检测攻击，现有深度学习方法依赖标注数据且难以应对攻击变种。

Method: 提出协议感知的令牌化方法和预训练模型GBC，结合提示学习适应下游任务。

Result: GBC在多个数据集上表现优异，分类任务F1分数提升5%。

Conclusion: GBC通过协议感知令牌化和预训练，显著提升了加密流量分类和生成的性能。

Abstract: The increasing demand for privacy protection and security considerations
leads to a significant rise in the proportion of encrypted network traffic.
Since traffic content becomes unrecognizable after encryption, accurate
analysis is challenging, making it difficult to classify applications and
detect attacks. Deep learning is currently the predominant approach for
encrypted traffic classification through feature analysis. However, these
methods face limitations due to their high dependence on labeled data and
difficulties in detecting attack variants. First, their performance is highly
sensitive to data quality, where the highcost manual labeling process and
dataset imbalance significantly degrade results. Second, the rapid evolution of
attack patterns makes it challenging for models to identify new types of
attacks. To tackle these challenges, we present GBC, a generative model based
on pre-training for encrypted traffic comprehension. Since traditional
tokenization methods are primarily designed for natural language, we propose a
protocol-aware tokenization approach for encrypted traffic that improves model
comprehension of fields specific to network traffic. In addition, GBC employs
pretraining to learn general representations from extensive unlabeled traffic
data. Through prompt learning, it effectively adapts to various downstream
tasks, enabling both high-quality traffic generation and effective detection.
Evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that GBC achieves superior
results in both traffic classification and generation tasks, resulting in a 5%
improvement in F1 score compared to state-of-the-art methods for classification
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅在干扰完全破坏通信链路后才能检测，而实际场景中需要早期检测弱干扰信号以采取缓解措施。

Result: 实验证明在真实环境中检测弱干扰信号是可行的，并提供了不同技术和场景的深入分析。

Conclusion: 研究为弱干扰信号的早期检测提供了实用解决方案，并公开了数据集供进一步研究。

Abstract: State-of-the-art solutions detect jamming attacks ex-post, i.e., only when
jamming has already disrupted the wireless communication link. In many
scenarios, e.g., mobile networks or static deployments distributed over a large
geographical area, it is often desired to detect jamming at the early stage,
when it affects the communication link enough to be detected but not
sufficiently to disrupt it (detection of weak jamming signals). Under such
assumptions, devices can enhance situational awareness and promptly apply
mitigation, e.g., moving away from the jammed area in mobile scenarios or
changing communication frequency in static deployments, before jamming fully
disrupts the communication link. Although some contributions recently
demonstrated the feasibility of detecting low-power and weak jamming signals,
they make simplistic assumptions far from real-world deployments. Given the
current state of the art, no evidence exists that detection of weak jamming can
be considered with real-world communication technologies. In this paper, we
provide and comprehensively analyze new general-purpose strategies for
detecting weak jamming signals, compatible by design with one of the most
relevant communication technologies used by commercial-off-the-shelf devices,
i.e., IEEE 802.11. We describe two operational modes: (i) binary classification
via Convolutional Neural Networks and (ii) one-class classification via Sparse
Autoencoders. We evaluate and compare the proposed approaches with the current
state-of-the-art using data collected through an extensive real-world
experimental campaign in three relevant environments. At the same time, we made
the dataset available to the public. Our results demonstrate that detecting
weak jamming signals is feasible in all considered real-world environments, and
we provide an in-depth analysis considering different techniques, scenarios,
and mobility patterns.

TLDR: ShadowPrint是一种新型后门攻击方法，通过针对神经网络的特征嵌入实现高攻击成功率和隐蔽性，减少对训练数据的依赖，并在极低毒化率下有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击对训练数据依赖性强、隐蔽性差且不稳定，限制了其实际应用效果。

Method: 采用基于聚类的优化策略对齐特征嵌入，减少对训练数据的依赖，并在极低毒化率（低至0.01%）下操作。

Result: 攻击成功率高达100%，准确率衰减不超过1%，检测率平均低于5%，在干净标签和脏标签设置下均表现优异。

Conclusion: ShadowPrint为后门攻击能力设定了新标准，强调了针对特征空间操作的高级防御策略的必要性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed malicious triggers into training data, enabling
attackers to manipulate neural network behavior during inference while
maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs. However, existing backdoor attacks
face limitations manifesting in excessive reliance on training data, poor
stealth, and instability, which hinder their effectiveness in real-world
applications. Therefore, this paper introduces ShadowPrint, a versatile
backdoor attack that targets feature embeddings within neural networks to
achieve high ASRs and stealthiness. Unlike traditional approaches, ShadowPrint
reduces reliance on training data access and operates effectively with
exceedingly low poison rates (as low as 0.01%). It leverages a clustering-based
optimization strategy to align feature embeddings, ensuring robust performance
across diverse scenarios while maintaining stability and stealth. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ShadowPrint achieves superior ASR (up to 100%),
steady CA (with decay no more than 1% in most cases), and low DDR (averaging
below 5%) across both clean-label and dirty-label settings, and with poison
rates ranging from as low as 0.01% to 0.05%, setting a new standard for
backdoor attack capabilities and emphasizing the need for advanced defense
strategies focused on feature space manipulations.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法需要频繁查询目标模型或依赖目标模型的训练数据，但在实际场景中这些条件难以满足，因此需要一种更通用的攻击方法。

Method: 利用公开的CLIP模型和数据集，通过文本概念生成通用的、可迁移的、目标明确的对抗性扰动。

Result: 在ImageNet上攻击成功率达85%，CIFAR-10上超过99%，并能成功攻击Google、Baidu等图像搜索引擎及GPT-4、Claude-3.5等视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: UnivIntruder展示了在传统攻击途径受限时的实用性，呼吁重新评估AI应用的安全范式。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved widespread success yet remain prone
to adversarial attacks. Typically, such attacks either involve frequent queries
to the target model or rely on surrogate models closely mirroring the target
model -- often trained with subsets of the target model's training data -- to
achieve high attack success rates through transferability. However, in
realistic scenarios where training data is inaccessible and excessive queries
can raise alarms, crafting adversarial examples becomes more challenging. In
this paper, we present UnivIntruder, a novel attack framework that relies
solely on a single, publicly available CLIP model and publicly available
datasets. By using textual concepts, UnivIntruder generates universal,
transferable, and targeted adversarial perturbations that mislead DNNs into
misclassifying inputs into adversary-specified classes defined by textual
concepts.
  Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of up to 85% on ImageNet and over 99% on CIFAR-10, significantly
outperforming existing transfer-based methods. Additionally, we reveal
real-world vulnerabilities, showing that even without querying target models,
UnivIntruder compromises image search engines like Google and Baidu with ASR
rates up to 84%, and vision language models like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 with ASR
rates up to 80%. These findings underscore the practicality of our attack in
scenarios where traditional avenues are blocked, highlighting the need to
reevaluate security paradigms in AI applications.

*Chunyang Li,Junwei Zhang,Anda Cheng,Zhuo Ma,Xinghua Li,Jianfeng Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: CPA-RAG是一种黑盒对抗框架，通过生成查询相关文本来操纵检索过程，诱导目标答案，攻击成功率超过90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统的投毒方法存在泛化性差和对抗文本不流畅等问题，需要更有效的攻击方法。

Method: 结合基于提示的文本生成、多LLM交叉引导优化和基于检索器的评分，构建高质量对抗样本。

Result: 在top-k为5时攻击成功率超90%，优于现有黑盒基线14.5个百分点，并成功攻击商业RAG系统。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RAG框架在安全性上的不足，需开发更鲁棒的防御机制。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge, but its openness introduces vulnerabilities
that can be exploited by poisoning attacks. Existing poisoning methods for RAG
systems have limitations, such as poor generalization and lack of fluency in
adversarial texts. In this paper, we propose CPA-RAG, a black-box adversarial
framework that generates query-relevant texts capable of manipulating the
retrieval process to induce target answers. The proposed method integrates
prompt-based text generation, cross-guided optimization through multiple LLMs,
and retriever-based scoring to construct high-quality adversarial samples. We
conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs to evaluate its
effectiveness. Results show that the framework achieves over 90\% attack
success when the top-k retrieval setting is 5, matching white-box performance,
and maintains a consistent advantage of approximately 5 percentage points
across different top-k values. It also outperforms existing black-box baselines
by 14.5 percentage points under various defense strategies. Furthermore, our
method successfully compromises a commercial RAG system deployed on Alibaba's
BaiLian platform, demonstrating its practical threat in real-world
applications. These findings underscore the need for more robust and secure RAG
frameworks to defend against poisoning attacks.

TLDR: 论文探讨了通过众包方式（如CTF竞赛）评估AI的网络安全能力，发现AI表现优异，并提出悬赏机制作为补充内部评估的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力增强，准确评估其网络安全潜力对治理和部署至关重要，但现有方法常低估其能力。

Method: 在两次CTF竞赛中（AI vs. Humans和Cyber Apocalypse_）测试AI表现，并收集人类数据作为对比。

Result: AI团队表现优异（前13%和前21%），表明众包评估可作为内部评估的有效补充。

Conclusion: 提出悬赏机制作为成本效益高的AI能力评估方法，并展示了AI在网络安全任务中的潜力。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly capable, understanding their offensive
cyber potential is critical for informed governance and responsible deployment.
However, it's hard to accurately bound their capabilities, and some prior
evaluations dramatically underestimated them. The art of extracting maximum
task-specific performance from AIs is called "AI elicitation", and today's
safety organizations typically conduct it in-house. In this paper, we explore
crowdsourcing elicitation efforts as an alternative to in-house elicitation
work.
  We host open-access AI tracks at two Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions: AI
vs. Humans (400 teams) and Cyber Apocalypse_ (4000 teams). The AI teams achieve
outstanding performance at both events, ranking top-13% and top-21%
respectively for a total of \$7500 in bounties. This impressive performance
suggests that open-market elicitation may offer an effective complement to
in-house elicitation. We propose elicitation bounties as a practical mechanism
for maintaining timely, cost-effective situational awareness of emerging AI
capabilities.
  Another advantage of open elicitations is the option to collect human
performance data at scale. Applying METR's methodology, we found that AI agents
can reliably solve cyber challenges requiring one hour or less of effort from a
median human CTF participant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在DFIR任务中展现出潜力，但其错误和幻觉问题在高风险环境中引发担忧，目前缺乏全面的评估基准。

Method: DFIR-Metric包含700个专家评审的多选题、150个CTF式任务和500个NIST CFTT案例，并引入任务理解分数（TUS）作为新指标。

Result: 评估了14个LLMs的准确性和一致性，提供了可重复的基准。

Conclusion: DFIR-Metric为AI在数字取证领域的进步提供了严格且可复现的基础。

Abstract: Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) involves analyzing digital
evidence to support legal investigations. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
new opportunities in DFIR tasks such as log analysis and memory forensics, but
their susceptibility to errors and hallucinations raises concerns in
high-stakes contexts. Despite growing interest, there is no comprehensive
benchmark to evaluate LLMs across both theoretical and practical DFIR domains.
To address this gap, we present DFIR-Metric, a benchmark with three components:
(1) Knowledge Assessment: a set of 700 expert-reviewed multiple-choice
questions sourced from industry-standard certifications and official
documentation; (2) Realistic Forensic Challenges: 150 CTF-style tasks testing
multi-step reasoning and evidence correlation; and (3) Practical Analysis: 500
disk and memory forensics cases from the NIST Computer Forensics Tool Testing
Program (CFTT). We evaluated 14 LLMs using DFIR-Metric, analyzing both their
accuracy and consistency across trials. We also introduce a new metric, the
Task Understanding Score (TUS), designed to more effectively evaluate models in
scenarios where they achieve near-zero accuracy. This benchmark offers a
rigorous, reproducible foundation for advancing AI in digital forensics. All
scripts, artifacts, and results are available on the project website at

TLDR: 研究发现开源项目中存在大量重复的路径遍历漏洞（CWE-22），开发了自动化工具扫描并修复漏洞，部分项目已修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件漏洞可能引发连锁反应，重复漏洞尤其危险，需研究其普遍性和影响。

Method: 开发自动化管道，扫描GitHub项目，静态分析确认漏洞，计算CVSS评分，用GPT-4生成补丁并通知维护者。

Result: 发现1,756个漏洞项目，部分影响严重（CVSS>9.0），14%漏洞已修复。

Conclusion: 需推广自动化漏洞管理方案并提高开发者意识，以保障开源生态安全。

Abstract: Vulnerabilities in open-source software can cause cascading effects in the
modern digital ecosystem. It is especially worrying if these vulnerabilities
repeat across many projects, as once the adversaries find one of them, they can
scale up the attack very easily. Unfortunately, since developers frequently
reuse code from their own or external code resources, some nearly identical
vulnerabilities exist across many open-source projects.
  We conducted a study to examine the prevalence of a particular vulnerable
code pattern that enables path traversal attacks (CWE-22) across open-source
GitHub projects. To handle this study at the GitHub scale, we developed an
automated pipeline that scans GitHub for the targeted vulnerable pattern,
confirms the vulnerability by first running a static analysis and then
exploiting the vulnerability in the context of the studied project, assesses
its impact by calculating the CVSS score, generates a patch using GPT-4, and
reports the vulnerability to the maintainers.
  Using our pipeline, we identified 1,756 vulnerable open-source projects, some
of which are very influential. For many of the affected projects, the
vulnerability is critical (CVSS score higher than 9.0), as it can be exploited
remotely without any privileges and critically impact the confidentiality and
availability of the system. We have responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to
the maintainers, and 14\% of the reported vulnerabilities have been remediated.
  We also investigated the root causes of the vulnerable code pattern and
assessed the side effects of the large number of copies of this vulnerable
pattern that seem to have poisoned several popular LLMs. Our study highlights
the urgent need to help secure the open-source ecosystem by leveraging scalable
automated vulnerability management solutions and raising awareness among
developers.

TLDR: 提出了一种终身安全对齐框架，通过元攻击者和防御者的竞争机制，使LLM能够持续适应新的越狱攻击策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在面对未知越狱攻击时的安全问题，提升其部署的可靠性。

Method: 框架包含元攻击者和防御者，元攻击者通过GPT-4o提取研究论文中的关键见解，生成新攻击策略；防御者则不断学习抵抗这些攻击。

Result: 元攻击者在首次迭代中单轮攻击成功率达73%，防御者最终将其成功率降至7%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了LLM的安全性和适应性，适用于开放环境部署。

Abstract: LLMs have made impressive progress, but their growing capabilities also
expose them to highly flexible jailbreaking attacks designed to bypass safety
alignment. While many existing defenses focus on known types of attacks, it is
more critical to prepare LLMs for unseen attacks that may arise during
deployment. To address this, we propose a lifelong safety alignment framework
that enables LLMs to continuously adapt to new and evolving jailbreaking
strategies. Our framework introduces a competitive setup between two
components: a Meta-Attacker, trained to actively discover novel jailbreaking
strategies, and a Defender, trained to resist them. To effectively warm up the
Meta-Attacker, we first leverage the GPT-4o API to extract key insights from a
large collection of jailbreak-related research papers. Through iterative
training, the first iteration Meta-Attacker achieves a 73% attack success rate
(ASR) on RR and a 57% transfer ASR on LAT using only single-turn attacks.
Meanwhile, the Defender progressively improves its robustness and ultimately
reduces the Meta-Attacker's success rate to just 7%, enabling safer and more
reliable deployment of LLMs in open-ended environments. The code is available

*Davide Macario,Hulya Seferoglu,Erdem Koyuncu*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: MDI-LLM是一种新型框架，通过将大语言模型分割并分配到边缘设备上，利用设备间协作计算实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在低功耗边缘设备上部署的挑战，突破单设备内存限制。

Method: 采用模型分割和“循环管道并行”技术，减少设备空闲时间，支持并行推理。

Result: MDI-LLM能够利用多设备资源，提升生成吞吐量并降低单设备内存消耗。

Conclusion: 该框架为边缘设备上部署大语言模型提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Model-Distributed Inference for Large-Language Models (MDI-LLM),
a novel framework designed to facilitate the deployment of state-of-the-art
large-language models (LLMs) across low-power devices at the edge. This is
accomplished by dividing the model into multiple partitions, which are then
assigned to different devices/nodes within the network. These nodes exchange
intermediate activation vectors via device-to-device links, enabling
collaborative computation. To enhance the efficiency of this process, we
propose the "recurrent pipeline parallelism" technique, which reduces idle time
on each device and facilitates parallel inference during the generation of
multiple text sequences. By leveraging the combined computational resources of
multiple edge devices, MDI-LLM enables the deployment of LLMs that exceed the
memory capacity of individual devices, making it possible to perform inference
on low-cost hardware. Furthermore, as the number of participating devices
increases, MDI-LLM boosts token generation throughput and reduces memory
consumption per device.

TLDR: 论文研究了在边缘部署中压缩基础模型的方法，重点比较了两种再训练损失函数（交叉熵微调和KL散度自蒸馏）对压缩模型恢复的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索在资源受限的边缘环境中，如何通过不同的损失函数优化压缩模型的性能，而无需依赖标记数据。

Method: 采用简单的层级L2范数剪枝方法，仅针对MLP块，比较了交叉熵微调（L2PFT）和KL散度自蒸馏（L2PSD）两种再训练策略。

Result: 在相同的剪枝条件下，KL散度自蒸馏的表现与交叉熵微调相当或更好，表明损失函数的选择对压缩模型恢复有显著影响。

Conclusion: 结论指出，即使在基础的MLP剪枝下，损失函数的选择对资源受限环境中的模型恢复至关重要。

Abstract: Modern foundational models are often compressed via a combination of
structured pruning and re-training to meet the strict compute, memory, and
connectivity constraints of edge deployments. While state-of-the-art pruning
schemes target the entire Transformer, we adopt a simple, layer-wise L2-norm
pruning on only the MLP blocks as a fixed baseline. Our focus is not on
achieving maximal compression, but on isolating the impact of the re-training
loss function: (i) Fine-tuning with Cross- Entropy (L2PFT), which requires
labeled data, versus (ii) Self-Distillation with KL-divergence, which leverages
only teacher logits (no labels) (L2PSD). We evaluate both pipelines on the
OLMo2- 7B-SFT model for CommonsenseQA suitable for intermittent or denied
connectivity scenarios typical of edge networks. Under identical pruning
schedules, KL-based distillation matches or exceeds CE fine-tuning in test
accuracy, demonstrating that, even with a basic MLP-only pruning, the choice of
loss function materially affects compressed model recovery in
resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的面部情感注释数据成本高昂且稀缺，限制了VLLM在情感感知任务中的性能。

Method: 结合先验知识和VLLM推理，通过自验证策略和蒙特卡洛采样生成多粒度情感描述数据，构建了面部情感指令数据集（FEID）和基准（FEAB）。

Result: 在三个下游面部情感分析任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SEKE和SV-UAMC方法有效解决了高质量注释数据不足的问题，提升了VLLM的情感感知能力。

Abstract: Facial emotion perception in the vision large language model (VLLM) is
crucial for achieving natural human-machine interaction. However, creating
high-quality annotations for both coarse- and fine-grained facial emotion
analysis demands costly expertise. The lack of such high-quality instruction
data limits the performance of VLLMs in facial emotion perception. To address
this, we propose a self-verification approach with emotion knowledge
enhancement (SEKE), which generates high-quality instruction data for
multi-grained emotion analysis cost-effectively using closed-source VLLM. This
approach integrates prior human knowledge to VLLM inference, guided by the
inherent correlations between three grained levels of emotion descriptions,
i.e., discrete expression, valence-arousal, and action unit, to reliably
generate comprehensive annotations. A self-verification strategy with
Uncertainty-Aware Monte Carlo sampling (SV-UAMC) is further embedded to
efficiently extract more accurate VLLM predictions, further improving
annotation reliability. Consequently, we construct a facial emotion instruction
dataset (FEID) containing three comprehensive descriptions, which provides
coarse- and fine-grained emotional information for effective model training.
Additionally, we introduce a facial emotion analysis benchmark (FEAB) to
measure the VLLM's corresponding ability. Our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on three downstream facial emotion analysis tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架首次将多任务PINN引入可穿戴情绪识别，性能优越且模型透明，为未来医疗和人机交互应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting human emotional and physiological states using
wearable sensors has important applications in stress monitoring, mental health
assessment, and affective computing. This study presents a novel Multi-Task
Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) that performs Electrodermal Activity
(EDA) prediction and emotion classification simultaneously, using the publicly
available WESAD dataset. The model integrates psychological self-report
features (PANAS and SAM) with a physics-inspired differential equation
representing EDA dynamics, enforcing biophysically grounded constraints through
a custom loss function. This loss combines EDA regression, emotion
classification, and a physics residual term for improved interpretability.
  The architecture supports dual outputs for both tasks and is trained under a
unified multi-task framework. Evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, the
model achieves an average EDA RMSE of 0.0362, Pearson correlation of 0.9919,
and F1-score of 94.08 percent. These results outperform classical models such
as SVR and XGBoost, as well as ablated variants like emotion-only and EDA-only
models.
  In addition, the learned physical parameters including decay rate (alpha_0),
emotional sensitivity (beta), and time scaling (gamma) are interpretable and
stable across folds, aligning with known principles of human physiology. This
work is the first to introduce a multi-task PINN framework for wearable emotion
recognition, offering improved performance, generalizability, and model
transparency. The proposed system provides a foundation for future
interpretable and multimodal applications in healthcare and human-computer
interaction.

Furthermore, we propose certified robustness evaluation metrics for KGE methods

Conclusion: 同时校准多模型具有潜力，但需注意高维空间中的物理约束和不可识别性挑战。

Abstract: In an increasing number of applications designers have access to multiple
computer models which typically have different levels of fidelity and cost.
Traditionally, designers calibrate these models one at a time against some
high-fidelity data (e.g., experiments). In this paper, we question this
tradition and assess the potential of calibrating multiple computer models at
the same time. To this end, we develop a probabilistic framework that is
founded on customized neural networks (NNs) that are designed to calibrate an
arbitrary number of computer models. In our approach, we (1) consider the fact
that most computer models are multi-response and that the number and nature of
calibration parameters may change across the models, and (2) learn a unique
probability distribution for each calibration parameter of each computer model,
(3) develop a loss function that enables our NN to emulate all data sources
while calibrating the computer models, and (4) aim to learn a visualizable
latent space where model-form errors can be identified. We test the performance
of our approach on analytic and engineering problems to understand the
potential advantages and pitfalls in simultaneous calibration of multiple
computer models. Our method can improve predictive accuracy, however, it is
prone to non-identifiability issues in higher-dimensional input spaces that are
normally constrained by underlying physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域数据共享因隐私法规限制导致数据不足，现有联邦学习方法在异构图数据上表现不佳，需改进。

Method: FedGRec利用局部子图的协作信号和动态时空建模，结合个性化联邦聚合策略，优化用户和物品表示学习。

Result: 在三个数据集上，FedGRec优于单域和跨域基线方法，同时有效保护隐私。

Conclusion: FedGRec在跨域推荐中实现了高效协作学习与隐私保护的平衡。

Abstract: Due to the highly sensitive nature of certain data in cross-border sharing,
collaborative cross-border recommendations and data sharing are often subject
to stringent privacy protection regulations, resulting in insufficient data for
model training. Consequently, achieving efficient cross-border business
recommendations while ensuring privacy security poses a significant challenge.
Although federated learning has demonstrated broad potential in collaborative
training without exposing raw data, most existing federated learning-based GNN
training methods still rely on federated averaging strategies, which perform
suboptimally on highly heterogeneous graph data. To address this issue, we
propose FedGRec, a privacy-preserving federated graph learning method for
cross-border recommendations. FedGRec captures user preferences from
distributed multi-domain data to enhance recommendation performance across all
domains without privacy leakage. Specifically, FedGRec leverages collaborative
signals from local subgraphs associated with users or items to enrich their
representation learning. Additionally, it employs dynamic spatiotemporal
modeling to integrate global and local user preferences in real time based on
business recommendation states, thereby deriving the final representations of
target users and candidate items. By automatically filtering relevant
behaviors, FedGRec effectively mitigates noise interference from unreliable
neighbors. Furthermore, through a personalized federated aggregation strategy,
FedGRec adapts global preferences to heterogeneous domain data, enabling
collaborative learning of user preferences across multiple domains. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate that FedGRec consistently outperforms
competitive single-domain and cross-domain baselines while effectively
preserving data privacy in cross-border recommendations.

Motivation: 现有区域表示学习方法多关注共享信息，忽视了任务相关的独特信息，而多模态数据的分解可以解决这一问题。

Method: CooKIE采用成对跨视图学习，捕获高阶信息而无需建模高维依赖，减少了模型复杂度。

Result: 在纽约和德里的三个回归任务及土地利用分类任务中，CooKIE表现优于现有方法，且参数和计算量更少。

Conclusion: CooKIE有效捕获多模态信息，为区域表示学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing availability of geospatial datasets, researchers have
explored region representation learning (RRL) to analyze complex region
characteristics. Recent RRL methods use contrastive learning (CL) to capture
shared information between two modalities but often overlook task-relevant
unique information specific to each modality. Such modality-specific details
can explain region characteristics that shared information alone cannot
capture. Bringing information factorization to RRL can address this by
factorizing multimodal data into shared and unique information. However,
existing factorization approaches focus on two modalities, whereas RRL can
benefit from various geospatial data. Extending factorization beyond two
modalities is non-trivial because modeling high-order relationships introduces
a combinatorial number of learning objectives, increasing model complexity. We
introduce Cross modal Knowledge Injected Embedding, an information
factorization approach for RRL that captures both shared and unique
representations. CooKIE uses a pairwise inter-view learning approach that
captures high-order information without modeling high-order dependency,
avoiding exhaustive combinations. We evaluate CooKIE on three regression tasks
and a land use classification task in New York City and Delhi, India. Results
show that CooKIE outperforms existing RRL methods and a factorized RRL model,
capturing multimodal information with fewer training parameters and
floating-point operations per second (FLOPs). We release the code:

Abstract: We present the GAIA (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence for Atmospheres)
Foundation Model, a novel model that combines masked autoencoders (MAE) and
self-DIstillation with NO labels (DINO) for analyzing global atmospheric
patterns in satellite imagery. By integrating these complementary
self-supervised learning approaches, our model simultaneously captures both
local features and global dependencies. We address two critical challenges in
satellite data analysis: reconstructing missing regions and estimating
precipitation patterns as our first downstream tasks. The model demonstrates
superior temporal pattern capture compared to standard MAE approaches, while
maintaining robust performance in downstream tasks. Our experimental results
show strong gap-filling capabilities across varying mask ratios and accurate
precipitation estimation with limited training data, achieving a false alarm
ratio of 0.088 and structural similarity of 0.881. This work represents an
advancement in self-supervised learning for atmospheric science, providing a

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
particularly Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy, plays
a critical role in elucidating molecular structures, interactions, and
electronic properties. However, accurately interpreting 2D NMR data remains
labor-intensive and error-prone, requiring highly trained domain experts,
especially for complex molecules. Machine Learning (ML) holds significant
potential in 2D NMR analysis by learning molecular representations and
recognizing complex patterns from data. However, progress has been limited by
the lack of large-scale and high-quality annotated datasets. In this work, we
introduce 2DNMRGym, the first annotated experimental dataset designed for
ML-based molecular representation learning in 2D NMR. It includes over 22,000
HSQC spectra, along with the corresponding molecular graphs and SMILES strings.
Uniquely, 2DNMRGym adopts a surrogate supervision setup: models are trained
using algorithm-generated annotations derived from a previously validated
method and evaluated on a held-out set of human-annotated gold-standard labels.
This enables rigorous assessment of a model's ability to generalize from
imperfect supervision to expert-level interpretation. We provide benchmark
results using a series of 2D and 3D GNN and GNN transformer models,
establishing a strong foundation for future work. 2DNMRGym supports scalable
model training and introduces a chemically meaningful benchmark for evaluating
atom-level molecular representations in NMR-guided structural tasks. Our data
and code is open-source and available on Huggingface and Github.

Result: 在多个大规模fMRI和EEG数据集上，DiffeoCFM实现了快速训练和最优性能，同时保持流形约束。

Conclusion: DiffeoCFM提供了一种高效且性能优越的方法，适用于矩阵流形上的生成建模。

Abstract: Generating realistic brain connectivity matrices is key to analyzing
population heterogeneity in brain organization, understanding disease, and
augmenting data in challenging classification problems. Functional connectivity
matrices lie in constrained spaces--such as the set of symmetric positive
definite or correlation matrices--that can be modeled as Riemannian manifolds.
However, using Riemannian tools typically requires redefining core operations
(geodesics, norms, integration), making generative modeling computationally
inefficient. In this work, we propose DiffeoCFM, an approach that enables
conditional flow matching (CFM) on matrix manifolds by exploiting pullback
metrics induced by global diffeomorphisms on Euclidean spaces. We show that
Riemannian CFM with such metrics is equivalent to applying standard CFM after
data transformation. This equivalence allows efficient vector field learning,
and fast sampling with standard ODE solvers. We instantiate DiffeoCFM with two
different settings: the matrix logarithm for covariance matrices and the
normalized Cholesky decomposition for correlation matrices. We evaluate
DiffeoCFM on three large-scale fMRI datasets with more than 4600 scans from
2800 subjects (ADNI, ABIDE, OASIS-3) and two EEG motor imagery datasets with
over 30000 trials from 26 subjects (BNCI2014-002 and BNCI2015-001). It enables
fast training and achieves state-of-the-art performance, all while preserving
manifold constraints.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于图的方法，通过构建证据图和声明图来检测多模态上下文外（OOC）虚假信息，利用GNN比较两者一致性，准确率达93.05%，优于现有LLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法（如LLM和LVLM）缺乏上下文解析步骤，容易产生幻觉，无法有效检测多模态OOC虚假信息。

Method: 构建证据图和声明图，使用GNN编码并比较两者一致性，评估图像-标题对的真实性。

Result: 方法在评估集上达到93.05%的准确率，优于第二名LLM方法2.82%。

Conclusion: 较小且任务特定的方法在多模态虚假信息检测中表现更优。

Abstract: Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that
repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such
misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the
claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs
and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in
absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a
graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the
caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived
from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption.
Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations,
our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create
datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model
against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores
$93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the
second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller
and task-specific methods.

TLDR: 本文主张在大型生成模型中，token reduction不应仅作为效率策略，而应成为生成建模的基本原则，影响模型架构和应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，token reduction主要用于提高效率，但在大型生成模型中，其作用应超越效率，成为影响模型架构和应用的核心原则。

Method: 通过重新定义token reduction的作用，探讨其在多模态整合、减少幻觉、保持长输入连贯性和增强训练稳定性等方面的潜力。

Result: token reduction在多模态系统、语言和视觉领域具有广泛的应用潜力，可推动新模型架构和学习策略的发展。

Conclusion: token reduction应被视为生成建模的基本原则，未来研究方向包括算法设计、强化学习引导的token reduction等。

Abstract: In Transformer architectures, tokens\textemdash discrete units derived from
raw data\textemdash are formed by segmenting inputs into fixed-length chunks.
Each token is then mapped to an embedding, enabling parallel attention
computations while preserving the input's essential information. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity of transformer self-attention mechanisms,
token reduction has primarily been used as an efficiency strategy. This is
especially true in single vision and language domains, where it helps balance
computational costs, memory usage, and inference latency. Despite these
advances, this paper argues that token reduction should transcend its
traditional efficiency-oriented role in the era of large generative models.
Instead, we position it as a fundamental principle in generative modeling,
critically influencing both model architecture and broader applications.
Specifically, we contend that across vision, language, and multimodal systems,
token reduction can: (i) facilitate deeper multimodal integration and
alignment, (ii) mitigate "overthinking" and hallucinations, (iii) maintain
coherence over long inputs, and (iv) enhance training stability, etc. We
reframe token reduction as more than an efficiency measure. By doing so, we
outline promising future directions, including algorithm design, reinforcement
learning-guided token reduction, token optimization for in-context learning,
and broader ML and scientific domains. We highlight its potential to drive new
model architectures and learning strategies that improve robustness, increase
interpretability, and better align with the objectives of generative modeling.

Result: EBM推导的度量在高维场景中优于基线方法，测地线更贴近数据流形且曲率失真更低。

Conclusion: 首次从EBM中推导黎曼度量，为生成建模和模拟提供了可扩展的几何驱动学习方法。

Abstract: What is the shortest path between two data points lying in a high-dimensional
space? While the answer is trivial in Euclidean geometry, it becomes
significantly more complex when the data lies on a curved manifold -- requiring
a Riemannian metric to describe the space's local curvature. Estimating such a
metric, however, remains a major challenge in high dimensions.
  In this work, we propose a method for deriving Riemannian metrics directly
from pretrained Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- a class of generative models that
assign low energy to high-density regions. These metrics define spatially
varying distances, enabling the computation of geodesics -- shortest paths that
follow the data manifold's intrinsic geometry. We introduce two novel metrics
derived from EBMs and show that they produce geodesics that remain closer to
the data manifold and exhibit lower curvature distortion, as measured by
alignment with ground-truth trajectories. We evaluate our approach on
increasingly complex datasets: synthetic datasets with known data density,
rotated character images with interpretable geometry, and high-resolution
natural images embedded in a pretrained VAE latent space.
  Our results show that EBM-derived metrics consistently outperform established
baselines, especially in high-dimensional settings. Our work is the first to
derive Riemannian metrics from EBMs, enabling data-aware geodesics and
unlocking scalable, geometry-driven learning for generative modeling and
simulation.

TLDR: NSNQuant是一种无需校准的向量量化技术，用于压缩KV缓存，通过三步变换和对齐标准正态分布，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量量化方法依赖校准数据集，易受分布偏移影响，因此需要一种更鲁棒的量化技术。

Method: 采用三步变换（归一化、平移、再归一化）和Hadamard变换，将令牌分布对齐标准正态分布。

Result: NSNQuant在1位和2位设置中优于现有方法，吞吐量提升高达3倍。

Conclusion: NSNQuant提供了一种高效、无需校准的KV缓存压缩方案，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is typically memory-intensive,
especially when processing large batch sizes and long sequences, due to the
large size of key-value (KV) cache. Vector Quantization (VQ) is recently
adopted to alleviate this issue, but we find that the existing approach is
susceptible to distribution shift due to its reliance on calibration datasets.
To address this limitation, we introduce NSNQuant, a calibration-free Vector
Quantization (VQ) technique designed for low-bit compression of the KV cache.
By applying a three-step transformation-1) a token-wise normalization
(Normalize), 2) a channel-wise centering (Shift), and 3) a second token-wise
normalization (Normalize)-with Hadamard transform, NSNQuant effectively aligns
the token distribution with the standard normal distribution. This alignment
enables robust, calibration-free vector quantization using a single reusable
codebook. Extensive experiments show that NSNQuant consistently outperforms
prior methods in both 1-bit and 2-bit settings, offering strong generalization
and up to 3$\times$ throughput gain over full-precision baselines.

TLDR: ELDeR提出了一种新的正则化后剪枝范式，通过数据驱动的层间剪枝方法减少信息损失，显著降低恢复微调成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的高计算和内存成本限制了其应用，现有剪枝方法因静态移除参数导致性能下降，需昂贵的恢复微调。

Method: ELDeR首先对每层Transformer输出乘以初始权重，通过少量数据迭代学习权重，再对权重较小的层施加正则化，迫使信息转移到剩余层。

Result: 实验表明，ELDeR优于现有层间结构化剪枝方法，显著减少恢复微调成本，同时保持语言建模能力。

Conclusion: ELDeR是一种高效的层间剪枝技术，具有明显的端到端加速效果，适用于高效LLMs。

Abstract: The deployment of Large language models (LLMs) in many fields is largely
hindered by their high computational and memory costs. Recent studies suggest
that LLMs exhibit sparsity, which can be used for pruning. Previous pruning
methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned parts
still contain valuable information, statically removing them without updating
the remaining parameters often results in irreversible performance degradation,
requiring costly recovery fine-tuning (RFT) to maintain performance. To address
this, we propose a novel paradigm: first apply regularization, then prune.
Based on this paradigm, we propose ELDeR: Getting Efficient LLMs through
Data-Driven Regularized Layer-wise Pruning. We multiply the output of each
transformer layer by an initial weight, then we iteratively learn the weights
of each transformer layer by using a small amount of data in a simple way.
After that, we apply regularization to the difference between the output and
input of the layers with smaller weights, forcing the information to be
transferred to the remaining layers. Compared with direct pruning, ELDeR
reduces the information loss caused by direct parameter removal, thus better
preserving the model's language modeling ability. Experimental results show
that ELDeR achieves superior performance compared with powerful layer-wise
structured pruning methods, while greatly reducing RFT computational costs.
Since ELDeR is a layer-wise pruning method, its end-to-end acceleration effect
is obvious, making it a promising technique for efficient LLMs.

capturing diverse linguistic and structural cues. This work demonstrates the
effectiveness of multi-signal learning in robust and region-aware phishing.

Result: 结果表明，余弦相似性可能编码了特征的内在几何结构，验证了表示空间与概念空间的潜在联系。

Conclusion: 结论是特征可以建模为流形，为神经网络表示的理解提供了更丰富的框架。

Abstract: There is a large ongoing scientific effort in mechanistic interpretability to
map embeddings and internal representations of AI systems into
human-understandable concepts. A key element of this effort is the linear
representation hypothesis, which posits that neural representations are sparse
linear combinations of `almost-orthogonal' direction vectors, reflecting the
presence or absence of different features. This model underpins the use of
sparse autoencoders to recover features from representations. Moving towards a
fuller model of features, in which neural representations could encode not just
the presence but also a potentially continuous and multidimensional value for a
feature, has been a subject of intense recent discourse. We describe why and
how a feature might be represented as a manifold, demonstrating in particular
that cosine similarity in representation space may encode the intrinsic
geometry of a feature through shortest, on-manifold paths, potentially
answering the question of how distance in representation space and relatedness
in concept space could be connected. The critical assumptions and predictions
of the theory are validated on text embeddings and token activations of large
language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 每小时的需求曲线包含对长期基础设施设计和日常运营至关重要的信息，影响网络压力、水质、能耗和整体可靠性。

Method: 通过将每日需求曲线分解为基线部分和不同的峰值部分，SGD方法用可解释的参数（如峰值幅度、时间、持续时间和偏态）表征每个峰值，从而重建观测模式并揭示潜在的用水动态。

Result: SGD在多个真实数据集上表现优于对称高斯模型，平均减少均方根误差50%以上，同时保持物理可解释性。

Conclusion: SGD方法不仅能提高合成模式生成的准确性，还能增强异常和泄漏检测能力，为需求管理提供战略分析工具。

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for decomposing urban water demand
patterns using Skewed Gaussian Distributions (SGD) to derive behavioral
insights and support operational planning. Hourly demand profiles contain
critical information for both long-term infrastructure design and daily
operations, influencing network pressures, water quality, energy consumption,
and overall reliability. By breaking down each daily demand curve into a
baseline component and distinct peak components, the proposed SGD method
characterizes each peak with interpretable parameters, including peak
amplitude, timing (mean), spread (duration), and skewness (asymmetry), thereby
reconstructing the observed pattern and uncovering latent usage dynamics. This
detailed peak-level decomposition enables both operational applications, e.g.
anomaly and leakage detection, real-time demand management, and strategic
analyses, e.g. identifying behavioral shifts, seasonal influences, or policy
impacts on consumption patterns. Unlike traditional symmetric Gaussian or
purely statistical time-series models, SGDs explicitly capture asymmetric peak
shapes such as sharp morning surges followed by gradual declines, improving the
fidelity of synthetic pattern generation and enhancing the detection of
irregular consumption behavior. The method is demonstrated on several
real-world datasets, showing that SGD outperforms symmetric Gaussian models in
reconstruction accuracy, reducing root-mean-square error by over 50% on
average, while maintaining physical interpretability. The SGD framework can
also be used to construct synthetic demand scenarios by designing daily peak
profiles with chosen characteristics. All implementation code is publicly

Conclusion: 该研究首次为多层网络解决模块化加法提供了理论支持的解释，推动了可推广的可解释性，并提出了超越模块化加法的普适性假设。

Abstract: We propose a testable universality hypothesis, asserting that seemingly
disparate neural network solutions observed in the simple task of modular
addition are unified under a common abstract algorithm. While prior work
interpreted variations in neuron-level representations as evidence for distinct
algorithms, we demonstrate - through multi-level analyses spanning neurons,
neuron clusters, and entire networks - that multilayer perceptrons and
transformers universally implement the abstract algorithm we call the
approximate Chinese Remainder Theorem. Crucially, we introduce approximate
cosets and show that neurons activate exclusively on them. Furthermore, our
theory works for deep neural networks (DNNs). It predicts that universally
learned solutions in DNNs with trainable embeddings or more than one hidden
layer require only O(log n) features, a result we empirically confirm. This
work thus provides the first theory-backed interpretation of multilayer
networks solving modular addition. It advances generalizable interpretability
and opens a testable universality hypothesis for group multiplication beyond
modular addition.

Conclusion: R2D2-Net能有效收缩无关系数并防止重要特征过度收缩，理论分析和实验结果均验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) treat neural network weights as random
variables, which aim to provide posterior uncertainty estimates and avoid
overfitting by performing inference on the posterior weights. However, the
selection of appropriate prior distributions remains a challenging task, and
BNNs may suffer from catastrophic inflated variance or poor predictive
performance when poor choices are made for the priors. Existing BNN designs
apply different priors to weights, while the behaviours of these priors make it
difficult to sufficiently shrink noisy signals or they are prone to
overshrinking important signals in the weights. To alleviate this problem, we
propose a novel R2D2-Net, which imposes the R^2-induced Dirichlet Decomposition
(R2D2) prior to the BNN weights. The R2D2-Net can effectively shrink irrelevant
coefficients towards zero, while preventing key features from over-shrinkage.
To approximate the posterior distribution of weights more accurately, we
further propose a variational Gibbs inference algorithm that combines the Gibbs
updating procedure and gradient-based optimization. This strategy enhances
stability and consistency in estimation when the variational objective
involving the shrinkage parameters is non-convex. We also analyze the evidence
lower bound (ELBO) and the posterior concentration rates from a theoretical
perspective. Experiments on both natural and medical image classification and
uncertainty estimation tasks demonstrate satisfactory performance of our
method.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in wind speed forecasting is a critical
challenge in wind power production due to the inherently volatile nature of

probabilistic forecasting methods by using the Tube loss function for wind
speed forecasting. The Tube loss function is a simple and model agnostic
Prediction Interval (PI) estimation approach and can obtain the narrow PI with
asymptotical coverage guarantees without any distribution assumption. Our deep
probabilistic forecasting models effectively incorporate popular architectures
such as LSTM, GRU, and TCN within the Tube loss framework. We further design a
simple yet effective heuristic for tuning the $\delta$ parameter of the Tube
loss function so that our deep forecasting models obtain the narrower PI
without compromising its calibration ability. We have considered three wind
datasets, containing the hourly recording of the wind speed, collected from
three distinct location namely Jaisalmer, Los Angeles and San Fransico. Our
numerical results demonstrate that the proposed deep forecasting models produce
more reliable and narrower PIs compared to recently developed probabilistic
wind forecasting methods.

Motivation: 结合GNNs的强表现力和凸优化的易处理性，以提升图预测任务的性能和理论分析能力。

Method: 将GNNs的非线性滤波器映射到再生核希尔伯特空间，利用凸优化和投影梯度方法进行训练，并采用分层训练策略扩展至深层架构。

Conclusion: CGNNs是一种强大且理论严谨的方法，兼具高性能、鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become prominent methods for graph
representation learning, demonstrating strong empirical results on diverse
graph prediction tasks. In this paper, we introduce Convexified Message Passing
Graph Neural Networks (CGNNs), a novel and general framework that combines the
power of message-passing GNNs with the tractability of convex optimization. By
mapping their nonlinear filters into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, CGNNs
transform training into a convex optimization problem, which can be solved
efficiently and optimally by projected gradient methods. This convexity further
allows the statistical properties of CGNNs to be analyzed accurately and
rigorously. For two-layer CGNNs, we establish rigorous generalization
guarantees, showing convergence to the performance of the optimal GNN. To scale
to deeper architectures, we adopt a principled layer-wise training strategy.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CGNNs significantly exceed the
performance of leading GNN models, achieving 10 to 40 percent higher accuracy
in most cases, underscoring their promise as a powerful and principled method
with strong theoretical foundations. In rare cases where improvements are not
quantitatively substantial, the convex models either slightly exceed or match
the baselines, stressing their robustness and wide applicability. Though
over-parameterization is often employed to enhance performance in nonconvex
models, we show that our CGNNs framework yields shallow convex models that can
surpass these models in both accuracy and resource efficiency.

*Jie Hu,Yi-Ting Ma,Do Young Eun*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出了一种基于历史驱动目标（HDT）的MCMC框架，用于改进离散状态空间上的随机游走算法，实现高效采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如自排斥随机游走（SRRW）虽能减少方差，但计算开销大且依赖时间可逆马尔可夫链，限制了其应用。

Method: HDT通过引入历史依赖的目标分布替代原始目标分布，仅需局部信息，兼容可逆和非可逆MCMC采样器。

Result: 实验证明HDT在保持无偏采样和低方差的同时，显著提升了性能，并适用于大规模图。

Conclusion: HDT框架克服了SRRW的局限性，实现了高效、轻量且兼容性强的采样方法。

Abstract: We propose a history-driven target (HDT) framework in Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) to improve any random walk algorithm on discrete state spaces,
such as general undirected graphs, for efficient sampling from target
distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. With broad applications in network science and
distributed optimization, recent innovations like the self-repellent random
walk (SRRW) achieve near-zero variance by prioritizing under-sampled states
through transition kernel modifications based on past visit frequencies.
However, SRRW's reliance on explicit computation of transition probabilities
for all neighbors at each step introduces substantial computational overhead,
while its strict dependence on time-reversible Markov chains excludes advanced
non-reversible MCMC methods. To overcome these limitations, instead of direct
modification of transition kernel, HDT introduces a history-dependent target
distribution $\boldsymbol{\pi}[\mathbf{x}]$ to replace the original target
$\boldsymbol{\mu}$ in any graph sampler, where $\mathbf{x}$ represents the
empirical measure of past visits. This design preserves lightweight
implementation by requiring only local information between the current and
proposed states and achieves compatibility with both reversible and
non-reversible MCMC samplers, while retaining unbiased samples with target
distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and near-zero variance performance. Extensive
experiments in graph sampling demonstrate consistent performance gains, and a
memory-efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache ensures scalability to large
general graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加速器内存和网络限制成为训练大型语言模型的主要瓶颈，现有低秩梯度估计器存在偏差、高方差或优化器状态不对齐的问题。

Method: PLUMAGE通过概率低秩无偏最小方差梯度估计，无需额外超参数，并解决优化器状态不对齐问题。

Result: 实验表明，PLUMAGE将全秩优化的预训练评估损失差距平均缩小33%，并在GLUE基准上将训练损失平均降低28%。

Conclusion: PLUMAGE是一种高效且稳定的低秩梯度估计器，适用于资源受限的LLM训练。

Abstract: Accelerator memory and networking constraints have emerged as dominant
bottlenecks when training large language models LLMs with billions of
parameters. Existing low rank gradient estimators such as GaLoRE and FLORA
compress gradients and optimizer tensors by projecting weight gradients onto a
rank r subspace, enabling LLM training on consumer hardware. Yet, these methods
are either biased or subject to high estimator variance. Moreover, the
optimizer state based on the first and second moments estimates expressed in
the previous subspace becomes misaligned whenever the projection is updated,
leading to instabilities during training. We propose PLUMAGE: Probabilistic Low
rank Unbiased Minimum vAriance Gradient Estimator. PLUMAGE is a drop in
replacement for existing low rank gradient estimators. It does not introduce
new hyperparameters beyond the chosen rank r and the update interval. In
addition, we resolve optimizer state misalignment issues to prevent spurious
weight updates and enhance training stability. We empirically demonstrate that
PLUMAGE shrinks the full rank optimization's gap over the pre training
evaluation loss by 33% on average across models and the average training loss
across the GLUE benchmark by 28% within a similar computational and memory
footprint as GaloRE.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across
vision, language, and scientific domains. Despite their empirical success,
prior theoretical analyses of the sample complexity suffer from poor scaling
with input data dimension or rely on unrealistic assumptions such as access to
exact empirical risk minimizers. In this work, we provide a principled analysis
of score estimation, establishing a sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Our approach leverages a structured
decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation,
and optimization errors, enabling us to eliminate the exponential dependence on
neural network parameters that arises in prior analyses. It is the first such
result which achieves sample complexity bounds without assuming access to the
empirical risk minimizer of score function estimation loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习中，权重函数$w$的计算依赖于未知的行为策略，导致扩散模型得分计算困难。

Method: 提出了一种同时扩散动作和权重的方法，直接从扩散模型中获取所需得分，无需额外网络学习。

Result: SWG在玩具示例中生成目标分布样本，并在D4RL挑战环境中与最先进方法表现相当。

Conclusion: SWG通过简化训练流程和验证权重公式的可扩展性，为离线强化学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recovers the optimal policy $\pi$ given
historical observations of an agent. In practice, $\pi$ is modeled as a
weighted version of the agent's behavior policy $\mu$, using a weight function
$w$ working as a critic of the agent's behavior. Though recent approaches to
offline RL based on diffusion models have exhibited promising results, the
computation of the required scores is challenging due to their dependence on
the unknown $w$. In this work, we alleviate this issue by constructing a
diffusion over both the actions and the weights. With the proposed setting, the
required scores are directly obtained from the diffusion model without learning
extra networks. Our main conceptual contribution is a novel guidance method,
where guidance (which is a function of $w$) comes from the same diffusion
model, therefore, our proposal is termed Self-Weighted Guidance (SWG). We show
that SWG generates samples from the desired distribution on toy examples and
performs on par with state-of-the-art methods on D4RL's challenging
environments, while maintaining a streamlined training pipeline. We further
validate SWG through ablation studies on weight formulations and scalability.

Result: 在AgarCL的主要挑战性任务及子任务中，DQN、PPO和SAC的表现被评估，揭示了不同游戏特性带来的挑战。

Conclusion: AgarCL为持续RL研究提供了丰富的实验环境，有助于深入理解复杂动态下的学习问题。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (RL) concerns agents that are expected to
learn continually, rather than converge to a policy that is then fixed for
evaluation. Such an approach is well suited to environments the agent perceives
as changing, which renders any static policy ineffective over time. The few
simulators explicitly designed for empirical research in continual RL are often
limited in scope or complexity, and it is now common for researchers to modify
episodic RL environments by artificially incorporating abrupt task changes
during interaction. In this paper, we introduce AgarCL, a research platform for
continual RL that allows for a progression of increasingly sophisticated
behaviour. AgarCL is based on the game Agar.io, a non-episodic,
high-dimensional problem featuring stochastic, ever-evolving dynamics,
continuous actions, and partial observability. Additionally, we provide
benchmark results reporting the performance of DQN, PPO, and SAC in both the
primary, challenging continual RL problem, and across a suite of smaller tasks
within AgarCL, each of which isolates aspects of the full environment and allow
us to characterize the challenges posed by different aspects of the game.

Motivation: 研究如何在资源受限环境中为特定任务优化LLM参数规模。

Method: 学习任务感知联合投影并使用遗传算法为每个矩阵定制剪枝级别。

Result: 参数减少20-75%，准确率仅降1-5%，且兼容LoRA和量化。

Conclusion: LLM-Sieve为生成小型高性能任务特定模型提供了实用机制。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted for narrow
tasks - such as medical question answering or sentiment analysis - and deployed
in resource-constrained settings, a key question arises: how many parameters
does a task actually need? In this work, we present LLM-Sieve, the first
comprehensive framework for task-specific pruning of LLMs that achieves 20-75%
parameter reduction with only 1-5% accuracy degradation across diverse domains.
Unlike prior methods that apply uniform pruning or rely on low-rank
approximations of weight matrices or inputs in isolation, LLM-Sieve (i) learns
task-aware joint projections to better approximate output behavior, and (ii)
employs a Genetic Algorithm to discover differentiated pruning levels for each
matrix. LLM-Sieve is fully compatible with LoRA fine-tuning and quantization,
and uniquely demonstrates strong generalization across datasets within the same
task domain. Together, these results establish a practical and robust mechanism
to generate smaller performant task-specific models.

Conclusion: 该研究为甲烷排放建模提供了新工具和方法，推动了更准确、可扩展的气候模型发展。

Abstract: Methane (CH$_4$) is the second most powerful greenhouse gas after carbon
dioxide and plays a crucial role in climate change due to its high global
warming potential. Accurately modeling CH$_4$ fluxes across the globe and at
fine temporal scales is essential for understanding its spatial and temporal
variability and developing effective mitigation strategies. In this work, we
introduce the first-of-its-kind cross-scale global wetland methane benchmark
dataset (X-MethaneWet), which synthesizes physics-based model simulation data
from TEM-MDM and the real-world observation data from FLUXNET-CH$_4$. This
dataset can offer opportunities for improving global wetland CH$_4$ modeling
and science discovery with new AI algorithms. To set up AI model baselines for
methane flux prediction, we evaluate the performance of various sequential deep
learning models on X-MethaneWet. Furthermore, we explore four different
transfer learning techniques to leverage simulated data from TEM-MDM to improve
the generalization of deep learning models on real-world FLUXNET-CH$_4$
observations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these
approaches, highlighting their potential for advancing methane emission
modeling and contributing to the development of more accurate and scalable
AI-driven climate models.

Motivation: 理解任务难度如何影响模型学习特定任务所需的最小参数规模。

Method: 使用ListOps数据集，逐步增加任务难度，观察不同操作（如SUM、MAX、MED）的学习效果及参数需求。

Result: SUM单独学习最难，但联合训练可降低难度；联合训练模型表现出更优的数值表示和注意力机制使用。

Conclusion: 模型能力不仅取决于规模，还与训练课程设计密切相关。

Abstract: The ability of a model to learn a task depends strongly on both the task
difficulty and the model size. We aim to understand how task difficulty relates
to the minimum number of parameters required for learning specific tasks in
small transformer models. Our study focuses on the ListOps dataset, which
consists of nested mathematical operations. We gradually increase task
difficulty by introducing new operations or combinations of operations into the
training data. We observe that sum modulo n is the hardest to learn. Curiously,
when combined with other operations such as maximum and median, the sum
operation becomes easier to learn and requires fewer parameters. We show that
joint training not only improves performance but also leads to qualitatively
different model behavior. We show evidence that models trained only on SUM
might be memorizing and fail to capture the number structure in the embeddings.
In contrast, models trained on a mixture of SUM and other operations exhibit
number-like representations in the embedding space, and a strong ability to
distinguish parity. Furthermore, the SUM-only model relies more heavily on its
feedforward layers, while the jointly trained model activates the attention
mechanism more. Finally, we show that learning pure SUM can be induced in
models below the learning threshold of pure SUM, by pretraining them on
MAX+MED. Our findings indicate that emergent abilities in language models
depend not only on model size, but also the training curriculum.

Conclusion: ICL是预训练的自然结果，其性能与预训练任务集相关，揭示了架构和模态无关的基本原理。

Abstract: We argue that in-context learning (ICL) predictably arises from standard
self-supervised next-token pretraining, rather than being an exotic emergent
property. This work establishes the foundational principles of this emergence
by focusing on in-distribution ICL, demonstrating how models necessarily adapt
to context when trained on token sequences, especially from non-ergodic
sources. Our information-theoretic framework precisely predicts these
in-distribution ICL dynamics (i.e., context-dependent loss reduction). We
verify this with experiments using synthetic datasets of differing types of
correlational structure, reproducing characteristic phenomena like phase
transitions in training loss for induction head formation and power-law scaling
of in-context loss. We further show that a model's in-context performance on
any task is mathematically coupled to the ensemble of tasks seen in
pretraining, offering a fundamental explanation, grounded in architecture- and
modality-independent principles, for such inference-time learning.

Abstract: De novo 3D molecule generation is a pivotal task in drug discovery. However,
many recent geometric generative models struggle to produce high-quality 3D

tackle this issue and enhance the learning of effective molecular generation

continuous and discrete denoising co-design objective. We assess Megalodon's

Megalodon achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D molecule generation,
conditional structure generation, and structure energy benchmarks using
diffusion and flow matching. Furthermore, doubling the number of parameters in
Megalodon to 40M significantly enhances its performance, generating up to 49x
more valid large molecules and achieving energy levels that are 2-10x lower
than those of the best prior generative models.

Conclusion: thought calibration 是一种有效的方法，能在减少计算成本的同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models achieve impressive test-time scaling by
thinking for longer, but this performance gain comes at significant compute
cost. Directly limiting test-time budget hurts overall performance, but not all
problems are equally difficult. We propose thought calibration to decide
dynamically when thinking can be terminated. To calibrate our decision rule, we
view a language model's growing body of thoughts as a nested sequence of
reasoning trees, where the goal is to identify the point at which novel
reasoning plateaus. We realize this framework through lightweight probes that
operate on top of the language model's hidden representations, which are
informative of both the reasoning structure and overall consistency of
response. Based on three reasoning language models and four datasets, thought
calibration preserves model performance with up to a 60% reduction in thinking
tokens on in-distribution data, and up to 20% in out-of-distribution data.

Result: 正则化使策略采样的动作具有差分隐私性，无需额外噪声。

Conclusion: KL正则化提供了一种新的隐私保护途径，同时保持性能优势。

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework for privacy, ensuring
the outputs of data-driven algorithms remain statistically indistinguishable
across datasets that differ in a single entry. While guaranteeing DP generally
requires explicitly injecting noise either to the algorithm itself or to its
outputs, the intrinsic randomness of existing algorithms presents an
opportunity to achieve DP ``for free''. In this work, we explore the role of
regularization in achieving DP across three different decision-making problems:
multi-armed bandits, linear contextual bandits, and reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF), in offline data settings. We show that adding
KL-regularization to the learning objective (a common approach in optimization
algorithms) makes the action sampled from the resulting stochastic policy
itself differentially private. This offers a new route to privacy guarantees
without additional noise injection, while also preserving the inherent
advantage of regularization in enhancing performance.

tensor decomposition to a global attention-aware joint tensor de-composition.
Our framework can significantly improve the model accuracy over the existing
model compression methods when reducing the latent dimension to realize
computationally/memory-efficient LLMs/LLMs. We show the benefit on several
benchmark including multi-modal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Euclidean Distance Matrix (EDM), which consists of pairwise squared Euclidean
distances of a given point configuration, finds many applications in modern
machine learning. This paper considers the setting where only a set of anchor
nodes is used to collect the distances between themselves and the rest. In the
presence of potential outliers, it results in a structured partial observation
on EDM with partial corruptions. Note that an EDM can be connected to a
positive semi-definite Gram matrix via a non-orthogonal dual basis. Inspired by
recent development of non-orthogonal dual basis in optimization, we propose a
novel algorithmic framework, dubbed Robust Euclidean Distance Geometry via Dual
Basis (RoDEoDB), for recovering the Euclidean distance geometry, i.e., the
underlying point configuration. The exact recovery guarantees have been
established in terms of both the Gram matrix and point configuration, under
some mild conditions. Empirical experiments show superior performance of
RoDEoDB on sensor localization and molecular conformation datasets.

Abstract: Aplastic anemia is a rare, life-threatening hematologic disorder
characterized by pancytopenia and bone marrow failure. ICU admission in these
patients often signals critical complications or disease progression, making
early risk assessment crucial for clinical decision-making and resource
allocation. In this study, we used the MIMIC-IV database to identify ICU
patients diagnosed with aplastic anemia and extracted clinical features from
five domains: demographics, synthetic indicators, laboratory results,
comorbidities, and medications. Over 400 variables were reduced to seven key
predictors through machine learning-based feature selection. Logistic
regression and Cox regression models were constructed to predict 7-, 14-, and
28-day mortality, and their performance was evaluated using AUROC. External
validation was conducted using the eICU Collaborative Research Database to
assess model generalizability. Among 1,662 included patients, the logistic
regression model demonstrated superior performance, with AUROC values of
0.8227, 0.8311, and 0.8298 for 7-, 14-, and 28-day mortality, respectively,
compared to the Cox model. External validation yielded AUROCs of 0.7391,
0.7119, and 0.7093. Interactive nomograms were developed based on the logistic
regression model to visually estimate individual patient risk. In conclusion,
we identified a concise set of seven predictors, led by APS III, to build
validated and generalizable nomograms that accurately estimate short-term
mortality in ICU patients with aplastic anemia. These tools may aid clinicians
in personalized risk stratification and decision-making at the point of care.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods for decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) facilitate collaborative optimal decision making without centralized
coordination, thus enabling a wide range of applications in practice. To date,
however, most theoretical convergence studies for existing actor-critic
decentralized MARL methods are limited to the guarantee of a stationary
solution under the linear function approximation. This leaves a significant gap
between the highly successful use of deep neural actor-critic for decentralized
MARL in practice and the current theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap,
in this paper, we make the first attempt to develop a deep neural actor-critic
method for decentralized MARL, where both the actor and critic components are
inherently non-linear. We show that our proposed method enjoys a global
optimality guarantee with a finite-time convergence rate of O(1/T), where T is
the total iteration times. This marks the first global convergence result for
deep neural actor-critic methods in the MARL literature. We also conduct
extensive numerical experiments, which verify our theoretical results.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为DB-KSVD的可扩展字典学习算法，用于解决高维Transformer嵌入的解耦问题，并在Gemma-2-2B模型上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在字典学习问题中的局限性，并提出一种更高效的算法。

Method: 提出Double-Batch KSVD（DB-KSVD），一种基于经典KSVD算法的可扩展字典学习算法。

Result: 在SAEBench基准测试中，DB-KSVD表现与SAEs相当，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SAEs在字典学习问题中表现良好，而传统优化方法如DB-KSVD也能扩展到大规模问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Dictionary learning has recently emerged as a promising approach for
mechanistic interpretability of large transformer models. Disentangling
high-dimensional transformer embeddings, however, requires algorithms that
scale to high-dimensional data with large sample sizes. Recent work has
explored sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for this problem. However, SAEs use a
simple linear encoder to solve the sparse encoding subproblem, which is known
to be NP-hard. It is therefore interesting to understand whether this structure
is sufficient to find good solutions to the dictionary learning problem or if a
more sophisticated algorithm could find better solutions. In this work, we
propose Double-Batch KSVD (DB-KSVD), a scalable dictionary learning algorithm
that adapts the classic KSVD algorithm. DB-KSVD is informed by the rich
theoretical foundations of KSVD but scales to datasets with millions of samples
and thousands of dimensions. We demonstrate the efficacy of DB-KSVD by
disentangling embeddings of the Gemma-2-2B model and evaluating on six metrics
from the SAEBench benchmark, where we achieve competitive results when compared
to established approaches based on SAEs. By matching SAE performance with an
entirely different optimization approach, our results suggest that (i) SAEs do
find strong solutions to the dictionary learning problem and (ii) that
traditional optimization approaches can be scaled to the required problem
sizes, offering a promising avenue for further research. We provide an
implementation of DB-KSVD at https://github.com/RomeoV/KSVD.jl.

Motivation: 现有模型在不同测试样本上表现不一，需探索如何自适应结合各模型优势。

Method: 利用元特征表征时间序列，训练可学习的融合器预测最优模型融合权重。

Result: 在长短预测任务中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: TimeFuse通过自适应融合实现通用性能提升。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting plays a critical role in many real-world
applications. Although increasingly powerful models have been developed and
achieved superior results on benchmark datasets, through a fine-grained
sample-level inspection, we find that (i) no single model consistently
outperforms others across different test samples, but instead (ii) each model
excels in specific cases. These findings prompt us to explore how to adaptively
leverage the distinct strengths of various forecasting models for different
samples. We introduce TimeFuse, a framework for collective time-series
forecasting with sample-level adaptive fusion of heterogeneous models. TimeFuse
utilizes meta-features to characterize input time series and trains a learnable
fusor to predict optimal model fusion weights for any given input. The fusor
can leverage samples from diverse datasets for joint training, allowing it to
adapt to a wide variety of temporal patterns and thus generalize to new inputs,
even from unseen datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of TimeFuse in various long-/short-term forecasting tasks, achieving
near-universal improvement over the state-of-the-art individual models. Code is

Method: 构建并优化目标域性能的保守估计，提供性能下限和避免负迁移的单调改进。

Result: 开发了两种保守估计方法，并设计了高效分布式算法，具有收敛保证。

Conclusion: 该框架为迁移强化学习提供了理论可靠且实践稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Transfer reinforcement learning aims to derive a near-optimal policy for a
target environment with limited data by leveraging abundant data from related
source domains. However, it faces two key challenges: the lack of performance
guarantees for the transferred policy, which can lead to undesired actions, and
the risk of negative transfer when multiple source domains are involved. We
propose a novel framework based on the pessimism principle, which constructs
and optimizes a conservative estimation of the target domain's performance. Our
framework effectively addresses the two challenges by providing an optimized
lower bound on target performance, ensuring safe and reliable decisions, and by
exhibiting monotonic improvement with respect to the quality of the source
domains, thereby avoiding negative transfer. We construct two types of
conservative estimations, rigorously characterize their effectiveness, and
develop efficient distributed algorithms with convergence guarantees. Our
framework provides a theoretically sound and practically robust solution for
transfer learning in reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: μ-MoE是一种高效且自适应的压缩方法，适用于未知下游任务。

Abstract: To tackle the huge computational demand of large foundation models,
activation-aware compression techniques without retraining have been
introduced. However, since these rely on calibration data, domain shift may
arise for unknown downstream tasks. With a computationally efficient
calibration, activation-aware pruning can be executed for every prompt
adaptively, yet achieving reduced complexity at inference. We formulate it as a
mixture of micro-experts, called $\mu$-MoE. Several experiments demonstrate
that $\mu$-MoE can dynamically adapt to task/prompt-dependent structured
sparsity on the fly.

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated success in geospatial applications,
yet quantifying the role of geolocation information in enhancing model
performance and geographic generalizability remains underexplored. A new
generation of location encoders have emerged with the goal of capturing
attributes present at any given location for downstream use in predictive
modeling. Being a nascent area of research, their evaluation has remained
largely limited to static tasks such as species distributions or average
temperature mapping. In this paper, we discuss and quantify the impact of
incorporating geolocation into deep learning for a real-world application
domain that is characteristically dynamic (with fast temporal change) and
spatially heterogeneous at high resolutions: estimating surface-level daily
PM2.5 levels using remotely sensed and ground-level data. We build on a
recently published deep learning-based PM2.5 estimation model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on data observed in the contiguous United States.
We examine three approaches for incorporating geolocation: excluding
geolocation as a baseline, using raw geographic coordinates, and leveraging
pretrained location encoders. We evaluate each approach under within-region
(WR) and out-of-region (OoR) evaluation scenarios. Aggregate performance
metrics indicate that while na\"ive incorporation of raw geographic coordinates
improves within-region performance by retaining the interpolative value of
geographic location, it can hinder generalizability across regions. In
contrast, pretrained location encoders like GeoCLIP enhance predictive
performance and geographic generalizability for both WR and OoR scenarios.
However, qualitative analysis reveals artifact patterns caused by high-degree
basis functions and sparse upstream samples in certain areas, and ablation
results indicate varying performance among location encoders...

Abstract: Graphs are a widely used paradigm for representing non-Euclidean data, with
applications ranging from social network analysis to biomolecular prediction.
Conventional graph learning approaches typically rely on fixed structural
assumptions or fully observed data, limiting their effectiveness in more
complex, noisy, or evolving settings. Consequently, real-world graph data often
violates the assumptions of traditional graph learning methods, in particular,
it leads to four fundamental challenges: (1) Incompleteness, real-world graphs
have missing nodes, edges, or attributes; (2) Imbalance, the distribution of
the labels of nodes or edges and their structures for real-world graphs are
highly skewed; (3) Cross-domain Heterogeneity, graphs from different domains
exhibit incompatible feature spaces or structural patterns; and (4) Dynamic
Instability, graphs evolve over time in unpredictable ways. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to tackle these challenges by
leveraging rich semantic reasoning and external knowledge. This survey provides
a comprehensive review of how LLMs can be integrated with graph learning to
address the aforementioned challenges. For each challenge, we review both
traditional solutions and modern LLM-driven approaches, highlighting how LLMs
contribute unique advantages. Finally, we discuss open research questions and
promising future directions in this emerging interdisciplinary field. To
support further exploration, we have curated a repository of recent advances on

Abstract: Numerous recent prompt optimization approaches like chain-of-thought, have
been demonstrated to significantly improve the quality of content generated by
large language models (LLMs). In-context learning (ICL), a recent paradigm
where a few representative examples guide content generation has also led to
strong improvements in generation quality of LLM generated content. This idea
has been applied to great effect in synthetic tabular data generation, where
LLMs, through effective use of ICL and prompt optimization, can generate data
that approximate samples from complex, heterogeneous distributions based on
representative examples. However, ensuring high-fidelity synthetic data often
requires a very large number of ICL examples which may be unavailable or costly
to obtain. At the same time, as LLMs get larger and larger, their in-built
prior knowledge becomes vast and can potentially substitute for specific data
examples. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge-Guided Prompting (KGP) as a new
knob in prompt optimization and explore the ability of KGP-based prompt
optimization to offset the cost of ICL. Specifically, we explore the question
`how many examples can a prompt substitute for?' and explore knowledge-guided
prompting (KGP) where domain knowledge, either inferred or available, is
explicitly injected into the prompt, reducing dependence on ICL examples. Our
experiments systematically explore the trade-off between ICL and KGP, revealing
an empirical scaling law that quantifies how quality of generated synthetic
data varies with increasing domain knowledge and decreasing example count. Our
results demonstrate that knowledge-guided prompting can be a scalable
alternative, or addition, to in-context examples, unlocking new approaches to
synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Error correction is an important capability when applying large language
models (LLMs) to facilitate user typing on mobile devices. In this paper, we
use LLMs to synthesize a high-quality dataset of error correction pairs to
evaluate and improve LLMs for mobile applications. We first prompt LLMs with
error correction domain knowledge to build a scalable and reliable addition to
the existing data synthesis pipeline. We then adapt the synthetic data
distribution to match the mobile application domain by reweighting the samples.
The reweighting model is learnt by predicting (a handful of) live A/B test
metrics when deploying LLMs in production, given the LLM performance on offline
evaluation data and scores from a small privacy-preserving on-device language
model. Finally, we present best practices for mixing our synthetic data with
other data sources to improve model performance on error correction in both
offline evaluation and production live A/B testing.

Result: 理论证明FedHL具有O(1/√T)收敛率，实验显示性能提升1-3%。

Conclusion: FedHL有效解决了异构LoRA的收敛问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates the fine-tuning of Foundation Models
(FMs) using distributed data sources, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) gaining
popularity due to its low communication costs and strong performance. While
recent work acknowledges the benefits of heterogeneous LoRA in FL and
introduces flexible algorithms to support its implementation, our theoretical
analysis reveals a critical gap: existing methods lack formal convergence
guarantees due to parameter truncation and biased gradient updates.
Specifically, adapting client-specific LoRA ranks necessitates truncating
global parameters, which introduces inherent truncation errors and leads to
subsequent inaccurate gradient updates that accumulate over training rounds,
ultimately degrading performance. To address the above issues, we propose
\textbf{FedHL}, a simple yet effective \textbf{Fed}erated Learning framework
tailored for \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{L}oRA. By leveraging the full-rank
global model as a calibrated aggregation basis, FedHL eliminates the direct
truncation bias from initial alignment with client-specific ranks. Furthermore,
we derive the theoretically optimal aggregation weights by minimizing the
gradient drift term in the convergence upper bound. Our analysis shows that
FedHL guarantees $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate, and experiments on
multiple real-world datasets demonstrate a 1-3\% improvement over several
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Prime通过引入中间状态显著提升了掩码扩散模型的效率和性能，适用于多种生成任务。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDM) are powerful generative models for discrete
data that generate samples by progressively unmasking tokens in a sequence.
Each token can take one of two states: masked or unmasked. We observe that
token sequences often remain unchanged between consecutive sampling steps;
consequently, the model repeatedly processes identical inputs, leading to
redundant computation. To address this inefficiency, we propose the Partial
masking scheme (Prime), which augments MDM by allowing tokens to take
intermediate states interpolated between the masked and unmasked states. This
design enables the model to make predictions based on partially observed token
information, and facilitates a fine-grained denoising process. We derive a
variational training objective and introduce a simple architectural design to
accommodate intermediate-state inputs. Our method demonstrates superior
performance across a diverse set of generative modeling tasks. On text data, it
achieves a perplexity of 15.36 on OpenWebText, outperforming previous MDM
(21.52), autoregressive models (17.54), and their hybrid variants (17.58),
without relying on an autoregressive formulation. On image data, it attains
competitive FID scores of 3.26 on CIFAR-10 and 6.98 on ImageNet-32, comparable
to leading continuous generative models.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress,
their proficiency in graph-related tasks remains notably limited, hindering the
development of truly general-purpose models. Previous attempts, including
pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often
face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented
graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that
Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can
significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we
curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50
diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data
and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1
obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B
model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also
show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph
encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as
real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising
general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for
building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic
tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with
abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess
graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully.

Abstract: Hypergraphs effectively model higher-order relationships in natural
phenomena, capturing complex interactions beyond pairwise connections. We
introduce a novel hypergraph message passing framework inspired by interacting
particle systems, where hyperedges act as fields inducing shared node dynamics.
By incorporating attraction, repulsion, and Allen-Cahn forcing terms, particles
of varying classes and features achieve class-dependent equilibrium, enabling
separability through the particle-driven message passing. We investigate both
first-order and second-order particle system equations for modeling these
dynamics, which mitigate over-smoothing and heterophily thus can capture
complete interactions. The more stable second-order system permits deeper
message passing. Furthermore, we enhance deterministic message passing with
stochastic element to account for interaction uncertainties. We prove
theoretically that our approach mitigates over-smoothing by maintaining a
positive lower bound on the hypergraph Dirichlet energy during propagation and
thus to enable hypergraph message passing to go deep. Empirically, our models
demonstrate competitive performance on diverse real-world hypergraph node
classification tasks, excelling on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.

Abstract: Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) driven by random noise play
a central role in modelling physical processes whose spatio-temporal dynamics
can be rough, such as turbulence flows, superconductors, and quantum dynamics.
To efficiently model these processes and make predictions, machine learning
(ML)-based surrogate models are proposed, with their network architectures
incorporating the spatio-temporal roughness in their design. However, it lacks
an extensive and unified datasets for SPDE learning; especially, existing
datasets do not account for the computational error introduced by noise
sampling and the necessary renormalization required for handling singular
SPDEs. We thus introduce SPDEBench, which is designed to solve typical SPDEs of
physical significance (e.g., the $\Phi^4_d$, wave, incompressible
Navier--Stokes, and KdV equations) on 1D or 2D tori driven by white noise via
ML methods. New datasets for singular SPDEs based on the renormalization
process have been constructed, and novel ML models achieving the best results
to date have been proposed. In particular, we investigate the impact of
computational error introduced by noise sampling and renormalization on the
performance comparison of ML models and highlight the importance of selecting
high-quality test data for accurate evaluation. Results are benchmarked with
traditional numerical solvers and ML-based models, including FNO, NSPDE and
DLR-Net, etc. It is shown that, for singular SPDEs, naively applying ML models
on data without specifying the numerical schemes can lead to significant errors
and misleading conclusions. Our SPDEBench provides an open-source codebase that
ensures full reproducibility of benchmarking across a variety of SPDE datasets
while offering the flexibility to incorporate new datasets and machine learning
baselines, making it a valuable resource for the community.

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to measure how training data
impacts a model's predictions. While gradient-based attribution methods, such
as influence functions, offer theoretical grounding, their computational costs
make them impractical for large-scale applications. Representation-based
approaches are far more scalable, but typically rely on heuristic embeddings
that are not optimized for attribution, limiting their fidelity. To address
these challenges, we propose AirRep, a scalable, representation-based approach
that closes this gap by learning task-specific and model-aligned
representations optimized explicitly for TDA. AirRep introduces two key
innovations: a trainable encoder tuned for attribution quality, and an
attention-based pooling mechanism that enables accurate estimation of
group-wise influence. We train AirRep using a ranking objective over
automatically constructed training subsets labeled by their empirical effect on
target predictions. Experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs demonstrate that
AirRep achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art gradient-based
approaches while being nearly two orders of magnitude more efficient at
inference time. Further analysis highlights its robustness and generalization
across tasks and models. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法在严重域偏移下表现不佳，而主动TTA方法因标注成本高不实用，需一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出BiTTA框架，结合强化学习平衡二元反馈引导的适应和基于一致性的自适应，优化模型预测。

Result: BiTTA在实验中比现有方法提升13.3%的准确率，显著优于基线。

Conclusion: BiTTA在减少标注负担的同时，有效处理严重域偏移，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Deep learning models perform poorly when domain shifts exist between training
and test data. Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a paradigm to mitigate this issue
by adapting pre-trained models using only unlabeled test samples. However,
existing TTA methods can fail under severe domain shifts, while recent active
TTA approaches requiring full-class labels are impractical due to high labeling
costs. To address this issue, we introduce a new setting of TTA with binary
feedback. This setting uses a few binary feedback inputs from annotators to
indicate whether model predictions are correct, thereby significantly reducing
the labeling burden of annotators. Under the setting, we propose BiTTA, a novel
dual-path optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to
balance binary feedback-guided adaptation on uncertain samples with
agreement-based self-adaptation on confident predictions. Experiments show
BiTTA achieves 13.3%p accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating its effectiveness in handling severe distribution shifts with
minimal labeling effort. The source code is available at

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为CLaDMoP的预训练方法，用于临床试验结果预测，通过多级融合技术结合大型语言模型和药物分子分支，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有临床试验结果预测模型依赖于任务特定的损失函数和特定阶段数据，可能导致泛化能力不足和更多假阳性/假阴性结果。

Method: CLaDMoP采用预训练方法，结合大型语言模型和药物分子分支，通过多级融合技术和分组块减少计算开销，并通过“配对匹配”代理任务进行预训练。

Result: 相比零样本和少样本基线方法，CLaDMoP显著提升了PR-AUC和ROC-AUC，尤其在I期和II期试验中。微调后，PR-AUC提升10.5%，ROC-AUC提升3.6%。

Conclusion: CLaDMoP展示了在临床试验结果预测中的潜力，性能优于现有监督基线方法。

Abstract: Many existing models for clinical trial outcome prediction are optimized
using task-specific loss functions on trial phase-specific data. While this
scheme may boost prediction for common diseases and drugs, it can hinder
learning of generalizable representations, leading to more false
positives/negatives. To address this limitation, we introduce CLaDMoP, a new
pre-training approach for clinical trial outcome prediction, alongside the
Successful Clinical Trials dataset(SCT), specifically designed for this task.
CLaDMoP leverages a Large Language Model-to encode trials' eligibility
criteria-linked to a lightweight Drug-Molecule branch through a novel
multi-level fusion technique. To efficiently fuse long embeddings across
levels, we incorporate a grouping block, drastically reducing computational
overhead. CLaDMoP avoids reliance on task-specific objectives by pre-training
on a "pair matching" proxy task. Compared to established zero-shot and few-shot
baselines, our method significantly improves both PR-AUC and ROC-AUC,
especially for phase I and phase II trials. We further evaluate and perform
ablation on CLaDMoP after Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, comparing it to
state-of-the-art supervised baselines, including MEXA-CTP, on the Trial Outcome
Prediction(TOP) benchmark. CLaDMoP achieves up to 10.5% improvement in PR-AUC
and 3.6% in ROC-AUC, while attaining comparable F1 score to MEXA-CTP,
highlighting its potential for clinical trial outcome prediction. Code and SCT
dataset can be downloaded from https://github.com/murai-lab/CLaDMoP.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种在保护群体噪声下鲁棒的AUC公平性优化方法，通过分布鲁棒优化提供理论保证，实验表明其优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: AUC是分类任务的关键指标，尤其在类别不平衡时。然而，现有AUC公平性研究常忽略保护群体噪声的影响，导致实际公平性受损。

Method: 采用分布鲁棒优化方法，首次提出在噪声保护群体下鲁棒的AUC公平性优化框架。

Result: 在表格和图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持AUC公平性方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了噪声保护群体下AUC公平性优化的空白，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a key metric for classification,
especially under class imbalance, with growing research focus on optimizing AUC
over accuracy in applications like medical image analysis and deepfake
detection. This leads to fairness in AUC optimization becoming crucial as
biases can impact protected groups. While various fairness mitigation
techniques exist, fairness considerations in AUC optimization remain in their
early stages, with most research focusing on improving AUC fairness under the
assumption of clean protected groups. However, these studies often overlook the
impact of noisy protected groups, leading to fairness violations in practice.
To address this, we propose the first robust AUC fairness approach under noisy
protected groups with fairness theoretical guarantees using distributionally
robust optimization. Extensive experiments on tabular and image datasets show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in preserving AUC
fairness. The code is in

Motivation: 理解SGD在不同噪声和几何条件下的动态行为，特别是在局部极值附近的逃逸概率和收敛时间。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究了SGD在无限和有限方差噪声下的收敛性和逃逸动态，考虑了初始点位置和噪声分布的影响。

Result: SGD通常收敛到局部最小值，但若初始点靠近局部最大值，可能长时间滞留；在尖锐最大值附近，SGD不会被困，且可以估计到达相邻最小值的概率。

Conclusion: SGD的动态行为受噪声特性和函数几何共同影响，提供了对局部极值间转移的细致理解。

Abstract: We study the convergence properties and escape dynamics of Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) in one-dimensional landscapes, separately considering
infinite- and finite-variance noise. Our main focus is to identify the time
scales on which SGD reliably moves from an initial point to the local minimum
in the same ''basin''. Under suitable conditions on the noise distribution, we
prove that SGD converges to the basin's minimum unless the initial point lies
too close to a local maximum. In that near-maximum scenario, we show that SGD
can linger for a long time in its neighborhood. For initial points near a
''sharp'' maximum, we show that SGD does not remain stuck there, and we provide
results to estimate the probability that it will reach each of the two
neighboring minima. Overall, our findings present a nuanced view of SGD's
transitions between local maxima and minima, influenced by both noise
characteristics and the underlying function geometry.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在多轮对话中是否能通过自我观察减少偏见，并探索哪些问题类型更容易引发偏见。

Method: 测试LLMs在9个主题的三种问题类型（主观、随机、客观）上的表现，并提出B-score作为偏见检测指标。

Result: LLMs在随机问题上能自我去偏见，B-score显著提升了答案验证的准确性。

Conclusion: 多轮对话和B-score是减少和检测LLM偏见的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit strong biases, e.g, against women
or in favor of the number 7. We investigate whether LLMs would be able to
output less biased answers when allowed to observe their prior answers to the
same question in a multi-turn conversation. To understand which types of
questions invite more biased answers, we test LLMs on our proposed set of
questions that span 9 topics and belong to three types: (1) Subjective; (2)
Random; and (3) Objective. Interestingly, LLMs are able to "de-bias" themselves
in a multi-turn conversation in response to questions that seek an Random,
unbiased answer. Furthermore, we propose B-score, a novel metric that is
effective in detecting biases to Subjective, Random, Easy, and Hard questions.
On MMLU, HLE, and CSQA, leveraging B-score substantially improves the
verification accuracy of LLM answers (i.e, accepting LLM correct answers and
rejecting incorrect ones) compared to using verbalized confidence scores or the
frequency of single-turn answers alone. Code and data are available at:

Motivation: 现有深度生成模型（如VAE和GAN）在处理离散观测和潜在代码时表现不佳，且优化目标与数据似然间接相关。

Method: 提出JSA自动编码器，直接最大化数据对数似然，并最小化后验与推理模型之间的KL散度。

Result: 实验表明JSA在结构不匹配时表现稳健，能一致处理离散和连续变量，且在离散潜在空间下性能与连续潜在空间的SOTA模型相当。

Conclusion: JSA是首个成功应用于半监督任务的离散潜在变量模型，展示了其优越性。

Abstract: Our examination of existing deep generative models (DGMs), including VAEs and
GANs, reveals two problems. First, their capability in handling discrete
observations and latent codes is unsatisfactory, though there are interesting
efforts. Second, both VAEs and GANs optimize some criteria that are indirectly
related to the data likelihood. To address these problems, we formally present
Joint-stochastic-approximation (JSA) autoencoders - a new family of algorithms
for building deep directed generative models, with application to
semi-supervised learning. The JSA learning algorithm directly maximizes the
data log-likelihood and simultaneously minimizes the inclusive KL divergence
the between the posteriori and the inference model. We provide theoretical
results and conduct a series of experiments to show its superiority such as
being robust to structure mismatch between encoder and decoder, consistent
handling of both discrete and continuous variables. Particularly we empirically
show that JSA autoencoders with discrete latent space achieve comparable
performance to other state-of-the-art DGMs with continuous latent space in
semi-supervised tasks over the widely adopted datasets - MNIST and SVHN. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that discrete latent
variable models are successfully applied in the challenging semi-supervised
tasks.

Motivation: 解决流固耦合问题中传统方法的局限性，探索PINN框架下更高效的架构设计。

Method: 提出两种神经网络架构：单FSI网络和欧拉-拉格朗日网络，分别采用Tanh和自适应B样条激活函数进行测试。

Result: 欧拉-拉格朗日架构表现更优，自适应B样条激活函数显著提升边界附近精度，但压力恢复仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 域特定架构设计和自适应激活函数对PINN框架下FSI问题建模至关重要。

Abstract: We introduce neural network architectures that combine physics-informed
neural networks (PINNs) with the immersed boundary method (IBM) to solve
fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. Our approach features two distinct
architectures: a Single-FSI network with a unified parameter space, and an
innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian network that maintains separate parameter spaces
for fluid and structure domains. We study each architecture using standard Tanh
and adaptive B-spline activation functions. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity
flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that the
Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture performs significantly better. The adaptive
B-spline activation further enhances accuracy by providing locality-aware
representation near boundaries. While our methodology shows promising results
in predicting the velocity field, pressure recovery remains challenging due to
the absence of explicit force-coupling constraints in the current formulation.
Our findings underscore the importance of domain-specific architectural design
and adaptive activation functions for modeling FSI problems within the PINN
framework.

Motivation: 深度网络在连续任务学习中容易发生灾难性遗忘，现有方法主要关注参数保护，但参数保护不切实际且效率低。

Method: 从神经科学和物理学角度提出通路比参数更重要的观点，提出LwI框架，通过图匹配实现模型融合，保护旧任务的通路。

Result: LwI能够自适应分配新任务的通路，以参数高效的方式解决灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: LwI在实验中表现优越，为持续学习提供了一种新的有效方法。

Abstract: Deep networks are prone to catastrophic forgetting during sequential task
learning, i.e., losing the knowledge about old tasks upon learning new tasks.
To this end, continual learning(CL) has emerged, whose existing methods focus
mostly on regulating or protecting the parameters associated with the previous
tasks. However, parameter protection is often impractical, since the size of
parameters for storing the old-task knowledge increases linearly with the
number of tasks, otherwise it is hard to preserve the parameters related to the
old-task knowledge. In this work, we bring a dual opinion from neuroscience and
physics to CL: in the whole networks, the pathways matter more than the
parameters when concerning the knowledge acquired from the old tasks. Following
this opinion, we propose a novel CL framework, learning without isolation(LwI),
where model fusion is formulated as graph matching and the pathways occupied by
the old tasks are protected without being isolated. Thanks to the sparsity of
activation channels in a deep network, LwI can adaptively allocate available
pathways for a new task, realizing pathway protection and addressing
catastrophic forgetting in a parameter-efficient manner. Experiments on popular
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LwI.

Method: VISTA利用视觉语言模型（VLMs），结合历史股价的文本和图表，通过零样本设置和链式思维提示进行预测。

Result: 实验显示，VISTA比ARIMA和纯文本LLM方法性能提升高达89.83%。

Conclusion: 多模态推理在股票时间序列分析中效果显著，VLMs在无需任务特定训练的情况下展现出潜力。

Abstract: Stock price prediction remains a complex and high-stakes task in financial
analysis, traditionally addressed using statistical models or, more recently,
language models. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Vision-Language Inference
for Stock Time-series Analysis), a novel, training-free framework that
leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal stock forecasting.
VISTA prompts a VLM with both textual representations of historical stock
prices and their corresponding line charts to predict future price values. By
combining numerical and visual modalities in a zero-shot setting and using
carefully designed chain-of-thought prompts, VISTA captures complementary
patterns that unimodal approaches often miss. We benchmark VISTA against
standard baselines, including ARIMA and text-only LLM-based prompting methods.
Experimental results show that VISTA outperforms these baselines by up to
89.83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal inference for stock
time-series analysis and highlighting the potential of VLMs in financial
forecasting tasks without requiring task-specific training.

Result: 将Rényi DP参数增长从O(T²)降至O(T)，数值结果验证了更优的DP边界。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升隐私保护效果，实验显示在去中心化场景下性能接近中心化方法。

Abstract: Fully decentralized training of machine learning models offers significant
advantages in scalability, robustness, and fault tolerance. However, achieving
differential privacy (DP) in such settings is challenging due to the absence of
a central aggregator and varying trust assumptions among nodes. In this work,
we present a novel privacy analysis of decentralized gossip-based averaging
algorithms with additive node-level noise, both with and without secure
summation over each node's direct neighbors. Our main contribution is a new
analytical framework based on a linear systems formulation that accurately
characterizes privacy leakage across these scenarios. This framework
significantly improves upon prior analyses, for example, reducing the R\'enyi
DP parameter growth from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the number of
training rounds. We validate our analysis with numerical results demonstrating
superior DP bounds compared to existing approaches. We further illustrate our
analysis with a logistic regression experiment on MNIST image classification in
a fully decentralized setting, demonstrating utility comparable to central
aggregation methods.

Method: 动态分配rollout预算和自适应温度调整策略。

Result: 提升了训练效率，同时保持了模型的探索能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了RL训练中的效率和探索问题。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks, which has
drawn significant attention to reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs. However,
existing approaches allocate an equal number of rollouts to all questions
during the RL process, which is inefficient. This inefficiency stems from the
fact that training on simple questions yields limited gains, whereas more
rollouts are needed for challenging questions to sample correct answers.
Furthermore, while RL improves response precision, it limits the model's
exploration ability, potentially resulting in a performance cap below that of
the base model prior to RL. To address these issues, we propose a mechanism for
dynamically allocating rollout budgets based on the difficulty of the problems,
enabling more efficient RL training. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive
dynamic temperature adjustment strategy to maintain the entropy at a stable
level, thereby encouraging sufficient exploration. This enables LLMs to improve
response precision while preserving their exploratory ability to uncover
potential correct pathways. The code and data is available on:

Abstract: As protein informatics advances rapidly, the demand for enhanced predictive
accuracy, structural analysis, and functional understanding has intensified.
Transformer models, as powerful deep learning architectures, have demonstrated
unprecedented potential in addressing diverse challenges across protein
research. However, a comprehensive review of Transformer applications in this

Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms, categorize Transformer
variants tailored for protein science, and summarize essential protein
knowledge. For each research domain, we outline its objectives and background,
critically evaluate prior methods and their limitations, and highlight
transformative contributions enabled by Transformer models. We also curate and
summarize pivotal datasets and open-source code resources to facilitate
reproducibility and benchmarking. Finally, we discuss persistent challenges in
applying Transformers to protein informatics and propose future research

Conclusion: 基于超材料的物理计算方法为SHM提供了高效、低能耗的解决方案，展示了在资源受限场景中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Structural health monitoring (SHM) involves sensor deployment, data
acquisition, and data interpretation, commonly implemented via a tedious wired
system. The information processing in current practice majorly depends on
electronic computers, albeit with universal applications, delivering challenges
such as high energy consumption and low throughput due to the nature of digital
units. In recent years, there has been a renaissance interest in shifting
computations from electronic computing units to the use of real physical
systems, a concept known as physical computation. This approach provides the
possibility of thinking out of the box for SHM, seamlessly integrating sensing
and computing into a pure-physical entity, without relying on external
electronic power supplies, thereby properly coping with resource-restricted
scenarios. The latest advances of metamaterials (MM) hold great promise for
this proactive idea. In this paper, we introduce a programmable
metamaterial-based sensor (termed as MM-sensor) for physically processing
structural vibration information to perform specific SHM tasks, such as
structural damage warning (binary classification) in this initiation, without
the need for further information processing or resource-consuming, that is, the
data collection and analysis are completed in-situ at the sensor level. We
adopt the configuration of a locally resonant metamaterial plate (LRMP) to
achieve the first fabrication of the MM-sensor. We take advantage of the
bandgap properties of LRMP to physically differentiate the dynamic behavior of
structures before and after damage. By inversely designing the geometric
parameters, our current approach allows for adjustments to the bandgap
features. This is effective for engineering systems with a first natural
frequency ranging from 9.54 Hz to 81.86 Hz.

Method: 通过拉普拉斯近似在学习的任何阶段（开始、期间或之后）增强点估计，无需修改基础模型架构。

Result: 该方法能估计非贝叶斯代理的分布统计量（如熵），且与变分基线性能相当，但参数更少。

Conclusion: 拉普拉斯近似提供了一种高效且轻量的方法，用于元强化学习中的任务后验分布估计。

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning trains a single reinforcement learning agent on a
distribution of tasks to quickly generalize to new tasks outside of the
training set at test time. From a Bayesian perspective, one can interpret this
as performing amortized variational inference on the posterior distribution
over training tasks. Among the various meta-reinforcement learning approaches,
a common method is to represent this distribution with a point-estimate using a
recurrent neural network. We show how one can augment this point estimate to
give full distributions through the Laplace approximation, either at the start
of, during, or after learning, without modifying the base model architecture.
With our approximation, we are able to estimate distribution statistics (e.g.,
the entropy) of non-Bayesian agents and observe that point-estimate based
methods produce overconfident estimators while not satisfying consistency.
Furthermore, when comparing our approach to full-distribution based learning of
the task posterior, our method performs on par with variational baselines while
having much fewer parameters.

Method: 分两阶段：轨迹标记（结合大语言模型和偏好强化学习）和多智能体模仿学习（提出MisoDICE算法）。

Result: 在多个标准多智能体强化学习基准测试中表现优异，尤其在专家数据稀缺时。

Conclusion: MisoDICE通过两阶段设计和新的算法框架，有效解决了多智能体模仿学习中的复杂性和数据质量问题。

Abstract: We study offline imitation learning (IL) in cooperative multi-agent settings,
where demonstrations have unlabeled mixed quality - containing both expert and
suboptimal trajectories. Our proposed solution is structured in two stages:
trajectory labeling and multi-agent imitation learning, designed jointly to
enable effective learning from heterogeneous, unlabeled data. In the first
stage, we combine advances in large language models and preference-based
reinforcement learning to construct a progressive labeling pipeline that
distinguishes expert-quality trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce
MisoDICE, a novel multi-agent IL algorithm that leverages these labels to learn
robust policies while addressing the computational complexity of large joint
state-action spaces. By extending the popular single-agent DICE framework to
multi-agent settings with a new value decomposition and mixing architecture,
our method yields a convex policy optimization objective and ensures
consistency between global and local policies. We evaluate MisoDICE on multiple
standard multi-agent RL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance,
especially when expert data is scarce.

TLDR: Inf-SSM是一种基于几何感知的正则化方法，用于解决状态空间模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在序列建模中表现优异，但在持续学习中，其动态状态更新容易导致灾难性遗忘，尤其是在无样本设置下。

Method: 提出Inf-SSM，利用无限维Grassmannian几何约束状态演化，并通过Sylvester方程实现高效正则化。

Result: 在ImageNet-R和Caltech-256等基准测试中，显著减少遗忘并提高准确性。

Conclusion: Inf-SSM是一种高效且易于集成的正则化方法，有效解决了状态空间模型在持续学习中的挑战。

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) excel at capturing long-range dependencies with
structured recurrence, making them well-suited for sequence modeling. However,
their evolving internal states pose challenges in adapting them under Continual
Learning (CL). This is particularly difficult in exemplar-free settings, where
the absence of prior data leaves updates to the dynamic SSM states
unconstrained, resulting in catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we
propose Inf-SSM, a novel and simple geometry-aware regularization method that
utilizes the geometry of the infinite-dimensional Grassmannian to constrain
state evolution during CL. Unlike classical continual learning methods that
constrain weight updates, Inf-SSM regularizes the infinite-horizon evolution of
SSMs encoded in their extended observability subspace. We show that enforcing
this regularization requires solving a matrix equation known as the Sylvester
equation, which typically incurs $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ complexity. We develop a
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ solution by exploiting the structure and properties of SSMs.
This leads to an efficient regularization mechanism that can be seamlessly
integrated into existing CL methods. Comprehensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks, including ImageNet-R and Caltech-256, demonstrate a significant
reduction in forgetting while improving accuracy across sequential tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了两种新指标CWSA和CWSA+，用于评估基于置信度的选择性预测模型，优于传统指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指标（如准确率、ECE、AURC）无法全面评估预测的可靠性，尤其是在处理置信度时存在局限性。

Method: 引入CWSA和CWSA+，通过显式奖励高置信度准确预测并惩罚过度自信错误，提供局部阈值评估。

Result: 在真实数据集（MNIST、CIFAR-10）和人工模型上的实验表明，CWSA和CWSA+能有效检测细微错误模式，优于传统指标。

Conclusion: CWSA为安全关键领域的选择性预测系统提供了可靠的评估基础。

Abstract: In recent machine learning systems, confidence scores are being utilized more
and more to manage selective prediction, whereby a model can abstain from
making a prediction when it is unconfident. Yet, conventional metrics like
accuracy, expected calibration error (ECE), and area under the risk-coverage
curve (AURC) do not capture the actual reliability of predictions. These
metrics either disregard confidence entirely, dilute valuable localized
information through averaging, or neglect to suitably penalize overconfident
misclassifications, which can be particularly detrimental in real-world
systems. We introduce two new metrics Confidence-Weighted Selective Accuracy
(CWSA) and its normalized variant CWSA+ that offer a principled and
interpretable way to evaluate predictive models under confidence thresholds.
Unlike existing methods, our metrics explicitly reward confident accuracy and
penalize overconfident mistakes. They are threshold-local, decomposable, and
usable in both evaluation and deployment settings where trust and risk must be
quantified. Through exhaustive experiments on both real-world data sets (MNIST,
CIFAR-10) and artificial model variants (calibrated, overconfident,
underconfident, random, perfect), we show that CWSA and CWSA+ both effectively
detect nuanced failure modes and outperform classical metrics in
trust-sensitive tests. Our results confirm that CWSA is a sound basis for
developing and assessing selective prediction systems for safety-critical
domains.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为“反射验证”的无训练、语义感知方法，通过利用大语言模型（LLM）的反射能力，在并行验证过程中语义评估草稿令牌的正确性，显著提高了解码速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法过于依赖分布一致性而忽略语义正确性，限制了速度提升潜力。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出反射验证方法，利用LLM的反射能力，通过提示探测获取草稿令牌的原始和反射分布，融合后进行语义级验证。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了草稿令牌的接受长度且不影响模型性能，结合现有统计验证方法可额外提升5~15%的解码速度。

Conclusion: 反射验证在语义正确性和效率之间取得了更好的平衡，且与现有方法正交，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) suffer from high inference latency due to the
auto-regressive decoding process. Speculative decoding accelerates inference by
generating multiple draft tokens using a lightweight model and verifying them
in parallel. However, existing verification methods rely heavily on
distributional consistency while overlooking semantic correctness, thereby
limiting the potential speedup of speculative decoding. While some methods
employ additional models for relaxed verification of draft tokens, they often
fail to generalize effectively to more diverse or open-domain settings. In this
work, we propose Reflective Verification, a training-free and semantics-aware
approach that achieves a better trade-off between correctness and efficiency.
Specifically, we leverage the inherent reflective capacity of LLMs to
semantically assess the correctness of draft tokens in parallel during
verification. Using prompt-based probing, we obtain both the original and
reflective distributions of draft tokens in a single forward pass. The fusion
of these distributions enables semantic-level verification of draft tokens that
incorporates both consistency and correctness. Experiments across multiple
domain benchmarks and model scales demonstrate that our method significantly
increases the acceptance length of draft tokens without compromising model
performance. Furthermore, we find that the proposed Reflective Verification is
orthogonal to existing statistical verification methods, and their combination
yields additional 5$\sim$15\% improvements in decoding speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集成方法在大规模模型和微调工作流中成本过高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 将大模型与小模型（sidekick）结合，通过学习的加权平均聚合预测。

Result: 在多个图像分类基准测试中，显著提升准确性、不确定性量化和选择性分类指标，仅增加10-20%计算成本。

Conclusion: Asymmetric Duo是一种高效且成本低的策略，适用于大规模模型的优化。

Abstract: The go-to strategy to apply deep networks in settings where uncertainty
informs decisions--ensembling multiple training runs with random
initializations--is ill-suited for the extremely large-scale models and
practical fine-tuning workflows of today. We introduce a new cost-effective
strategy for improving the uncertainty quantification and downstream decisions
of a large model (e.g. a fine-tuned ViT-B): coupling it with a less accurate
but much smaller "sidekick" (e.g. a fine-tuned ResNet-34) with a fraction of
the computational cost. We propose aggregating the predictions of this
\emph{Asymmetric Duo} by simple learned weighted averaging. Surprisingly,
despite their inherent asymmetry, the sidekick model almost never harms the
performance of the larger model. In fact, across five image classification
benchmarks and a variety of model architectures and training schemes (including
soups), Asymmetric Duos significantly improve accuracy, uncertainty
quantification, and selective classification metrics with only ${\sim}10-20\%$
more computation.

TLDR: ThanoRA提出了一种任务异构感知的多任务低秩适应框架，解决了现有方法因路由器导致参数不可合并的问题，同时保持了LoRA的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中基础模型需要同时适应多个任务，而现有方法（如LoRA与MoE结合）因路由器导致参数不可合并，增加了推理开销并限制了多任务适应。

Method: ThanoRA通过构建任务特定的LoRA子空间，并在训练中引入子空间保持正则化，以建模任务异构性并防止子空间干扰。

Result: 在多模态和纯文本基准测试中，ThanoRA在多种任务组合下均表现出色，且不增加额外推理开销。

Conclusion: ThanoRA实现了高效且统一的多任务适应，为实际部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely adopted for downstream fine-tuning of
foundation models due to its efficiency and zero additional inference cost.
Many real-world applications require foundation models to specialize in
multiple tasks simultaneously, motivating the need for efficient multi-task
adaptation. While recent approaches integrate LoRA with mixture-of-experts
(MoE) to address this, the use of routers prevents parameter mergeability,
which increases inference overhead and hinders unified multi-task adaptation,
thereby limiting deployment practicality. In this work, we propose ThanoRA, a
Task Heterogeneity-Aware Multi-Task Low-Rank Adaptation framework that enables
multi-task adaptation while preserving the inference efficiency of LoRA.
ThanoRA jointly models task heterogeneity and mitigates subspace interference
throughout training. Specifically, motivated by inherent differences in
complexity and heterogeneity across tasks, ThanoRA constructs task-specific
LoRA subspaces at initialization, enabling fine-grained knowledge injection
aligned with task heterogeneity. Furthermore, to prevent task interference and
subspace collapse during multi-task training, ThanoRA introduces a
subspace-preserving regularization that maintains the independence of
task-specific representations. With the synergy of both components, ThanoRA
enables efficient and unified multi-task adaptation. Extensive experiments
across multimodal and text-only benchmarks under varying multi-task mixtures
demonstrate that ThanoRA consistently achieves robust and superior performance
over strong baselines without introducing additional inference overhead. Our
code is publicly available at: https://github.com/LiangJian24/ThanoRA.

Result: 在N体系统、分子动力学和行人动力学基准测试中，STFlow显著降低预测误差并提高推理效率。

Conclusion: STFlow证明了在概率几何轨迹建模中利用物理信息先验分布的优势。

Abstract: The simulation of N-body systems is a fundamental problem with applications
in a wide range of fields, such as molecular dynamics, biochemistry, and
pedestrian dynamics. Machine learning has become an invaluable tool for scaling
physics-based simulators and developing models directly from experimental data.
In particular, recent advances based on deep generative modeling and geometric
deep learning have enabled probabilistic simulation by modeling complex
distributions over trajectories while respecting the permutation symmetry that
is fundamental to N-body systems. However, to generate realistic trajectories,
existing methods must learn complex transformations starting from uninformed
noise and do not allow for the exploitation of domain-informed priors. In this
work, we propose STFlow to address this limitation. By leveraging flow matching
and data-dependent couplings, STFlow facilitates physics-informed simulation of
geometric trajectories without sacrificing model expressivity or scalability.
Our evaluation on N-body dynamical systems, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian
dynamics benchmarks shows that STFlow produces significantly lower prediction
errors while enabling more efficient inference, highlighting the benefits of
employing physics-informed prior distributions in probabilistic geometric
trajectory modeling.

Abstract: We introduce an encoder-only approach to learn the evolution operators of
large-scale non-linear dynamical systems, such as those describing complex
natural phenomena. Evolution operators are particularly well-suited for
analyzing systems that exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns and have become
a key analytical tool across various scientific communities. As terabyte-scale
weather datasets and simulation tools capable of running millions of molecular
dynamics steps per day are becoming commodities, our approach provides an
effective tool to make sense of them from a data-driven perspective. The core
of it lies in a remarkable connection between self-supervised representation
learning methods and the recently established learning theory of evolution
operators. To show the usefulness of the proposed method, we test it across
multiple scientific domains: explaining the folding dynamics of small proteins,
the binding process of drug-like molecules in host sites, and autonomously
finding patterns in climate data. Code and data to reproduce the experiments

Result: 实验表明，COCA显著降低了分布内和分布外越狱成功率，同时保持了数学和代码生成等常规任务的性能。

Conclusion: COCA在非线性设置中解决了表示干预的局限性，为安全对齐提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Representation intervention aims to locate and modify the representations
that encode the underlying concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) to elicit
the aligned and expected behaviors. Despite the empirical success, it has never
been examined whether one could locate the faithful concepts for intervention.
In this work, we explore the question in safety alignment. If the interventions
are faithful, the intervened LLMs should erase the harmful concepts and be
robust to both in-distribution adversarial prompts and the out-of-distribution
(OOD) jailbreaks. While it is feasible to erase harmful concepts without
degrading the benign functionalities of LLMs in linear settings, we show that
it is infeasible in the general non-linear setting. To tackle the issue, we
propose Concept Concentration (COCA). Instead of identifying the faithful
locations to intervene, COCA refractors the training data with an explicit
reasoning process, which firstly identifies the potential unsafe concepts and
then decides the responses. Essentially, COCA simplifies the decision boundary
between harmful and benign representations, enabling more effective linear
erasure. Extensive experiments with multiple representation intervention
methods and model architectures demonstrate that COCA significantly reduces
both in-distribution and OOD jailbreak success rates, and meanwhile maintaining
strong performance on regular tasks such as math and code generation.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) without a hole transport layer (HTL) offer a
cost-effective and stable alternative to conventional architectures, utilizing
only an absorber layer and an electron transport layer (ETL). This study
presents a machine learning (ML)-driven framework to optimize the efficiency
and stability of HTL-free PSCs by integrating experimental validation with
numerical simulations. Excellent agreement is achieved between a fabricated
device and its simulated counterpart at a molar fraction \( x = 68.7\% \) in
\(\mathrm{MAPb}_{1-x}\mathrm{Sb}_{2x/3}\mathrm{I}_3\), where MA is
methylammonium. A dataset of 1650 samples is generated by varying molar
fraction, absorber defect density, thickness, and ETL doping, with
corresponding efficiency and 50-hour degradation as targets. A fourth-degree
polynomial regressor (PR-4) shows the best performance, achieving RMSEs of
0.0179 and 0.0117, and \( R^2 \) scores of 1 and 0.999 for efficiency and
degradation, respectively. The derived model generalizes beyond the training
range and is used in an L-BFGS-B optimization algorithm with a weighted
objective function to maximize efficiency and minimize degradation. This
improves device efficiency from 13.7\% to 16.84\% and reduces degradation from
6.61\% to 2.39\% over 1000 hours. Finally, the dataset is labeled into superior
and inferior classes, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier achieves
100\% accuracy, successfully identifying optimal configurations.

Result: SimGCL在无记忆约束下超越现有GNN基线约20%。

Conclusion: LLMs能有效缓解GCL中的灾难性遗忘，SimGCL方法简单高效，LLM4GCL工具促进可复现性。

Abstract: Nowadays, real-world data, including graph-structure data, often arrives in a
streaming manner, which means that learning systems need to continuously
acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information.
Although substantial existing works attempt to address catastrophic forgetting
in graph machine learning, they are all based on training from scratch with
streaming data. With the rise of pretrained models, an increasing number of
studies have leveraged their strong generalization ability for continual
learning. Therefore, in this work, we attempt to answer whether large language
models (LLMs) can mitigate catastrophic forgetting in Graph Continual Learning
(GCL). We first point out that current experimental setups for GCL have
significant flaws, as the evaluation stage may lead to task ID leakage. Then,
we evaluate the performance of LLMs in more realistic scenarios and find that
even minor modifications can lead to outstanding results. Finally, based on
extensive experiments, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, Simple Graph
Continual Learning (SimGCL), that surpasses the previous state-of-the-art
GNN-based baseline by around 20% under the rehearsal-free constraint. To
facilitate reproducibility, we have developed an easy-to-use benchmark LLM4GCL
for training and evaluating existing GCL methods. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的注意力机制存在二次复杂度问题，限制了其在长序列任务中的效率。本文旨在通过结构化矩阵近似注意力机制，降低计算成本。

Method: 利用Monarch矩阵和软注意力的变分形式，提出了一种高效的优化算法，计算复杂度为Θ(N√N d)，内存/IO复杂度为Θ(Nd)。

Result: MonarchAttention在多种任务中表现优异，计算速度显著提升（如N=16K时速度提升8.2倍），且无需额外训练即可直接替换原始注意力层。

Conclusion: MonarchAttention是一种高效、可迁移的注意力近似方法，适用于多种任务和架构，显著提升了Transformer的效率。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various tasks,
but suffer from a notable quadratic complexity in sequence length due to the
attention mechanism. In this work, we propose MonarchAttention -- a novel
approach to sub-quadratic attention approximation via Monarch matrices, an
expressive class of structured matrices. Based on the variational form of
softmax, we describe an efficient optimization-based algorithm to compute an
approximate projection of softmax attention onto the class of Monarch matrices
with $\Theta(N\sqrt{N} d)$ computational complexity and $\Theta(Nd)$ memory/IO
complexity. Unlike previous approaches, MonarchAttention is both (1)
transferable, yielding minimal performance loss with no additional training,
even when replacing every attention layer of the transformer, and (2)
hardware-efficient, utilizing the highest-throughput tensor core units on
modern GPUs. With optimized kernels, MonarchAttention achieves substantial
speed-ups in wall-time over FlashAttention-2: $1.4\times$ for shorter sequences
$(N=256)$, $4.5\times$ for medium-length sequences $(N=4K)$, and $8.2\times$
for longer sequences $(N=16K)$. We demonstrate the quality of MonarchAttention
on diverse tasks and architectures in vision and language problems, showing
that it flexibly and accurately approximates softmax attention in a variety of
contexts. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent work on reasoning-oriented language models, exemplified by o1-like
systems, suggests that reinforcement-learning (RL) finetuning does not create
new capabilities but instead strengthens reasoning patterns already latent in
the pretrained network. We test this claim by training steering vectors:
layer-wise biases that additively amplify selected hidden features while
leaving all original weights unchanged. Experiments on four base models across
the GSM8K and MATH benchmarks show that steering vectors recover, and in
several cases exceed, the accuracy of fully-tuned counterparts. This result
supports the view that the required reasoning skills pre-exist in the base
model. Further, logit-lens analysis reveals that the trained vectors
consistently boost token groups linked to structured languages and logical
connectors, providing an interpretable account that aligns with the demands of
quantitative reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: NPS-Pruning是一种高效且鲁棒的剪枝方法，适用于知识迁移、模型融合和压缩部署。

Abstract: Foundation models and their checkpoints have significantly advanced deep
learning, boosting performance across various applications. However, fine-tuned
models often struggle outside their specific domains and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Recent studies suggest that combining a pruned fine-tuned model
with the original pre-trained model can mitigate forgetting, reduce
interference when merging model parameters across tasks, and improve
compression efficiency. In this context, developing an effective pruning
strategy for fine-tuned models is crucial. Leveraging the advantages of the
task vector mechanism, we preprocess fine-tuned models by calculating the
differences between them and the original model. Recognizing that different
task vector subspaces contribute variably to model performance, we introduce a
novel method called Neural Parameter Search (NPS-Pruning) for slimming down
fine-tuned models. This method enhances pruning efficiency by searching through
neural parameters of task vectors within low-rank subspaces. Our method has
three key applications: enhancing knowledge transfer through pairwise model
interpolation, facilitating effective knowledge fusion via model merging, and
enabling the deployment of compressed models that retain near-original

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化模型在边缘设备部署时面临数据精度不匹配和性能下降的挑战，现有方法无法无损合并适应权重。

Method: 结合三元适应权重对齐量化网格、无损合并机制和三值符号梯度下降（t-SignSGD）更新权重。

Result: 在MMLU基准测试中，LoTA-QAF性能超越16位LoRA达5.14%，任务微调中表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: LoTA-QAF有效解决了量化模型微调中的关键问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Quantization and fine-tuning are crucial for deploying large language models
(LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices. However, fine-tuning quantized
models presents significant challenges, primarily stemming from: First, the
mismatch in data types between the low-precision quantized weights (e.g.,
4-bit) and the high-precision adaptation weights (e.g., 16-bit). This mismatch
limits the computational efficiency advantage offered by quantized weights
during inference. Second, potential accuracy degradation when merging these
high-precision adaptation weights into the low-precision quantized weights, as
the adaptation weights often necessitate approximation or truncation. Third, as
far as we know, no existing methods support the lossless merging of adaptation
while adjusting all quantized weights. To address these challenges, we
introduce lossless ternary adaptation for quantization-aware fine-tuning
(LoTA-QAF). This is a novel fine-tuning method specifically designed for
quantized LLMs, enabling the lossless merging of ternary adaptation weights
into quantized weights and the adjustment of all quantized weights. LoTA-QAF
operates through a combination of: i) A custom-designed ternary adaptation (TA)
that aligns ternary weights with the quantization grid and uses these ternary
weights to adjust quantized weights. ii) A TA-based mechanism that enables the
lossless merging of adaptation weights. iii) Ternary signed gradient descent
(t-SignSGD) for updating the TA weights. We apply LoTA-QAF to Llama-3.1/3.3 and
Qwen-2.5 model families and validate its effectiveness on several downstream
tasks. On the MMLU benchmark, our method effectively recovers performance for
quantized models, surpassing 16-bit LoRA by up to 5.14\%. For task-specific
fine-tuning, 16-bit LoRA achieves superior results, but LoTA-QAF still
outperforms other methods.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为MP-SSM的新方法，将现代状态空间模型（SSM）的关键原理直接嵌入消息传递神经网络（MPNN）框架，解决了现有图状态空间模型（GSSM）在置换等变性、消息传递兼容性和计算效率上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GSSM方法在将SSM模块应用于图序列时，常牺牲置换等变性、消息传递兼容性和计算效率等核心特性，因此需要一种更统一且高效的方法。

Method: 通过将SSM计算原理嵌入MPNN框架，提出MP-SSM方法，支持高效、置换等变和长程信息传播，同时保持消息传递的架构简洁性。

Result: MP-SSM在节点分类、图属性预测、长程基准测试和时空预测等任务中表现出色，验证了其多功能性和强大性能。

Conclusion: MP-SSM不仅解决了现有GSSM的局限性，还通过理论分析和优化实现，展示了其在图学习中的高效性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: The recent success of State-Space Models (SSMs) in sequence modeling has
motivated their adaptation to graph learning, giving rise to Graph State-Space
Models (GSSMs). However, existing GSSMs operate by applying SSM modules to
sequences extracted from graphs, often compromising core properties such as
permutation equivariance, message-passing compatibility, and computational
efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective by embedding the key
principles of modern SSM computation directly into the Message-Passing Neural
Network framework, resulting in a unified methodology for both static and
temporal graphs. Our approach, MP-SSM, enables efficient,
permutation-equivariant, and long-range information propagation while
preserving the architectural simplicity of message passing. Crucially, MP-SSM
enables an exact sensitivity analysis, which we use to theoretically
characterize information flow and evaluate issues like vanishing gradients and
over-squashing in the deep regime. Furthermore, our design choices allow for a
highly optimized parallel implementation akin to modern SSMs. We validate
MP-SSM across a wide range of tasks, including node classification, graph
property prediction, long-range benchmarks, and spatiotemporal forecasting,
demonstrating both its versatility and strong empirical performance.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖弱标签和用户行为后验，导致在ASR错误和低频领域表现不佳，需要改进用户满意度预测的表示学习。

Method: 提出两种辅助任务：对比自监督学习任务（学习罕见用户语句表示和识别ASR错误）和领域意图分类任务（学习长尾领域会话表示）。

Result: 在DuerOS上验证，显著提高了罕见用户语句和长尾领域的错误识别准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了噪声奖励和长尾分布问题，提升了用户满意度预测的准确性。

Abstract: Reward-driven proactive dialogue agents require precise estimation of user
satisfaction as an intrinsic reward signal to determine optimal interaction
strategies. Specifically, this framework triggers clarification questions when
detecting potential user dissatisfaction during interactions in the industrial
dialogue system. Traditional works typically rely on training a neural network
model based on weak labels which are generated by a simple model trained on
user actions after current turn. However, existing methods suffer from two
critical limitations in real-world scenarios: (1) Noisy Reward Supervision,
dependence on weak labels derived from post-hoc user actions introduces bias,
particularly failing to capture satisfaction signals in ASR-error-induced
utterances; (2) Long-Tail Feedback Sparsity, the power-law distribution of user
queries causes reward prediction accuracy to drop in low-frequency domains. The
noise in the weak labels and a power-law distribution of user utterances
results in that the model is hard to learn good representation of user
utterances and sessions. To address these limitations, we propose two auxiliary
tasks to improve the representation learning of user utterances and sessions
that enhance user satisfaction prediction. The first one is a contrastive
self-supervised learning task, which helps the model learn the representation
of rare user utterances and identify ASR errors. The second one is a
domain-intent classification task, which aids the model in learning the
representation of user sessions from long-tailed domains and improving the
model's performance on such domains. The proposed method is evaluated on
DuerOS, demonstrating significant improvements in the accuracy of error
recognition on rare user utterances and long-tailed domains.

TLDR: AuroRA通过引入自适应非线性层（ANL）解决了LoRA的低秩瓶颈问题，显著提升了参数效率，并在多个任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在参数高效微调中面临低秩瓶颈，性能提升需增加参数矩阵秩，导致参数开销大。现有线性变体无法根本提升表达能力。

Method: 提出AuroRA，在两组线性投影间加入自适应非线性层（ANL），形成类似MLP的结构，压缩秩并降低近似误差。

Result: 在22个数据集和6个预训练模型上，AuroRA仅用6.18%~25%的LoRA参数即匹配或超越全微调性能，优于现有PEFT方法达10.88%。

Conclusion: AuroRA通过非线性层显著提升参数效率和性能，适用于多种任务和秩配置。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) method validated across NLP and CV domains. However, LoRA
faces an inherent low-rank bottleneck: narrowing its performance gap with full
finetuning requires increasing the rank of its parameter matrix, resulting in
significant parameter overhead. Recent linear LoRA variants have attempted to
enhance expressiveness by introducing additional linear mappings; however,
their composition remains inherently linear and fails to fundamentally improve
LoRA's representational capacity. To address this limitation, we propose
AuroRA, which incorporates an Adaptive Nonlinear Layer (ANL) between two linear
projectors to capture fixed and learnable nonlinearities. This combination
forms an MLP-like structure with a compressed rank, enabling flexible and
precise approximation of diverse target functions while theoretically
guaranteeing lower approximation errors and bounded gradients. Extensive
experiments on 22 datasets and 6 pretrained models demonstrate that AuroRA: (I)
not only matches or surpasses full fine-tuning performance with only 6.18% ~
25% of LoRA's parameters but also (II) outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT
methods by up to 10.88% in both NLP and CV tasks, and (III) exhibits robust
performance across various rank configurations.

Abstract: With the proliferation of smart grids, smart cities face growing challenges
due to cyber-attacks and sophisticated electricity theft behaviors,
particularly in residential photovoltaic (PV) generation systems. Traditional
Electricity Theft Detection (ETD) methods often struggle to capture complex
temporal dependencies and integrating multi-source data, limiting their
effectiveness. In this work, we propose an efficient ETD method that accurately
identifies fraudulent behaviors in residential PV generation, thus ensuring the
supply-demand balance in smart cities. Our hybrid deep learning model,
combining multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM), and Transformer, excels in capturing both short-term and
long-term temporal dependencies. Additionally, we introduce a data embedding
technique that seamlessly integrates time-series data with discrete temperature
variables, enhancing detection robustness. Extensive simulation experiments
using real-world data validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
significant improvements in the accuracy of detecting sophisticated energy
theft activities, thereby contributing to the stability and fairness of energy
systems in smart cities.

Abstract: The ever-growing size of neural networks poses serious challenges on
resource-constrained devices, such as embedded sensors. Compression algorithms
that reduce their size can mitigate these problems, provided that model
performance stays close to the original. We propose a novel post-training
compression framework that combines rate-aware quantization with entropy coding
by (1) extending the well-known layer-wise loss by a quadratic rate estimation,
and (2) providing locally exact solutions to this modified objective following
the Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) method. Our method allows for very fast
decoding and is compatible with arbitrary quantization grids. We verify our
results empirically by testing on various computer-vision networks, achieving a
20-40\% decrease in bit rate at the same performance as the popular compression
algorithm NNCodec. Our code is available at https://github.com/Conzel/cerwu.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在离线RL中表现优异，但在在线RL框架（如PPO）中的应用尚未充分探索，尤其是在大规模并行GPU加速模拟器中。

Method: GenPO利用精确扩散反演构建可逆动作映射，并提出双虚拟动作机制实现交替更新。

Result: 在八个IsaacLab基准测试中，GenPO优于现有RL基线，首次成功将扩散策略集成到在线RL中。

Conclusion: GenPO为大规模并行化训练和真实机器人部署解锁了扩散策略的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the powerful
exploration capabilities and multimodality of generative diffusion-based
policies. While substantial progress has been made in offline RL and off-policy
RL settings, integrating diffusion policies into on-policy frameworks like PPO
remains underexplored. This gap is particularly significant given the
widespread use of large-scale parallel GPU-accelerated simulators, such as
IsaacLab, which are optimized for on-policy RL algorithms and enable rapid
training of complex robotic tasks. A key challenge lies in computing
state-action log-likelihoods under diffusion policies, which is straightforward
for Gaussian policies but intractable for flow-based models due to irreversible
forward-reverse processes and discretization errors (e.g., Euler-Maruyama
approximations). To bridge this gap, we propose GenPO, a generative policy
optimization framework that leverages exact diffusion inversion to construct
invertible action mappings. GenPO introduces a novel doubled dummy action
mechanism that enables invertibility via alternating updates, resolving
log-likelihood computation barriers. Furthermore, we also use the action
log-likelihood for unbiased entropy and KL divergence estimation, enabling
KL-adaptive learning rates and entropy regularization in on-policy updates.
Extensive experiments on eight IsaacLab benchmarks, including legged locomotion
(Ant, Humanoid, Anymal-D, Unitree H1, Go2), dexterous manipulation (Shadow
Hand), aerial control (Quadcopter), and robotic arm tasks (Franka), demonstrate
GenPO's superiority over existing RL baselines. Notably, GenPO is the first
method to successfully integrate diffusion policies into on-policy RL,
unlocking their potential for large-scale parallelized training and real-world
robotic deployment.

Conclusion: MWGraD为解决多目标分布优化问题提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: We address the optimization problem of simultaneously minimizing multiple
objective functionals over a family of probability distributions. This type of
Multi-Objective Distributional Optimization commonly arises in machine learning
and statistics, with applications in areas such as multiple target sampling,
multi-task learning, and multi-objective generative modeling. To solve this
problem, we propose an iterative particle-based algorithm, which we call
Muliple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD), which constructs a flow of
intermediate empirical distributions, each being represented by a set of
particles, which gradually minimize the multiple objective functionals
simultaneously. Specifically, MWGraD consists of two key steps at each
iteration. First, it estimates the Wasserstein gradient for each objective
functional based on the current particles. Then, it aggregates these gradients
into a single Wasserstein gradient using dynamically adjusted weights and
updates the particles accordingly. In addition, we provide theoretical analysis
and present experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of MWGraD.

Result: 在8个GPU上，HD-PiSSA的有效更新秩比数据并行LoRA或PiSSA高16倍以上，多任务学习平均提升10.0绝对点。

Conclusion: HD-PiSSA通过额外优化灵活性显著提升了性能，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for large language
models (LLMs), such as LoRA and PiSSA, constrain model updates to low-rank
subspaces, limiting their expressiveness and leading to suboptimal performance
on complex tasks. To address this, we introduce High-rank Distributed PiSSA
(HD-PiSSA), a distributed PEFT approach that initializes orthogonal adapters
across different devices and aggregates their delta updates collectively on W
for fine-tuning. Unlike Data Parallel LoRA or PiSSA, which maintain identical
adapters across all devices, HD-PiSSA assigns different principal components of
the pre-trained weights to each GPU, significantly expanding the range of
update directions. This results in over 16x higher effective updated ranks than
data-parallel LoRA or PiSSA when fine-tuning on 8 GPUs with the same per-device
adapter rank. Empirically, we evaluate HD-PiSSA across various challenging
downstream tasks, including mathematics, code generation, and multi-task
learning. In the multi-task setting, HD-PiSSA achieves average gains of 10.0
absolute points (14.63%) over LoRA and 4.98 points (6.60%) over PiSSA across 12
benchmarks, demonstrating its benefits from the extra optimization flexibility.

Abstract: The very challenging task of learning solution operators of PDEs on arbitrary
domains accurately and efficiently is of vital importance to engineering and
industrial simulations. Despite the existence of many operator learning
algorithms to approximate such PDEs, we find that accurate models are not
necessarily computationally efficient and vice versa. We address this issue by
proposing a geometry aware operator transformer (GAOT) for learning PDEs on
arbitrary domains. GAOT combines novel multiscale attentional graph neural
operator encoders and decoders, together with geometry embeddings and (vision)
transformer processors to accurately map information about the domain and the
inputs into a robust approximation of the PDE solution. Multiple innovations in
the implementation of GAOT also ensure computational efficiency and
scalability. We demonstrate this significant gain in both accuracy and
efficiency of GAOT over several baselines on a large number of learning tasks
from a diverse set of PDEs, including achieving state of the art performance on
a large scale three-dimensional industrial CFD dataset.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, as a post-hoc processing technique, has gained widespread
adoption in addressing challenges like bias mitigation and robustness
enhancement, colloquially, machine unlearning for fairness and robustness.
However, existing non-privacy unlearning-based solutions persist in using
binary data removal framework designed for privacy-driven motivation, leading
to significant information loss, a phenomenon known as over-unlearning. While
over-unlearning has been largely described in many studies as primarily causing
utility degradation, we investigate its fundamental causes and provide deeper
insights in this work through counterfactual leave-one-out analysis. In this
paper, we introduce a weighted influence function that assigns tailored weights
to each sample by solving a convex quadratic programming problem analytically.
Building on this, we propose a soft-weighted framework enabling fine-grained
model adjustments to address the over-unlearning challenge. We demonstrate that
the proposed soft-weighted scheme is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated
into most existing unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments show that in
fairness- and robustness-driven tasks, the soft-weighted scheme significantly
outperforms hard-weighted schemes in fairness/robustness metrics and alleviates
the decline in utility metric, thereby enhancing machine unlearning algorithm
as an effective correction solution.

Result: 实验表明，基于实例的隐私损失与现有数据难度指标相关，并能识别更难的数据点组。

Conclusion: 研究为针对单个数据点特性的高效自适应遗忘策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present a principled, per-instance approach to quantifying the difficulty
of unlearning via fine-tuning. We begin by sharpening an analysis of noisy
gradient descent for unlearning (Chien et al., 2024), obtaining a better
utility-unlearning tradeoff by replacing worst-case privacy loss bounds with
per-instance privacy losses (Thudi et al., 2024), each of which bounds the
(Renyi) divergence to retraining without an individual data point. To
demonstrate the practical applicability of our theory, we present empirical
results showing that our theoretical predictions are born out both for
Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) as well as for standard
fine-tuning without explicit noise. We further demonstrate that per-instance
privacy losses correlate well with several existing data difficulty metrics,
while also identifying harder groups of data points, and introduce novel
evaluation methods based on loss barriers. All together, our findings provide a
foundation for more efficient and adaptive unlearning strategies tailored to
the unique properties of individual data points.

Abstract: The explicit governing equation is one of the simplest and most intuitive
forms for characterizing physical laws. However, directly discovering partial
differential equations (PDEs) from data poses significant challenges, primarily
in determining relevant terms from a vast search space. Symmetry, as a crucial
prior knowledge in scientific fields, has been widely applied in tasks such as
designing equivariant networks and guiding neural PDE solvers. In this paper,
we propose a pipeline for governing equation discovery based on differential
invariants, which can losslessly reduce the search space of existing equation
discovery methods while strictly adhering to symmetry. Specifically, we compute
the set of differential invariants corresponding to the infinitesimal
generators of the symmetry group and select them as the relevant terms for
equation discovery. Taking DI-SINDy (SINDy based on Differential Invariants) as
an example, we demonstrate that its success rate and accuracy in PDE discovery
surpass those of other symmetry-informed governing equation discovery methods
across a series of PDEs.

Abstract: Building on the framework proposed in Boffi et al. (2024), we present a
systematic approach for learning flow maps associated with flow and diffusion
models. Flow map-based models, commonly known as consistency models, encompass
recent efforts to improve the efficiency of generative models based on
solutions to differential equations. By exploiting a relationship between the
velocity field underlying a continuous-time flow and the instantaneous rate of
change of the flow map, we show how to convert existing distillation schemes
into direct training algorithms via self-distillation, eliminating the need for
pre-trained models. We empirically evaluate several instantiations of our
framework, finding that high-dimensional tasks like image synthesis benefit
from objective functions that avoid temporal and spatial derivatives of the
flow map, while lower-dimensional tasks can benefit from objectives
incorporating higher-order derivatives to capture sharp features.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the Pandora's Box problem in an online learning setting with
semi-bandit feedback. In each round, the learner sequentially pays to open up
to $n$ boxes with unknown reward distributions, observes rewards upon opening,
and decides when to stop. The utility of the learner is the maximum observed
reward minus the cumulative cost of opened boxes, and the goal is to minimize
regret defined as the gap between the cumulative expected utility and that of
the optimal policy. We propose a new algorithm that achieves
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{nT})$ regret after $T$ rounds, which improves the
$\widetilde{O}(n\sqrt{T})$ bound of Agarwal et al. [2024] and matches the known
lower bound up to logarithmic factors. To better capture real-life
applications, we then extend our results to a natural but challenging
contextual linear setting, where each box's expected reward is linear in some
known but time-varying $d$-dimensional context and the noise distribution is
fixed over time. We design an algorithm that learns both the linear function
and the noise distributions, achieving $\widetilde{O}(nd\sqrt{T})$ regret.
Finally, we show that our techniques also apply to the online Prophet
Inequality problem, where the learner must decide immediately whether or not to
accept a revealed reward. In both non-contextual and contextual settings, our
approach achieves similar improvements and regret bounds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法在训练过程中存在LLD现象，即正确回答的似然性仅微弱增加甚至下降，影响了模型性能。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，NTHR有效缓解了LLD，模型性能从0.5B到3B参数均显著提升。

Conclusion: NTHR通过优化惩罚机制解决了GRPO中的LLD问题，为强化学习在LLMs中的应用提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become popular in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) emerging as a widely used algorithm in recent systems.
Despite GRPO's widespread adoption, we identify a previously unrecognized
phenomenon we term Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), wherein the likelihood
of correct responses marginally increases or even decreases during training.
This behavior mirrors a recently discovered misalignment issue in Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), attributed to the influence of negative
gradients. We provide a theoretical analysis of GRPO's learning dynamic,
identifying the source of LLD as the naive penalization of all tokens in
incorrect responses with the same strength. To address this, we develop a
method called NTHR, which downweights penalties on tokens contributing to the
LLD. Unlike prior DPO-based approaches, NTHR takes advantage of GRPO's
group-based structure, using correct responses as anchors to identify
influential tokens. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
NTHR effectively mitigates LLD, yielding consistent performance gains across
models ranging from 0.5B to 3B parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索用户移动性对DFL性能的影响，以促进通信和模型收敛。

Method: 提出分布感知的移动策略，利用数据分布和静态客户端位置信息优化移动路径。

Result: 实验验证移动性对DFL的积极影响，且提出的移动策略优于随机移动。

Conclusion: 移动性可有效缓解数据异构性并加速学习收敛，分布感知策略更具优势。

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) has attracted significant attention
due to its scalability and independence from a central server. In practice,
some participating clients can be mobile, yet the impact of user mobility on
DFL performance remains largely unexplored, despite its potential to facilitate
communication and model convergence. In this work, we demonstrate that
introducing a small fraction of mobile clients, even with random movement, can
significantly improve the accuracy of DFL by facilitating information flow. To
further enhance performance, we propose novel distribution-aware mobility
patterns, where mobile clients strategically navigate the network, leveraging
knowledge of data distributions and static client locations. The proposed
moving strategies mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity and boost learning
convergence. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of induced
mobility in DFL and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed mobility
patterns over random movement.

TLDR: RefLoRA改进LoRA的低秩适应方法，通过优化低秩分解提升收敛速度和性能，实验验证其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在微调大模型时存在收敛慢和性能下降问题，原因是其低秩分解导致权重更新不一致和不平衡。

Method: 提出RefLoRA方法，通过每步优化低秩分解以最小化损失上界，实现更平坦的损失景观和稳定的权重更新。

Result: 实验表明RefLoRA在自然语言理解和常识推理任务中收敛更快，性能优于基准方法，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: RefLoRA解决了LoRA的局限性，显著提升了低秩适应的效率和性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) lowers the computational and memory overhead of
fine-tuning large models by updating a low-dimensional subspace of the
pre-trained weight matrix. Albeit efficient, LoRA exhibits suboptimal
convergence and noticeable performance degradation, due to inconsistent and
imbalanced weight updates induced by its nonunique low-rank factorizations. To
overcome these limitations, this article identifies the optimal low-rank
factorization per step that minimizes an upper bound on the loss. The resultant
refactored low-rank adaptation (RefLoRA) method promotes a flatter loss
landscape, along with consistent and balanced weight updates, thus speeding up
stable convergence. Extensive experiments evaluate RefLoRA on natural language
understanding, and commonsense reasoning tasks with popular large language
models including DeBERTaV3, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B. The numerical
tests corroborate that RefLoRA converges faster, outperforms various
benchmarks, and enjoys negligible computational overhead compared to
state-of-the-art LoRA variants.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: PGMs是一种新的掩码生成建模方法，通过将令牌分为两组并使用稀疏注意力模式，避免了传统方法中MASK令牌的低效处理，显著提升了计算效率和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码生成建模（MGM）在处理MASK令牌时效率低下，PGMs旨在通过分区策略消除对MASK令牌的需求，提升计算效率和生成性能。

Method: PGMs将令牌分为两组，采用稀疏注意力模式防止跨组信息交换，仅基于一组信息预测另一组令牌。

Result: 在OpenWebText上的实验表明，PGMs在延迟和吞吐量上比MDLM提升至少5倍，同时生成样本的困惑度更低。

Conclusion: PGMs不仅显著提升了计算效率和生成质量，还能通过SDTT方法进一步优化推理性能。

Abstract: We introduce ``Partition Generative Models'' (PGMs), a novel approach to
masked generative modeling (MGMs), particularly effective for masked diffusion
language modeling (MDLMs). PGM divides tokens into two distinct groups and
employs sparse attention patterns to prevent cross-group information exchange.
Hence, the model is trained to predict tokens in one group based solely on
information from the other group. This partitioning strategy eliminates the
need for MASK tokens entirely. While traditional MGMs inefficiently process
MASK tokens during generation, PGMs achieve greater computational efficiency by
operating exclusively on unmasked tokens. Our experiments on OpenWebText with a
context length of 1024 tokens demonstrate that PGMs deliver at least 5x
improvements in both latency and throughput compared to MDLM when using the
same number of sampling steps, while generating samples with better generative
perplexity than MDLM. Finally, we show that PGMs can be distilled with
Self-Distillation Through Time (SDTT), a method originally devised for MDLM, in
order to achieve further inference gains.

Motivation: 现有对抗微调方法存在不稳定性和鲁棒性与准确性之间的权衡问题，限制了性能优化。

Method: 提出LORE框架，利用约束优化和嵌入空间邻近约束，平衡鲁棒性和清洁数据性能。

Result: 实验表明LORE显著提升零样本对抗鲁棒性，同时最小化清洁数据准确性损失。

Conclusion: LORE为对抗微调提供了一种有效方法，同时提升了分布外泛化能力和嵌入可解释性。

Abstract: Visual encoders have become fundamental components in modern computer vision
pipelines. However, ensuring robustness against adversarial perturbations
remains a critical challenge. Recent efforts have explored both supervised and
unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning strategies. We identify two key
limitations in these approaches: (i) they often suffer from instability,
especially during the early stages of fine-tuning, resulting in suboptimal
convergence and degraded performance on clean data, and (ii) they exhibit a
suboptimal trade-off between robustness and clean data accuracy, hindering the
simultaneous optimization of both objectives. To overcome these challenges, we
propose Lagrangian-Optimized Robust Embeddings (LORE), a novel unsupervised
adversarial fine-tuning framework. LORE utilizes constrained optimization,
which offers a principled approach to balancing competing goals, such as
improving robustness while preserving nominal performance. By enforcing
embedding-space proximity constraints, LORE effectively maintains clean data
performance throughout adversarial fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that
LORE significantly improves zero-shot adversarial robustness with minimal
degradation in clean data accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the adversarially fine-tuned CLIP image encoder in
out-of-distribution generalization and enhancing the interpretability of image
embeddings.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于核函数的零阶优化框架（KerZOO），用于减少大语言模型（LLM）微调中的梯度估计偏差，显著提升收敛速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统一阶微调方法内存需求高，而零阶优化（ZO）虽内存高效，但存在梯度估计偏差问题，影响收敛速度。

Method: 通过数学物理工具分析ZO梯度估计中的低阶偏差，提出基于核函数的ZO框架（KerZOO）以减少偏差并提升稳定性。

Result: KerZOO在LLM微调中表现优于现有ZO基线，减少迭代次数，GPU训练时间显著降低（如WSC数据集减少74%），准确率提升（如超过MeZO基线2.9%）。

Conclusion: 核函数是减少ZO方法估计偏差的有效途径，KerZOO在性能和效率上均表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
numerous NLP tasks. Nevertheless, conventional first-order fine-tuning
techniques impose heavy memory demands, creating practical obstacles to
real-world applications. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has recently emerged as
a promising memory-efficient alternative, as it circumvents the need for
backpropagation by estimating gradients solely through forward passes--making
it particularly suitable for resource-limited environments. Despite its
efficiency, ZO optimization suffers from gradient estimation bias, which
significantly hinders convergence speed. To address this, we analytically
identify and characterize the lower-order bias introduced during ZO-based
gradient estimation in LLM fine-tuning. Motivated by tools in mathematical
physics, we introduce a kernel-function-based ZO framework aimed at mitigating
this bias and improving optimization stability. KerZOO achieves comparable or
superior performance to existing ZO baselines in both full-parameter and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning settings of LLMs, while significantly reducing
the number of iterations required to reach convergence. For example, KerZOO
reduces total GPU training hours by as much as 74% and 44% on WSC and MultiRC
datasets in fine-tuning OPT-2.7B model and can exceed the MeZO baseline by 2.9%
and 2.6% in accuracy. We show that the kernel function is an effective avenue
for reducing estimation bias in ZO methods.

Motivation: 药物-靶点相互作用预测的机器学习模型需要提供可靠的预测不确定性，但传统方法忽略了药物和蛋白质子群的变异性。

Method: 分析了三种基于聚类的条件CP方法（非共形性得分、特征相似性和最近邻聚类），并与传统方法进行对比。

Result: 实验表明，基于非共形性得分的聚类方法在随机和完全未见的数据分割中表现最优，提供最紧密的预测区间和最可靠的子群覆盖。

Conclusion: 基于聚类的CP方法在不确定性条件下显著提升了DTI预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction with machine learning
models is essential for drug discovery. Such models should also provide a
credible representation of their uncertainty, but applying classical marginal
conformal prediction (CP) in DTI prediction often overlooks variability across
drug and protein subgroups. In this work, we analyze three cluster-conditioned
CP methods for DTI prediction, and compare them with marginal and
group-conditioned CP. Clusterings are obtained via nonconformity scores,
feature similarity, and nearest neighbors, respectively. Experiments on the
KIBA dataset using four data-splitting strategies show that nonconformity-based
clustering yields the tightest intervals and most reliable subgroup coverage,
especially in random and fully unseen drug-protein splits. Group-conditioned CP
works well when one entity is familiar, but residual-driven clustering provides
robust uncertainty estimates even in sparse or novel scenarios. These results
highlight the potential of cluster-based CP for improving DTI prediction under
uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型选择方法通常忽视价格差异，导致成本增加和潜在性能下降。

Method: PromptWise优先查询低成本模型，仅在必要时转向高价模型。

Result: 实验表明，PromptWise在多种任务中优于不考虑成本的基线方法。

Conclusion: PromptWise证明在保持性能的同时显著降低成本，优于直接选择高价模型的方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models has provided users with
numerous options to address their prompts. When selecting a generative AI model
for a given prompt, users should consider not only the performance of the
chosen model but also its associated service cost. The principle guiding such
consideration is to select the least expensive model among the available
satisfactory options. However, existing model-selection approaches typically
prioritize performance, overlooking pricing differences between models. In this
paper, we introduce PromptWise, an online learning framework designed to assign
a sequence of prompts to a group of large language models (LLMs) in a
cost-effective manner. PromptWise strategically queries cheaper models first,
progressing to more expensive options only if the lower-cost models fail to
adequately address a given prompt. Through numerical experiments, we
demonstrate PromptWise's effectiveness across various tasks, including puzzles
of varying complexity and code generation/translation tasks. The results
highlight that PromptWise consistently outperforms cost-unaware baseline
methods, emphasizing that directly assigning prompts to the most expensive
models can lead to higher costs and potentially lower average performance.

Method: 分析RL目标的影响，提出behavior injection数据增强方法。

Result: behavior injection显著提升RFT性能。

Conclusion: behavior injection是一种有效的任务无关数据增强方法，能显著提升RFT效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has emerged as a powerful post-training
technique to incentivize the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs).
However, LLMs can respond very inconsistently to RFT: some show substantial
performance gains, while others plateau or even degrade. To understand this
divergence, we analyze the per-step influence of the RL objective and identify
two key conditions for effective post-training: (1) RL-informative rollout
accuracy, and (2) strong data co-influence, which quantifies how much the
training data affects performance on other samples. Guided by these insights,
we propose behavior injection, a task-agnostic data-augmentation scheme applied
prior to RL. Behavior injection enriches the supervised finetuning (SFT) data
by seeding exploratory and exploitative behaviors, effectively making the model
more RL-ready. We evaluate our method across two reasoning benchmarks with
multiple base models. The results demonstrate that our theoretically motivated
augmentation can significantly increases the performance gain from RFT over the
pre-RL model.

Method: 通过构建图结构处理不规则采样点，结合注意力增强的GNN和傅里叶编码器，提升模型表达能力。

Result: 在多种2D PDE问题（如Darcy Flow、Advection等）上表现优异，尤其在数据稀缺情况下。

Conclusion: GOLA框架在不规则域上具有强泛化能力和高效性，为算子学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Operator learning seeks to approximate mappings from input functions to
output solutions, particularly in the context of partial differential equations
(PDEs). While recent advances such as DeepONet and Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) have demonstrated strong performance, they often rely on regular grid
discretizations, limiting their applicability to complex or irregular domains.
In this work, we propose a Graph-based Operator Learning with Attention (GOLA)
framework that addresses this limitation by constructing graphs from
irregularly sampled spatial points and leveraging attention-enhanced Graph
Neural Netwoks (GNNs) to model spatial dependencies with global information. To
improve the expressive capacity, we introduce a Fourier-based encoder that
projects input functions into a frequency space using learnable complex
coefficients, allowing for flexible embeddings even with sparse or nonuniform
samples. We evaluated our approach across a range of 2D PDEs, including Darcy
Flow, Advection, Eikonal, and Nonlinear Diffusion, under varying sampling
densities. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, particularly in
data-scarce regimes, demonstrating strong generalization and efficiency on
irregular domains.

Abstract: We propose a neural physics system for real-time, interactive fluid
simulations. Traditional physics-based methods, while accurate, are
computationally intensive and suffer from latency issues. Recent
machine-learning methods reduce computational costs while preserving fidelity;
yet most still fail to satisfy the latency constraints for real-time use and
lack support for interactive applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
novel hybrid method that integrates numerical simulation, neural physics, and
generative control. Our neural physics jointly pursues low-latency simulation
and high physical fidelity by employing a fallback safeguard to classical
numerical solvers. Furthermore, we develop a diffusion-based controller that is
trained using a reverse modeling strategy to generate external dynamic force
fields for fluid manipulation. Our system demonstrates robust performance
across diverse 2D/3D scenarios, material types, and obstacle interactions,
achieving real-time simulations at high frame rates (11~29% latency) while
enabling fluid control guided by user-friendly freehand sketches. We present a
significant step towards practical, controllable, and physically plausible
fluid simulations for real-time interactive applications. We promise to release
both models and data upon acceptance.

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) in heterogeneous networks presents unique
challenges due to node and edge heterogeneity. Existing Graph Neural Network
(GNN) methods primarily focus on homogeneous GAD and thus fail to address three
key issues: (C1) Capturing abnormal signal and rich semantics across diverse
meta-paths; (C2) Retaining high-frequency content in HIN dimension alignment;
and (C3) Learning effectively from difficult anomaly samples with class
imbalance. To overcome these, we propose ChiGAD, a spectral GNN framework based
on a novel Chi-Square filter, inspired by the wavelet effectiveness in diverse
domains. Specifically, ChiGAD consists of: (1) Multi-Graph Chi-Square Filter,
which captures anomalous information via applying dedicated Chi-Square filters
to each meta-path graph; (2) Interactive Meta-Graph Convolution, which aligns
features while preserving high-frequency information and incorporates
heterogeneous messages by a unified Chi-Square Filter; and (3)
Contribution-Informed Cross-Entropy Loss, which prioritizes difficult anomalies
to address class imbalance. Extensive experiments on public and industrial
datasets show that ChiGAD outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple
metrics. Additionally, its homogeneous variant, ChiGNN, excels on seven GAD
datasets, validating the effectiveness of Chi-Square filters. Our code is

Conclusion: 填充和循环是并行化扩展Transformer能力的有效方法，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Chain of thought is a natural inference-time method for increasing the
computational power of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), but
comes at the cost of sequential decoding. Are there more efficient alternatives
to expand a transformer's expressive power without adding parameters? We
consider transformers with padding tokens as a form of parallelizable test-time
compute. We show that averaging-hard-attention, masked-pre-norm transformers
with polynomial padding converge to precisely the class $\mathsf{TC}^0$ of
extremely parallelizable problems. While the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ upper bound was
known, proving a matching lower bound had been elusive. Further, our novel
analysis reveals the precise expanded power of padded transformers when coupled
with another form of inference-time compute, namely dynamically increasing
depth via looping. Our core technical contribution is to show how padding helps
bring the notions of complete problems and reductions, which have been a
cornerstone of classical complexity theory, to the formal study of
transformers. Armed with this new tool, we prove that padded transformers with
$O(\log^d n)$ looping on inputs of length $n$ recognize exactly the class
$\mathsf{TC}^d$ of moderately parallelizable problems. Thus, padding and
looping together systematically expand transformers' expressive power: with
polylogarithmic looping, padded transformers converge to the class
$\mathsf{NC}$, the best that could be expected without losing parallelism
(unless $\mathsf{NC} = \mathsf{P}$). Our results thus motivate further
exploration of padding and looping as parallelizable alternatives to chain of
thought.

optimization is constrained to achieve near-optimality within a confidence set
for preference alignment. For preference data construction, we explore both
offline and online preference-based KD. Additionally, we reformulate the RM
using the $Q$-value function and extend the framework to white-box KD, where
the teacher policy's predicted probabilities are accessible. Theoretical

Conclusion: ProDVa通过结合天然蛋白质片段，有效解决了生成蛋白质的结构合理性问题，为功能导向的蛋白质设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Protein design is a fundamental challenge in biotechnology, aiming to design
novel sequences with specific functions within the vast space of possible
proteins. Recent advances in deep generative models have enabled function-based
protein design from textual descriptions, yet struggle with structural
plausibility. Inspired by classical protein design methods that leverage
natural protein structures, we explore whether incorporating fragments from
natural proteins can enhance foldability in generative models. Our empirical
results show that even random incorporation of fragments improves foldability.
Building on this insight, we introduce ProDVa, a novel protein design approach
that integrates a text encoder for functional descriptions, a protein language
model for designing proteins, and a fragment encoder to dynamically retrieve
protein fragments based on textual functional descriptions. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach effectively designs protein sequences
that are both functionally aligned and structurally plausible. Compared to
state-of-the-art models, ProDVa achieves comparable function alignment using
less than 0.04% of the training data, while designing significantly more
well-folded proteins, with the proportion of proteins having pLDDT above 70
increasing by 7.38% and those with PAE below 10 increasing by 9.6%.

Abstract: Gradient-based data attribution methods, such as influence functions, are

*Zixuan Chen,Hao Lin,Ke Xu,Xinghao Jiang,Tanfeng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: GhostPrompt是一个自动化框架，通过动态提示优化和多模态反馈绕过现代文本和图像安全过滤器，显著提高了绕过率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效绕过现代安全过滤器，需要一种更高效的方法来揭示多模态防御的系统性漏洞。

Method: 结合动态优化和自适应安全指示注入，利用LLM和CLIP相似度生成对抗性提示，并通过强化学习注入视觉线索。

Result: GhostPrompt将ShieldLM-7B的绕过率从12.5%提升至99.0%，CLIP分数从0.2637提高到0.2762，时间成本降低4.2倍。

Conclusion: GhostPrompt揭示了当前多模态防御的系统性漏洞，为AI安全和红队研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models can inadvertently produce
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, prompting the integration of text and image
safety filters. Recent advances employ large language models (LLMs) for
semantic-level detection, rendering traditional token-level perturbation
attacks largely ineffective. However, our evaluation shows that existing
jailbreak methods are ineffective against these modern filters. We introduce
GhostPrompt, the first automated jailbreak framework that combines dynamic
prompt optimization with multimodal feedback. It consists of two key
components: (i) Dynamic Optimization, an iterative process that guides a large
language model (LLM) using feedback from text safety filters and CLIP
similarity scores to generate semantically aligned adversarial prompts; and
(ii) Adaptive Safety Indicator Injection, which formulates the injection of
benign visual cues as a reinforcement learning problem to bypass image-level
filters. GhostPrompt achieves state-of-the-art performance, increasing the
ShieldLM-7B bypass rate from 12.5\% (Sneakyprompt) to 99.0\%, improving CLIP
score from 0.2637 to 0.2762, and reducing the time cost by $4.2 \times$.
Moreover, it generalizes to unseen filters including GPT-4.1 and successfully
jailbreaks DALLE 3 to generate NSFW images in our evaluation, revealing
systemic vulnerabilities in current multimodal defenses. To support further
research on AI safety and red-teaming, we will release code and adversarial
prompts under a controlled-access protocol.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的数据异构性（客户端间标签偏好偏差）影响模型收敛和性能，现有方法忽视客户端内类别结构信息。

Method: FedSKC方法包括局部对比学习、全局差异聚合和全局周期性审查，以解决局部、全局和采样漂移问题。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明FedSKC在非凸目标下表现优越。

Conclusion: FedSKC通过结构知识协作有效解决了数据异构性问题，提升了联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: With the advancement of edge computing, federated learning (FL) displays a
bright promise as a privacy-preserving collaborative learning paradigm.
However, one major challenge for FL is the data heterogeneity issue, which
refers to the biased labeling preferences among multiple clients, negatively
impacting convergence and model performance. Most previous FL methods attempt
to tackle the data heterogeneity issue locally or globally, neglecting
underlying class-wise structure information contained in each client. In this
paper, we first study how data heterogeneity affects the divergence of the
model and decompose it into local, global, and sampling drift sub-problems. To
explore the potential of using intra-client class-wise structural knowledge in
handling these drifts, we thus propose Federated Learning with Structural
Knowledge Collaboration (FedSKC). The key idea of FedSKC is to extract and
transfer domain preferences from inter-client data distributions, offering
diverse class-relevant knowledge and a fair convergent signal. FedSKC comprises
three components: i) local contrastive learning, to prevent weight divergence
resulting from local training; ii) global discrepancy aggregation, which
addresses the parameter deviation between the server and clients; iii) global
period review, correcting for the sampling drift introduced by the server
randomly selecting devices. We have theoretically analyzed FedSKC under
non-convex objectives and empirically validated its superiority through
extensive experimental results.

Result: 在38个下游任务中，AmorLIP零样本分类和检索性能显著优于标准CLIP，相对提升高达12.24%。

Conclusion: AmorLIP通过高效分摊计算，解决了CLIP训练中的资源瓶颈，同时提升性能。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong
zero-shot performance across diverse downstream text-image tasks. Existing CLIP
methods typically optimize a contrastive objective using negative samples drawn
from each minibatch. To achieve robust representation learning, these methods
require extremely large batch sizes and escalate computational demands to
hundreds or even thousands of GPUs. Prior approaches to mitigate this issue
often compromise downstream performance, prolong training duration, or face
scalability challenges with very large datasets. To overcome these limitations,
we propose AmorLIP, an efficient CLIP pretraining framework that amortizes
expensive computations involved in contrastive learning through lightweight
neural networks, which substantially improves training efficiency and
performance. Leveraging insights from a spectral factorization of energy-based
models, we introduce novel amortization objectives along with practical
techniques to improve training stability. Extensive experiments across 38
downstream tasks demonstrate the superior zero-shot classification and
retrieval capabilities of AmorLIP, consistently outperforming standard CLIP
baselines with substantial relative improvements of up to 12.24%.

Abstract: While diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation with
their ability to synthesize realistic and diverse scenes, they continue to
struggle to generate consistent and legible text within images. This
shortcoming is commonly attributed to the locality bias inherent in
diffusion-based generation, which limits their ability to model long-range
spatial dependencies. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{STRICT}$, a
benchmark designed to systematically stress-test the ability of diffusion
models to render coherent and instruction-aligned text in images. Our benchmark
evaluates models across multiple dimensions: (1) the maximum length of readable
text that can be generated; (2) the correctness and legibility of the generated
text, and (3) the ratio of not following instructions for generating text. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models, including proprietary and open-source
variants, and reveal persistent limitations in long-range consistency and
instruction-following capabilities. Our findings provide insights into
architectural bottlenecks and motivate future research directions in multimodal
generative modeling. We release our entire evaluation pipeline at

Abstract: Hybrid neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) integrate
mechanistic models with neural ODEs, offering strong inductive bias and
flexibility, and are particularly advantageous in data-scarce healthcare
settings. However, excessive latent states and interactions from mechanistic
models can lead to training inefficiency and over-fitting, limiting practical
effectiveness of hybrid neural ODEs. In response, we propose a new hybrid
pipeline for automatic state selection and structure optimization in
mechanistic neural ODEs, combining domain-informed graph modifications with
data-driven regularization to sparsify the model for improving predictive
performance and stability while retaining mechanistic plausibility. Experiments
on synthetic and real-world data show improved predictive performance and
robustness with desired sparsity, establishing an effective solution for hybrid
model reduction in healthcare applications.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效利用未标记数据，简化学习过程，且适用性广泛，为离线强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an optimal policy from
pre-collected data. However, it faces challenges of distributional shift, where
the learned policy may encounter unseen scenarios not covered in the offline
data. Additionally, numerous applications suffer from a scarcity of labeled
reward data. Relying on labeled data alone often leads to a narrow state-action
distribution, further amplifying the distributional shift, and resulting in
suboptimal policy learning. To address these issues, we first recognize that
the volume of unlabeled data is typically substantially larger than that of
labeled data. We then propose a semi-pessimistic RL method to effectively
leverage abundant unlabeled data. Our approach offers several advantages. It
considerably simplifies the learning process, as it seeks a lower bound of the
reward function, rather than that of the Q-function or state transition
function. It is highly flexible, and can be integrated with a range of
model-free and model-based RL algorithms. It enjoys the guaranteed improvement
when utilizing vast unlabeled data, but requires much less restrictive
conditions. We compare our method with a number of alternative solutions, both
analytically and numerically, and demonstrate its clear competitiveness. We
further illustrate with an application to adaptive deep brain stimulation for
Parkinson's disease.

Result: 实验表明，FGSV在计算效率和近似准确性上显著优于现有方法，且能确保组级估值的公正性。

Conclusion: FGSV为组级数据估值提供了一种高效、准确且抗攻击的解决方案。

Abstract: Data Shapley is an important tool for data valuation, which quantifies the
contribution of individual data points to machine learning models. In practice,
group-level data valuation is desirable when data providers contribute data in
batch. However, we identify that existing group-level extensions of Data
Shapley are vulnerable to shell company attacks, where strategic group
splitting can unfairly inflate valuations. We propose Faithful Group Shapley
Value (FGSV) that uniquely defends against such attacks. Building on original
mathematical insights, we develop a provably fast and accurate approximation
algorithm for computing FGSV. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our
algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational
efficiency and approximation accuracy, while ensuring faithful group-level
valuation.

Conclusion: ECBind填补了电子结构在结合预测中的研究空白，为生物调控和信号转导机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: The affinity and specificity of protein-molecule binding directly impact
functional outcomes, uncovering the mechanisms underlying biological regulation
and signal transduction. Most deep-learning-based prediction approaches focus
on structures of atoms or fragments. However, quantum chemical properties, such
as electronic structures, are the key to unveiling interaction patterns but
remain largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose ECBind, a method
for tokenizing electron cloud signals into quantized embeddings, enabling their
integration into downstream tasks such as binding affinity prediction. By
incorporating electron densities, ECBind helps uncover binding modes that
cannot be fully represented by atom-level models. Specifically, to remove the
redundancy inherent in electron cloud signals, a structure-aware transformer
and hierarchical codebooks encode 3D binding sites enriched with electron
structures into tokens. These tokenized codes are then used for specific tasks
with labels. To extend its applicability to a wider range of scenarios, we
utilize knowledge distillation to develop an electron-cloud-agnostic prediction
model. Experimentally, ECBind demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across
multiple tasks, achieving improvements of 6.42\% and 15.58\% in per-structure
Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, respectively.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了核模型潜在的隐私问题，需引起重视。

Abstract: Over-parameterized models have raised concerns about their potential to
memorize training data, even when achieving strong generalization. The privacy
implications of such memorization are generally unclear, particularly in
scenarios where only model outputs are accessible. We study this question in
the context of kernel methods, and demonstrate both empirically and
theoretically that querying kernel models at various points suffices to
reconstruct their training data, even without access to model parameters. Our
results hold for a range of kernel methods, including kernel regression,
support vector machines, and kernel density estimation. Our hope is that this
work can illuminate potential privacy concerns for such models.

Conclusion: PiNGDA通过科学噪声分析生成可靠增强，提升了图对比学习的性能。

Abstract: Although graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been widely investigated, it is
still a challenge to generate effective and stable graph augmentations.
Existing methods often apply heuristic augmentation like random edge dropping,
which may disrupt important graph structures and result in unstable GCL
performance. In this paper, we propose Positive-incentive Noise driven Graph
Data Augmentation (PiNGDA), where positive-incentive noise (pi-noise)
scientifically analyzes the beneficial effect of noise under the information
theory. To bridge the standard GCL and pi-noise framework, we design a Gaussian
auxiliary variable to convert the loss function to information entropy. We
prove that the standard GCL with pre-defined augmentations is equivalent to
estimate the beneficial noise via the point estimation. Following our analysis,
PiNGDA is derived from learning the beneficial noise on both topology and
attributes through a trainable noise generator for graph augmentations, instead
of the simple estimation. Since the generator learns how to produce beneficial
perturbations on graph topology and node attributes, PiNGDA is more reliable
compared with the existing methods. Extensive experimental results validate the
effectiveness and stability of PiNGDA.

Conclusion: Turb-L1有效克服光谱偏差，显著提升长期湍流预测的保真度和物理真实性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the long-term evolution of turbulence is crucial for
advancing scientific understanding and optimizing engineering applications.
However, existing deep learning methods face significant bottlenecks in
long-term autoregressive prediction, which exhibit excessive smoothing and fail
to accurately track complex fluid dynamics. Our extensive experimental and
spectral analysis of prevailing methods provides an interpretable explanation
for this shortcoming, identifying Spectral Bias as the core obstacle.
Concretely, spectral bias is the inherent tendency of models to favor
low-frequency, smooth features while overlooking critical high-frequency
details during training, thus reducing fidelity and causing physical
distortions in long-term predictions. Building on this insight, we propose
Turb-L1, an innovative turbulence prediction method, which utilizes a
Hierarchical Dynamics Synthesis mechanism within a multi-grid architecture to
explicitly overcome spectral bias. It accurately captures cross-scale
interactions and preserves the fidelity of high-frequency dynamics, enabling
reliable long-term tracking of turbulence evolution. Extensive experiments on
the 2D turbulence benchmark show that Turb-L1 demonstrates excellent
performance: (I) In long-term predictions, it reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE)
by $80.3\%$ and increases Structural Similarity (SSIM) by over $9\times$
compared to the SOTA baseline, significantly improving prediction fidelity.
(II) It effectively overcomes spectral bias, accurately reproducing the full
enstrophy spectrum and maintaining physical realism in high-wavenumber regions,
thus avoiding the spectral distortions or spurious energy accumulation seen in
other methods.

Result: 实验证明两种算法在真实和合成数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: 离线聚类方法能有效利用离线数据提升决策性能，尤其是数据充足时。

Abstract: Contextual linear multi-armed bandits are a learning framework for making a
sequence of decisions, e.g., advertising recommendations for a sequence of
arriving users. Recent works have shown that clustering these users based on
the similarity of their learned preferences can significantly accelerate the
learning. However, prior work has primarily focused on the online setting,
which requires continually collecting user data, ignoring the offline data
widely available in many applications. To tackle these limitations, we study
the offline clustering of bandits (Off-ClusBand) problem, which studies how to
use the offline dataset to learn cluster properties and improve decision-making
across multiple users. The key challenge in Off-ClusBand arises from data
insufficiency for users: unlike the online case, in the offline case, we have a
fixed, limited dataset to work from and thus must determine whether we have
enough data to confidently cluster users together. To address this challenge,
we propose two algorithms: Off-C$^2$LUB, which we analytically show performs
well for arbitrary amounts of user data, and Off-CLUB, which is prone to bias
when data is limited but, given sufficient data, matches a theoretical lower
bound that we derive for the offline clustered MAB problem. We experimentally
validate these results on both real and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: SRL显著提升了RL在组合动作空间中的性能、稳定性和收敛速度。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly applied to real-world problems
involving complex and structured decisions, such as routing, scheduling, and
assortment planning. These settings challenge standard RL algorithms, which
struggle to scale, generalize, and exploit structure in the presence of
combinatorial action spaces. We propose Structured Reinforcement Learning

layers into the actor neural network. We enable end-to-end learning of the
actor via Fenchel-Young losses and provide a geometric interpretation of SRL as
a primal-dual algorithm in the dual of the moment polytope. Across six
environments with exogenous and endogenous uncertainty, SRL matches or
surpasses the performance of unstructured RL and imitation learning on static
tasks and improves over these baselines by up to 92% on dynamic problems, with

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have leveraged neural
networks to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various control tasks.
However, these successes often come at the cost of significant computational
resources, as training deep neural networks requires substantial time and data.
In this paper, we introduce an actor-critic algorithm that utilizes randomized

strong performance. Despite its simple architecture, our method effectively
solves a range of control problems, including the locomotion control of a
highly dynamic 12-motor quadruped robot, and achieves results comparable to
leading algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Notably, our
approach does not outperform other algorithms in terms of sample efficnency but
rather in terms of wall-clock training time. That is, although our algorithm
requires more timesteps to converge to an optimal policy, the actual time
required for training turns out to be lower.

Abstract: We propose a novel distributionally robust $Q$-learning algorithm for the
non-tabular case accounting for continuous state spaces where the state
transition of the underlying Markov decision process is subject to model
uncertainty. The uncertainty is taken into account by considering the
worst-case transition from a ball around a reference probability measure. To
determine the optimal policy under the worst-case state transition, we solve
the associated non-linear Bellman equation by dualising and regularising the
Bellman operator with the Sinkhorn distance, which is then parameterized with
deep neural networks. This approach allows us to modify the Deep Q-Network
algorithm to optimise for the worst case state transition.
  We illustrate the tractability and effectiveness of our approach through
several applications, including a portfolio optimisation task based on
S\&{P}~500 data.

Conclusion: ABoB在动态环境中表现出色，显著降低遗憾并加速收敛，适用于非随机和随机设置。

Abstract: Motivated by dynamic parameter optimization in finite, but large action
(configurations) spaces, this work studies the nonstochastic multi-armed bandit
(MAB) problem in metric action spaces with oblivious Lipschitz adversaries. We
propose ABoB, a hierarchical Adversarial Bandit over Bandits algorithm that can
use state-of-the-art existing "flat" algorithms, but additionally clusters
similar configurations to exploit local structures and adapt to changing
environments. We prove that in the worst-case scenario, such clustering
approach cannot hurt too much and ABoB guarantees a standard worst-case regret
bound of $O\left(k^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$, where $T$ is the
number of rounds and $k$ is the number of arms, matching the traditional flat
approach. However, under favorable conditions related to the algorithm
properties, clusters properties, and certain Lipschitz conditions, the regret
bound can be improved to $O\left(k^{\frac{1}{4}}T^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$.
Simulations and experiments on a real storage system demonstrate that ABoB,
using standard algorithms like EXP3 and Tsallis-INF, achieves lower regret and
faster convergence than the flat method, up to 50% improvement in known
previous setups, nonstochastic and stochastic, as well as in our settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文分析了二元概率分类器的重新校准方法，提出了两种新方法（CSPD和QMM），并在实验中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信用风险管理等领域，将二元概率分类器重新校准到目标先验概率是一个重要任务。

Method: 从分布偏移角度分析重新校准方法，提出CSPD和QMM两种新方法，并与现有方法进行对比测试。

Result: 实验表明，QMM方法在凹函数评估（如信用风险权重函数）中能提供保守且合理的结果。

Conclusion: QMM方法在特定场景下表现优越，适合需要保守评估的应用。

Abstract: Recalibration of binary probabilistic classifiers to a target prior
probability is an important task in areas like credit risk management. We
analyse methods for recalibration from a distribution shift perspective.
Distribution shift assumptions linked to the area under the curve (AUC) of a
probabilistic classifier are found to be useful for the design of meaningful
recalibration methods. Two new methods called parametric covariate shift with
posterior drift (CSPD) and ROC-based quasi moment matching (QMM) are proposed
and tested together with some other methods in an example setting. The outcomes
of the test suggest that the QMM methods discussed in the paper can provide
appropriately conservative results in evaluations with concave functionals like
for instance risk weights functions for credit risk.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文研究了过参数化模型在马尔可夫随机训练算法下的泛化间隙，通过Langevin动力学和Gibbs稳态分布分析，给出了与训练时间、维度无关的泛化间隙上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨过参数化模型在随机训练算法下的泛化性能，避免传统分析中对训练时间、维度或梯度性质的依赖。

Method: 采用Langevin动力学（带高斯噪声的梯度下降）和Gibbs稳态分布理论，分析训练过程中的泛化间隙。

Result: 泛化间隙上界为√((βE[L(θ0)] + log(1/δ))/N)，与训练时间、维度无关。

Conclusion: 通过热力学第二定律的推广，证明了泛化间隙的简单上界，为随机训练算法提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We analyze the generalization gap (gap between the training and test errors)
when training a potentially over-parametrized model using a Markovian
stochastic training algorithm, initialized from some distribution $\theta_0
\sim p_0$. We focus on Langevin dynamics with a positive temperature
$\beta^{-1}$, i.e. gradient descent on a training loss $L$ with infinitesimal
step size, perturbed with $\beta^{-1}$-variances Gaussian noise, and lightly
regularized or bounded. There, we bound the generalization gap, at any time
during training, by $\sqrt{(\beta\mathbb{E} L (\theta_0) + \log(1/\delta))/N}$
with probability $1-\delta$ over the dataset, where $N$ is the sample size, and
$\mathbb{E} L (\theta_0) =O(1)$ with standard initialization scaling. In
contrast to previous guarantees, we have no dependence on either training time
or reliance on mixing, nor a dependence on dimensionality, gradient norms, or
any other properties of the loss or model. This guarantee follows from a
general analysis of any Markov process-based training that has a Gibbs-style
stationary distribution. The proof is surprisingly simple, once we observe that
the marginal distribution divergence from initialization remains bounded, as
implied by a generalized second law of thermodynamics.

Method: CMoS直接建模时间序列块的空间相关性，引入相关性混合技术捕捉多样空间相关性，并可选周期性注入技术加速收敛。

Result: CMoS仅使用DLinear模型1%的参数，却在多个数据集上优于现有最先进模型，且权重具有高可解释性。

Conclusion: CMoS以极简参数实现高性能和可解释性，为时间序列预测提供实用工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in lightweight time series forecasting models suggest the
inherent simplicity of time series forecasting tasks. In this paper, we present
CMoS, a super-lightweight time series forecasting model. Instead of learning
the embedding of the shapes, CMoS directly models the spatial correlations
between different time series chunks. Additionally, we introduce a Correlation
Mixing technique that enables the model to capture diverse spatial correlations
with minimal parameters, and an optional Periodicity Injection technique to
ensure faster convergence. Despite utilizing as low as 1% of the lightweight
model DLinear's parameters count, experimental results demonstrate that CMoS
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets.
Furthermore, the learned weights of CMoS exhibit great interpretability,
providing practitioners with valuable insights into temporal structures within
specific application scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有影响函数方法在深度神经网络中，尤其是面对噪声数据时，影响估计不可靠，主要问题在于损失变化估计的不足，而非参数变化估计。

Method: 建立了影响估计误差、验证集风险及其尖锐性之间的理论联系，提出了一种专为平坦验证极小值设计的新型影响函数估计形式。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多种任务中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 平坦验证极小值对准确的影响估计至关重要，提出的新型影响函数估计方法显著提升了估计的可靠性。

Abstract: The Influence Function (IF) is a widely used technique for assessing the
impact of individual training samples on model predictions. However, existing
IF methods often fail to provide reliable influence estimates in deep neural
networks, particularly when applied to noisy training data. This issue does not
stem from inaccuracies in parameter change estimation, which has been the
primary focus of prior research, but rather from deficiencies in loss change
estimation, specifically due to the sharpness of validation risk. In this work,
we establish a theoretical connection between influence estimation error,
validation set risk, and its sharpness, underscoring the importance of flat
validation minima for accurate influence estimation. Furthermore, we introduce
a novel estimation form of Influence Function specifically designed for flat
validation minima. Experimental results across various tasks validate the
superiority of our approach.

Result: 在多种PDE基准测试中，LaMO表现优异，比现有基线方法在解算子逼近上提升了32.3%。

Conclusion: LaMO在复杂PDE求解中表现出色，为高维PDE的高效求解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful data-driven frameworks for solving
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering significant speedups over
numerical methods. However, existing neural operators struggle with scalability
in high-dimensional spaces, incur high computational costs, and face challenges
in capturing continuous and long-range dependencies in PDE dynamics. To address
these limitations, we introduce the Latent Mamba Operator (LaMO), which
integrates the efficiency of state-space models (SSMs) in latent space with the
expressive power of kernel integral formulations in neural operators. We also
establish a theoretical connection between state-space models (SSMs) and the
kernel integral of neural operators. Extensive experiments across diverse PDE
benchmarks on regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds covering solid
and fluid physics datasets, LaMOs achieve consistent state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance, with a 32.3\% improvement over existing baselines in solution

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如上下文学习和参数高效微调）在少样本场景中存在计算开销大或过拟合的问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 将LLM的前向传播视为优化过程，提出OFA方法，学习预条件器以提高优化效率，并避免引入额外参数。

Result: OFA在多种少样本任务中表现优于现有方法，解决了上下文学习和参数高效微调的局限性。

Conclusion: OFA是一种高效的少样本适应方法，通过优化视角改进了LLM的微调性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
real-world applications. However, adapting LLMs to novel tasks via fine-tuning
often requires substantial training data and computational resources that are
impractical in few-shot scenarios. Existing approaches, such as in-context
learning and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), face key limitations:
in-context learning introduces additional inference computational overhead with
limited performance gains, while PEFT models are prone to overfitting on the
few demonstration examples. In this work, we reinterpret the forward pass of
LLMs as an optimization process, a sequence of preconditioned gradient descent
steps refining internal representations. Based on this connection, we propose
Optimization-Inspired Few-Shot Adaptation (OFA), integrating a parameterization
that learns preconditioners without introducing additional trainable
parameters, and an objective that improves optimization efficiency by learning
preconditioners based on a convergence bound, while simultaneously steering the
optimization path toward the flat local minimum. Our method overcomes both
issues of ICL-based and PEFT-based methods, and demonstrates superior
performance over the existing methods on a variety of few-shot adaptation tasks
in experiments.

Motivation: 探索高效量化训练方法，减少计算资源需求，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 研究FP4的关键设计选择（如块大小、缩放格式、舍入方法），采用NVFP4格式和随机舍入策略。

Result: 成功训练7B参数模型，FP4训练性能与标准BF16基线相当。

Conclusion: FP4训练是实用且高效的大规模LLM训练方法。

Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, fully quantized training (FQT) of large
language models (LLMs) using predominantly 4-bit floating-point (FP4) precision
for weights, activations, and gradients on datasets up to 200 billion tokens.
We extensively investigate key design choices for FP4, including block sizes,
scaling formats, and rounding methods. Our analysis shows that the NVFP4
format, where each block of 16 FP4 values (E2M1) shares a scale represented in
E4M3, provides optimal results. We use stochastic rounding for backward and
update passes and round-to-nearest for the forward pass to enhance stability.
Additionally, we identify a theoretical and empirical threshold for effective
quantized training: when the gradient norm falls below approximately $\sqrt{3}$
times the quantization noise, quantized training becomes less effective.
Leveraging these insights, we successfully train a 7-billion-parameter model on
256 Intel Gaudi2 accelerators. The resulting FP4-trained model achieves
downstream task performance comparable to a standard BF16 baseline, confirming
that FP4 training is a practical and highly efficient approach for large-scale
LLM training. A reference implementation is supplied in

Result: 在真实电力负荷数据集上验证了方法在填补精度和训练效率上的优越性。

Conclusion: 所提方法在自适应性和计算效率上优于现有基线。

Abstract: Low-rank representation learning has emerged as a powerful tool for
recovering missing values in power load data due to its ability to exploit the
inherent low-dimensional structures of spatiotemporal measurements. Among
various techniques, low-rank factorization models are favoured for their
efficiency and interpretability. However, their performance is highly sensitive
to the choice of regularization parameters, which are typically fixed or
manually tuned, resulting in limited generalization capability or slow
convergence in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a
Regularization-optimized Low-Rank Factorization, which introduces a
Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller to adaptively adjust the
regularization coefficient. Furthermore, we provide a detailed algorithmic
complexity analysis, showing that our method preserves the computational
efficiency of stochastic gradient descent while improving adaptivity.
Experimental results on real-world power load datasets validate the superiority
of our method in both imputation accuracy and training efficiency compared to
existing baselines.

Abstract: Drug combinations play a critical role in cancer therapy by significantly
enhancing treatment efficacy and overcoming drug resistance. However, the
combinatorial space of possible drug pairs grows exponentially, making
experimental screening highly impractical. Therefore, developing efficient
computational methods to predict promising drug combinations and guide
experimental validation is of paramount importance. In this work, we propose
ADGSyn, an innovative method for predicting drug synergy. The key components of
our approach include: (1) shared projection matrices combined with attention
mechanisms to enable cross-drug feature alignment; (2) automatic mixed
precision (AMP)-optimized graph operations that reduce memory consumption by
40\% while accelerating training speed threefold; and (3) residual pathways
stabilized by LayerNorm to ensure stable gradient propagation during training.
Evaluated on the O'Neil dataset containing 13,243 drug--cell line combinations,
ADGSyn demonstrates superior performance over eight baseline methods. Moreover,
the framework supports full-batch processing of up to 256 molecular graphs on a
single GPU, setting a new standard for efficiency in drug synergy prediction

Conclusion: 计算惯性为优化动态提供了简洁的解释框架，可能对理论分析工具的发展有重要意义。

Abstract: We identify a conserved quantity in continuous-time optimization dynamics,
termed computational inertia. Defined as the sum of kinetic energy (parameter
velocity) and potential energy (loss), this scalar remains invariant under
idealized, frictionless training. We formalize this conservation law, derive
its analytic decay under damping and stochastic perturbations, and demonstrate
its behavior in a synthetic system. The invariant offers a compact lens for
interpreting learning trajectories, and may inform theoretical tools for
analyzing convergence, stability, and training geometry.

Conclusion: 本书为设计可扩展且隐私保护的FL系统提供了数学原理与实践指导。

Abstract: This book offers a hands-on introduction to building and understanding
federated learning (FL) systems. FL enables multiple devices -- such as
smartphones, sensors, or local computers -- to collaboratively train machine
learning (ML) models, while keeping their data private and local. It is a
powerful solution when data cannot or should not be centralized due to privacy,
regulatory, or technical reasons. The book is designed for students, engineers,
and researchers who want to learn how to design scalable, privacy preserving FL
systems. Our main focus is on personalization: enabling each device to train
its own model while still benefiting from collaboration with relevant devices.
This is achieved by leveraging similarities between (the learning tasks
associated with) devices that are encoded by the weighted edges (or links) of a
federated learning network (FL network). The key idea is to represent
real-world FL systems as networks of devices, where nodes correspond to device
and edges represent communication links and data similarities between them. The
training of personalized models for these devices can be naturally framed as a
distributed optimization problem. This optimization problem is referred to as
generalized total variation minimization (GTVMin) and ensures that devices with
similar learning tasks learn similar model parameters. Our approach is both
mathematically principled and practically motivated. While we introduce some
advanced ideas from optimization theory and graph-based learning, we aim to
keep the book accessible. Readers are guided through the core ideas step by
step, with intuitive explanations.

Conclusion: 无弦结构的CSGNN在表达能力和计算效率上均优于现有方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Researchers have proposed various methods of incorporating more structured
information into the design of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance their
expressiveness. However, these methods are either computationally expensive or
lacking in provable expressiveness. In this paper, we observe that the chords
increase the complexity of the graph structure while contributing little useful
information in many cases. In contrast, chordless structures are more efficient
and effective for representing the graph. Therefore, when leveraging the
information of cycles, we choose to omit the chords. Accordingly, we propose a
Chordless Structure-based Graph Neural Network (CSGNN) and prove that its
expressiveness is strictly more powerful than the k-hop GNN (KPGNN) with
polynomial complexity. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate
that CSGNN outperforms existing GNNs across various graph tasks while incurring
lower computational costs and achieving better performance than the GNNs of
3-WL expressiveness.

Conclusion: I2MoE是一种有效的模态融合方法，兼具性能提升和可解释性。

Abstract: Modality fusion is a cornerstone of multimodal learning, enabling information
integration from diverse data sources. However, vanilla fusion methods are
limited by (1) inability to account for heterogeneous interactions between
modalities and (2) lack of interpretability in uncovering the multimodal
interactions inherent in the data. To this end, we propose I2MoE (Interpretable
Multimodal Interaction-aware Mixture of Experts), an end-to-end MoE framework
designed to enhance modality fusion by explicitly modeling diverse multimodal
interactions, as well as providing interpretation on a local and global level.
First, I2MoE utilizes different interaction experts with weakly supervised
interaction losses to learn multimodal interactions in a data-driven way.
Second, I2MoE deploys a reweighting model that assigns importance scores for
the output of each interaction expert, which offers sample-level and
dataset-level interpretation. Extensive evaluation of medical and general
multimodal datasets shows that I2MoE is flexible enough to be combined with
different fusion techniques, consistently improves task performance, and
provides interpretation across various real-world scenarios. Code is available

Conclusion: GMAN不仅性能优越，还具有可解释性，能提供节点、图和子集级别的重要性分析，适用于高风险的现实任务。

Abstract: Real-world medical data often includes measurements from multiple signals
that are collected at irregular and asynchronous time intervals. For example,
different types of blood tests can be measured at different times and
frequencies, resulting in fragmented and unevenly scattered temporal data.
Similar issues of irregular sampling of different attributes occur in other
domains, such as monitoring of large systems using event log files or the
spread of fake news on social networks. Effectively learning from such data
requires models that can handle sets of temporally sparse and heterogeneous
signals. In this paper, we propose Graph Mixing Additive Networks (GMAN), a
novel and interpretable-by-design model for learning over irregular sets of
temporal signals. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in
real-world medical tasks, including a 4-point increase in the AUROC score of
in-hospital mortality prediction, compared to existing methods. We further
showcase GMAN's flexibility by applying it to a fake news detection task. We
demonstrate how its interpretability capabilities, including node-level,
graph-level, and subset-level importance, allow for transition phases detection
and gaining medical insights with real-world high-stakes implications. Finally,
we provide theoretical insights on GMAN expressive power.

Result: 发现决策边界曲率与对抗鲁棒性之间存在统计联系，并提出新攻击方法CDBA。

Conclusion: DCE和CDBA为理解对抗鲁棒性提供了新视角，并提升了攻击性能。

Abstract: Adversarial attack reveals the vulnerability of deep learning models. For
about a decade, countless attack and defense methods have been proposed,
leading to robustified classifiers and better understanding of models. Among
these methods, curvature-based approaches have attracted attention because it
is assumed that high curvature may give rise to rough decision boundary.
However, the most commonly used \textit{curvature} is the curvature of loss
function, scores or other parameters from within the model as opposed to
decision boundary curvature, since the former can be relatively easily formed
using second order derivative. In this paper, we propose a new query-efficient
method, dynamic curvature estimation(DCE), to estimate the decision boundary
curvature in a black-box setting. Our approach is based on CGBA, a black-box
adversarial attack. By performing DCE on a wide range of classifiers, we
discovered, statistically, a connection between decision boundary curvature and
adversarial robustness. We also propose a new attack method, curvature dynamic
black-box attack(CDBA) with improved performance using the dynamically
estimated curvature.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a critical yet challenging aspect of
machine learning model development, significantly impacting model performance
and generalization. Traditional HPO methods often struggle with high
dimensionality, complex interdependencies, and computational expense. This
paper introduces OptiMindTune, a novel multi-agent framework designed to
intelligently and efficiently optimize hyperparameters. OptiMindTune leverages
the collaborative intelligence of three specialized AI agents -- a Recommender
Agent, an Evaluator Agent, and a Decision Agent -- each powered by Google's
Gemini models. These agents address distinct facets of the HPO problem, from
model selection and hyperparameter suggestion to robust evaluation and
strategic decision-making. By fostering dynamic interactions and knowledge
sharing, OptiMindTune aims to converge to optimal hyperparameter configurations
more rapidly and robustly than existing single-agent or monolithic approaches.
Our framework integrates principles from advanced large language models, and
adaptive search to achieve scalable and intelligent AutoML. We posit that this
multi-agent paradigm offers a promising avenue for tackling the increasing
complexity of modern machine learning model tuning.

TLDR: 论文提出了VRPO框架，通过减少ELBO估计的方差来优化MDM与人类偏好的对齐，显著提升了LLaDA模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDM（如LLaDA）在语言建模中表现优异，但缺乏通过强化学习与人类偏好对齐的研究，主要因ELBO估计方差高。

Method: 提出VRPO框架，分析ELBO估计器的方差，引入无偏方差减少策略（如最优蒙特卡洛预算分配和对立采样）。

Result: LLaDA 1.5在数学、代码和对齐基准测试中显著优于前代模型，表现竞争力强。

Conclusion: VRPO有效解决了MDM对齐中的方差问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), such as LLaDA, present a promising
paradigm for language modeling, there has been relatively little effort in
aligning these models with human preferences via reinforcement learning. The
challenge primarily arises from the high variance in Evidence Lower Bound
(ELBO)-based likelihood estimates required for preference optimization. To
address this issue, we propose Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization (VRPO),
a framework that formally analyzes the variance of ELBO estimators and derives
bounds on both the bias and variance of preference optimization gradients.
Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce unbiased variance
reduction strategies, including optimal Monte Carlo budget allocation and
antithetic sampling, that significantly improve the performance of MDM
alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VRPO by applying it to LLaDA,
and the resulting model, LLaDA 1.5, outperforms its SFT-only predecessor
consistently and significantly across mathematical (GSM8K +4.7), code
(HumanEval +3.0, MBPP +1.8), and alignment benchmarks (IFEval +4.0, Arena-Hard
+4.3). Furthermore, LLaDA 1.5 demonstrates a highly competitive mathematical
performance compared to strong language MDMs and ARMs. Project page:

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文研究了梯度下降在训练基于Transformer的语言模型时遇到的优化困难，发现数据分布的幂律特性（如Zipf定律）对训练性能有显著影响。通过线性双模型分析，发现当数据分布较重尾时（α=1），梯度下降表现最差，而符号下降（类似Adam）表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究梯度下降在训练语言模型时遇到的优化困难，特别是数据分布的幂律特性如何影响训练性能。

Method: 使用线性双模型分析不同幂律指数α下的优化性能，比较梯度下降和符号下降的表现。

Result: 当α=1（Zipf分布）时，梯度下降表现最差，迭代次数几乎与维度线性增长；符号下降表现更好，迭代次数仅与维度的平方根成正比。

Conclusion: 数据分布的幂律特性对优化性能有重要影响，符号下降（类似Adam）在处理重尾数据时更具优势。

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted optimization difficulties faced by gradient
descent in training the first and last layers of transformer-based language
models, which are overcome by optimizers such as Adam. These works suggest that
the difficulty is linked to the heavy-tailed distribution of words in text
data, where the frequency of the $k$th most frequent word $\pi_k$ is
proportional to $1/k$, following Zipf's law. To better understand the impact of
the data distribution on training performance, we study a linear bigram model
for next-token prediction when the tokens follow a power law $\pi_k \propto
1/k^\alpha$ parameterized by the exponent $\alpha > 0$. We derive optimization
scaling laws for deterministic gradient descent and sign descent as a proxy for
Adam as a function of the exponent $\alpha$. Existing theoretical
investigations in scaling laws assume that the eigenvalues of the data decay as
a power law with exponent $\alpha > 1$. This assumption effectively makes the
problem ``finite dimensional'' as most of the loss comes from a few of the
largest eigencomponents. In comparison, we show that the problem is more
difficult when the data have heavier tails. The case $\alpha = 1$ as found in
text data is ``worst-case'' for gradient descent, in that the number of
iterations required to reach a small relative error scales almost linearly with
dimension. While the performance of sign descent also depends on the dimension,
for Zipf-distributed data the number of iterations scales only with the
square-root of the dimension, leading to a large improvement for large
vocabularies.

Result: 在十项图像理解任务和三种硬件设备上表现优异，NVIDIA Titan Xp上实现了5倍FLOPs减少和10倍加速。

Conclusion: 令牌与神经元稀疏性之间存在协同效应，CoreMatching框架为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel across diverse tasks but suffer from high
inference costs in time and memory. Token sparsity mitigates inefficiencies in
token usage, while neuron sparsity reduces high-dimensional computations, both
offering promising solutions to enhance efficiency. Recently, these two
sparsity paradigms have evolved largely in parallel, fostering the prevailing
assumption that they function independently. However, a fundamental yet
underexplored question remains: Do they truly operate in isolation, or is there
a deeper underlying interplay that has yet to be uncovered? In this paper, we
conduct the first comprehensive investigation into this question. By
introducing and analyzing the matching mechanism between Core Neurons and Core
Tokens, we found that key neurons and tokens for inference mutually influence
and reinforce each other. Building on this insight, we propose CoreMatching, a
co-adaptive sparse inference framework, which leverages the synergy between
token and neuron sparsity to enhance inference efficiency. Through theoretical
analysis and efficiency evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed method
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on ten image understanding tasks and three
hardware devices. Notably, on the NVIDIA Titan Xp, it achieved 5x FLOPs
reduction and a 10x overall speedup. Code is released at

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Constrained decision-making is essential for designing safe policies in
real-world control systems, yet simulated environments often fail to capture
real-world adversities. We consider the problem of learning a policy that will
maximize the cumulative reward while satisfying a constraint, even when there
is a mismatch between the real model and an accessible simulator/nominal model.
In particular, we consider the robust constrained Markov decision problem
(RCMDP) where an agent needs to maximize the reward and satisfy the constraint
against the worst possible stochastic model under the uncertainty set centered
around an unknown nominal model. Primal-dual methods, effective for standard
constrained MDP (CMDP), are not applicable here because of the lack of the
strong duality property. Further, one cannot apply the standard robust
value-iteration based approach on the composite value function either as the
worst case models may be different for the reward value function and the
constraint value function. We propose a novel technique that effectively
minimizes the constraint value function--to satisfy the constraints; on the
other hand, when all the constraints are satisfied, it can simply maximize the
robust reward value function. We prove that such an algorithm finds a policy
with at most $\epsilon$ sub-optimality and feasible policy after
$O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. In contrast to the state-of-the-art method, we
do not need to employ a binary search, thus, we reduce the computation time by
at least 4x for smaller value of discount factor ($\gamma$) and by at least 6x
for larger value of $\gamma$.

Motivation: 高质量的人类偏好数据集对LLM对齐至关重要，但收集成本高且资源密集，需要高效的数据选择方法。现有方法缺乏理论基础或依赖限制性假设。

Method: 提出ActiveDPO算法，利用理论支持的数据选择标准，直接使用LLM参数化奖励模型，并考虑LLM对数据选择的影响。

Result: 实验表明，ActiveDPO在多种模型和数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ActiveDPO通过理论支持和LLM的直接利用，实现了更高效和有效的LLM对齐数据收集。

Abstract: The recent success of using human preferences to align large language models
(LLMs) has significantly improved their performance in various downstream tasks
like question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. However,3
achieving effective LLM alignment depends on high-quality human preference
datasets. Collecting these datasets requires human preference annotation, which
is costly and resource-intensive, necessitating efficient active data selection
methods. Existing methods either lack a strong theoretical foundation or depend
on restrictive reward function assumptions (e.g., linearity). To this end, we
propose an algorithm, ActiveDPO, that uses a theoretically grounded data
selection criterion for non-linear reward functions while directly leveraging
the LLM itself to parameterize the reward model that is used for active data
selection. As a result, ActiveDPO explicitly accounts for the influence of LLM
on data selection, unlike methods that select the data without considering the
LLM that is being aligned, thereby leading to more effective and efficient data
collection. Extensive experiments show that ActiveDPO outperforms existing
methods across various models and datasets.

Motivation: 理解CoT和Looped Transformers在推理任务中的比较能力，为选择推理范式提供依据。

Result: Looped Transformers适合确定性任务（如DAG评估），CoT适合组合结构问题（如自可归约问题）。

Conclusion: 研究为选择推理范式提供了实用线索，明确了深度驱动递归的适用场景。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Looped Transformers have been shown to empirically
improve performance on reasoning tasks and to theoretically enhance
expressivity by recursively increasing the number of computational steps.
However, their comparative capabilities are still not well understood. In this
paper, we provide a formal analysis of their respective strengths and
limitations. We show that Looped Transformers can efficiently simulate parallel
computations for deterministic tasks, which we formalize as evaluation over
directed acyclic graphs. In contrast, CoT with stochastic decoding excels at
approximate inference for compositional structures, namely self-reducible
problems. These separations suggest the tasks for which depth-driven recursion
is more suitable, thereby offering practical cues for choosing between
reasoning paradigms.

Motivation: 质疑近似信任区域是否真正导致策略改进，提出价值估计准确性是关键因素。

Method: 增加普通策略梯度算法中每个迭代的价值更新步数。

Result: VPG性能与PPO相当或更好，且对超参数更鲁棒。

Conclusion: RL算法可能更有效且易用，关键在于价值估计准确性。

Abstract: Modern policy gradient algorithms, such as TRPO and PPO, outperform vanilla
policy gradient in many RL tasks. Questioning the common belief that enforcing
approximate trust regions leads to steady policy improvement in practice, we
show that the more critical factor is the enhanced value estimation accuracy
from more value update steps in each iteration. To demonstrate, we show that by
simply increasing the number of value update steps per iteration, vanilla
policy gradient itself can achieve performance comparable to or better than PPO
in all the standard continuous control benchmark environments. Importantly,
this simple change to vanilla policy gradient is significantly more robust to
hyperparameter choices, opening up the possibility that RL algorithms may still
become more effective and easier to use.

Result: 实验表明，VTool-R1在图表和表格的结构化视觉问答任务中显著提升了推理性能。

Conclusion: VTool-R1通过教导VLMs“用图像思考”并生成多模态思维链，填补了多模态推理的空白。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Finetuning (RFT) has significantly advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling long chains
of thought, self-correction, and effective tool use. While recent works attempt
to extend RFT to vision-language models (VLMs), these efforts largely produce
text-only reasoning conditioned on static image inputs, falling short of true
multimodal reasoning in the response. In contrast, test-time methods like
Visual Sketchpad incorporate visual steps but lack training mechanisms.
  We introduce VTool-R1, the first framework that trains VLMs to generate
multimodal chains of thought by interleaving text and intermediate visual
reasoning steps. VTool-R1 integrates Python-based visual editing tools into the
RFT process, enabling VLMs to learn when and how to generate visual reasoning
steps that benefit final reasoning. Trained with outcome-based rewards tied to
task accuracy, our approach elicits strategic visual tool use for reasoning
without relying on process-based supervision. Experiments on structured visual
question answering over charts and tables show that VTool-R1 enhances reasoning
performance by teaching VLMs to "think with images" and generate multimodal
chain of thoughts with tools.

Abstract: With the increasing availability of meteorological data from various sensors,

hydrometeorological studies. In this work, we propose a data fusion approach
for precipitation nowcasting by integrating data from meteorological and rain

covering a 9 x 11 grid. The study spans from January 2011 to October 2024, and
we evaluate the impact of integrating three surface station systems. Among the
tested configurations, the fusion-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.2033
for forecasting heavy precipitation events (greater than 25 mm/h) at a one-hour
lead time. Additionally, we present an ablation study to assess the
contribution of each station network and propose a refined inference strategy
for precipitation nowcasting, integrating the GFS numerical weather prediction

Abstract: Agricultural decision-making involves complex, context-specific reasoning,
where choices about crops, practices, and interventions depend heavily on
geographic, climatic, and economic conditions. Traditional large language
models (LLMs) often fall short in navigating this nuanced problem due to
limited reasoning capacity. We hypothesize that recent advances in large
reasoning models (LRMs) can better handle such structured, domain-specific
inference. To investigate this, we introduce AgReason, the first expert-curated
open-ended science benchmark with 100 questions for agricultural reasoning.
Evaluations across thirteen open-source and proprietary models reveal that LRMs
outperform conventional ones, though notable challenges persist, with the
strongest Gemini-based baseline achieving 36% accuracy. We also present
AgThoughts, a large-scale dataset of 44.6K question-answer pairs generated with
human oversight and equipped with synthetically generated reasoning traces.
Using AgThoughts, we develop AgThinker, a suite of small reasoning models that
can be run on consumer-grade GPUs, and show that our dataset can be effective
in unlocking agricultural reasoning abilities in LLMs. Our project page is

Conclusion: 提出的框架在隐私保护和模型鲁棒性方面表现优异，适用于分布式网络流量预测。

Abstract: Network traffic prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent network
operation. Traditional prediction methods often rely on centralized training,
necessitating the transfer of vast amounts of traffic data to a central server.
This approach can lead to latency and privacy concerns. To address these
issues, federated learning integrated with differential privacy has emerged as
a solution to improve data privacy and model robustness in distributed
settings. Nonetheless, existing federated learning protocols are vulnerable to
Byzantine attacks, which may significantly compromise model robustness.
Developing a robust and privacy-preserving prediction model in the presence of
Byzantine clients remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose an
asynchronous differential federated learning framework based on
distributionally robust optimization. The proposed framework utilizes multiple
clients to train the prediction model collaboratively with local differential
privacy. In addition, regularization techniques have been employed to further
improve the Byzantine robustness of the models. We have conducted extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets, and the results elucidate that our
proposed distributed algorithm can achieve superior performance over existing
methods.

Motivation: 在线RL在复杂、安全关键领域表现出色，但存在样本效率低、训练不稳定和缺乏可解释性等问题。数据归因可以追溯模型行为到训练样本，但现有方法假设固定数据集，不适用于在线RL的动态数据收集。

Method: 提出了局部归因框架，通过梯度相似性衡量训练样本对代理行为和累积回报的贡献。设计了两种目标函数，并开发了IIF算法，迭代过滤经验以优化策略更新。

Result: 在标准RL基准测试和RLHF任务中，IIF降低了样本复杂度，加速了训练，并取得了更高的回报。

Conclusion: 该研究提升了在线RL的可解释性、效率和性能，为动态数据环境中的归因问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) excels in complex, safety-critical
domains, yet it faces challenges such as sample inefficiency, training
instability, and a lack of interpretability. Data attribution offers a
principled way to trace model behavior back to individual training samples.
However, in online RL, each training sample not only drives policy updates but
also influences future data collection, violating the fixed dataset assumption
in existing attribution methods. In this paper, we initiate the study of data
attribution for online RL, focusing on the widely used Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm. We start by establishing a local attribution
framework, interpreting model checkpoints with respect to the records in the
recent training buffer. We design two target functions, capturing agent action
and cumulative return respectively, and measure each record's contribution
through gradient similarity between its training loss and these targets. We
demonstrate the power of this framework through three concrete applications:
diagnosis of learning, temporal analysis of behavior formation, and targeted
intervention during training. Leveraging this framework, we further propose an
algorithm, iterative influence-based filtering (IIF), for online RL training
that iteratively performs experience filtering to refine policy updates. Across
standard RL benchmarks (classic control, navigation, locomotion) to RLHF for
large language models, IIF reduces sample complexity, speeds up training, and
achieves higher returns. Overall, these results advance interpretability,
efficiency, and effectiveness of online RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于语义相似性的RAG在领域知识密集型任务中难以返回简洁且高度相关的信息，因此需要一种更精确的检索方法。

Method: 基于多维超立方体结构（Hypercube）索引文档，通过分解查询的实体和主题，并与超立方体维度对齐实现检索。

Result: 在三个科学问答数据集上，准确率提升3.7%，检索效率提升81.2%，并具有解释性。

Conclusion: Hypercube-RAG显著优于传统RAG，适用于需要高精度和解释性的领域知识任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often need to incorporate external knowledge to
solve theme-specific problems. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which
empowers LLMs to generate more qualified responses with retrieved external data
and knowledge, has shown its high promise. However, traditional semantic
similarity-based RAGs struggle to return concise yet highly relevant
information for domain knowledge-intensive tasks, such as scientific
question-answering (QA). Built on a multi-dimensional (cube) structure called
Hypercube, which can index documents in an application-driven, human-defined,
multi-dimensional space, we introduce the Hypercube-RAG, a novel RAG framework
for precise and efficient retrieval. Given a query, Hypercube-RAG first
decomposes it based on its entities and topics and then retrieves relevant
documents from cubes by aligning these decomposed components with hypercube
dimensions. Experiments on three in-domain scientific QA datasets demonstrate
that our method improves accuracy by 3.7% and boosts retrieval efficiency by
81.2%, measured as relative gains over the strongest RAG baseline. More
importantly, our Hypercube-RAG inherently offers explainability by revealing
the underlying predefined hypercube dimensions used for retrieval. The code and
data sets are available at https://github.com/JimengShi/Hypercube-RAG.

Motivation: 尽管文本到图像模型在生成质量和复杂性上取得了显著进展，但提示并不总能产生期望的输出。因此，研究如何通过直接干预模型激活来控制模型行为，以访问潜在空间中难以通过提示达到的概念。

Method: 设计了一个包含三个关键障碍的训练数据集：概念稀缺性、标题中概念的不明确性以及数据偏差与绑定概念。通过实验分析概念可达性。

Result: 结果显示：(i) 概念可达性在潜在空间中表现出明显的相变，仅需少量样本即可实现；(ii) 干预的位置对可达性至关重要，某些概念仅在特定转换阶段可达；(iii) 提示能力随数据集质量下降而迅速减弱，但通过干预仍可可靠地达到概念。

Conclusion: 模型提供商可以利用这一发现，绕过昂贵的重新训练和数据整理，转而创新用户控制机制。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in quality and complexity of the generations in
text-to-image models, prompting does not always lead to the desired outputs.
Controlling model behaviour by directly steering intermediate model activations
has emerged as a viable alternative allowing to reach concepts in latent space
that may otherwise remain inaccessible by prompt. In this work, we introduce a
set of experiments to deepen our understanding of concept reachability. We
design a training data setup with three key obstacles: scarcity of concepts,
underspecification of concepts in the captions, and data biases with tied
concepts. Our results show: (i) concept reachability in latent space exhibits a
distinct phase transition, with only a small number of samples being sufficient
to enable reachability, (ii) where in the latent space the intervention is
performed critically impacts reachability, showing that certain concepts are
reachable only at certain stages of transformation, and (iii) while prompting
ability rapidly diminishes with a decrease in quality of the dataset, concepts
often remain reliably reachable through steering. Model providers can leverage
this to bypass costly retraining and dataset curation and instead innovate with
user-facing control mechanisms.

Conclusion: 对比学习通过显式建模正负例，有望减少语言模型去偏中的对齐代价。

Abstract: Current debiasing approaches often result a degradation in model capabilities
such as factual accuracy and knowledge retention. Through systematic evaluation
across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that existing debiasing methods face
fundamental trade-offs, particularly in smaller models, leading to reduced
truthfulness, knowledge loss, or unintelligible outputs. To address these
limitations, we propose a contrastive learning framework that learns through
carefully constructed positive and negative examples. Our approach introduces
contrast computation and dynamic loss scaling to balance bias mitigation with
faithfulness preservation. Experimental results across multiple model scales
demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in both toxicity
reduction and faithfulness preservation. Most importantly, we show that our
framework is the first to consistently improve both metrics simultaneously,
avoiding the capability degradation characteristic of existing approaches.
These results suggest that explicit modeling of both positive and negative
examples through contrastive learning could be a promising direction for
reducing the alignment tax in language model debiasing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLM）在信息检索任务中，点式评分与列表式排名性能差异的根本原因。

Method: 评估四种LLM在八个基准数据集（BEIR和TREC-DL）及两个专有数据集上的表现，比较点式评分和列表式排名的性能。

Result: 点式评分与列表式排名的性能差距在足够大的有序标签空间下缩小，部分情况下差异不显著。

Conclusion: 点式评分在某些条件下可以接近列表式排名的性能，挑战了当前研究社区对列表式排名优越性的共识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) obtain state of the art zero shot relevance
ranking performance on a variety of information retrieval tasks. The two most
common prompts to elicit LLM relevance judgments are pointwise scoring (a.k.a.
relevance generation), where the LLM sees a single query-document pair and
outputs a single relevance score, and listwise ranking (a.k.a. permutation
generation), where the LLM sees a query and a list of documents and outputs a
permutation, sorting the documents in decreasing order of relevance. The
current research community consensus is that listwise ranking yields superior
performance, and significant research effort has been devoted to crafting LLM
listwise ranking algorithms. The underlying hypothesis is that LLMs are better
at making relative relevance judgments than absolute ones. In tension with this
hypothesis, we find that the gap between pointwise scoring and listwise ranking
shrinks when pointwise scoring is implemented using a sufficiently large
ordinal relevance label space, becoming statistically insignificant for many
LLM-benchmark dataset combinations (where ``significant'' means ``95\%
confidence that listwise ranking improves NDCG@10''). Our evaluations span four
LLMs, eight benchmark datasets from the BEIR and TREC-DL suites, and two
proprietary datasets with relevance labels collected after the training cut-off
of all LLMs evaluated.

TLDR: RADT是一种基于决策变换器的离线强化学习模型，支持动态指定避免区域，无需重新训练即可泛化到新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法动态指定避免区域，且依赖精心设计的奖励函数，限制了复杂环境的扩展性。

Method: RADT通过提示令牌编码目标和避免区域，结合后见之明重标记技术学习行为。

Result: 在11个任务中，RADT零样本泛化能力优于基线模型，目标达成率高且成本降低35.7%。

Conclusion: RADT在复杂环境中表现优异，尤其在生物细胞重编程任务中有效减少不良状态访问。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning methods have shown promise
for reach-avoid tasks, where an agent must reach a target state while avoiding
undesirable regions of the state space. Existing approaches typically encode
avoid-region information into an augmented state space and cost function, which
prevents flexible, dynamic specification of novel avoid-region information at
evaluation time. They also rely heavily on well-designed reward and cost
functions, limiting scalability to complex or poorly structured environments.
We introduce RADT, a decision transformer model for offline, reward-free,
goal-conditioned, avoid region-conditioned RL. RADT encodes goals and avoid
regions directly as prompt tokens, allowing any number of avoid regions of
arbitrary size to be specified at evaluation time. Using only suboptimal
offline trajectories from a random policy, RADT learns reach-avoid behavior
through a novel combination of goal and avoid-region hindsight relabeling. We
benchmark RADT against 3 existing offline goal-conditioned RL models across 11
tasks, environments, and experimental settings. RADT generalizes in a zero-shot
manner to out-of-distribution avoid region sizes and counts, outperforming
baselines that require retraining. In one such zero-shot setting, RADT achieves
35.7% improvement in normalized cost over the best retrained baseline while
maintaining high goal-reaching success. We apply RADT to cell reprogramming in
biology, where it reduces visits to undesirable intermediate gene expression
states during trajectories to desired target states, despite stochastic
transitions and discrete, structured state dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的高推理延迟限制了实时应用，现有多设备推理方法需要高带宽，不适用于带宽受限环境。

Method: ASTRA结合序列并行和混合精度注意力机制，通过向量量化压缩非局部令牌嵌入，并通过噪声增强量化和分布式类别令牌优化保持任务准确性。

Result: 实验表明，ASTRA在ViT和GPT2上比单设备推理快2.64倍，比现有最佳多设备推理快15.25倍，且可在低至10 Mbps带宽下运行。

Conclusion: ASTRA是一种高效的多设备Transformer推理框架，适用于带宽受限环境，并已开源。

Abstract: Transformer models power many AI applications but suffer from high inference
latency, limiting their use in real-time settings. Multi-device inference can
reduce latency by parallelizing computation. Yet, existing methods require high
inter-device bandwidth, making them impractical for bandwidth-constrained
environments. We propose ASTRA, a communication-efficient framework that
accelerates Transformer inference through a novel integration of sequence
parallelism and a Mixed-Precision Attention mechanism designed to minimize
inter-device communication. ASTRA compresses non-local token embeddings via
vector quantization and preserves task accuracy through two optimizations,
Noise-Augmented Quantization and Distributed Class Tokens. Experiments on ViT
and GPT2 across vision and NLP tasks show that ASTRA achieves up to 2.64X
speedups over single-device inference and up to 15.25X speedups over
state-of-the-art multi-device inferences, while operating under bandwidths as
low as 10 Mbps. ASTRA is open-sourced at https://github.com/xl1990/Astra.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型（如CNN和RNN）在捕捉长时依赖和多传感器通道的上下文相关性方面表现不足，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出SETransformer，结合Transformer的时序建模、SE注意力通道加权和可学习的时序注意力池化机制，处理原始加速度计数据。

Conclusion: SETransformer是HAR任务中高效且可解释的解决方案，适用于移动和泛在感知应用。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensor data has become a
central task in mobile computing, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.
Despite the success of traditional deep learning models such as CNNs and RNNs,
they often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and contextual
relevance across multiple sensor channels. To address these limitations, we
propose SETransformer, a hybrid deep neural architecture that combines
Transformer-based temporal modeling with channel-wise squeeze-and-excitation
(SE) attention and a learnable temporal attention pooling mechanism. The model
takes raw triaxial accelerometer data as input and leverages global
self-attention to capture activity-specific motion dynamics over extended time
windows, while adaptively emphasizing informative sensor channels and critical
time steps.
  We evaluate SETransformer on the WISDM dataset and demonstrate that it
significantly outperforms conventional models including LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and
CNN baselines. The proposed model achieves a validation accuracy of 84.68\% and
a macro F1-score of 84.64\%, surpassing all baseline architectures by a notable
margin. Our results show that SETransformer is a competitive and interpretable
solution for real-world HAR tasks, with strong potential for deployment in
mobile and ubiquitous sensing applications.

Result: 实验证明该方法在PKU-SafeRLHF数据集上有效，能够找到接近最优的约束LLM策略。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了约束对齐问题中的关键挑战，为LLM策略优化提供了理论支持和实践验证。

Abstract: We study the problem of computing an optimal large language model (LLM)
policy for a constrained alignment problem, where the goal is to maximize a
primary reward objective while satisfying constraints on secondary utilities.
Despite the popularity of Lagrangian-based LLM policy search in constrained
alignment, iterative primal-dual methods often fail to converge, and
non-iterative dual-based methods do not achieve optimality in the LLM parameter
space. To address these challenges, we employ Lagrangian duality to develop an
iterative dual-based alignment method that alternates between updating the LLM
policy via Lagrangian maximization and updating the dual variable via dual
descent. In theory, we characterize the primal-dual gap between the primal
value in the distribution space and the dual value in the LLM parameter space.
We further quantify the optimality gap of the learned LLM policies at
near-optimal dual variables with respect to both the objective and the
constraint functions. These results prove that dual-based alignment methods can
find an optimal constrained LLM policy, up to an LLM parametrization gap. We
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our approach through extensive
experiments conducted on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着TSFMs在零样本预测中的广泛应用，其对抗性鲁棒性问题尚未被充分研究，可能被用于中间人攻击或数据投毒。

Method: 通过系统实验评估代表性TSFMs和多个数据集，分析其对对抗性扰动的脆弱性，并探讨潜在改进设计。

Result: 实验表明，TSFMs对微小扰动高度敏感，可能导致预测行为的显著变化。

Conclusion: 研究为设计更鲁棒的预测系统提供了指导，并揭示了TSFMs在对抗性鲁棒性方面的不足。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), which are pretrained on large-scale,
cross-domain data and capable of zero-shot forecasting in new scenarios without
further training, are increasingly adopted in real-world applications. However,
as the zero-shot forecasting paradigm gets popular, a critical yet overlooked
question emerges: Are TSFMs robust to adversarial input perturbations? Such
perturbations could be exploited in man-in-the-middle attacks or data
poisoning. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic investigation into the
adversarial robustness of TSFMs. Our results show that even minimal
perturbations can induce significant and controllable changes in forecast
behaviors, including trend reversal, temporal drift, and amplitude shift,
posing serious risks to TSFM-based services. Through experiments on
representative TSFMs and multiple datasets, we reveal their consistent
vulnerabilities and identify potential architectural designs, such as
structural sparsity and multi-task pretraining, that may improve robustness.
Our findings offer actionable guidance for designing more resilient forecasting
systems and provide a critical assessment of the adversarial robustness of
TSFMs.

Result: TypiClust 在低预算 FAL 中表现优异，对分布偏移不敏感，且对特征提取方法的选择有一定鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TypiClust 是低预算 FAL 的有效策略，为有限数据场景下的 FAL 提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Federated Active Learning (FAL) seeks to reduce the burden of annotation
under the realistic constraints of federated learning by leveraging Active
Learning (AL). As FAL settings make it more expensive to obtain ground truth
labels, FAL strategies that work well in low-budget regimes, where the amount
of annotation is very limited, are needed. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of TypiClust, a successful low-budget AL strategy, in low-budget
FAL settings. Our empirical results show that TypiClust works well even in
low-budget FAL settings contrasted with relatively low performances of other
methods, although these settings present additional challenges, such as data
heterogeneity, compared to AL. In addition, we show that FAL settings cause
distribution shifts in terms of typicality, but TypiClust is not very
vulnerable to the shifts. We also analyze the sensitivity of TypiClust to
feature extraction methods, and it suggests a way to perform FAL even in
limited data situations.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理时间图中的未见链接时表现不佳，且依赖复杂模块。本文旨在通过简化架构并引入目标感知建模，提升预测性能。

Method: 提出CRAFT模型，利用可学习节点嵌入和交叉注意力机制，直接建模源节点与目标节点的兼容性，摒弃传统内存和聚合模块。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CRAFT表现优异且高效，适用于大规模实际应用。

Conclusion: CRAFT通过简洁设计实现了高性能，为时间图的未来链接预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Future link prediction on temporal graphs is a fundamental task with wide
applicability in real-world dynamic systems. These scenarios often involve both
recurring (seen) and novel (unseen) interactions, requiring models to
generalize effectively across both types of edges. However, existing methods
typically rely on complex memory and aggregation modules, yet struggle to
handle unseen edges. In this paper, we revisit the architecture of existing
temporal graph models and identify two essential but overlooked modeling
requirements for future link prediction: representing nodes with unique
identifiers and performing target-aware matching between source and destination
nodes. To this end, we propose Cross-Attention based Future Link Predictor on
Temporal Graphs (CRAFT), a simple yet effective architecture that discards
memory and aggregation modules and instead builds on two components: learnable
node embeddings and cross-attention between the destination and the source's
recent interactions. This design provides strong expressive power and enables
target-aware modeling of the compatibility between candidate destinations and
the source's interaction patterns. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate that CRAFT consistently achieves superior performance with high
efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale real-world applications.

Motivation: 传统ERL方法因评估大量无效候选策略而导致高计算成本和低效率，而现有代理模型难以处理高维策略表示。

Method: 使用AE压缩高维策略为低维表示，并利用HNN作为分类代理模型，预筛选策略以避免昂贵评估。

Result: 在10个Atari和4个Mujoco游戏中验证了方法的优越性，搜索轨迹在探索和收敛上更有效。

Conclusion: 本文首次提出了可学习的策略嵌入和代理建模模块，并实证了其成功条件。

Abstract: Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL), training the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) policies with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), have demonstrated
enhanced exploration capabilities and greater robustness than using traditional
policy gradient. However, ERL suffers from the high computational costs and low
search efficiency, as EAs require evaluating numerous candidate policies with
expensive simulations, many of which are ineffective and do not contribute
meaningfully to the training. One intuitive way to reduce the ineffective
evaluations is to adopt the surrogates. Unfortunately, existing ERL policies
are often modeled as deep neural networks (DNNs) and thus naturally represented
as high-dimensional vectors containing millions of weights, which makes the
building of effective surrogates for ERL policies extremely challenging. This
paper proposes a novel surrogate-assisted ERL that integrates Autoencoders (AE)
and Hyperbolic Neural Networks (HNN). Specifically, AE compresses
high-dimensional policies into low-dimensional representations while extracting
key features as the inputs for the surrogate. HNN, functioning as a
classification-based surrogate model, can learn complex nonlinear relationships
from sampled data and enable more accurate pre-selection of the sampled
policies without real evaluations. The experiments on 10 Atari and 4 Mujoco
games have verified that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches
significantly. The search trajectories guided by AE and HNN are also visually
demonstrated to be more effective, in terms of both exploration and
convergence. This paper not only presents the first learnable policy embedding
and surrogate-modeling modules for high-dimensional ERL policies, but also
empirically reveals when and why they can be successful.

TLDR: WINA提出了一种无需训练的稀疏激活框架，通过联合考虑隐藏状态幅度和权重矩阵的列范数，显著提升了LLM推理的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的计算需求增长使得高效推理和激活策略变得至关重要，现有方法仅依赖隐藏状态幅度导致高近似误差和次优推理精度。

Method: WINA框架联合使用隐藏状态幅度和权重矩阵的列范数来确定激活，无需训练即可实现稀疏化。

Result: WINA在相同稀疏度下优于现有方法（如TEAL），平均性能提升2.94%，并在理论上获得更紧的近似误差界限。

Conclusion: WINA为LLM推理中的训练无关稀疏激活设立了新的性能基准，推动了高效推理的发展。

Abstract: The growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs) make
efficient inference and activation strategies increasingly critical. While
recent approaches, such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), leverage selective
activation but require specialized training, training-free sparse activation
methods offer broader applicability and superior resource efficiency through
their plug-and-play design. However, many existing methods rely solely on
hidden state magnitudes to determine activation, resulting in high
approximation errors and suboptimal inference accuracy. To address these
limitations, we propose WINA (Weight Informed Neuron Activation), a novel,
simple, and training-free sparse activation framework that jointly considers
hidden state magnitudes and the column-wise $\ell_2$-norms of weight matrices.
We show that this leads to a sparsification strategy that obtains optimal
approximation error bounds with theoretical guarantees tighter than existing
techniques. Empirically, WINA also outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g.,
TEAL) by up to $2.94\%$ in average performance at the same sparsity levels,
across a diverse set of LLM architectures and datasets. These results position
WINA as a new performance frontier for training-free sparse activation in LLM
inference, advancing training-free sparse activation methods and setting a
robust baseline for efficient inference. The source code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在缺乏目标分布样本时，常使用反向KL目标，导致模式覆盖不完整。本文旨在通过前向KL目标实现更全面的模式覆盖。

Method: 提出了重要性加权分数匹配方法，通过重要性采样估计重新加权分数匹配损失，优化前向KL目标。

Conclusion: 该方法通过前向KL目标实现了更好的模式覆盖，实验证明了其优越性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Training neural samplers directly from unnormalized densities without access
to target distribution samples presents a significant challenge. A critical
desideratum in these settings is achieving comprehensive mode coverage,
ensuring the sampler captures the full diversity of the target distribution.
However, prevailing methods often circumvent the lack of target data by
optimizing reverse KL-based objectives. Such objectives inherently exhibit
mode-seeking behavior, potentially leading to incomplete representation of the
underlying distribution. While alternative approaches strive for better mode
coverage, they typically rely on implicit mechanisms like heuristics or
iterative refinement. In this work, we propose a principled approach for
training diffusion-based samplers by directly targeting an objective analogous
to the forward KL divergence, which is conceptually known to encourage mode
coverage. We introduce \textit{Importance Weighted Score Matching}, a method
that optimizes this desired mode-covering objective by re-weighting the score
matching loss using tractable importance sampling estimates, thereby overcoming
the absence of target distribution data. We also provide theoretical analysis
of the bias and variance for our proposed Monte Carlo estimator and the
practical loss function used in our method. Experiments on increasingly complex
multi-modal distributions, including 2D Gaussian Mixture Models with up to 120
modes and challenging particle systems with inherent symmetries -- demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms existing neural samplers across all
distributional distance metrics, achieving state-of-the-art results on all
benchmarks.

Abstract: Reliable long-term forecast of Earth system dynamics is heavily hampered by
instabilities in current AI models during extended autoregressive simulations.
These failures often originate from inherent spectral bias, leading to
inadequate representation of critical high-frequency, small-scale processes and
subsequent uncontrolled error amplification. We present Triton, an AI framework
designed to address this fundamental challenge. Inspired by increasing grids to
explicitly resolve small scales in numerical models, Triton employs a
hierarchical architecture processing information across multiple resolutions to
mitigate spectral bias and explicitly model cross-scale dynamics. We
demonstrate Triton's superior performance on challenging forecast tasks,
achieving stable year-long global temperature forecasts, skillful Kuroshio eddy
predictions till 120 days, and high-fidelity turbulence simulations preserving
fine-scale structures all without external forcing, with significantly
surpassing baseline AI models in long-term stability and accuracy. By
effectively suppressing high-frequency error accumulation, Triton offers a
promising pathway towards trustworthy AI-driven simulation for climate and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩基准仅关注语言建模和自然语言理解任务，忽略了代理能力（如工作流、工具使用等），因此需要全面评估压缩对代理能力的影响。

Method: ACBench包含12个任务、4种能力（如工作流生成、长上下文检索），测试了量化和剪枝方法，并评估了15个模型。

Result: 实验表明，4位量化对工作流和工具使用影响较小（1%-3%下降），但对实际应用准确性下降较大（10%-15%）。

Conclusion: ACBench为代理场景下的LLM压缩优化提供了实用见解，并提出了ERank等分析方法。

Abstract: Post-training compression reduces the computational and memory costs of large
language models (LLMs), enabling resource-efficient deployment. However,
existing compression benchmarks only focus on language modeling (e.g.,
perplexity) and natural language understanding tasks (e.g., GLUE accuracy),
ignoring the agentic capabilities - workflow, tool use/function call,
long-context understanding and real-world application. We introduce the Agent
Compression Benchmark (ACBench), the first comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating how compression impacts LLMs' agentic abilities. ACBench spans (1)
12 tasks across 4 capabilities (e.g., WorfBench for workflow generation,
Needle-in-Haystack for long-context retrieval), (2) quantization (GPTQ, AWQ)
and pruning (Wanda, SparseGPT), and (3) 15 models, including small (Gemma-2B),
standard (Qwen2.5 7B-32B), and distilled reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-Distill).
Our experiments reveal compression tradeoffs: 4-bit quantization preserves
workflow generation and tool use (1%-3% drop) but degrades real-world
application accuracy by 10%-15%. We introduce ERank, Top-k Ranking Correlation
and Energy to systematize analysis. ACBench provides actionable insights for
optimizing LLM compression in agentic scenarios. The code can be found in

Conclusion: MetaGMT通过提高解释可靠性，为GNN在敏感领域的部署提供了更可信和可操作的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in high-stakes domains
like healthcare and finance demands reliable explanations of their
decision-making processes. While inherently interpretable GNN architectures
like Graph Multi-linear Networks (GMT) have emerged, they remain vulnerable to
generating explanations based on spurious correlations, potentially undermining
trust in critical applications. We present MetaGMT, a meta-learning framework
that enhances explanation fidelity through a novel bi-level optimization
approach. We demonstrate that MetaGMT significantly improves both explanation
quality (AUC-ROC, Precision@K) and robustness to spurious patterns, across
BA-2Motifs, MUTAG, and SP-Motif benchmarks. Our approach maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing more faithful explanations (with an
increase up to 8% of Explanation ROC on SP-Motif 0.5) compared to baseline
methods. These advancements in interpretability could enable safer deployment
of GNNs in sensitive domains by (1) facilitating model debugging through more
reliable explanations, (2) supporting targeted retraining when biases are
identified, and (3) enabling meaningful human oversight. By addressing the
critical challenge of explanation reliability, our work contributes to building
more trustworthy and actionable GNN systems for real-world applications.

Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily
progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit
an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable
insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on
idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in
standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these
energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference
dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider
relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in
energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures
capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy
function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that
normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues,
forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances
inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to
develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring
inference dynamics.

Conclusion: EB-JDAT成功解决了分类精度、生成能力和对抗鲁棒性之间的权衡问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Joint Energy-based Models (JEMs), a class of hybrid generative-discriminative
models, are well known for their ability to achieve both high classification
accuracy and generative capability within a single model. However, their
robustness still lags significantly behind the classifiers based adversarial
training (AT). Conversely, while AT is currently the most effective approach to
improving the classifier's robustness, it typically sacrifices accuracy on
clean data and lacks generative capability. The triple trade-off between
classification accuracy, generative capability and robustness, raises a natural
question: Can a single model simultaneously achieve high classification
accuracy, adversarial robustness, and generative performance? -- a goal that
has been rarely explored. To address this question, we systematically analyze
the energy distribution differences of clean, adversarial, and generated
samples across various JEM variants and adversarially trained models. We
observe that AT tends to reduce the energy gap between clean and adversarial
samples, while JEMs reduce the gap between clean and synthetic ones. This
observation suggests a key insight: if the energy distributions of all three
data types can be aligned, we might unify the strengths of AT and JEMs,
resolving their inherent trade-offs. Building on this idea, we propose
Energy-based Joint Distribution Adversarial Training (EB-JDAT), to jointly
model the clean data distribution, the adversarial distribution, and the
classifier by maximizing their joint probability. EB-JDAT is a general and
flexible optimization method, compatible with various JEM variants. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that EB-JDAT not only maintains near original
accuracy and generative capability of JEMs, but also significantly enhances
robustness, even surpassing state-of-the-art ATs.

Abstract: This letter proposes a deep-learning (DL)-based multi-user channel state
information (CSI) feedback framework for massive multiple-input multiple-output
systems, where the deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) is utilized to
improve the CSI reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, we design a multi-user
joint CSI feedback framework, whereby the CSI correlation of nearby users is
utilized to reduce the feedback overhead. Under the framework, we propose a new
residual cross-attention transformer architecture, which is deployed at the
base station to further improve the CSI feedback performance. Moreover, to
tackle the "cliff-effect" of conventional bit-level CSI feedback approaches, we
integrated DJSCC into the multi-user CSI feedback, together with utilizing a
two-stage training scheme to adapt to varying uplink noise levels. Experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of our methods in CSI feedback performance,
with low network complexity and better scalability.

Abstract: Dataset distillation enables the training of deep neural networks with
comparable performance in significantly reduced time by compressing large
datasets into small and representative ones. Although the introduction of
generative models has made great achievements in this field, the distributions
of their distilled datasets are not diverse enough to represent the original
ones, leading to a decrease in downstream validation accuracy. In this paper,
we present a diversity-driven generative dataset distillation method based on a
diffusion model to solve this problem. We introduce self-adaptive memory to
align the distribution between distilled and real datasets, assessing the
representativeness. The degree of alignment leads the diffusion model to
generate more diverse datasets during the distillation process. Extensive
experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in most situations, proving its ability to tackle dataset distillation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际应用（如高频交易和实时竞技游戏）需要严格延迟约束下的决策，但LLM代理在此领域的延迟与质量权衡尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入两个新基准测试（HFTBench和StreetFighter），并提出FPX框架，动态调整模型大小和量化级别以适应实时需求。

Result: FPX在StreetFighter中提升胜率80%，在高频交易中提高日收益率26.52%。

Conclusion: 延迟感知的评估和部署策略对LLM代理至关重要，FPX框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse
reasoning and generation tasks, and are increasingly deployed as agents in
dynamic environments such as code generation and recommendation systems.
However, many real-world applications, such as high-frequency trading and
real-time competitive gaming, require decisions under strict latency
constraints, where faster responses directly translate into higher rewards.
Despite the importance of this latency quality trade off, it remains
underexplored in the context of LLM based agents. In this work, we present the
first systematic study of this trade off in real time decision making tasks. To
support our investigation, we introduce two new benchmarks: HFTBench, a high
frequency trading simulation, and StreetFighter, a competitive gaming platform.
Our analysis reveals that optimal latency quality balance varies by task, and
that sacrificing quality for lower latency can significantly enhance downstream
performance. To address this, we propose FPX, an adaptive framework that
dynamically selects model size and quantization level based on real time
demands. Our method achieves the best performance on both benchmarks, improving
win rate by up to 80% in Street Fighter and boosting daily yield by up to
26.52% in trading, underscoring the need for latency aware evaluation and
deployment strategies for LLM based agents. These results demonstrate the
critical importance of latency aware evaluation and deployment strategies for
real world LLM based agents. Our benchmarks are available at Latency Sensitive
Benchmarks.

Motivation: 旨在通过心理学中的联想记忆概念，深入理解Transformer架构的工作原理，并探索其潜在改进空间。

Method: 从联想记忆的基础出发，引入检索信噪比（SNR）衡量记忆容量，并通过核视角分析Softmax Attention的有效性；同时提出统一框架分析不同Transformer变体的记忆更新机制。

Result: 揭示了Softmax Attention的高效性，并提出FFN可视为联想记忆的观点；探讨了Transformer的表达限制和无限上下文下的潜力。

Conclusion: 论文为Transformer架构提供了新的理解视角，并激发了未来创新的可能性。

Abstract: In this paper, we share our reflections and insights on understanding
Transformer architectures through the lens of associative memory--a classic
psychological concept inspired by human cognition. We start with the basics of
associative memory (think simple linear attention) and then dive into two
dimensions:
  Memory Capacity: How much can a Transformer really remember, and how well? We
introduce retrieval SNR to measure this and use a kernel perspective to
mathematically reveal why Softmax Attention is so effective. We also show how
FFNs can be seen as a type of associative memory, leading to insights on their
design and potential improvements.
  Memory Update: How do these memories learn and evolve? We present a unified
framework for understanding how different Transformer variants (like DeltaNet
and Softmax Attention) update their "knowledge base". This leads us to tackle
two provocative questions: 1. Are Transformers fundamentally limited in what
they can express, and can we break these barriers? 2. If a Transformer had
infinite context, would it become infinitely intelligent?
  We want to demystify Transformer architecture, offering a clearer
understanding of existing designs. This exploration aims to provide fresh
insights and spark new avenues for Transformer innovation.

Motivation: 在非平稳环境中，近期历史比远期历史更重要，但实际场景中折扣因子λ往往未知，因此需要开发能自适应未知λ的算法。

Result: SOGD实现了对所有连续区间内λ值的统一O(√(log T/(1-λ)))折扣遗憾。

Conclusion: 本文证明了自适应未知折扣因子的可行性，并通过SOGD和DNP的组合提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reflecting the greater significance of recent history over the distant past
in non-stationary environments, $\lambda$-discounted regret has been introduced
in online convex optimization (OCO) to gracefully forget past data as new
information arrives. When the discount factor $\lambda$ is given, online
gradient descent with an appropriate step size achieves an
$O(1/\sqrt{1-\lambda})$ discounted regret. However, the value of $\lambda$ is
often not predetermined in real-world scenarios. This gives rise to a
significant open question: is it possible to develop a discounted algorithm
that adapts to an unknown discount factor. In this paper, we affirmatively
answer this question by providing a novel analysis to demonstrate that smoothed
OGD (SOGD) achieves a uniform $O(\sqrt{\log T/1-\lambda})$ discounted regret,
holding for all values of $\lambda$ across a continuous interval
simultaneously. The basic idea is to maintain multiple OGD instances to handle
different discount factors, and aggregate their outputs sequentially by an
online prediction algorithm named as Discounted-Normal-Predictor (DNP)
(Kapralov and Panigrahy,2010). Our analysis reveals that DNP can combine the
decisions of two experts, even when they operate on discounted regret with
different discount factors.

Motivation: 现有保护方法（如水印）无法有效防止仅通过观察输出文本的知识蒸馏，需在API访问的现实约束下主动保护LLM。

Method: 通过对抗性损失微调教师LLM的最后一层线性层，生成防御性输出，干扰蒸馏过程。

Result: 实验表明，防御性输出显著降低了学生模型的性能，同时保持或提升教师模型的原始性能。

Conclusion: DOGe是一种实用且高效的保护方法，能有效防止基于知识蒸馏的模型模仿。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent substantial intellectual and economic
investments, yet their effectiveness can inadvertently facilitate model
imitation via knowledge distillation (KD).In practical scenarios, competitors
can distill proprietary LLM capabilities by simply observing publicly
accessible outputs, akin to reverse-engineering a complex performance by
observation alone. Existing protective methods like watermarking only identify
imitation post-hoc, while other defenses assume the student model mimics the
teacher's internal logits, rendering them ineffective against distillation
purely from observed output text. This paper confronts the challenge of
actively protecting LLMs within the realistic constraints of API-based access.
We introduce an effective and efficient Defensive Output Generation (DOGe)
strategy that subtly modifies the output behavior of an LLM. Its outputs remain
accurate and useful for legitimate users, yet are designed to be misleading for
distillation, significantly undermining imitation attempts. We achieve this by
fine-tuning only the final linear layer of the teacher LLM with an adversarial
loss. This targeted training approach anticipates and disrupts distillation
attempts during inference time. Our experiments show that, while preserving or
even improving the original performance of the teacher model, student models
distilled from the defensively generated teacher outputs demonstrate
catastrophically reduced performance, demonstrating our method's effectiveness
as a practical safeguard against KD-based model imitation.

Motivation: 现有基准未能反映多模态知识冲突的实际场景，尤其是上下文与记忆间的冲突。

Method: 提出MMKC-Bench，包含1,573个知识实例和3,381张图像，涵盖三种冲突类型。

Result: 当前LMMs能识别冲突，但更倾向于内部知识而非外部证据。

Conclusion: MMKC-Bench有望推动多模态知识冲突研究，提升RAG系统发展。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models(LMMs) face notable challenges when encountering
multimodal knowledge conflicts, particularly under retrieval-augmented
generation(RAG) frameworks where the contextual information from external
sources may contradict the model's internal parametric knowledge, leading to
unreliable outputs. However, existing benchmarks fail to reflect such realistic
conflict scenarios. Most focus solely on intra-memory conflicts, while
context-memory and inter-context conflicts remain largely investigated.
Furthermore, commonly used factual knowledge-based evaluations are often
overlooked, and existing datasets lack a thorough investigation into conflict
detection capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose MMKC-Bench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate factual knowledge conflicts in both context-memory and
inter-context scenarios. MMKC-Bench encompasses three types of multimodal
knowledge conflicts and includes 1,573 knowledge instances and 3,381 images
across 23 broad types, collected through automated pipelines with human
verification. We evaluate three representative series of LMMs on both model
behavior analysis and conflict detection tasks. Our findings show that while
current LMMs are capable of recognizing knowledge conflicts, they tend to favor
internal parametric knowledge over external evidence. We hope MMKC-Bench will
foster further research in multimodal knowledge conflict and enhance the
development of multimodal RAG systems. The source code is available at

Conclusion: Conf-SMoE通过理论分析和实证解决了缺失模态问题，为多模态学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Effectively managing missing modalities is a fundamental challenge in
real-world multimodal learning scenarios, where data incompleteness often
results from systematic collection errors or sensor failures. Sparse
Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have the potential to naturally handle
multimodal data, with individual experts specializing in different modalities.
However, existing SMoE approach often lacks proper ability to handle missing
modality, leading to performance degradation and poor generalization in
real-world applications. We propose Conf-SMoE to introduce a two-stage
imputation module to handle the missing modality problem for the SMoE
architecture and reveal the insight of expert collapse from theoretical
analysis with strong empirical evidence. Inspired by our theoretical analysis,
Conf-SMoE propose a novel expert gating mechanism by detaching the softmax
routing score to task confidence score w.r.t ground truth. This naturally
relieves expert collapse without introducing additional load balance loss
function. We show that the insights of expert collapse aligns with other gating
mechanism such as Gaussian and Laplacian gate. We also evaluate the proposed
method on four different real world dataset with three different experiment
settings to conduct comprehensive the analysis of Conf-SMoE on modality fusion
and resistance to missing modality.

Conclusion: 提出的优化器通过球体滚动模拟有效改善了训练动态和泛化性能，同时为理解损失曲面几何提供了工具。

Abstract: Training large neural networks through gradient-based optimization requires
navigating high-dimensional loss landscapes, which often exhibit pathological
geometry, leading to undesirable training dynamics. In particular, poor
generalization frequently results from convergence to sharp minima that are
highly sensitive to input perturbations, causing the model to overfit the
training data while failing to generalize to unseen examples. Furthermore,
these optimization procedures typically display strong dependence on the fine
structure of the loss landscape, leading to unstable training dynamics, due to
the fractal-like nature of the loss surface. In this work, we propose an
alternative optimizer that simultaneously reduces this dependence, and avoids
sharp minima, thereby improving generalization. This is achieved by simulating
the motion of the center of a ball rolling on the loss landscape. The degree to
which our optimizer departs from the standard gradient descent is controlled by
a hyperparameter, representing the radius of the ball. Changing this
hyperparameter allows for probing the loss landscape at different scales,
making it a valuable tool for understanding its geometry.

Motivation: 探索单头softmax注意力机制在解决简单布尔函数任务时的能力极限，并揭示其与理想监督和标准训练之间的差距。

Method: 使用单头softmax注意力机制，结合教师强制（teacher forcing）进行训练。

Result: 单头softmax注意力机制在教师强制下可以解决AND和OR函数，而单独使用时无法解决。

Conclusion: 解决布尔任务仅需简约注意力机制，无需深度Transformer或FFN；教师强制下的单步梯度下降可替代多步推理。

Abstract: We study the computational limits of learning $k$-bit Boolean functions
(specifically, $\mathrm{AND}$, $\mathrm{OR}$, and their noisy variants), using
a minimalist single-head softmax-attention mechanism, where $k=\Theta(d)$
relevant bits are selected from $d$ inputs. We show that these simple
$\mathrm{AND}$ and $\mathrm{OR}$ functions are unsolvable with a single-head
softmax-attention mechanism alone. However, with teacher forcing, the same
minimalist attention is capable of solving them. These findings offer two key
insights: Architecturally, solving these Boolean tasks requires only minimalist
attention, without deep Transformer blocks or FFNs. Methodologically, one
gradient descent update with supervision suffices and replaces the multi-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning scheme of [Kim and Suzuki, ICLR 2025] for
solving Boolean problems. Together, the bounds expose a fundamental gap between
what this minimal architecture achieves under ideal supervision and what is
provably impossible under standard training.

Conclusion: SCAB攻击表明，在不可信的RL训练供应链中，后门攻击可能成为现实威胁。

Abstract: The current state-of-the-art backdoor attacks against Reinforcement Learning
(RL) rely upon unrealistically permissive access models, that assume the
attacker can read (or even write) the victim's policy parameters, observations,
or rewards. In this work, we question whether such a strong assumption is
required to launch backdoor attacks against RL. To answer this question, we
propose the \underline{S}upply-\underline{C}h\underline{a}in
\underline{B}ackdoor (SCAB) attack, which targets a common RL workflow:
training agents using external agents that are provided separately or embedded
within the environment. In contrast to prior works, our attack only relies on
legitimate interactions of the RL agent with the supplied agents. Despite this
limited access model, by poisoning a mere $3\%$ of training experiences, our
attack can successfully activate over $90\%$ of triggered actions, reducing the
average episodic return by $80\%$ for the victim. Our novel attack demonstrates
that RL attacks are likely to become a reality under untrusted RL training
supply-chains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in ex-ante
reasoning, where analysis, inference, or predictions must be made without
access to information from future events. Even with explicit prompts enforcing
temporal cutoffs, LLMs often generate outputs influenced by internalized
knowledge of events beyond the specified cutoff. This paper introduces a novel
task and benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to reason while
adhering to such temporal constraints. The benchmark includes a variety of
tasks: stock prediction, Wikipedia event prediction, scientific publication
prediction, and Question Answering (QA), designed to assess factual knowledge
under temporal cutoff constraints. We use leakage rate to quantify models'
reliance on future information beyond cutoff timestamps. Experimental results
reveal that LLMs struggle to consistently adhere to temporal cutoffs across
common prompting strategies and tasks, demonstrating persistent challenges in
ex-ante reasoning. This benchmark provides a potential evaluation framework to
advance the development of LLMs' temporal reasoning ability for time-sensitive
applications.

predictable ways based on prior performance. However, in reality, learners'
abilities change irregularly due to factors like cognitive fatigue, motivation,
and external stress -- a task introduced, which we refer to as Real-time
Learning Pattern Adjustment (RLPA). Existing KT models, when faced with RLPA,
lack sufficient adaptability, because they fail to timely account for the
dynamic nature of different learners' evolving learning patterns. Current
strategies for enhancing adaptability rely on retraining, which leads to
significant overfitting and high time overhead issues. To address this, we
propose Cuff-KT, comprising a controller and a generator. The controller
assigns value scores to learners, while the generator generates personalized
parameters for selected learners. Cuff-KT controllably adapts to data changes
fast and flexibly without fine-tuning. Experiments on five datasets from
different subjects demonstrate that Cuff-KT significantly improves the
performance of five KT models with different structures under intra- and
inter-learner shifts, with an average relative increase in AUC of 10% and 4%,
respectively, at a negligible time cost, effectively tackling RLPA task. Our
code and datasets are fully available at https://github.com/zyy-2001/Cuff-KT.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为STRAP的时空检索增强模式学习框架，通过整合检索增强学习提升STGNN在时空分布外（STOOD）场景中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决STGNN在时空分布外场景中泛化能力不足的问题。

Result: 在多个真实世界流图数据集上，STRAP显著优于现有STGNN基线。

Conclusion: STRAP展示了强大的泛化能力和适应性，无需任务特定微调。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful
tool for modeling dynamic graph-structured data across diverse domains.
However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution
(STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve
beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an
innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning
framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating
retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The
core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores
representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural,
and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training
phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library
based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a
plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal
representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP
introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with
retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming
graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN
baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and
strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: 在标准基准测试中显著提高了样本效率，并在高维问题和分子构象生成中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了扩散采样器的性能和适用范围。

Abstract: We address the challenge of training diffusion models to sample from
unnormalized energy distributions in the absence of data, the so-called
diffusion samplers. Although these approaches have shown promise, they struggle
to scale in more demanding scenarios where energy evaluations are expensive and
the sampling space is high-dimensional. To address this limitation, we propose
a scalable and sample-efficient framework that properly harmonizes the powerful
classical sampling method and the diffusion sampler. Specifically, we utilize
Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) samplers with a novelty-based auxiliary energy
as a Searcher to collect off-policy samples, using an auxiliary energy function
to compensate for exploring modes the diffusion sampler rarely visits. These
off-policy samples are then combined with on-policy data to train the diffusion
sampler, thereby expanding its coverage of the energy landscape. Furthermore,
we identify primacy bias, i.e., the preference of samplers for early experience
during training, as the main cause of mode collapse during training, and
introduce a periodic re-initialization trick to resolve this issue. Our method
significantly improves sample efficiency on standard benchmarks for diffusion
samplers and also excels at higher-dimensional problems and real-world
molecular conformer generation.

Conclusion: Lego sketch在扩展性和准确性上表现优异，优于现有手绘和神经草图。

Abstract: Sketches, probabilistic structures for estimating item frequencies in
infinite data streams with limited space, are widely used across various
domains. Recent studies have shifted the focus from handcrafted sketches to
neural sketches, leveraging memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) to enhance
the streaming compression capabilities and achieve better space-accuracy
trade-offs.However, existing neural sketches struggle to scale across different
data domains and space budgets due to inflexible MANN configurations. In this
paper, we introduce a scalable MANN architecture that brings to life the {\it
Lego sketch}, a novel sketch with superior scalability and accuracy. Much like
assembling creations with modular Lego bricks, the Lego sketch dynamically
coordinates multiple memory bricks to adapt to various space budgets and
diverse data domains. Our theoretical analysis guarantees its high scalability
and provides the first error bound for neural sketch. Furthermore, extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the Lego sketch exhibits superior
space-accuracy trade-offs, outperforming existing handcrafted and neural
sketches. Our code is available at https://github.com/FFY0/LegoSketch_ICML.

TLDR: 提出了一种高精度稀疏注意力机制，通过跨头共享精确的注意力模式，显著提升了长上下文推理的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法依赖预定义模式或不准确估计，无法完全捕捉注意力的真实动态，导致效率和准确性下降。

Method: 基于两个关键观察（注意力模式在头间高度相似且输入间一致），提出跨头共享精确注意力模式的方法，仅需对少量头进行完整注意力计算。

Result: 在保持或优于现有方法速度的同时，实现了最佳整体准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过共享精确注意力模式，有效平衡了效率与准确性，为长上下文推理提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse attention methods exploit the inherent sparsity in attention to speed
up the prefilling phase of long-context inference, mitigating the quadratic
complexity of full attention computation. While existing sparse attention
methods rely on predefined patterns or inaccurate estimations to approximate
attention behavior, they often fail to fully capture the true dynamics of
attention, resulting in reduced efficiency and compromised accuracy. Instead,
we propose a highly accurate sparse attention mechanism that shares similar yet
precise attention patterns across heads, enabling a more realistic capture of
the dynamic behavior of attention. Our approach is grounded in two key
observations: (1) attention patterns demonstrate strong inter-head similarity,
and (2) this similarity remains remarkably consistent across diverse inputs. By
strategically sharing computed accurate patterns across attention heads, our
method effectively captures actual patterns while requiring full attention
computation for only a small subset of heads. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior or comparable speedup relative
to state-of-the-art methods while delivering the best overall accuracy.

*Shadi Alijani,Homayoun Najjaran*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了两种方法（RLSCP和WQLCP）来改进共形预测（CP）在分布偏移下的表现，WQLCP通过加权交换性进一步优化了RLSCP，实验证明其优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中数据分布偏移会破坏交换性假设，导致共形预测的覆盖率和预测集不可靠。

Method: 1. 提出RLSCP，利用VAE的重构损失作为不确定性度量；2. 提出WQLCP，引入加权交换性调整分位数阈值。

Result: WQLCP在ImageNet等数据集上表现优于基线，保持覆盖率的同时减小预测集大小。

Conclusion: WQLCP为分布偏移下的共形预测提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides a framework for constructing prediction
sets with guaranteed coverage, assuming exchangeable data. However, real-world
scenarios often involve distribution shifts that violate exchangeability,
leading to unreliable coverage and inflated prediction sets. To address this
challenge, we first introduce Reconstruction Loss-Scaled Conformal Prediction
(RLSCP), which utilizes reconstruction losses derived from a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) as an uncertainty metric to scale score functions. While
RLSCP demonstrates performance improvements, mainly resulting in better
coverage, it quantifies quantiles based on a fixed calibration dataset without
considering the discrepancies between test and train datasets in an
unexchangeable setting. In the next step, we propose Weighted Quantile
Loss-scaled Conformal Prediction (WQLCP), which refines RLSCP by incorporating
a weighted notion of exchangeability, adjusting the calibration quantile
threshold based on weights with respect to the ratio of calibration and test
loss values. This approach improves the CP-generated prediction set outputs in
the presence of distribution shifts. Experiments on large-scale datasets,
including ImageNet variants, demonstrate that WQLCP outperforms existing
baselines by consistently maintaining coverage while reducing prediction set
sizes, providing a robust solution for CP under distribution shifts.

TLDR: 提出了一种通用的、模型无关的差分隐私框架，用于估计平均处理效应（ATE），避免了强结构假设，并通过扰动预测和聚合步骤实现隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学、经济学和社会科学等领域，从观测数据中估计因果效应至关重要，但隐私问题突出。现有方法通常直接对干扰组件进行隐私化处理，导致隐私成本随模型复杂度增加。

Method: 提出了一种框架，将干扰估计与隐私保护分离，利用灵活的先进黑盒模型，并通过扰动预测和聚合步骤实现差分隐私。具体应用于G-formula、IPW和AIPW三种经典估计器。

Result: 在现实隐私预算下，方法保持竞争力，并扩展支持多私有ATE估计的元分析。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了因果推断与隐私保护数据分析之间的关键空白。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is essential in fields such
as medicine, economics and social sciences, where privacy concerns are
paramount. We propose a general, model-agnostic framework for differentially
private estimation of average treatment effects (ATE) that avoids strong
structural assumptions on the data-generating process or the models used to
estimate propensity scores and conditional outcomes. In contrast to prior work,
which enforces differential privacy by directly privatizing these nuisance
components and results in a privacy cost that scales with model complexity, our
approach decouples nuisance estimation from privacy protection. This separation
allows the use of flexible, state-of-the-art black-box models, while
differential privacy is achieved by perturbing only predictions and aggregation
steps within a fold-splitting scheme with ensemble techniques. We instantiate
the framework for three classical estimators -- the G-formula, inverse
propensity weighting (IPW), and augmented IPW (AIPW) -- and provide formal
utility and privacy guarantees. Empirical results show that our methods
maintain competitive performance under realistic privacy budgets. We further
extend our framework to support meta-analysis of multiple private ATE
estimates. Our results bridge a critical gap between causal inference and
privacy-preserving data analysis.

Motivation: 传统RLVR方法依赖昂贵且领域特定的监督信号，限制了其应用范围。RLIF旨在通过内部信号实现无监督学习，减少对外部奖励的依赖。

Method: 提出Intuitor方法，利用模型的自信度（self-certainty）作为奖励信号，替代GRPO中的外部奖励，实现完全无监督学习。

Result: Intuitor在数学任务上与GRPO表现相当，在代码生成等任务上泛化能力更强，且无需黄金解决方案或测试用例。

Conclusion: 内部信号可以驱动跨领域的有效学习，为无验证奖励的自主AI系统提供了可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for complex reasoning via Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is effective but limited by reliance on
costly, domain-specific supervision. We explore Reinforcement Learning from
Internal Feedback (RLIF), a framework that enables LLMs to learn from intrinsic
signals without external rewards or labeled data. We propose Intuitor, an RLIF
method that uses a model's own confidence, termed self-certainty, as its sole
reward signal. Intuitor replaces external rewards in Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with self-certainty scores, enabling fully unsupervised
learning. Experiments demonstrate that Intuitor matches GRPO's performance on
mathematical benchmarks while achieving superior generalization to
out-of-domain tasks like code generation, without requiring gold solutions or
test cases. Our findings show that intrinsic model signals can drive effective
learning across domains, offering a scalable alternative to RLVR for autonomous
AI systems where verifiable rewards are unavailable. Code is available at

TLDR: 本文提出了一种广义的DPO损失函数（BPO），通过比率匹配实现目标策略的最优性，同时保持了简单性和理论保证。BPO框架包含DPO作为特例，并在实验中表现出优于DPO的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如f-PO无法同时满足简单性和理论保证，因此需要一种更通用的框架来优化目标策略。

Method: 提出了Bregman偏好优化（BPO），一种基于比率匹配的广义框架，并开发了梯度缩放方法SBA。

Result: BPO在实验中同时提高了生成保真度和多样性，并在Llama-3-8B上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BPO是一种通用且高效的框架，适用于多种目标策略，并显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) is widely used as a simple and stable
method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. This
paper investigates a generalized DPO loss that enables a policy model to match
the target policy from a likelihood ratio estimation perspective. The ratio of
the target policy provides a unique identification of the policy distribution
without relying on reward models or partition functions. This allows the
generalized loss to retain both simplicity and theoretical guarantees, which
prior work such as $f$-PO fails to achieve simultaneously. We propose Bregman
preference optimization (BPO), a generalized framework for ratio matching that
provides a family of objective functions achieving target policy optimality.
BPO subsumes DPO as a special case and offers tractable forms for all
instances, allowing implementation with a few lines of code. We further develop
scaled Basu's power divergence (SBA), a gradient scaling method that can be
used for BPO instances. The BPO framework complements other DPO variants and is
applicable to target policies defined by these variants. In experiments, unlike
other probabilistic loss extensions such as $f$-DPO or $f$-PO, which exhibit a
trade-off between generation fidelity and diversity, instances of BPO improve
both win rate and entropy compared with DPO. When applied to
Llama-3-Instruct-8B, BPO achieves state-of-the-art performance among Llama-3-8B
backbones, with a 55.9\% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.

TLDR: ScaleKV是一种针对VAR模型的KV缓存压缩框架，通过分层和分尺度优化，显著减少内存消耗和计算冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型的粗到细方法导致KV缓存在推理时指数增长，带来高内存和计算成本。

Method: ScaleKV将Transformer层分为drafters和refiners两类，根据注意力模式和缓存需求进行差异化缓存管理。

Result: 在Infinity模型上测试，ScaleKV将KV缓存内存降至10%，同时保持像素级保真度。

Conclusion: ScaleKV有效解决了VAR模型的KV缓存问题，提升了效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling has garnered significant attention for
its innovative next-scale prediction approach, which yields substantial
improvements in efficiency, scalability, and zero-shot generalization.
Nevertheless, the coarse-to-fine methodology inherent in VAR results in
exponential growth of the KV cache during inference, causing considerable
memory consumption and computational redundancy. To address these bottlenecks,
we introduce ScaleKV, a novel KV cache compression framework tailored for VAR
architectures. ScaleKV leverages two critical observations: varying cache
demands across transformer layers and distinct attention patterns at different
scales. Based on these insights, ScaleKV categorizes transformer layers into
two functional groups: drafters and refiners. Drafters exhibit dispersed
attention across multiple scales, thereby requiring greater cache capacity.
Conversely, refiners focus attention on the current token map to process local
details, consequently necessitating substantially reduced cache capacity.
ScaleKV optimizes the multi-scale inference pipeline by identifying
scale-specific drafters and refiners, facilitating differentiated cache
management tailored to each scale. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art
text-to-image VAR model family, Infinity, demonstrates that our approach
effectively reduces the required KV cache memory to 10% while preserving
pixel-level fidelity.

Motivation: 解决异构（非独立同分布）数据下联邦学习因客户端漂移导致的收敛缓慢问题。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，Kuramoto-FedAvg显著加速收敛并提高准确性。

Conclusion: 同步策略在非独立同分布场景下有效管理梯度多样性，加速联邦学习优化。

Abstract: Federated learning on heterogeneous (non-IID) client data experiences slow
convergence due to client drift. To address this challenge, we propose
Kuramoto-FedAvg, a federated optimization algorithm that reframes the weight
aggregation step as a synchronization problem inspired by the Kuramoto model of
coupled oscillators. The server dynamically weighs each client's update based
on its phase alignment with the global update, amplifying contributions that
align with the global gradient direction while minimizing the impact of updates
that are out of phase. We theoretically prove that this synchronization
mechanism reduces client drift, providing a tighter convergence bound compared
to the standard FedAvg under heterogeneous data distributions. Empirical
validation supports our theoretical findings, showing that Kuramoto-FedAvg
significantly accelerates convergence and improves accuracy across multiple
benchmark datasets. Our work highlights the potential of coordination and
synchronization-based strategies for managing gradient diversity and
accelerating federated optimization in realistic non-IID settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法依赖不确定的预测且计算效率低，EPOTTA旨在通过能量框架解决这些问题。

Result: 实验表明EPOTTA性能良好且计算高效。

Conclusion: EPOTTA提供了一种高效可靠的测试时适应方法，避免了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enhances model robustness by enabling adaptation
to target distributions that differ from training distributions, improving
real-world generalizability. Existing TTA approaches focus on adjusting the
conditional distribution; however these methods often depend on uncertain
predictions in the absence of label information, leading to unreliable
performance. Energy-based frameworks suggest a promising alternative to address
distribution shifts without relying on uncertain predictions, instead computing
the marginal distribution of target data. However, they involve the critical
challenge of requiring extensive SGLD sampling, which is impractical for
test-time scenarios requiring immediate adaptation. In this work, we propose
Energy-based Preference Optimization for Test-time Adaptation (EPOTTA), which
is based on a sampling free strategy. We first parameterize the target model
using a pretrained model and residual energy function, enabling marginal
likelihood maximization of target data without sampling. Building on the
observation that the parameterization is mathematically equivalent to DPO
objective, we then directly adapt the model to a target distribution without
explicitly training the residual. Our experiments verify that EPOTTA is
well-calibrated and performant while achieving computational efficiency.

Motivation: 长上下文监督微调（Long-SFT）在处理混合长度序列时，现有训练系统难以同时高效处理长短序列，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出Skrull动态数据调度器，通过动态调度平衡长短序列的计算需求，并设计轻量级调度算法实现近零成本在线调度。

Result: 实验表明，Skrull在真实长-SFT场景中平均性能优于DeepSpeed 3.76倍（最高7.54倍）。

Conclusion: Skrull通过高效数据调度解决了长-SFT中的异构数据分布问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Long-context supervised fine-tuning (Long-SFT) plays a vital role in
enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on long-context
tasks. To smoothly adapt LLMs to long-context scenarios, this process typically
entails training on mixed datasets containing both long and short sequences.
However, this heterogeneous sequence length distribution poses significant
challenges for existing training systems, as they fail to simultaneously
achieve high training efficiency for both long and short sequences, resulting
in sub-optimal end-to-end system performance in Long-SFT. In this paper, we
present a novel perspective on data scheduling to address the challenges posed
by the heterogeneous data distributions in Long-SFT. We propose Skrull, a
dynamic data scheduler specifically designed for efficient long-SFT. Through
dynamic data scheduling, Skrull balances the computation requirements of long
and short sequences, improving overall training efficiency. Furthermore, we
formulate the scheduling process as a joint optimization problem and thoroughly
analyze the trade-offs involved. Based on those analysis, Skrull employs a
lightweight scheduling algorithm to achieve near-zero cost online scheduling in
Long-SFT. Finally, we implement Skrull upon DeepSpeed, a state-of-the-art
distributed training system for LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that
Skrull outperforms DeepSpeed by 3.76x on average (up to 7.54x) in real-world
long-SFT scenarios.

Conclusion: 呼吁研究新的多重性感知学习框架和数据集构建协议，以解决多重性问题。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has seen remarkable progress, particularly with the
emergence of large-scale pre-training across various modalities. However, most
current approaches are built on the assumption of a deterministic, one-to-one
alignment between modalities. This oversimplifies real-world multimodal
relationships, where their nature is inherently many-to-many. This phenomenon,
named multiplicity, is not a side-effect of noise or annotation error, but an
inevitable outcome of semantic abstraction, representational asymmetry, and
task-dependent ambiguity in multimodal tasks. This position paper argues that
multiplicity is a fundamental bottleneck that manifests across all stages of
the multimodal learning pipeline: from data construction to training and
evaluation. This paper examines the causes and consequences of multiplicity,
and highlights how multiplicity introduces training uncertainty, unreliable
evaluation, and low dataset quality. This position calls for new research
directions on multimodal learning: novel multiplicity-aware learning frameworks
and dataset construction protocols considering multiplicity.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across tasks, yet they often exhibit difficulty in distinguishing
task-relevant from irrelevant signals, particularly in tasks like Visual
Question Answering (VQA), which can lead to susceptibility to misleading or
spurious inputs. We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality
Competency Problem: the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities.
This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks such as
image classification or pure text question answering, where models are expected
to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from
irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We
refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and
measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem. We further design
a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this
problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to
fine-tune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both
heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations via Projected Gradient
Descent (PGD), and a consistency regularization strategy applied to model
outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark
datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy, and VQA tasks) and multiple model families
with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and
cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting
unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Deep generative models have recently garnered significant attention across
various fields, from physics to chemistry, where sampling from unnormalized
Boltzmann-like distributions represents a fundamental challenge. In particular,
autoregressive models and normalizing flows have become prominent due to their
appealing ability to yield closed-form probability densities. Moreover, it is
well-established that incorporating prior knowledge - such as symmetries - into
deep neural networks can substantially improve training performances. In this
context, recent advances have focused on developing symmetry-equivariant
generative models, achieving remarkable results. Building upon these
foundations, this paper introduces Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation
(SESaMo). Similar to equivariant normalizing flows, SESaMo enables the
incorporation of inductive biases (e.g., symmetries) into normalizing flows
through a novel technique called stochastic modulation. This approach enhances
the flexibility of the generative model, allowing to effectively learn a
variety of exact and broken symmetries. Our numerical experiments benchmark
SESaMo in different scenarios, including an 8-Gaussian mixture model and
physically relevant field theories, such as the $\phi^4$ theory and the Hubbard
model.

Result: 在大规模数据集上实验显示，STH-SepNet在提升预测性能的同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: STH-SepNet为时空预测提供了一种轻量级框架，有望降低计算需求并提升性能。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal prediction is a pivotal task with broad applications in
traffic management, climate monitoring, energy scheduling, etc. However,
existing methodologies often struggle to balance model expressiveness and
computational efficiency, especially when scaling to large real-world datasets.
To tackle these challenges, we propose STH-SepNet (Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph
Separation Networks), a novel framework that decouples temporal and spatial
modeling to enhance both efficiency and precision. Therein, the temporal
dimension is modeled using lightweight large language models, which effectively
capture low-rank temporal dynamics. Concurrently, the spatial dimension is
addressed through an adaptive hypergraph neural network, which dynamically
constructs hyperedges to model intricate, higher-order interactions. A
carefully designed gating mechanism is integrated to seamlessly fuse temporal
and spatial representations. By leveraging the fundamental principles of
low-rank temporal dynamics and spatial interactions, STH-SepNet offers a
pragmatic and scalable solution for spatio-temporal prediction in real-world
applications. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of STH-SepNet in boosting
predictive performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This work
may provide a promising lightweight framework for spatio-temporal prediction,
aiming to reduce computational demands and while enhancing predictive
performance. Our code is avaliable at

Motivation: 高维距离集中性是设计稳定可靠数据分析算法的关键因素，但分数拟p-范数的集中性长期存在争议，需要明确条件。

Method: 通过分析分数拟p-范数在不同分布下的行为，提出集中性与反集中性的条件，并验证其理论。

Result: 发现分数拟p-范数在广泛分布下具有指数级集中性，同时揭示了可通过选择p值控制集中速率的分布族。

Conclusion: 研究解决了理论与实证中的争议，为数据编码和表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: Concentration of distances in high dimension is an important factor for the
development and design of stable and reliable data analysis algorithms. In this
paper, we address the fundamental long-standing question about the
concentration of distances in high dimension for fractional quasi $p$-norms,
$p\in(0,1)$. The topic has been at the centre of various theoretical and
empirical controversies. Here we, for the first time, identify conditions when
fractional quasi $p$-norms concentrate and when they don't. We show that
contrary to some earlier suggestions, for broad classes of distributions,
fractional quasi $p$-norms admit exponential and uniform in $p$ concentration
bounds. For these distributions, the results effectively rule out previously
proposed approaches to alleviate concentration by "optimal" setting the values
of $p$ in $(0,1)$. At the same time, we specify conditions and the
corresponding families of distributions for which one can still control
concentration rates by appropriate choices of $p$. We also show that in an
arbitrarily small vicinity of a distribution from a large class of
distributions for which uniform concentration occurs, there are uncountably
many other distributions featuring anti-concentration properties. Importantly,
this behavior enables devising relevant data encoding or representation schemes
favouring or discouraging distance concentration. The results shed new light on
this long-standing problem and resolve the tension around the topic in both
theory and empirical evidence reported in the literature.

Conclusion: 本研究为MoE推理加速提供了新视角，特别是在私有服务场景中，现有解决方案难以应对的情况下。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across many
applications, with Mixture of Experts (MoE) models demonstrating great
potential. Compared to traditional dense models, MoEs achieve better
performance with less computation. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used
technique to accelerate LLM inference without accuracy loss, but it has been
considered efficient only for dense models. In this work, we first demonstrate
that, under medium batch sizes, MoE surprisingly benefits more from SD than
dense models. Furthermore, as MoE becomes sparser -- the prevailing trend in
MoE designs -- the batch size range where SD acceleration is expected to be
effective becomes broader. To quantitatively understand tradeoffs involved in
SD, we develop a reliable modeling based on theoretical analyses. While current
SD research primarily focuses on improving acceptance rates of algorithms,
changes in workload and model architecture can still lead to degraded SD
acceleration even with high acceptance rates. To address this limitation, we
introduce a new metric 'target efficiency' that characterizes these effects,
thus helping researchers identify system bottlenecks and understand SD
acceleration more comprehensively. For scenarios like private serving, this
work unveils a new perspective to speed up MoE inference, where existing
solutions struggle. Experiments on different GPUs show up to 2.29x speedup for
Qwen2-57B-A14B at medium batch sizes and validate our theoretical predictions.

Result: 在离散和多模态任务（分别高达100维和20维）上验证了EGM的有效性。

Conclusion: EGM为无数据生成模型训练提供了一种灵活且高效的方法。

Abstract: We propose Energy-based generator matching (EGM), a modality-agnostic
approach to train generative models from energy functions in the absence of
data. Extending the recently proposed generator matching, EGM enables training
of arbitrary continuous-time Markov processes, e.g., diffusion, flow, and jump,
and can generate data from continuous, discrete, and a mixture of two
modalities. To this end, we propose estimating the generator matching loss
using self-normalized importance sampling with an additional bootstrapping
trick to reduce variance in the importance weight. We validate EGM on both
discrete and multimodal tasks up to 100 and 20 dimensions, respectively.

Conclusion: SMLLE通过减少延迟和提升生成稳定性，为流式文本到语音提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot streaming text-to-speech is an important research topic in
human-computer interaction. Existing methods primarily use a lookahead
mechanism, relying on future text to achieve natural streaming speech
synthesis, which introduces high processing latency. To address this issue, we
propose SMLLE, a streaming framework for generating high-quality speech
frame-by-frame. SMLLE employs a Transducer to convert text into semantic tokens
in real time while simultaneously obtaining duration alignment information. The
combined outputs are then fed into a fully autoregressive (AR) streaming model
to reconstruct mel-spectrograms. To further stabilize the generation process,
we design a Delete < Bos > Mechanism that allows the AR model to access future
text introducing as minimal delay as possible. Experimental results suggest
that the SMLLE outperforms current streaming TTS methods and achieves
comparable performance over sentence-level TTS systems. Samples are available

Result: 在多个多标签图像基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: CUTER是一种简单且通用的方法，能有效解决多标签在线持续学习中的核心问题。

Abstract: Multi-Label Online Continual Learning (MOCL) requires models to learn
continuously from endless multi-label data streams, facing complex challenges
including persistent catastrophic forgetting, potential missing labels, and
uncontrollable imbalanced class distributions. While existing MOCL methods
attempt to address these challenges through various techniques, \textit{they
all overlook label-specific region identifying and feature learning} - a
fundamental solution rooted in multi-label learning but challenging to achieve
in the online setting with incremental and partial supervision. To this end, we
first leverage the inherent structural information of input data to evaluate
and verify the innate localization capability of different pre-trained models.
Then, we propose CUTER (CUT-out-and-Experience-Replay), a simple yet versatile
strategy that provides fine-grained supervision signals by further identifying,
strengthening and cutting out label-specific regions for efficient experience
replay. It not only enables models to simultaneously address catastrophic
forgetting, missing labels, and class imbalance challenges, but also serves as
an orthogonal solution that seamlessly integrates with existing approaches.
Extensive experiments on multiple multi-label image benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method. The code is available at

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个运动任务和策略专业水平上生成了足够紧密的风险证书，可用于实际应用。

Conclusion: 研究证明了通过少量评估数据和递归PAC-Bayes方法，可以为深度演员-评论家算法生成实用的风险证书。

Abstract: After a period of research, deep actor-critic algorithms have reached a level
where they influence our everyday lives. They serve as the driving force behind
the continual improvement of large language models through user-collected
feedback. However, their deployment in physical systems is not yet widely
adopted, mainly because no validation scheme that quantifies their risk of
malfunction. We demonstrate that it is possible to develop tight risk
certificates for deep actor-critic algorithms that predict generalization
performance from validation-time observations. Our key insight centers on the
effectiveness of minimal evaluation data. Surprisingly, a small feasible of
evaluation roll-outs collected from a pretrained policy suffices to produce
accurate risk certificates when combined with a simple adaptation of PAC-Bayes
theory. Specifically, we adopt a recently introduced recursive PAC-Bayes
approach, which splits validation data into portions and recursively builds
PAC-Bayes bounds on the excess loss of each portion's predictor, using the
predictor from the previous portion as a data-informed prior. Our empirical
results across multiple locomotion tasks and policy expertise levels
demonstrate risk certificates that are tight enough to be considered for
practical use.

Conclusion: GGDiff为条件图生成提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案，平衡了计算效率、奖励对齐和样本质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models for graph
generation, yet their use for conditional graph generation remains a
fundamental challenge. In particular, guiding diffusion models on graphs under
arbitrary reward signals is difficult: gradient-based methods, while powerful,
are often unsuitable due to the discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs,
and non-differentiable rewards further complicate gradient-based guidance. We
propose Graph Guided Diffusion (GGDiff), a novel guidance framework that
interprets conditional diffusion on graphs as a stochastic control problem to
address this challenge. GGDiff unifies multiple guidance strategies, including
gradient-based guidance (for differentiable rewards), control-based guidance
(using control signals from forward reward evaluations), and zero-order
approximations (bridging gradient-based and gradient-free optimization). This
comprehensive, plug-and-play framework enables zero-shot guidance of
pre-trained diffusion models under both differentiable and non-differentiable
reward functions, adapting well-established guidance techniques to graph
generation--a direction largely unexplored. Our formulation balances
computational efficiency, reward alignment, and sample quality, enabling
practical conditional generation across diverse reward types. We demonstrate
the efficacy of GGDiff in various tasks, including constraints on graph motifs,
fairness, and link prediction, achieving superior alignment with target rewards
while maintaining diversity and fidelity.

Result: JEDI在人类优势任务中优于SOTA模型，同时在Atari100k基准上保持竞争力，且运行速度更快、内存更低。

Conclusion: 研究重新定义了Atari100k中超越人类性能的真正含义，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) have achieved
super-human level performance on the Atari100k benchmark, driven by
reinforcement learning agents trained on powerful diffusion world models.
However, we identify that the current aggregates mask a major performance
asymmetry: MBRL agents dramatically outperform humans in some tasks despite
drastically underperforming in others, with the former inflating the aggregate
metrics. This is especially pronounced in pixel-based agents trained with
diffusion world models. In this work, we address the pronounced asymmetry
observed in pixel-based agents as an initial attempt to reverse the worrying
upward trend observed in them. We address the problematic aggregates by
delineating all tasks as Agent-Optimal or Human-Optimal and advocate for equal
importance on metrics from both sets. Next, we hypothesize this pronounced
asymmetry is due to the lack of temporally-structured latent space trained with
the World Model objective in pixel-based methods. Lastly, to address this
issue, we propose Joint Embedding DIffusion (JEDI), a novel latent diffusion
world model trained end-to-end with the self-consistency objective. JEDI
outperforms SOTA models in human-optimal tasks while staying competitive across
the Atari100k benchmark, and runs 3 times faster with 43% lower memory than the
latest pixel-based diffusion baseline. Overall, our work rethinks what it truly
means to cross human-level performance in Atari100k.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm that
enables clients to collaboratively train models while preserving data privacy.
However, the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity gives rise to
inconsistent representations and divergent optimization dynamics across
clients, ultimately hindering robust global performance. To transcend these
challenges, we propose Mosaic, a novel data-free knowledge distillation
framework tailored for heterogeneous distributed environments. Mosaic first
trains local generative models to approximate each client's personalized
distribution, enabling synthetic data generation that safeguards privacy
through strict separation from real data. Subsequently, Mosaic forms a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) from client models based on their specialized
knowledge, and distills it into a global model using the generated data. To
further enhance the MoE architecture, Mosaic integrates expert predictions via
a lightweight meta model trained on a few representative prototypes. Extensive
experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that Mosaic
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under both model and data
heterogeneity. The source code has been published at

Result: 发现梯度约束下的修正流仅在更强假设下与最优传输相关，并提出了反例以否定先前的等价性结论。

Conclusion: 修正流在梯度约束下通常不能可靠地计算最优传输映射，需要更强的假设条件。

Abstract: This paper investigates the connections between rectified flows, flow
matching, and optimal transport. Flow matching is a recent approach to learning
generative models by estimating velocity fields that guide transformations from
a source to a target distribution. Rectified flow matching aims to straighten
the learned transport paths, yielding more direct flows between distributions.
Our first contribution is a set of invariance properties of rectified flows and
explicit velocity fields. In addition, we also provide explicit constructions
and analysis in the Gaussian (not necessarily independent) and Gaussian mixture
settings and study the relation to optimal transport. Our second contribution
addresses recent claims suggesting that rectified flows, when constrained such
that the learned velocity field is a gradient, can yield (asymptotically)
solutions to optimal transport problems. We study the existence of solutions
for this problem and demonstrate that they only relate to optimal transport
under assumptions that are significantly stronger than those previously
acknowledged. In particular, we present several counter-examples that
invalidate earlier equivalence results in the literature, and we argue that
enforcing a gradient constraint on rectified flows is, in general, not a
reliable method for computing optimal transport maps.

Conclusion: 正交化和归一化技术有效，OCN方法在理论和实验上均表现出色。

Abstract: Common Neighbors (CNs) and their higher-order variants are important pairwise
features widely used in state-of-the-art link prediction methods. However,
existing methods often struggle with the repetition across different orders of
CNs and fail to fully leverage their potential. We identify that these
limitations stem from two key issues: redundancy and over-smoothing in
high-order common neighbors. To address these challenges, we design
orthogonalization to eliminate redundancy between different-order CNs and
normalization to mitigate over-smoothing. By combining these two techniques, we
propose Orthogonal Common Neighbor (OCN), a novel approach that significantly
outperforms the strongest baselines by an average of 7.7% on popular link
prediction benchmarks. A thorough theoretical analysis is provided to support
our method. Ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of our
orthogonalization and normalization techniques.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion has recently emerged as a promising paradigm in discrete
data modeling. However, existing methods typically rely on a fixed rate
transition matrix during training, which not only limits the expressiveness of
latent representations, a fundamental strength of variational methods, but also
constrains the overall design space. To address these limitations, we propose
Discrete Markov Bridge, a novel framework specifically designed for discrete
representation learning. Our approach is built upon two key components: Matrix
Learning and Score Learning. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis,
establishing formal performance guarantees for Matrix Learning and proving the
convergence of the overall framework. Furthermore, we analyze the space
complexity of our method, addressing practical constraints identified in prior
studies. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of the
proposed Discrete Markov Bridge, which achieves an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)
of 1.38 on the Text8 dataset, outperforming established baselines. Moreover,
the proposed model demonstrates competitive performance on the CIFAR-10
dataset, achieving results comparable to those obtained by image-specific
generation approaches.

Conclusion: 概率动力学为AlphaFold1提供了更精确的理论基础，并展示了其在概率深度学习中的潜力。

Abstract: We present a novel theoretical interpretation of AlphaFold1. The seminal
breakthrough of AlphaFold1 in protein structure prediction by deep learning
relied on a learned potential energy function, in contrast to the later
end-to-end architectures of AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3. While this potential was
originally justified by referring to physical potentials of mean force (PMFs),
we reinterpret AlphaFold1's potential as an instance of probability kinematics
- also known as Jeffrey conditioning - a principled but underrecognised
generalization of conventional Bayesian updating. Probability kinematics
accommodates uncertain or soft evidence in the form of updated probabilities
over a partition. This perspective reveals AlphaFold1's potential as a form of
generalized Bayesian updating, rather than a thermodynamic potential. To
confirm our probabilistic framework's scope and precision, we analyze a
synthetic 2D model in which an angular random walk prior is updated with
evidence on distances via probability kinematics, mirroring AlphaFold1's
approach. This theoretical contribution connects AlphaFold1 to a broader class
of well-justified Bayesian methods, allowing precise quantification, surpassing
merely qualitative heuristics based on PMFs. More broadly, given the
achievements of AlphaFold1, probability kinematics holds considerable promise
for probabilistic deep learning, as it allows for the formulation of complex
models from a few simpler components.

Motivation: 优化LLM代理系统配置的搜索空间大，现有方法计算成本高且效果不佳。

Method: 采用多视角工作流编码技术，结合代码架构、文本提示和交互图特征，并通过跨领域无监督预训练提高预测准确性。

Result: 在三个领域的基准测试中，Agentic Predictor在预测准确性和工作流效用上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Agentic Predictor显著减少了试错评估需求，为LLM代理工作流设计提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, but optimizing LLM-based agentic systems remains challenging due
to the vast search space of agent configurations, prompting strategies, and
communication patterns. Existing approaches often rely on heuristic-based
tuning or exhaustive evaluation, which can be computationally expensive and
suboptimal. This paper proposes Agentic Predictor, a lightweight predictor for
efficient agentic workflow evaluation. Agentic Predictor is equipped with a
multi-view workflow encoding technique that leverages multi-view representation
learning of agentic systems by incorporating code architecture, textual
prompts, and interaction graph features. To achieve high predictive accuracy
while significantly reducing the number of required workflow evaluations for
training a predictor, Agentic Predictor employs cross-domain unsupervised
pretraining. By learning to approximate task success rates, Agentic Predictor
enables fast and accurate selection of optimal agentic workflow configurations
for a given task, significantly reducing the need for expensive trial-and-error
evaluations. Experiments on a carefully curated benchmark spanning three
domains show that our predictor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
predictive accuracy and workflow utility, highlighting the potential of
performance predictors in streamlining the design of LLM-based agentic
workflows.

Method: 通过理论分析，分解性能差距为显式和隐式表示差距，并在精确优化和近似优化设定下比较RLHF和DPO的表现。

Result: RLHF、DPO或在线DPO在不同模型误设下表现各异；在线DPO在模型类同构且误设时表现最优；RLHF在隐式稀疏奖励下样本效率更高。

Conclusion: 研究全面理解了RLHF和DPO的性能差距，并为实际选择提供了指导。

Abstract: We present a fine-grained theoretical analysis of the performance gap between
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) under a representation gap. Our study decomposes this gap
into two sources: an explicit representation gap under exact optimization and
an implicit representation gap under finite samples. In the exact optimization
setting, we characterize how the relative capacities of the reward and policy
model classes influence the final policy qualities. We show that RLHF, DPO, or
online DPO can outperform one another depending on the type of model
mis-specifications. Notably, online DPO can outperform both RLHF and standard
DPO when the reward and policy model classes are isomorphic and both
mis-specified. In the approximate optimization setting, we provide a concrete
construction where the ground-truth reward is implicitly sparse and show that
RLHF requires significantly fewer samples than DPO to recover an effective
reward model -- highlighting a statistical advantage of two-stage learning.
Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the
performance gap between RLHF and DPO under various settings, and offer
practical insights into when each method is preferred.

Motivation: 现有临床决策支持系统依赖离散化和插值，可能扭曲时间动态并降低决策质量，且忽视数据收集模式的临床意义。模型无关的强化学习方法样本效率低且泛化能力差。

Method: MedDreamer采用两阶段模型强化学习框架，结合自适应特征整合模块和潜在想象技术，模拟患者轨迹以优化策略。

Conclusion: MedDreamer首次将潜在想象技术应用于不规则医疗数据，显著提升了临床决策的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Timely and personalized treatment decisions are essential across a wide range
of healthcare settings where patient responses vary significantly and evolve
over time. Clinical data used to support these decisions are often irregularly
sampled, sparse, and noisy. Existing decision support systems commonly rely on
discretization and imputation, which can distort critical temporal dynamics and
degrade decision quality. Moreover, they often overlook the clinical
significance of irregular recording frequencies, filtering out patterns in how
and when data is collected. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a natural fit for
clinical decision-making, enabling sequential, long-term optimization in
dynamic, uncertain environments. However, most existing treatment
recommendation systems are model-free and trained solely on offline data,
making them sample-inefficient, sensitive to data quality, and poorly
generalizable across tasks or cohorts. To address these limitations, we propose
MedDreamer, a two-phase model-based RL framework for personalized treatment
recommendation. MedDreamer uses a world model with an Adaptive Feature
Integration (AFI) module to effectively model irregular, sparse clinical data.
Through latent imagination, it simulates plausible patient trajectories to
enhance learning, refining its policy using a mix of real and imagined
experiences. This enables learning policies that go beyond suboptimal
historical decisions while remaining grounded in clinical data. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of latent imagination to irregular
healthcare data. Evaluations on sepsis and mechanical ventilation (MV)
treatment using two large-scale EHR datasets show that MedDreamer outperforms
both model-free and model-based baselines in clinical outcomes and off-policy
metrics.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要通过监督微调（SFT）训练，易受分布偏移影响，泛化能力有限。RL提供了一种通过试错优化任务目标的方法，但其对VLA的具体泛化优势尚不明确。

Method: 研究引入了一个全面的VLA泛化评估基准，并系统研究了RL微调（如PPO）在视觉、语义和执行维度上的影响。

Result: 实验显示，RL微调（尤其是PPO）在语义理解和执行鲁棒性上显著优于SFT，同时保持视觉鲁棒性。PPO比其他RL算法（如DPO、GRPO）更有效。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种高效的PPO训练方法，并证明了其在提升VLA泛化能力中的实用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential
for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under
distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome
these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a
systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs
compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically
investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and
execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning,
particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic
understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable
visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs
than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for
efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for
improving VLA generalization. The project page is at https://rlvla.github.io

Abstract: Understanding pain-related facial behaviors is essential for digital
healthcare in terms of effective monitoring, assisted diagnostics, and
treatment planning, particularly for patients unable to communicate verbally.
Existing data-driven methods of detecting pain from facial expressions are
limited due to interpretability and severity quantification. To this end, we
propose GraphAU-Pain, leveraging a graph-based framework to model facial Action
Units (AUs) and their interrelationships for pain intensity estimation. AUs are
represented as graph nodes, with co-occurrence relationships as edges, enabling
a more expressive depiction of pain-related facial behaviors. By utilizing a
relational graph neural network, our framework offers improved interpretability
and significant performance gains. Experiments conducted on the publicly
available UNBC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the GraphAU-Pain,
achieving an F1-score of 66.21% and accuracy of 87.61% in pain intensity
estimation.

Abstract: We study the problem of causal function estimation in the Proxy Causal
Learning (PCL) framework, where confounders are not observed but proxies for
the confounders are available. Two main approaches have been proposed: outcome
bridge-based and treatment bridge-based methods. In this work, we propose two
kernel-based doubly robust estimators that combine the strengths of both
approaches, and naturally handle continuous and high-dimensional variables. Our
identification strategy builds on a recent density ratio-free method for
treatment bridge-based PCL; furthermore, in contrast to previous approaches, it
does not require indicator functions or kernel smoothing over the treatment
variable. These properties make it especially well-suited for continuous or
high-dimensional treatments. By using kernel mean embeddings, we have
closed-form solutions and strong consistency guarantees. Our estimators
outperform existing methods on PCL benchmarks, including a prior doubly robust
method that requires both kernel smoothing and density ratio estimation.

Abstract: In many real-world applications of regression, conditional probability
estimation, and uncertainty quantification, exploiting symmetries rooted in
physics or geometry can dramatically improve generalization and sample
efficiency. While geometric deep learning has made significant empirical
advances by incorporating group-theoretic structure, less attention has been
given to statistical learning guarantees. In this paper, we introduce an
equivariant representation learning framework that simultaneously addresses
regression, conditional probability estimation, and uncertainty quantification
while providing first-of-its-kind non-asymptotic statistical learning
guarantees. Grounded in operator and group representation theory, our framework
approximates the spectral decomposition of the conditional expectation
operator, building representations that are both equivariant and disentangled
along independent symmetry subgroups. Empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets and real-world robotics applications confirm the potential of our
approach, matching or outperforming existing equivariant baselines in
regression while additionally providing well-calibrated parametric uncertainty
estimates.

Conclusion: InfoCons能有效识别点云中的关键概念，为模型解释提供新方法。

Abstract: Interpretability of point cloud (PC) models becomes imperative given their
deployment in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous vehicles. We focus
on attributing PC model outputs to interpretable critical concepts, defined as
meaningful subsets of the input point cloud. To enable human-understandable
diagnostics of model failures, an ideal critical subset should be *faithful*
(preserving points that causally influence predictions) and *conceptually
coherent* (forming semantically meaningful structures that align with human
perception). We propose InfoCons, an explanation framework that applies
information-theoretic principles to decompose the point cloud into 3D concepts,
enabling the examination of their causal effect on model predictions with
learnable priors. We evaluate InfoCons on synthetic datasets for
classification, comparing it qualitatively and quantitatively with four
baselines. We further demonstrate its scalability and flexibility on two
real-world datasets and in two applications that utilize critical scores of PC.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种轻量级自适应隐私分配（LAPA）策略，通过个性化分配隐私预算和动态优化噪声，在联邦学习中平衡隐私保护与系统效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在保护数据隐私的同时仍面临梯度泄漏攻击风险，而差分隐私（DP）技术虽能减少泄漏风险，但会损害FL的效用，尤其是在非独立同分布（Non-IID）数据场景下。

Method: 提出LAPA策略，为设备分配个性化隐私预算，并利用DDPG算法优化传输功率，动态调整噪声以平衡隐私与效用；同时设计可靠的聚合策略。

Result: 实验表明，LAPA策略在满足隐私需求的同时提升了FL的收敛性能。

Conclusion: LAPA策略通过个性化噪声分配和动态优化，有效解决了FL中隐私保护与系统效用的权衡问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm based on
protecting data privacy of devices, which however, can still be broken by
gradient leakage attack via parameter inversion techniques. Differential
privacy (DP) technology reduces the risk of private data leakage by adding
artificial noise to the gradients, but detrimental to the FL utility at the
same time, especially in the scenario where the data is Non-Independent
Identically Distributed (Non-IID). Based on the impact of heterogeneous data on
aggregation performance, this paper proposes a Lightweight Adaptive Privacy
Allocation (LAPA) strategy, which assigns personalized privacy budgets to
devices in each aggregation round without transmitting any additional
information beyond gradients, ensuring both privacy protection and aggregation
efficiency. Furthermore, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
algorithm is employed to optimize the transmission power, in order to determine
the optimal timing at which the adaptively attenuated artificial noise aligns
with the communication noise, enabling an effective balance between DP and
system utility. Finally, a reliable aggregation strategy is designed by
integrating communication quality and data distribution characteristics, which
improves aggregation performance while preserving privacy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the personalized noise allocation and dynamic optimization
strategy based on LAPA proposed in this paper enhances convergence performance
while satisfying the privacy requirements of FL.

Abstract: Current research on tabular foundation models often overlooks the
complexities of large-scale, real-world data by treating tables as isolated
entities and assuming information completeness, thereby neglecting the vital
operational context. To address this, we introduce the concept of Semantically
Linked Tables (SLT), recognizing that tables are inherently connected to both
declarative and procedural operational knowledge. We propose Foundation Models
for Semantically Linked Tables (FMSLT), which integrate these components to
ground tabular data within its true operational context. This comprehensive
representation unlocks the full potential of machine learning for complex,
interconnected tabular data across diverse domains. Realizing FMSLTs requires
access to operational knowledge that is often unavailable in public datasets,
highlighting the need for close collaboration between domain experts and
researchers. Our work exposes the limitations of current tabular foundation
models and proposes a new direction centered on FMSLTs, aiming to advance
robust, context-aware models for structured data.

Method: 理论分析Glorot的不稳定性，提出维度感知的调整方法。

Result: 证明Glorot不稳定，调整后能稳定信号传播。

Conclusion: 标准初始化在长序列任务中失效，需新理论支持。

Abstract: Proper initialization is critical for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),
particularly in long-range reasoning tasks, where repeated application of the
same weight matrix can cause vanishing or exploding signals. A common baseline
for linear recurrences is Glorot initialization, designed to ensure stable
signal propagation--but derived under the infinite-width, fixed-length
regime--an unrealistic setting for RNNs processing long sequences. In this
work, we show that Glorot initialization is in fact unstable: small positive
deviations in the spectral radius are amplified through time and cause the
hidden state to explode. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that sequences
of length $t = O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the hidden width, are sufficient to
induce instability. To address this, we propose a simple, dimension-aware
rescaling of Glorot that shifts the spectral radius slightly below one,
preventing rapid signal explosion or decay. These results suggest that standard
initialization schemes may break down in the long-sequence regime, motivating a
separate line of theory for stable recurrent initialization.

Conclusion: PCDCNet为空气质量预测提供实用且可解释的解决方案，支持个人和监管决策。

Abstract: Air quality forecasting (AQF) is critical for public health and environmental
management, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of emissions,
meteorology, and chemical transformations. Traditional numerical models, such
as CMAQ and WRF-Chem, provide physically grounded simulations but are
computationally expensive and rely on uncertain emission inventories. Deep
learning models, while computationally efficient, often struggle with
generalization due to their lack of physical constraints. To bridge this gap,
we propose PCDCNet, a surrogate model that integrates numerical modeling
principles with deep learning. PCDCNet explicitly incorporates emissions,
meteorological influences, and domain-informed constraints to model pollutant
formation, transport, and dissipation. By combining graph-based spatial
transport modeling, recurrent structures for temporal accumulation, and
representation enhancement for local interactions, PCDCNet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 72-hour station-level PM2.5 and O3
forecasting while significantly reducing computational costs. Furthermore, our
model is deployed in an online platform, providing free, real-time air quality
forecasts, demonstrating its scalability and societal impact. By aligning deep
learning with physical consistency, PCDCNet offers a practical and
interpretable solution for AQF, enabling informed decision-making for both
personal and regulatory applications.

Result: DISCOVER在实验中解决了现有方法无法处理的高维任务探索问题。

Conclusion: 定向目标选择是解决复杂稀疏奖励任务的关键，DISCOVER展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) can model a wide range of highly
complex tasks. Solving sparse-reward tasks is RL's core premise - requiring
efficient exploration coupled with long-horizon credit assignment - and
overcoming these challenges is key for building self-improving agents with
superhuman ability. We argue that solving complex and high-dimensional tasks
requires solving simpler tasks that are relevant to the target task. In
contrast, most prior work designs strategies for selecting exploratory tasks
with the objective of solving any task, making exploration of challenging
high-dimensional, long-horizon tasks intractable. We find that the sense of
direction, necessary for effective exploration, can be extracted from existing
RL algorithms, without needing any prior information. Based on this finding, we
propose a method for directed sparse-reward goal-conditioned very long-horizon
RL (DISCOVER), which selects exploratory goals in the direction of the target
task. We connect DISCOVER to principled exploration in bandits, formally
bounding the time until the target task becomes achievable in terms of the
agent's initial distance to the target, but independent of the volume of the
space of all tasks. Empirically, we perform a thorough evaluation in
high-dimensional environments. We find that the directed goal selection of
DISCOVER solves exploration problems that are beyond the reach of prior
state-of-the-art exploration methods in RL.

Result: 某些编辑方法（如WISE和AlphaEdit）在遗忘任务中表现优异，尤其适用于预训练知识。

Conclusion: 建议遗忘领域采用SOTA编辑方法作为基线，并从编辑视角探索更全面的LLM记忆控制。

Abstract: Large language Model (LLM) unlearning, i.e., selectively removing information
from LLMs, is vital for responsible model deployment. Differently, LLM
knowledge editing aims to modify LLM knowledge instead of removing it. Though
editing and unlearning seem to be two distinct tasks, we find there is a tight
connection between them. In this paper, we conceptualize unlearning as a
special case of editing where information is modified to a refusal or "empty
set" $\emptyset$ response, signifying its removal. This paper thus investigates
if knowledge editing techniques are strong baselines for LLM unlearning. We
evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) editing methods (e.g., ROME, MEMIT, GRACE,
WISE, and AlphaEdit) against existing unlearning approaches on pretrained and
finetuned knowledge. Results show certain editing methods, notably WISE and
AlphaEdit, are effective unlearning baselines, especially for pretrained
knowledge, and excel in generating human-aligned refusal answers. To better
adapt editing methods for unlearning applications, we propose practical recipes
including self-improvement and query merging. The former leverages the LLM's
own in-context learning ability to craft a more human-aligned unlearning
target, and the latter enables ROME and MEMIT to perform well in unlearning
longer sample sequences. We advocate for the unlearning community to adopt SOTA
editing methods as baselines and explore unlearning from an editing perspective
for more holistic LLM memory control.

Result: 在模拟工业场景的延迟和长时程环境中，该方法表现出色，无需手工奖励或复杂规划。

Conclusion: 结合生成模型与AIF的架构为延迟和长时程环境提供了一种高效的概率控制器。

Abstract: With the recent success of world-model agents, which extend the core idea of
model-based reinforcement learning by learning a differentiable model for
sample-efficient control across diverse tasks, active inference (AIF) offers a
complementary, neuroscience-grounded paradigm that unifies perception,
learning, and action within a single probabilistic framework powered by a
generative model. Despite this promise, practical AIF agents still rely on
accurate immediate predictions and exhaustive planning, a limitation that is
exacerbated in delayed environments requiring plans over long horizons, tens to
hundreds of steps. Moreover, most existing agents are evaluated on robotic or
vision benchmarks which, while natural for biological agents, fall short of
real-world industrial complexity. We address these limitations with a
generative-policy architecture featuring (i) a multi-step latent transition
that lets the generative model predict an entire horizon in a single
look-ahead, (ii) an integrated policy network that enables the transition and
receives gradients of the expected free energy, (iii) an alternating
optimization scheme that updates model and policy from a replay buffer, and
(iv) a single gradient step that plans over long horizons, eliminating
exhaustive planning from the control loop. We evaluate our agent in an
environment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario with delayed and
long-horizon settings. The empirical results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, demonstrating the coupled world-model with the AIF formalism
yields an end-to-end probabilistic controller capable of effective decision
making in delayed, long-horizon settings without handcrafted rewards or
expensive planning.

that leverages black-box foundation models. FedOT shares only a global
task-dependent classifier across clients while locally adapting features
through orthogonal transformations. By enforcing orthogonality, FedOT mitigates
gradient conflicts across diverse clients, preserves semantic integrity, and
achieves robust performance even in the presence of substantial data
heterogeneity. The strategy of combining global and local parameters enables a
more balanced approach for both generalization and personalization,
outperforming baseline FL methods across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our
extensive analysis confirms that joint optimization of global classifiers and
local orthogonal transformations yields superior performance and suggests
broader applicability.

*Melis Ilayda Bal,Volkan Cevher,Michael Muehlebach*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: ESLM是一种风险感知算法，通过在线令牌级批量选择提高训练效率和分布鲁棒性，显著减少训练FLOPs，同时保持或改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型预训练计算密集，许多令牌对学习贡献有限，导致效率低下。

Method: ESLM利用每令牌统计信息（如熵或损失）和应用风险值阈值，仅保留每批次中最具信息量的令牌。

Result: 在GPT-2预训练中，ESLM显著减少训练FLOPs，同时保持或改进困惑度和下游性能。

Conclusion: ESLM提供了一种高效且分布鲁棒的语言模型预训练方法，并可扩展到不同模型规模和知识蒸馏。

Abstract: Large language model pretraining is compute-intensive, yet many tokens
contribute marginally to learning, resulting in inefficiency. We introduce
Efficient Selective Language Modeling (ESLM), a risk-aware algorithm that
improves training efficiency and distributional robustness by performing online
token-level batch selection. ESLM leverages per-token statistics (e.g., entropy
or loss) and applies value-at-risk thresholding to retain only the most
informative tokens per batch. This data-centric mechanism reshapes the training
loss, prioritizing high-risk tokens and eliminating redundant gradient
computation. We frame ESLM as a bilevel game: the model competes with a masking
adversary that selects worst-case token subsets under a constrained
thresholding rule. In the loss-based setting, ESLM recovers conditional
value-at-risk loss minimization, providing a principled connection to
distributionally robust optimization. We extend our approach to Ada-ESLM, which
adaptively tunes the selection confidence during training. Experiments on GPT-2
pretraining show that ESLM significantly reduces training FLOPs while
maintaining or improving both perplexity and downstream performance compared to
baselines. Our approach also scales across model sizes, pretraining corpora,
and integrates naturally with knowledge distillation.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种选择性状态自适应正则化方法，用于解决离线强化学习中固定正则化强度导致的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习中，固定正则化强度无法适应数据质量的差异，导致性能下降或过度依赖行为克隆。

Method: 引入状态自适应正则化系数，选择性对高质量动作应用正则化，避免低质量动作的约束影响性能。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有方法，适用于离线和离线到在线场景。

Conclusion: 选择性状态自适应正则化有效解决了离线强化学习中的性能问题，提升了学习效果。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an effective policy from a
static dataset. To alleviate extrapolation errors, existing studies often
uniformly regularize the value function or policy updates across all states.
However, due to substantial variations in data quality, the fixed
regularization strength often leads to a dilemma: Weak regularization strength
fails to address extrapolation errors and value overestimation, while strong
regularization strength shifts policy learning toward behavior cloning,
impeding potential performance enabled by Bellman updates. To address this
issue, we propose the selective state-adaptive regularization method for
offline RL. Specifically, we introduce state-adaptive regularization
coefficients to trust state-level Bellman-driven results, while selectively
applying regularization on high-quality actions, aiming to avoid performance
degradation caused by tight constraints on low-quality actions. By establishing
a connection between the representative value regularization method, CQL, and
explicit policy constraint methods, we effectively extend selective
state-adaptive regularization to these two mainstream offline RL approaches.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in both offline and
offline-to-online settings on the D4RL benchmark.

Motivation: 传统神经网络的复杂性给形式化验证带来了挑战，而逻辑门网络（LGNs）通过布尔逻辑门替代乘法，更适合符号验证。

Method: 引入了一种SAT编码方法，用于验证LGNs的全局鲁棒性和公平性。

Result: 在五个基准数据集（包括一个新构建的5类变体）上评估，LGNs表现出验证友好性和强预测性能。

Conclusion: LGNs是一种既适合形式化验证又能保持高性能的替代方案。

Abstract: Learning-based systems are increasingly deployed across various domains, yet
the complexity of traditional neural networks poses significant challenges for
formal verification. Unlike conventional neural networks, learned Logic Gate
Networks (LGNs) replace multiplications with Boolean logic gates, yielding a
sparse, netlist-like architecture that is inherently more amenable to symbolic
verification, while still delivering promising performance. In this paper, we
introduce a SAT encoding for verifying global robustness and fairness in LGNs.
We evaluate our method on five benchmark datasets, including a newly
constructed 5-class variant, and find that LGNs are both verification-friendly
and maintain strong predictive performance.

Result: 在无线多径信道上的图像分类任务中，SLSCom显著优于传统数字编码方法和现有DL方法。

Conclusion: SLSCom在标记样本有限的情况下仍能高效提取语义信息，提升任务推理性能。

Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication enhances transmission efficiency by
conveying semantic information rather than exact messages. Deep learning
(DL)-based semantic communication can effectively cultivate the essential
semantic knowledge for semantic extraction, transmission, and interpretation by
leveraging massive labeled samples for downstream task training. In this paper,
we propose a self-supervised learning-based semantic communication framework
(SLSCom) to enhance task inference performance, particularly in scenarios with
limited access to labeled samples. Specifically, we develop a task-relevant
semantic encoder using unlabeled samples, which can be collected by devices in
real-world edge networks. To facilitate task-relevant semantic extraction, we
introduce self-supervision for learning contrastive features and formulate the
information bottleneck (IB) problem to balance the tradeoff between the
informativeness of the extracted features and task inference performance. Given
the computational challenges of the IB problem, we devise a practical and
effective solution by employing self-supervised classification and
reconstruction pretext tasks. We further propose efficient joint training
methods to enhance end-to-end inference accuracy over wireless channels, even
with few labeled samples. We evaluate the proposed framework on image
classification tasks over multipath wireless channels. Extensive simulation
results demonstrate that SLSCom significantly outperforms conventional digital
coding methods and existing DL-based approaches across varying labeled data set
sizes and SNR conditions, even when the unlabeled samples are irrelevant to the
downstream tasks.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为MIST的稀疏调参方法，通过选择性更新预训练模型参数，提升持续学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法冻结预训练模型并依赖辅助模块，限制了模型的可塑性，导致在分布偏移时泛化能力不足。

Method: MIST基于互信息目标选择性更新少量参数（<5%），并通过梯度随机丢弃进一步减少干扰（<0.5%参数更新）。

Result: 实验表明，MIST在多种持续学习基准测试中显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: MIST是一种即插即用的方法，能有效平衡任务适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Continual Learning with Pre-trained Models holds great promise for efficient
adaptation across sequential tasks. However, most existing approaches freeze
PTMs and rely on auxiliary modules like prompts or adapters, limiting model
plasticity and leading to suboptimal generalization when facing significant
distribution shifts. While full fine-tuning can improve adaptability, it risks
disrupting crucial pre-trained knowledge. In this paper, we propose Mutual
Information-guided Sparse Tuning (MIST), a plug-and-play method that
selectively updates a small subset of PTM parameters, less than 5%, based on
sensitivity to mutual information objectives. MIST enables effective
task-specific adaptation while preserving generalization. To further reduce
interference, we introduce strong sparsity regularization by randomly dropping
gradients during tuning, resulting in fewer than 0.5% of parameters being
updated per step. Applied before standard freeze-based methods, MIST
consistently boosts performance across diverse continual learning benchmarks.
Experiments show that integrating our method into multiple baselines yields
significant performance gains. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究离线模仿学习问题，旨在通过专家生成的状态-动作对数据集学习高性能策略，不同于现有方法对专家策略类别的假设。

Method: 引入SPOIL算法，利用环境的结构假设，在线性Qπ-realizable MDPs中保证性能匹配专家，样本复杂度为O(ε⁻²)；扩展到非线性情况，复杂度为O(ε⁻⁴)。

Result: SPOIL在标准基准测试中表现优于行为克隆，与现有算法竞争，并提出新的损失函数用于深度模仿学习中的评论家网络训练。

Conclusion: SPOIL算法在离线模仿学习中表现出色，为线性及非线性Qπ-realizable MDPs提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of offline imitation learning in Markov decision
processes (MDPs), where the goal is to learn a well-performing policy given a
dataset of state-action pairs generated by an expert policy. Complementing a
recent line of work on this topic that assumes the expert belongs to a
tractable class of known policies, we approach this problem from a new angle
and leverage a different type of structural assumption about the environment.
Specifically, for the class of linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs, we introduce a
new algorithm called saddle-point offline imitation learning (\SPOIL), which is
guaranteed to match the performance of any expert up to an additive error
$\varepsilon$ with access to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples. Moreover,
we extend this result to possibly non-linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs at the
cost of a worse sample complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$.
Finally, our analysis suggests a new loss function for training critic networks
from expert data in deep imitation learning. Empirical evaluations on standard
benchmarks demonstrate that the neural net implementation of \SPOIL is superior
to behavior cloning and competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在开放权重LLM模型库中选择合适模型的挑战，同时平衡用户对响应质量的需求和服务提供商的成本最小化目标。

Method: MESS+通过实时学习LLM的请求满意度概率，并结合虚拟队列和请求满意度预测，解决每请求优化问题。

Result: 在多个先进LLM基准测试中，MESS+平均节省了2倍的成本。

Conclusion: MESS+在保证服务质量的同时，显著降低了LLM请求路由的成本。

Abstract: Open-weight LLM zoos provide access to numerous high-quality models, but
selecting the appropriate model for specific tasks remains challenging and
requires technical expertise. Most users simply want factually correct, safe,
and satisfying responses without concerning themselves with model
technicalities, while inference service providers prioritize minimizing
operating costs. These competing interests are typically mediated through
service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee minimum service quality. We
introduce MESS+, a stochastic optimization algorithm for cost-optimal LLM
request routing while providing rigorous SLA compliance guarantees. MESS+
learns request satisfaction probabilities of LLMs in real-time as users
interact with the system, based on which model selection decisions are made by
solving a per-request optimization problem. Our algorithm includes a novel
combination of virtual queues and request satisfaction prediction, along with a
theoretical analysis of cost optimality and constraint satisfaction. Across a
wide range of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, MESS+ achieves an average of 2x
cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式策略，难以捕捉数据中的细微特征，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 利用影响力函数系统分析训练数据对模型推理能力的影响，提出数据集重加权策略。

Result: 发现数学和编程任务间的跨领域效应，调整数据集权重后，模型在AIME24和LiveCodeBench上的准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: Infra方法揭示了数据特征对推理能力的影响，为优化训练数据提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities in math and coding, often bolstered by post-training on the
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) generated by stronger models. However, existing
strategies for curating such training data predominantly rely on heuristics,
limiting generalizability and failing to capture subtleties underlying in data.
To address these limitations, we leverage influence functions to systematically
attribute LLMs' reasoning ability on math and coding to individual training
examples, sequences, and tokens, enabling deeper insights into effective data
characteristics. Our Influence-based Reasoning Attribution (Infra) uncovers
nontrivial cross-domain effects across math and coding tasks: high-difficulty
math examples improve both math and code reasoning, while low-difficulty code
tasks most effectively benefit code reasoning. Based on these findings, we
introduce a simple yet effective dataset reweighting strategy by flipping task
difficulty, which doubles AIME24 accuracy from 10\% to 20\% and boosts
LiveCodeBench accuracy from 33.8\% to 35.3\% for Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Moreover,
our fine-grained attribution reveals that the sequence-level exploratory
behaviors enhance reasoning performance in both math and code, and the
token-level influence patterns are distinct for math and code reasoning: the
former prefers natural language logic connectors and the latter emphasizes
structural syntax.

Motivation: 神经退行性痴呆的诊断因症状重叠和影像学相似而具有挑战性，现有深度学习方法虽准确但缺乏透明性。

Result: 该框架在保持诊断准确性的同时，生成了基于影像学发现的结构化诊断理由，提供了因果解释。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅匹配现有深度学习方法的性能，还提供了支持诊断结论的透明推理过程。

Abstract: The differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias is a challenging
clinical task, mainly because of the overlap in symptom presentation and the
similarity of patterns observed in structural neuroimaging. To improve
diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, deep learning-based methods such as
Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers have been proposed for
the automatic classification of brain MRIs. However, despite their strong
predictive performance, these models find limited clinical utility due to their
opaque decision making. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates
two core components to enhance diagnostic transparency. First, we introduce a
modular pipeline for converting 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs into textual
radiology reports. Second, we explore the potential of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs) to assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis between
Frontotemporal dementia subtypes, Alzheimer's disease, and normal aging based
on the generated reports. To bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and
explainability, we employ reinforcement learning to incentivize diagnostic
reasoning in LLMs. Without requiring supervised reasoning traces or
distillation from larger models, our approach enables the emergence of
structured diagnostic rationales grounded in neuroimaging findings. Unlike
post-hoc explainability methods that retrospectively justify model decisions,
our framework generates diagnostic rationales as part of the inference
process-producing causally grounded explanations that inform and guide the
model's decision-making process. In doing so, our framework matches the
diagnostic performance of existing deep learning methods while offering
rationales that support its diagnostic conclusions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to
drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning
research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks
sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2)
MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with
carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3)
MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks
through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation,
and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these
distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research
paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced
coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent
ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in
80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental
results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate
MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert
reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation.
We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve
AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.

Motivation: 研究如何将强化学习应用于需要人类反馈的任务（如深度研究和旅行规划），并探讨偏好数据在优化中的根本限制。

Method: 通过投票理论形式化偏好数据的局限性，类比模型选择答案与选民选择候选人的过程，分析RLHF在不同任务中的表现差异。

Result: 发现偏好数据显著限制了基于结果的优化，尤其是在需要推理行为的任务中，RLHF难以引发稳健策略。

Conclusion: 需要结合人类评分和算法创新，以扩展RL在依赖人类反馈的领域的成功应用。

Abstract: Recent progress in strengthening the capabilities of large language models
has stemmed from applying reinforcement learning to domains with automatically
verifiable outcomes. A key question is whether we can similarly use RL to
optimize for outcomes in domains where evaluating outcomes inherently requires
human feedback; for example, in tasks like deep research and trip planning,
outcome evaluation is qualitative and there are many possible degrees of
success. One attractive and scalable modality for collecting human feedback is
preference data: ordinal rankings (pairwise or $k$-wise) that indicate, for $k$
given outcomes, which one is preferred. In this work, we study a critical
roadblock: preference data fundamentally and significantly limits outcome-based
optimization. Even with idealized preference data (infinite, noiseless, and
online), the use of ordinal feedback can prevent obtaining even approximately
optimal solutions. We formalize this impossibility using voting theory, drawing
an analogy between how a model chooses to answer a query with how voters choose
a candidate to elect. This indicates that grounded human scoring and
algorithmic innovations are necessary for extending the success of RL
post-training to domains demanding human feedback. We also explore why these
limitations have disproportionately impacted RLHF when it comes to eliciting
reasoning behaviors (e.g., backtracking) versus situations where RLHF has been
historically successful (e.g., instruction-tuning and safety training), finding
that the limitations of preference data primarily suppress RLHF's ability to
elicit robust strategies -- a class that encompasses most reasoning behaviors.

Method: 提出GenICL框架，利用LLM反馈直接优化演示选择。

Result: 在19个数据集上表现优于现有方法，提升ICL性能。

Conclusion: GenICL能更有效地选择演示，显著提升ICL效果。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to
new tasks during inference using only a few demonstrations. However, ICL
performance is highly dependent on the selection of these demonstrations.
Recent work explores retrieval-based methods for selecting query-specific
demonstrations, but these approaches often rely on surrogate objectives such as
metric learning, failing to directly optimize ICL performance. Consequently,
they struggle to identify truly beneficial demonstrations. Moreover, their
discriminative retrieval paradigm is ineffective when the candidate pool lacks
sufficient high-quality demonstrations. To address these challenges, we propose
GenICL, a novel generative preference learning framework that leverages LLM
feedback to directly optimize demonstration selection for ICL. Experiments on
19 datasets across 11 task categories demonstrate that GenICL achieves superior
performance than existing methods in selecting the most effective
demonstrations, leading to better ICL performance.

Conclusion: 本文填补了小批量EM方法理论支持的空白，为概率电路的高效训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) offer a computationally scalable framework for
generative modeling, supporting exact and efficient inference of a wide range
of probabilistic queries. While recent advances have significantly improved the
expressiveness and scalability of PCs, effectively training their parameters
remains a challenge. In particular, a widely used optimization method,
full-batch Expectation-Maximization (EM), requires processing the entire
dataset before performing a single update, making it ineffective for large
datasets. While empirical extensions to the mini-batch setting have been
proposed, it remains unclear what objective these algorithms are optimizing,
making it difficult to assess their theoretical soundness. This paper bridges
the gap by establishing a novel connection between the general EM objective and
the standard full-batch EM algorithm. Building on this, we derive a
theoretically grounded generalization to the mini-batch setting and demonstrate
its effectiveness through preliminary empirical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Actor-Critic methods are widely used for their scalability, yet existing
theoretical guarantees for infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) often rely on restrictive ergodicity assumptions. We propose
NAC-B, a Natural Actor-Critic with Batching, that achieves order-optimal regret
of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ in infinite-horizon average-reward MDPs under the
unichain assumption, which permits both transient states and periodicity. This
assumption is among the weakest under which the classic policy gradient theorem
remains valid for average-reward settings. NAC-B employs function approximation
for both the actor and the critic, enabling scalability to problems with large
state and action spaces. The use of batching in our algorithm helps mitigate
potential periodicity in the MDP and reduces stochasticity in gradient
estimates, and our analysis formalizes these benefits through the introduction
of the constants $C_{\text{hit}}$ and $C_{\text{tar}}$, which characterize the
rate at which empirical averages over Markovian samples converge to the
stationary distribution.

Conclusion: OMIB通过理论保证和动态调整权重，有效解决了多模态学习中的信息瓶颈问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Leveraging high-quality joint representations from multimodal data can
greatly enhance model performance in various machine-learning based
applications. Recent multimodal learning methods, based on the multimodal
information bottleneck (MIB) principle, aim to generate optimal MIB with
maximal task-relevant information and minimal superfluous information via
regularization. However, these methods often set ad hoc regularization weights
and overlook imbalanced task-relevant information across modalities, limiting
their ability to achieve optimal MIB. To address this gap, we propose a novel
multimodal learning framework, Optimal Multimodal Information Bottleneck
(OMIB), whose optimization objective guarantees the achievability of optimal
MIB by setting the regularization weight within a theoretically derived bound.
OMIB further addresses imbalanced task-relevant information by dynamically
adjusting regularization weights per modality, promoting the inclusion of all
task-relevant information. Moreover, we establish a solid
information-theoretical foundation for OMIB's optimization and implement it
under the variational approximation framework for computational efficiency.
Finally, we empirically validate the OMIB's theoretical properties on synthetic
data and demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art benchmark
methods in various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing education, with LLM-based
agents playing a key role in simulating student behavior. A major challenge in
student simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at
various cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as ``helpful
assistants'', target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they
struggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often
produce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that
characterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To
address this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student
simulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student
using a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from
past learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict
student performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these
predictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better
replicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the
\texttt{Student\_100} dataset, consisting of $100$ students working on Python
programming and $5,000$ learning records. Experimental results show that our
method consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving $100\%$ improvement
in simulation accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨TabPFN作为表格数据基础模型的可能性，并通过实验验证其在半监督参数估计、协变量偏移预测等任务中的优越性。

Method: 通过近似贝叶斯推断解释TabPFN的工作原理，并设计实验验证其在多种统计任务中的表现。

Result: TabPFN在半监督参数估计、协变量偏移预测等任务中显著优于现有方法，且在稀疏回归和分类任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: TabPFN具有成为表格数据基础模型的潜力，可能取代现有统计建模方法。

Abstract: Hollmann et al. (Nature 637 (2025) 319-326) recently introduced TabPFN, a
transformer-based deep learning model for regression and classification on
tabular data, which they claim "outperforms all previous methods on datasets
with up to 10,000 samples by a wide margin, using substantially less training
time." Furthermore, they have called TabPFN a "foundation model" for tabular
data, as it can support "data generation, density estimation, learning reusable
embeddings and fine-tuning". If these statements are well-supported, TabPFN may
have the potential to supersede existing modeling approaches on a wide range of
statistical tasks, mirroring a similar revolution in other areas of artificial
intelligence that began with the advent of large language models. In this
paper, we provide a tailored explanation of how TabPFN works for a statistics
audience, by emphasizing its interpretation as approximate Bayesian inference.
We also provide more evidence of TabPFN's "foundation model" capabilities: We
show that an out-of-the-box application of TabPFN vastly outperforms
specialized state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised parameter estimation,
prediction under covariate shift, and heterogeneous treatment effect
estimation. We further show that TabPFN can outperform LASSO at sparse
regression and can break a robustness-efficiency trade-off in classification.

TLDR: 论文提出了两种加速低秩分解模型的技术：秩优化和分层顺序冻结，实验表明这些技术能显著提升训练和推理速度，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低秩分解（LRD）虽然能减少模型参数和计算复杂度，但分解秩过小会导致精度下降，而秩过大则无法显著加速训练和推理。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出两种技术：1) 秩优化，动态调整分解秩；2) 分层顺序冻结，逐步固定分解层的参数。实验在卷积和Transformer模型上进行。

Result: 实验结果显示，结合这两种技术，训练吞吐量提升60%，推理吞吐量提升37%，同时模型精度接近原始模型。

Conclusion: 所提技术能有效加速低秩分解模型，无需牺牲精度，适用于多种深度学习架构。

Abstract: Low Rank Decomposition (LRD) is a model compression technique applied to the
weight tensors of deep learning models in order to reduce the number of
trainable parameters and computational complexity. However, due to high number
of new layers added to the architecture after applying LRD, it may not lead to
a high training/inference acceleration if the decomposition ranks are not small
enough. The issue is that using small ranks increases the risk of significant
accuracy drop after decomposition. In this paper, we propose two techniques for
accelerating low rank decomposed models without requiring to use small ranks
for decomposition. These methods include rank optimization and sequential
freezing of decomposed layers. We perform experiments on both convolutional and
transformer-based models. Experiments show that these techniques can improve
the model throughput up to 60% during training and 37% during inference when
combined together while preserving the accuracy close to that of the original
models

Motivation: 现有约束MAB问题中的遗憾界通常为经典的上界，而数据依赖的遗憾界可以更小，但尚未在约束MAB中被研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了针对硬约束的算法，其遗憾界包含两个数据依赖项：约束满足难度和学习复杂度。

Result: 证明了数据依赖的遗憾界在约束MAB中是可行的，并给出了算法的具体表现。

Conclusion: 数据依赖的遗憾界是约束MAB问题的固有特性，本文算法和分析为此提供了理论基础。

Abstract: This paper initiates the study of data-dependent regret bounds in constrained
MAB settings. These bounds depend on the sequence of losses that characterize
the problem instance. Thus, they can be much smaller than classical
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bounds, while being equivalent to
them in the worst case. Despite this, data-dependent regret bounds have been
completely overlooked in constrained MAB settings. The goal of this paper is to
answer the following question: Can data-dependent regret bounds be derived in
the presence of constraints? We answer this question affirmatively in
constrained MABs with adversarial losses and stochastic constraints.
Specifically, our main focus is on the most challenging and natural settings
with hard constraints, where the learner must ensure that the constraints are
always satisfied with high probability. We design an algorithm with a regret
bound consisting of two data-dependent terms. The first term captures the
difficulty of satisfying the constraints, while the second one encodes the
complexity of learning independently of the presence of constraints. We also
prove a lower bound showing that these two terms are not artifacts of our
specific approach and analysis, but rather the fundamental components that
inherently characterize the complexities of the problem. Finally, in designing
our algorithm, we also derive some novel results in the related (and easier)
soft constraints settings, which may be of independent interest.

Result: 在ViT上测试，模型大小减少4%时准确率提升0.3%；模型大小减少15%时准确率仅下降1%。

Conclusion: 传统多头注意力并非总是最佳选择，GQKVA提供了更轻量、更快的替代方案。

Abstract: Massive transformer-based models face several challenges, including slow and
computationally intensive pre-training and over-parametrization. This paper
addresses these challenges by proposing a versatile method called GQKVA, which
generalizes query, key, and value grouping techniques. GQKVA is designed to
speed up transformer pre-training while reducing the model size. Our
experiments with various GQKVA variants highlight a clear trade-off between
performance and model size, allowing for customized choices based on resource
and time limitations. Our findings also indicate that the conventional
multi-head attention approach is not always the best choice, as there are
lighter and faster alternatives available. We tested our method on ViT, which
achieved an approximate 0.3% increase in accuracy while reducing the model size
by about 4% in the task of image classification. Additionally, our most
aggressive model reduction experiment resulted in a reduction of approximately
15% in model size, with only around a 1% drop in accuracy.

Conclusion: GIT是一种高效、鲁棒的梯度反演方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: We propose Gradient Inversion Transcript (GIT), a novel generative approach
for reconstructing training data from leaked gradients. GIT employs a
generative attack model, whose architecture is tailored to align with the
structure of the leaked model based on theoretical analysis. Once trained
offline, GIT can be deployed efficiently and only relies on the leaked
gradients to reconstruct the input data, rendering it applicable under various
distributed learning environments. When used as a prior for other iterative
optimization-based methods, GIT not only accelerates convergence but also
enhances the overall reconstruction quality. GIT consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple datasets and demonstrates strong robustness
under challenging conditions, including inaccurate gradients, data distribution
shifts and discrepancies in model parameters.

Conclusion: LSTM训练的最优性能出现在有序到混沌的首次过渡点，此时'混沌边缘'最宽，有利于权重配置的探索。

Abstract: We observe a novel 'multiple-descent' phenomenon during the training process
of LSTM, in which the test loss goes through long cycles of up and down trend
multiple times after the model is overtrained. By carrying out asymptotic
stability analysis of the models, we found that the cycles in test loss are
closely associated with the phase transition process between order and chaos,
and the local optimal epochs are consistently at the critical transition point
between the two phases. More importantly, the global optimal epoch occurs at
the first transition from order to chaos, where the 'width' of the 'edge of
chaos' is the widest, allowing the best exploration of better weight
configurations for learning.

Abstract: Dynamics modeling has been introduced as a novel paradigm in message passing
(MP) of graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing methods consider MP between
nodes as a heat diffusion process, and leverage heat equation to model the
temporal evolution of nodes in the embedding space. However, heat equation can
hardly depict the wave nature of graph signals in graph signal processing.
Besides, heat equation is essentially a partial differential equation (PDE)
involving a first partial derivative of time, whose numerical solution usually
has low stability, and leads to inefficient model training. In this paper, we
would like to depict more wave details in MP, since graph signals are
essentially wave signals that can be seen as a superposition of a series of
waves in the form of eigenvector. This motivates us to consider MP as a wave
propagation process to capture the temporal evolution of wave signals in the
space. Based on wave equation in physics, we innovatively develop a graph wave
equation to leverage the wave propagation on graphs. In details, we demonstrate
that the graph wave equation can be connected to traditional spectral GNNs,
facilitating the design of graph wave networks based on various Laplacians and
enhancing the performance of the spectral GNNs. Besides, the graph wave
equation is particularly a PDE involving a second partial derivative of time,
which has stronger stability on graphs than the heat equation that involves a
first partial derivative of time. Additionally, we theoretically prove that the
numerical solution derived from the graph wave equation are constantly stable,
enabling to significantly enhance model efficiency while ensuring its
performance. Extensive experiments show that GWNs achieve SOTA and efficient
performance on benchmark datasets, and exhibit outstanding performance in
addressing challenging graph problems, such as over-smoothing and heterophily.

Motivation: 蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用（PPIs）对理解疾病机制和药物发现至关重要，但现有方法在结合亲和力预测上表现不足。

Method: 引入改进的PPB-Affinity数据集，并提出四种架构（EC、SC、HP、PAD）用于PLMs的适应，评估了两种训练方法。

Result: HP和PAD架构显著优于传统方法，Spearman相关性提升达12%。

Conclusion: 复杂架构设计对充分发挥PLMs在PPI结合亲和力预测中的潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental to numerous cellular
processes, and their characterization is vital for understanding disease
mechanisms and guiding drug discovery. While protein language models (PLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting protein structure and
function, their application to sequence-based PPI binding affinity prediction
remains relatively underexplored. This gap is often attributed to the scarcity
of high-quality, rigorously refined datasets and the reliance on simple
strategies for concatenating protein representations. In this work, we address
these limitations. First, we introduce a meticulously curated version of the
PPB-Affinity dataset of a total of 8,207 unique protein-protein interaction
entries, by resolving annotation inconsistencies and duplicate entries for
multi-chain protein interactions. This dataset incorporates a stringent, less
than or equal to 30%, sequence identity threshold to ensure robust splitting
into training, validation, and test sets, minimizing data leakage. Second, we
propose and systematically evaluate four architectures for adapting PLMs to PPI
binding affinity prediction: embeddings concatenation (EC), sequences
concatenation (SC), hierarchical pooling (HP), and pooled attention addition
(PAD). These architectures were assessed using two training methods: full
fine-tuning and a lightweight approach employing ConvBERT heads over frozen PLM
features. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple leading PLMs (ProtT5,
ESM2, Ankh, Ankh2, and ESM3) demonstrated that the HP and PAD architectures
consistently outperform conventional concatenation methods, achieving up to 12%
increase in terms of Spearman correlation. These results highlight the
necessity of sophisticated architectural designs to fully exploit the
capabilities of PLMs for nuanced PPI binding affinity prediction.

Conclusion: Koopman增强的Transformer是一种有前景的混合方法，适用于噪声和复杂现实条件下的稳健、可解释且理论支持的时间序列预测。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as energy,
finance, and healthcare, where accurate predictions inform decision-making
under uncertainty. Although Transformer-based models have demonstrated success
in sequential modeling, their adoption for time series remains limited by
challenges such as noise sensitivity, long-range dependencies, and a lack of
inductive bias for temporal structure. In this work, we present a unified and
principled framework for benchmarking three prominent Transformer forecasting
architectures-Autoformer, Informer, and Patchtst-each evaluated through three
architectural variants: Minimal, Standard, and Full, representing increasing
levels of complexity and modeling capacity.
  We conduct over 1500 controlled experiments on a suite of ten synthetic
signals, spanning five patch lengths and five forecast horizons under both
clean and noisy conditions. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across
model families.
  To advance this landscape further, we introduce the Koopman-enhanced
Transformer framework, Deep Koopformer, which integrates operator-theoretic
latent state modeling to improve stability and interpretability. We demonstrate
its efficacy on nonlinear and chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight
Koopman based Transformer as a promising hybrid approach for robust,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded time series forecasting in noisy and
complex real-world conditions.

Abstract: Regret minimization in stochastic non-stationary bandits gained popularity
over the last decade, as it can model a broad class of real-world problems,
from advertising to recommendation systems. Existing literature relies on
various assumptions about the reward-generating process, such as Bernoulli or
subgaussian rewards. However, in settings such as finance and
telecommunications, heavy-tailed distributions naturally arise. In this work,
we tackle the heavy-tailed piecewise-stationary bandit problem. Heavy-tailed
bandits, introduced by Bubeck et al., 2013, operate on the minimal assumption
that the finite absolute centered moments of maximum order $1+\epsilon$ are
uniformly bounded by a constant $v<+\infty$, for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We
focus on the most popular non-stationary bandit setting, i.e., the
piecewise-stationary setting, in which the mean of reward-generating
distributions may change at unknown time steps. We provide a novel Catoni-style
change-point detection strategy tailored for heavy-tailed distributions that
relies on recent advancements in the theory of sequential estimation, which is
of independent interest. We introduce Robust-CPD-UCB, which combines this
change-point detection strategy with optimistic algorithms for bandits,
providing its regret upper bound and an impossibility result on the minimum
attainable regret for any policy. Finally, we validate our approach through
numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools to detect
complex patterns of protein sequences. However, the capability of PLMs to fully
capture information on protein sequences might be limited by focusing on single
pre-training tasks. Although adding data modalities or supervised objectives
can improve the performance of PLMs, pre-training often remains focused on
denoising corrupted sequences. To push the boundaries of PLMs, our research
investigated a multi-task pre-training strategy. We developed Ankh3, a model
jointly optimized on two objectives: masked language modeling with multiple
masking probabilities and protein sequence completion relying only on protein
sequences as input. This multi-task pre-training demonstrated that PLMs can
learn richer and more generalizable representations solely from protein
sequences. The results demonstrated improved performance in downstream tasks,
such as secondary structure prediction, fluorescence, GB1 fitness, and contact
prediction. The integration of multiple tasks gave the model a more
comprehensive understanding of protein properties, leading to more robust and
accurate predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法仅通过激活分析SAE特征，未能全面描述特征对模型输出的影响，因此需要更有效的特征分类方法。

Method: 提出输入和输出分数来区分输入特征（捕获输入模式）和输出特征（影响模型输出），并过滤低输出分数特征。

Result: 过滤低输出分数特征后，SAE的操控性能提升2-3倍，达到与监督方法竞争的水平。

Conclusion: 输入和输出特征的区分及过滤低输出分数特征可显著提升SAE的无监督应用效果。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been proposed as an unsupervised approach to
learn a decomposition of a model's latent space. This enables useful
applications such as steering - influencing the output of a model towards a
desired concept - without requiring labeled data. Current methods identify SAE
features to steer by analyzing the input tokens that activate them. However,
recent work has highlighted that activations alone do not fully describe the
effect of a feature on the model's output. In this work, we draw a distinction
between two types of features: input features, which mainly capture patterns in
the model's input, and output features, which have a human-understandable
effect on the model's output. We propose input and output scores to
characterize and locate these types of features, and show that high values for
both scores rarely co-occur in the same features. These findings have practical
implications: after filtering out features with low output scores, we obtain
2-3x improvements when steering with SAEs, making them competitive with
supervised methods.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为SafeDPO的新算法，通过单阶段策略学习直接优化安全对齐目标，简化了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，确保其安全性变得至关重要。现有方法复杂且需额外步骤，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 基于Direct Preference Optimization（DPO），提出SafeDPO算法，仅需一个额外超参数和少量修改，无需拟合单独奖励和成本模型。

Result: SafeDPO在安全对齐和人类偏好对齐方面表现优异，与现有先进算法竞争。

Conclusion: SafeDPO简化了安全对齐流程，同时保持了高性能，为LLMs的安全性提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance and find applications
across a growing number of fields, ensuring the safety of LLMs has become
increasingly critical. To address safety concerns, recent studies have proposed
integrating safety constraints into Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF). However, these approaches tend to be complex, as they encompass
complicated procedures in RLHF along with additional steps required by the
safety constraints. Inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we
introduce a new algorithm called SafeDPO, which is designed to directly
optimize the safety alignment objective in a single stage of policy learning,
without requiring relaxation. SafeDPO introduces only one additional
hyperparameter to further enhance safety and requires only minor modifications
to standard DPO. As a result, it eliminates the need to fit separate reward and
cost models or to sample from the language model during fine-tuning, while
still enhancing the safety of LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate that SafeDPO
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art safety alignment
algorithms, both in terms of aligning with human preferences and improving
safety.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的图神经网络隐私攻击方法GOOD-MIA，解决了跨域攻击中的分布多样性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络方法因引入目标拓扑结构而面临隐私泄露风险，现有攻击假设（攻击者能获取相同分布的辅助数据集）与现实不符。

Method: 将分布多样性问题建模为OOD问题，构建多域影子子图，提取稳定节点表示并消除冗余信息，优化攻击的域适应性。

Result: 实验表明GOOD-MIA在多域数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: GOOD-MIA通过OOD设计实现了跨域图攻击，为隐私保护提供了新视角。

Abstract: Graph Neural Network-based methods face privacy leakage risks due to the
introduction of topological structures about the targets, which allows
attackers to bypass the target's prior knowledge of the sensitive attributes
and realize membership inference attacks (MIA) by observing and analyzing the
topology distribution. As privacy concerns grow, the assumption of MIA, which
presumes that attackers can obtain an auxiliary dataset with the same
distribution, is increasingly deviating from reality. In this paper, we
categorize the distribution diversity issue in real-world MIA scenarios as an
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) problem, and propose a novel Graph OOD Membership
Inference Attack (GOOD-MIA) to achieve cross-domain graph attacks.
Specifically, we construct shadow subgraphs with distributions from different
domains to model the diversity of real-world data. We then explore the stable
node representations that remain unchanged under external influences and
consider eliminating redundant information from confounding environments and
extracting task-relevant key information to more clearly distinguish between
the characteristics of training data and unseen data. This OOD-based design
makes cross-domain graph attacks possible. Finally, we perform risk
extrapolation to optimize the attack's domain adaptability during attack
inference to generalize the attack to other domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that GOOD-MIA achieves superior attack performance in datasets
designed for multiple domains.

TLDR: ExPLAIND是一个统一框架，整合了模型组件、数据和训练轨迹的视角，提供理论支持的模型行为解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后解释方法通常孤立地分析模型行为，缺乏统一视角和关键交互信息，ExPLAIND旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过推广梯度路径核方法，将其应用于更现实的训练场景，并从中推导参数和步骤级影响分数。

Result: 实验表明，ExPLAIND能准确复现CNN和Transformer模型，并在参数剪枝中表现优异，同时支持对Grokking现象的分析。

Conclusion: ExPLAIND提供了一个理论支持的统一框架，用于解释模型行为和训练动态。

Abstract: Post-hoc interpretability methods typically attribute a model's behavior to
its components, data, or training trajectory in isolation. This leads to
explanations that lack a unified view and may miss key interactions. While
combining existing methods or applying them at different training stages offers
broader insights, these approaches usually lack theoretical support. In this
work, we present ExPLAIND, a unified framework that integrates all three
perspectives. First, we generalize recent work on gradient path kernels, which
reformulate models trained by gradient descent as a kernel machine, to more
realistic training settings. Empirically, we find that both a CNN and a
Transformer model are replicated accurately by this reformulation. Second, we
derive novel parameter- and step-wise influence scores from the kernel feature
maps. We show their effectiveness in parameter pruning that is comparable to
existing methods, reinforcing their value for model component attribution.
Finally, jointly interpreting model components and data over the training
process, we leverage ExPLAIND to analyze a Transformer that exhibits Grokking.
Among other things, our findings support previously proposed stages of
Grokking, while refining the final phase as one of alignment of input
embeddings and final layers around a representation pipeline learned after the
memorization phase. Overall, ExPLAIND provides a theoretically grounded,
unified framework to interpret model behavior and training dynamics.

Motivation: 神经网络在有限和偏见数据下训练时，隐私攻击风险加剧，虚假相关性偏差可能进一步放大隐私漏洞。

Method: 研究虚假相关性对隐私的影响，提出虚假隐私泄漏概念，并通过实验验证模型架构对隐私结果的影响。

Result: 虚假组比非虚假组更易受隐私攻击，减少虚假相关性无法缓解隐私泄漏，模型架构选择影响隐私结果。

Conclusion: 隐私差异与记忆化相关，减少虚假相关性无法改善隐私水平，模型架构对隐私有显著影响。

Abstract: Neural networks are vulnerable to privacy attacks aimed at stealing sensitive
data. The risks can be amplified in a real-world scenario, particularly when
models are trained on limited and biased data. In this work, we investigate the
impact of spurious correlation bias on privacy vulnerability. We introduce
\emph{spurious privacy leakage}, a phenomenon where spurious groups are
significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks than non-spurious groups. We
further show that group privacy disparity increases in tasks with simpler
objectives (e.g. fewer classes) due to the persistence of spurious features.
Surprisingly, we find that reducing spurious correlation using spurious robust
methods does not mitigate spurious privacy leakage. This leads us to introduce
a perspective on privacy disparity based on memorization, where mitigating
spurious correlation does not mitigate the memorization of spurious data, and
therefore, neither the privacy level. Lastly, we compare the privacy of
different model architectures trained with spurious data, demonstrating that,
contrary to prior works, architectural choice can affect privacy outcomes.

Motivation: 现有加速T2MV生成方法在少步扩散模型中牺牲了图像保真度和视图一致性，需改进。

Method: 1. 将多视图去噪统一为马尔可夫决策过程；2. 引入ZMV-Sampling采样技术；3. 提出MV-ZigAL策略优化；4. 将RL微调重构为约束优化问题。

Result: MVC-ZigAL框架显著提升了少步T2MV扩散模型的保真度和一致性，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: MVC-ZigAL通过强化学习优化，有效平衡了T2MV生成的保真度与一致性，为少步扩散模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-to-multiview (T2MV) generation, which produces coherent multiview images
from a single text prompt, remains computationally intensive, while accelerated
T2MV methods using few-step diffusion models often sacrifice image fidelity and
view consistency. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning
(RL) finetuning framework tailored for few-step T2MV diffusion models to
jointly optimize per-view fidelity and cross-view consistency. Specifically, we
first reformulate T2MV denoising across all views as a single unified Markov
decision process, enabling multiview-aware policy optimization driven by a
joint-view reward objective. Next, we introduce ZMV-Sampling, a test-time T2MV
sampling technique that adds an inversion-denoising pass to reinforce both
viewpoint and text conditioning, resulting in improved T2MV generation at the
cost of inference time. To internalize its performance gains into the base
sampling policy, we develop MV-ZigAL, a novel policy optimization strategy that
uses reward advantages of ZMV-Sampling over standard sampling as learning
signals for policy updates. Finally, noting that the joint-view reward
objective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view
metrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV
diffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view
fidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more
efficient and balanced policy updates. By integrating this constrained
optimization paradigm with MV-ZigAL, we establish our complete RL finetuning
framework, referred to as MVC-ZigAL, which effectively refines the few-step
T2MV diffusion baseline in both fidelity and consistency while preserving its
few-step efficiency.

Result: TD-GFN在多个任务中高效可靠地训练，收敛速度和样本质量显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TD-GFN通过代理无关方法提升了GFlowNet的训练效果，适用于高成本奖励函数的场景。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a promising class of generative
models designed to sample diverse, high-reward structures by modeling
distributions over compositional objects. In many real-world applications,
obtaining the reward function for such objects is expensive, time-consuming, or
requires human input, making it necessary to train GFlowNets from historical
datasets. Most existing methods adopt a model-based approach, learning a proxy
model from the dataset to approximate the reward function. However, this
strategy inherently ties the quality of the learned policy to the accuracy of
the proxy, introducing additional complexity and uncertainty into the training
process. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Trajectory-Distilled
GFlowNet (TD-GFN)}, a \emph{proxy-free} training framework that eliminates the
need for out-of-dataset reward queries. Our method is motivated by the key
observation that different edges in the associated directed acyclic graph (DAG)
contribute unequally to effective policy learning. TD-GFN leverages inverse
reinforcement learning to estimate edge-level rewards from the offline dataset,
which are then used to ingeniously prune the DAG and guide backward trajectory
sampling during training. This approach directs the policy toward high-reward
regions while reducing the complexity of model fitting. Empirical results
across multiple tasks show that TD-GFN trains both efficiently and reliably,
significantly outperforming existing baselines in convergence speed and sample
quality.

Result: 实验揭示了扩散模型的泛化行为，包括从记忆到泛化的缩放行为、早期学习和双下降训练动态，以及偏差-方差分解。

Conclusion: PFD为未来研究扩散模型的泛化能力提供了理论和实证基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
capable of producing high-quality samples that generalize beyond the training
data. However, evaluating this generalization remains challenging: theoretical
metrics are often impractical for high-dimensional data, while no practical
metrics rigorously measure generalization. In this work, we bridge this gap by
introducing probability flow distance ($\texttt{PFD}$), a theoretically
grounded and computationally efficient metric to measure distributional
generalization. Specifically, $\texttt{PFD}$ quantifies the distance between
distributions by comparing their noise-to-data mappings induced by the
probability flow ODE. Moreover, by using $\texttt{PFD}$ under a teacher-student
evaluation protocol, we empirically uncover several key generalization
behaviors in diffusion models, including: (1) scaling behavior from
memorization to generalization, (2) early learning and double descent training
dynamics, and (3) bias-variance decomposition. Beyond these insights, our work
lays a foundation for future empirical and theoretical studies on
generalization in diffusion models.

spatial interference effects; (2) it adapts to different spatial covariance
functions; (3) it is computationally efficient. Theoretical results and
numerical experiments based on synthetic environments and a dispatch simulator
that models a city-scale ridesharing market, further validate the effectiveness
of our design. A python implementation of our method is available at

Conclusion: MolEditRL通过结构约束和精确属性优化的结合，为分子编辑提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Molecular editing aims to modify a given molecule to optimize desired
chemical properties while preserving structural similarity. However, current
approaches typically rely on string-based or continuous representations, which
fail to adequately capture the discrete, graph-structured nature of molecules,
resulting in limited structural fidelity and poor controllability. In this
paper, we propose MolEditRL, a molecular editing framework that explicitly
integrates structural constraints with precise property optimization.
Specifically, MolEditRL consists of two stages: (1) a discrete graph diffusion
model pretrained to reconstruct target molecules conditioned on source
structures and natural language instructions; (2) an editing-aware
reinforcement learning fine-tuning stage that further enhances property
alignment and structural preservation by explicitly optimizing editing
decisions under graph constraints. For comprehensive evaluation, we construct
MolEdit-Instruct, the largest and most property-rich molecular editing dataset,
comprising 3 million diverse examples spanning single- and multi-property tasks
across 10 chemical attributes. Experimental results demonstrate that MolEditRL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both property
optimization accuracy and structural fidelity, achieving a 74\% improvement in
editing success rate while using 98\% fewer parameters.

Method: Reshaping dense weight matrices into tensors and using low-rank tensor network decompositions.

Result: TNNs show promise for compression, scaling, and interpretability, but face practical adoption challenges.

Conclusion: TNNs deserve more attention; key research directions are needed to overcome scaling and adoption barriers.

Abstract: Tensorizing a neural network involves reshaping some or all of its dense
weight matrices into higher-order tensors and approximating them using low-rank
tensor network decompositions. This technique has shown promise as a model
compression strategy for large-scale neural networks. However, despite
encouraging empirical results, tensorized neural networks (TNNs) remain
underutilized in mainstream deep learning. In this position paper, we offer a
perspective on both the potential and current limitations of TNNs. We argue
that TNNs represent a powerful yet underexplored framework for deep
learning--one that deserves greater attention from both engineering and
theoretical communities. Beyond compression, we highlight the value of TNNs as
a flexible class of architectures with distinctive scaling properties and
increased interpretability. A central feature of TNNs is the presence of bond
indices, which introduce new latent spaces not found in conventional networks.
These internal representations may provide deeper insight into the evolution of
features across layers, potentially advancing the goals of mechanistic
interpretability. We conclude by outlining several key research directions
aimed at overcoming the practical barriers to scaling and adopting TNNs in
modern deep learning workflows.

Conclusion: 该方法通过可学习缓冲区和轻量级蒸馏模块，显著提升了持续学习的性能，代码将公开。

Abstract: Replay-based continual learning (CL) methods assume that models trained on a
small subset can also effectively minimize the empirical risk of the complete
dataset. These methods maintain a memory buffer that stores a sampled subset of
data from previous tasks to consolidate past knowledge. However, this
assumption is not guaranteed in practice due to the limited capacity of the
memory buffer and the heuristic criteria used for buffer data selection. To
address this issue, we propose a new dataset distillation framework tailored
for CL, which maintains a learnable memory buffer to distill the global
information from the current task data and accumulated knowledge preserved in
the previous memory buffer. Moreover, to avoid the computational overhead and
overfitting risks associated with parameterizing the entire buffer during
distillation, we introduce a lightweight distillation module that can achieve
global information distillation solely by generating learnable soft labels for
the memory buffer data. Extensive experiments show that, our method can achieve
competitive results and effectively mitigates forgetting across various
datasets. The source code will be publicly available.

Result: 实验表明，EO在深层模型中性能与反向传播相当，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: EO不仅解决了PC的深层架构问题，还为生物启发学习的扩展提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Predictive Coding (PC) offers a biologically plausible alternative to
backpropagation for neural network training, yet struggles with deeper
architectures. This paper identifies the root cause: an inherent signal decay
problem where gradients attenuate exponentially with depth, becoming
computationally negligible due to numerical precision constraints. To address
this fundamental limitation, we introduce Error Optimization (EO), a novel
reparameterization that preserves PC's theoretical properties while eliminating
signal decay. By optimizing over prediction errors rather than states, EO
enables signals to reach all layers simultaneously and without attenuation,
converging orders of magnitude faster than standard PC. Experiments across
multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that EO matches
backpropagation's performance even for deeper models where conventional PC
struggles. Besides practical improvements, our work provides theoretical
insight into PC dynamics and establishes a foundation for scaling
biologically-inspired learning to deeper architectures on digital hardware and
beyond.

Result: 在对抗训练、捷径训练和跨层缝合实验中，FuLA表现更可靠，减少了任务线索相关的伪影。

Conclusion: FuLA是一种更可靠的功能相似性评估方法，优于传统缝合级匹配。

Abstract: Evaluating functional similarity involves quantifying the degree to which
independently trained neural networks learn functionally similar
representations. Reliably inferring the functional similarity of these networks
remains an open problem with far-reaching implications for AI. Model stitching
has emerged as a promising paradigm, where an optimal affine transformation
aligns two models to solve a task, with the stitched model serving as a proxy
for functional similarity. In this work, we draw inspiration from the knowledge
distillation literature and propose Functional Latent Alignment (FuLA) as a
novel optimality condition for model stitching. We revisit previously explored
functional similarity testbeds and introduce a new one, based on which FuLA
emerges as an overall more reliable method of functional similarity.
Specifically, our experiments in (a) adversarial training, (b) shortcut
training and, (c) cross-layer stitching, reveal that FuLA is less prone to
artifacts tied to training on task cues while achieving non-trivial alignments
that are missed by stitch-level matching.

Abstract: Multiset functions, which are functions that map multisets to vectors, are a
fundamental tool in the construction of neural networks for multisets and
graphs. To guarantee that the vector representation of the multiset is
faithful, it is often desirable to have multiset mappings that are both
injective and bi-Lipschitz. Currently, there are several constructions of
multiset functions achieving both these guarantees, leading to improved
performance in some tasks but often also to higher compute time than standard
constructions. Accordingly, it is natural to inquire whether simpler multiset
functions achieving the same guarantees are available. In this paper, we make a
large step towards giving a negative answer to this question. We consider the
family of k-ary Janossy pooling, which includes many of the most popular
multiset models, and prove that no piecewise linear Janossy pooling function
can be injective. On the positive side, we show that when restricted to
multisets without multiplicities, even simple deep-sets models suffice for
injectivity and bi-Lipschitzness.

Conclusion: 数据多样性对语言模型泛化至关重要，G-Vendi和Prismatic Synthesis为改进模型性能提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Effective generalization in language models depends critically on the
diversity of their training data. Yet existing diversity metrics often fall
short of this goal, relying on surface-level heuristics that are decoupled from
model behavior. This motivates us to ask: What kind of diversity in training
data actually drives generalization in language models -- and how can we
measure and amplify it? Through large-scale empirical analyses spanning over
300 training runs, carefully controlled for data scale and quality, we show
that data diversity can be a strong predictor of generalization in LLM
reasoning -- as measured by average model performance on unseen
out-of-distribution benchmarks. We introduce G-Vendi, a metric that quantifies
diversity via the entropy of model-induced gradients. Despite using a small
off-the-shelf proxy model for gradients, G-Vendi consistently outperforms
alternative measures, achieving strong correlation (Spearman's $\rho \approx
0.9$) with out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on both natural language
inference (NLI) and math reasoning tasks. Building on this insight, we present
Prismatic Synthesis, a framework for generating diverse synthetic data by
targeting underrepresented regions in gradient space. Experimental results show
that Prismatic Synthesis consistently improves model performance as we scale
synthetic data -- not just on in-distribution test but across unseen,
out-of-distribution benchmarks -- significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
models that rely on 20 times larger data generator than ours. For example,
PrismMath-7B, our model distilled from a 32B LLM, outperforms

Method: 在温和正则条件下，分析带有权重衰减的梯度流轨迹，假设无正则化梯度流收敛。

Result: 轨迹呈现两阶段行为：快速收敛到临界点流形，随后慢漂移阶段最小化参数范数，解释了“grokking”现象。

Abstract: We study the dynamics of gradient flow with small weight decay on general
training losses $F: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$. Under mild regularity
assumptions and assuming convergence of the unregularised gradient flow, we
show that the trajectory with weight decay $\lambda$ exhibits a two-phase
behaviour as $\lambda \to 0$. During the initial fast phase, the trajectory
follows the unregularised gradient flow and converges to a manifold of critical
points of $F$. Then, at time of order $1/\lambda$, the trajectory enters a slow
drift phase and follows a Riemannian gradient flow minimising the $\ell_2$-norm
of the parameters. This purely optimisation-based phenomenon offers a natural
explanation for the \textit{grokking} effect observed in deep learning, where
the training loss rapidly reaches zero while the test loss plateaus for an
extended period before suddenly improving. We argue that this generalisation
jump can be attributed to the slow norm reduction induced by weight decay, as
explained by our analysis. We validate this mechanism empirically on several
synthetic regression tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究受分布偏移学习的启发，旨在解决监督学习中的污染问题，填补了传统学习与污染学习之间的复杂性差距。

Method: 采用迭代多项式滤波算法，结合低度多项式近似和夹逼近似器，处理不同类型的污染（如有界污染和强加性污染）。

Conclusion: 该研究显著推进了对污染环境下高效监督学习的理解，填补了相关领域的空白。

Abstract: Inspired by recent work on learning with distribution shift, we give a
general outlier removal algorithm called iterative polynomial filtering and
show a number of striking applications for supervised learning with
contamination: (1) We show that any function class that can be approximated by
low-degree polynomials with respect to a hypercontractive distribution can be
efficiently learned under bounded contamination (also known as nasty noise).
This is a surprising resolution to a longstanding gap between the complexity of
agnostic learning and learning with contamination, as it was widely believed
that low-degree approximators only implied tolerance to label noise. (2) For
any function class that admits the (stronger) notion of sandwiching
approximators, we obtain near-optimal learning guarantees even with respect to
heavy additive contamination, where far more than $1/2$ of the training set may
be added adversarially. Prior related work held only for regression and in a
list-decodable setting. (3) We obtain the first efficient algorithms for
tolerant testable learning of functions of halfspaces with respect to any fixed
log-concave distribution. Even the non-tolerant case for a single halfspace in
this setting had remained open. These results significantly advance our
understanding of efficient supervised learning under contamination, a setting
that has been much less studied than its unsupervised counterpart.

Motivation: 针对专利文本语义挖掘中的跨模态特征融合、长文本建模效率低和层次语义一致性不足的问题。

Method: 通过HCL在词、句、段落层次构建动态掩码、对比和跨结构相似性约束；M-GAT建模专利分类代码、引用关系和文本语义为异构图结构；MSA采用分层稀疏策略优化长文本建模效率。

Result: 实验表明，HGM-Net在专利分类和相似性匹配等任务中优于现有深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为提升专利审查效率和技术相关性挖掘提供了理论和实践价值兼具的解决方案。

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of cross-modal feature fusion, low efficiency of long
text modeling and lack of hierarchical semantic coherence in patent text
semantic mining, this study proposes HGM-Net, a deep learning framework that
integrates Hierarchical Comparative Learning (HCL), Multi-modal Graph Attention
Network (M-GAT) and Multi-Granularity Sparse Attention (MSA), which builds a
dynamic mask, contrast and cross-structural similarity constraints on the word,
sentence and paragraph hierarchies through HCL. Contrast and cross-structural
similarity constraints are constructed at the word and paragraph levels by HCL
to strengthen the local semantic and global thematic consistency of patent
text; M-GAT models patent classification codes, citation relations and text
semantics as heterogeneous graph structures, and achieves dynamic fusion of
multi-source features by cross-modal gated attention; MSA adopts a hierarchical
sparsity strategy to optimize the computational efficiency of long text
modeling at word, phrase, sentence and paragraph granularity. Experiments show
that the framework demonstrates significant advantages over existing deep
learning methods in tasks such as patent classification and similarity
matching, and provides a solution with both theoretical innovation and
practical value for solving the problems of patent examination efficiency
improvement and technology relevance mining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以平衡推理步骤与函数调用精度，导致性能不佳。FunReason旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FunReason采用自动数据优化策略和自优化多尺度损失（SRML）方法，动态平衡推理与函数调用精度。

Result: FunReason性能接近GPT-4o，并有效缓解微调中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: FunReason为增强LLM函数调用能力提供了全面解决方案，包括平衡训练方法和数据优化流程。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with function calling has
emerged as a crucial capability for enhancing their practical utility in
real-world applications. However, effectively combining reasoning processes
with accurate function execution remains a significant challenge. Traditional
training approaches often struggle to balance the detailed reasoning steps with
the precision of function calls, leading to suboptimal performance. To address
these limitations, we introduce FunReason, a novel framework that enhances
LLMs' function calling capabilities through an automated data refinement
strategy and a Self-Refinement Multiscale Loss (SRML) approach. FunReason
leverages LLMs' natural reasoning abilities to generate high-quality training
examples, focusing on query parseability, reasoning coherence, and function
call precision. The SRML approach dynamically balances the contribution of
reasoning processes and function call accuracy during training, addressing the
inherent trade-off between these two critical aspects. FunReason achieves
performance comparable to GPT-4o while effectively mitigating catastrophic
forgetting during fine-tuning. FunReason provides a comprehensive solution for
enhancing LLMs' function calling capabilities by introducing a balanced
training methodology and a data refinement pipeline. For code and dataset,

Motivation: 在资源受限的情况下，高效微调大型语言模型（LLM）至关重要。现有方法如LoRA与全微调的学习行为存在差异，尤其是谱特性方面。

Method: 提出PiCa方法，基于预训练权重的谱特性，将梯度投影到低秩列子空间，并结合权重共享减少可训练参数。

Result: PiCa在性能上优于现有PEFT方法，使用13倍更少的可训练参数，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: PiCa是一种理论支持的高效微调方法，显著减少计算开销，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with minimal computational overhead
is essential for efficiently adapting them to downstream tasks under resource
constraints. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), facilitate this by updating only a small subset of
parameters. However, recent studies show that LoRA diverges from full
fine-tuning (Full FT) in its learning behavior, particularly in terms of
spectral properties. Motivated by these findings, we propose PiCa, the first
theoretically grounded PEFT method based on the spectral properties of
fine-tuned weights. PiCa projects gradients onto the low-rank column subspace
of pre-trained weights and exhibits learning patterns more closely aligned with
Full FT. Furthermore, we show that combining PiCa with weight sharing
drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters without compromising
performance, enabling to achieve superior performance than LoRA using 13x fewer
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate PiCa achieves the
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing PEFT methods.

Result: FLAME在基准测试中表现优异，实现了高准确性、可控的安全-准确性权衡及强泛化能力。

Conclusion: FLAME为多病共存患者的药物推荐提供了更优的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and safe medication recommendations are critical for effective
clinical decision-making, especially in multimorbidity cases. However, existing
systems rely on point-wise prediction paradigms that overlook synergistic drug
effects and potential adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We propose FLAME,
a fine-grained list-wise alignment framework for large language models (LLMs),
enabling drug-by-drug generation of drug lists. FLAME formulates recommendation
as a sequential decision process, where each step adds or removes a single
drug. To provide fine-grained learning signals, we devise step-wise Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with potential-based reward shaping, which
explicitly models DDIs and optimizes the contribution of each drug to the
overall prescription. Furthermore, FLAME enhances patient modeling by
integrating structured clinical knowledge and collaborative information into
the representation space of LLMs. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that FLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior accuracy,
controllable safety-accuracy trade-offs, and strong generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. Our code is available at

Motivation: 由于基于梯度的优化是迭代的，训练深度神经网络计算量大，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: GFM利用条件流匹配捕捉优化器（如SGD、Adam、RMSprop）的更新规则，将梯度更新的结构知识融入学习目标。

Result: GFM在预测准确性上优于LSTM等基线模型，与Transformer模型竞争，且能泛化到不同神经网络架构和初始化。

Conclusion: GFM为研究优化动态和加速收敛预测提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks remains computationally intensive due to the
itera2 tive nature of gradient-based optimization. We propose Gradient Flow
Matching (GFM), a continuous-time modeling framework that treats neural network
training as a dynamical system governed by learned optimizer-aware vector
fields. By leveraging conditional flow matching, GFM captures the underlying
update rules of optimizers such as SGD, Adam, and RMSprop, enabling smooth
extrapolation of weight trajectories toward convergence. Unlike black-box
sequence models, GFM incorporates structural knowledge of gradient-based
updates into the learning objective, facilitating accurate forecasting of final
weights from partial training sequences. Empirically, GFM achieves forecasting
accuracy that is competitive with Transformer-based models and significantly
outperforms LSTM and other classical baselines. Furthermore, GFM generalizes
across neural architectures and initializations, providing a unified framework
for studying optimization dynamics and accelerating convergence prediction.

Conclusion: 文本嵌入对虚假相关性更鲁棒，但图像嵌入的线性分类器可能放大隐藏捷径，需整体机制解释性。

Abstract: Transformer-based CLIP models are widely used for text-image probing and
feature extraction, making it relevant to understand the internal mechanisms
behind their predictions. While recent works show that Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) yield interpretable latent components, they focus on what these encode
and miss how they drive predictions. We introduce a scalable framework that
reveals what latent components activate for, how they align with expected
semantics, and how important they are to predictions. To achieve this, we adapt
attribution patching for instance-wise component attributions in CLIP and
highlight key faithfulness limitations of the widely used Logit Lens technique.
By combining attributions with semantic alignment scores, we can automatically
uncover reliance on components that encode semantically unexpected or spurious
concepts. Applied across multiple CLIP variants, our method uncovers hundreds
of surprising components linked to polysemous words, compound nouns, visual
typography and dataset artifacts. While text embeddings remain prone to
semantic ambiguity, they are more robust to spurious correlations compared to
linear classifiers trained on image embeddings. A case study on skin lesion
detection highlights how such classifiers can amplify hidden shortcuts,
underscoring the need for holistic, mechanistic interpretability. We provide

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning holds immense potential for collaboratively
training models from multiple sources without sharing raw data, addressing both
data scarcity and privacy concerns, two key challenges in healthcare. A major
challenge in training multimodal federated models in healthcare is the presence
of missing modalities due to multiple reasons, including variations in clinical
practice, cost and accessibility constraints, retrospective data collection,
privacy concerns, and occasional technical or human errors. Previous methods
typically rely on publicly available real datasets or synthetic data to
compensate for missing modalities. However, obtaining real datasets for every
disease is impractical, and training generative models to synthesize missing
modalities is computationally expensive and prone to errors due to the high
dimensionality of medical data. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight,
low-dimensional feature translator to reconstruct bottleneck features of the
missing modalities. Our experiments on three different datasets (MIMIC-CXR, NIH
Open-I, and CheXpert), in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings
consistently improve the performance of competitive baselines. The code and

Conclusion: 通过优化隐式正则化的变分深度网络，为不确定性量化提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern deep learning models generalize remarkably well in-distribution,
despite being overparametrized and trained with little to no explicit
regularization. Instead, current theory credits implicit regularization imposed
by the choice of architecture, hyperparameters and optimization procedure.
However, deploying deep learning models out-of-distribution, in sequential
decision-making tasks, or in safety-critical domains, necessitates reliable
uncertainty quantification, not just a point estimate. The machinery of modern
approximate inference -- Bayesian deep learning -- should answer the need for
uncertainty quantification, but its effectiveness has been challenged by our
inability to define useful explicit inductive biases through priors, as well as
the associated computational burden. Instead, in this work we demonstrate, both
theoretically and empirically, how to regularize a variational deep network
implicitly via the optimization procedure, just as for standard deep learning.
We fully characterize the inductive bias of (stochastic) gradient descent in
the case of an overparametrized linear model as generalized variational
inference and demonstrate the importance of the choice of parametrization.
Finally, we show empirically that our approach achieves strong in- and
out-of-distribution performance without tuning of additional hyperparameters
and with minimal time and memory overhead over standard deep learning.

Conclusion: DreamPRM的领域重加权策略优于其他数据选择方法，并提供了更高的准确性提升。

Abstract: Reasoning has substantially improved the performance of large language models
(LLMs) on complicated tasks. Central to the current reasoning studies, Process
Reward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning
steps and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning
covers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting
distribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to
greater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM,
therefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage.
However, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality
imbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an
effective data selection strategy. To address the issues, we introduce
DreamPRM, a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs which
employs bi-level optimization. In the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM
performs fine-tuning on multiple datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM
to prioritize high-quality reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of
dataset quality imbalance. In the upper-level optimization, the PRM is
evaluated on a separate meta-learning dataset; this feedback updates the domain
weights through an aggregation loss function, thereby improving the
generalization capability of trained PRM. Extensive experiments on multiple
multimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both mathematical and general
reasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM consistently improves the
performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Further comparisons reveal that
DreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses other data selection methods
and yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time scaling approaches.

Conclusion: RedAHD为自动化设计启发式方法提供了新思路，显著减少了人工干预，展示了LLMs在组合优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) (e.g., traveling
salesman problems (TSPs) and capacitated vehicle routing problems (CVRPs)) in
practice traditionally involves handcrafting heuristics or specifying a search
space for finding effective heuristics. The main challenges from these
approaches, however, are the sheer amount of domain knowledge and
implementation efforts required from human experts. Recently, significant
progress has been made to address these challenges, particularly by using large
language models (LLMs) to design heuristics within some predetermined
generalized algorithmic framework (GAF, e.g., ant colony optimization and
guided local search) for building key functions/components (e.g., a priori
information on how promising it is to include each edge in a solution for TSP
and CVRP). Although existing methods leveraging this idea have shown to yield
impressive optimization performance, they are not fully end-to-end and still
require considerable manual interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel
end-to-end framework, named RedAHD, that enables these LLM-based heuristic
design methods to operate without the need of GAFs. More specifically, RedAHD
employs LLMs to automate the process of reduction, i.e., transforming the COP
at hand into similar COPs that are better-understood, from which LLM-based
heuristic design methods can design effective heuristics for directly solving
the transformed COPs and, in turn, indirectly solving the original COP. Our
experimental results, evaluated on six COPs, show that RedAHD is capable of
designing heuristics with competitive or improved results over the
state-of-the-art methods with minimal human involvement.

Conclusion: 自回归模型能够高效外推，优于传统随机搜索方法，适用于需要优化序列属性的任务。

Abstract: Most successful applications of deep learning involve similar training and
test conditions. However, tasks such as biological sequence design involve
searching for sequences that improve desirable properties beyond previously
known values, which requires novel hypotheses that \emph{extrapolate} beyond
training data. In these settings, extrapolation may be achieved by using random
search methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which, given an initial
state, sample local transformations to approximate a target density that
rewards states with the desired properties. However, even with a well-designed
proposal, MCMC may struggle to explore large structured state spaces
efficiently. Rather than relying on stochastic search, it would be desirable to
have a model that greedily optimizes the properties of interest, successfully
extrapolating in as few steps as possible. We propose to learn such a model
from the Markov chains resulting from MCMC search. Specifically, our approach
uses selected states from Markov chains as a source of training data for an
autoregressive model, which is then able to efficiently generate novel
sequences that extrapolate along the sequence-level properties of interest. The
proposed approach is validated on three problems: protein sequence design, text
sentiment control, and text anonymization. We find that the autoregressive
model can extrapolate as well or better than MCMC, but with the additional
benefits of scalability and significantly higher sample efficiency.

Conclusion: 呼吁社区系统性测量特征一致性，以促进MI研究的稳健累积进展。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are a prominent tool in mechanistic
interpretability (MI) for decomposing neural network activations into
interpretable features. However, the aspiration to identify a canonical set of
features is challenged by the observed inconsistency of learned SAE features
across different training runs, undermining the reliability and efficiency of
MI research. This position paper argues that mechanistic interpretability
should prioritize feature consistency in SAEs -- the reliable convergence to
equivalent feature sets across independent runs. We propose using the Pairwise
Dictionary Mean Correlation Coefficient (PW-MCC) as a practical metric to
operationalize consistency and demonstrate that high levels are achievable
(0.80 for TopK SAEs on LLM activations) with appropriate architectural choices.
Our contributions include detailing the benefits of prioritizing consistency;
providing theoretical grounding and synthetic validation using a model
organism, which verifies PW-MCC as a reliable proxy for ground-truth recovery;
and extending these findings to real-world LLM data, where high feature
consistency strongly correlates with the semantic similarity of learned feature
explanations. We call for a community-wide shift towards systematically
measuring feature consistency to foster robust cumulative progress in MI.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with outcome-based feedback faces a fundamental
challenge: when rewards are only observed at trajectory endpoints, how do we
assign credit to the right actions? This paper provides the first comprehensive
analysis of this problem in online RL with general function approximation. We
develop a provably sample-efficient algorithm achieving $\widetilde{O}({C_{\rm
cov} H^3}/{\epsilon^2})$ sample complexity, where $C_{\rm cov}$ is the
coverability coefficient of the underlying MDP. By leveraging general function
approximation, our approach works effectively in large or infinite state spaces
where tabular methods fail, requiring only that value functions and reward
functions can be represented by appropriate function classes. Our results also
characterize when outcome-based feedback is statistically separated from
per-step rewards, revealing an unavoidable exponential separation for certain
MDPs. For deterministic MDPs, we show how to eliminate the completeness
assumption, dramatically simplifying the algorithm. We further extend our
approach to preference-based feedback settings, proving that equivalent
statistical efficiency can be achieved even under more limited information.
Together, these results constitute a theoretical foundation for understanding
the statistical properties of outcome-based reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 本文研究了高维欧几里得空间中的角度测试问题，提出了两种基于投影的概率核函数，分别用于角度比较和角度阈值化。与现有方法不同，该方法利用参考角度和确定性投影向量结构，无需渐近假设，并在理论和实验上优于基于高斯分布的核函数。进一步应用于近似最近邻搜索（ANNS），实现了比HNSW算法高2.5~3倍的查询吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维空间中角度测试问题，改进现有基于高斯分布随机投影方法的局限性。

Method: 提出两种基于投影的概率核函数，利用参考角度和确定性投影向量结构，避免渐近假设。

Result: 理论和实验证明优于高斯分布核函数，应用于ANNS时查询吞吐量提升2.5~3倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在高维角度测试和ANNS中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the angle testing problem in high-dimensional
Euclidean spaces and propose two projection-based probabilistic kernel
functions, one designed for angle comparison and the other for angle
thresholding. Unlike existing approaches that rely on random projection vectors
drawn from Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages reference angles and
employs a deterministic structure for the projection vectors. Notably, our
kernel functions do not require asymptotic assumptions, such as the number of
projection vectors tending to infinity, and can be both theoretically and
experimentally shown to outperform Gaussian-distribution-based kernel
functions. We further apply the proposed kernel function to Approximate Nearest
Neighbor Search (ANNS) and demonstrate that our approach achieves a 2.5X ~ 3X
higher query-per-second (QPS) throughput compared to the state-of-the-art
graph-based search algorithm HNSW.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在系统性组合泛化中的不足，提出数据为中心的框架以理解其局限性。

Method: 通过覆盖原则分析Transformer的泛化能力，包括数据需求、参数扩展效率、路径模糊性任务的表现，以及思维链监督的效果。

Result: 发现训练数据需求随标记集大小呈二次增长，参数扩展对效率无显著提升；路径模糊性任务中模型表现受限；思维链监督对多跳任务有效但仍有局限。

Conclusion: 覆盖原则为组合推理提供了统一视角，指出需架构或训练创新以实现系统性组合性。

Abstract: Large language models excel at pattern matching, yet often fall short in
systematic compositional generalization. We propose the coverage principle: a
data-centric framework showing that models relying primarily on pattern
matching for compositional tasks cannot reliably generalize beyond substituting
fragments that yield identical results when used in the same contexts. We
demonstrate that this framework has a strong predictive power for the
generalization capabilities of Transformers. First, we derive and empirically
confirm that the training data required for two-hop generalization grows at
least quadratically with the token set size, and the training data efficiency
does not improve with 20x parameter scaling. Second, for compositional tasks
with path ambiguity where one variable affects the output through multiple
computational paths, we show that Transformers learn context-dependent state
representations that undermine both performance and interoperability. Third,
Chain-of-Thought supervision improves training data efficiency for multi-hop
tasks but still struggles with path ambiguity. Finally, we outline a
\emph{mechanism-based} taxonomy that distinguishes three ways neural networks
can generalize: structure-based (bounded by coverage), property-based
(leveraging algebraic invariances), and shared-operator (through function
reuse). This conceptual lens contextualizes our results and highlights where
new architectural ideas are needed to achieve systematic compositionally.
Overall, the coverage principle provides a unified lens for understanding
compositional reasoning, and underscores the need for fundamental architectural
or training innovations to achieve truly systematic compositionality.

Abstract: The digital exclusion of endangered languages remains a critical challenge in
NLP, limiting both linguistic research and revitalization efforts. This study
introduces the first computational investigation of Comanche, an Uto-Aztecan
language on the verge of extinction, demonstrating how minimal-cost,
community-informed NLP interventions can support language preservation. We
present a manually curated dataset of 412 phrases, a synthetic data generation
pipeline, and an empirical evaluation of GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini for language
identification. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs struggle with Comanche
in zero-shot settings, few-shot prompting significantly improves performance,
achieving near-perfect accuracy with just five examples. Our findings highlight
the potential of targeted NLP methodologies in low-resource contexts and
emphasize that visibility is the first step toward inclusion. By establishing a
foundation for Comanche in NLP, we advocate for computational approaches that
prioritize accessibility, cultural sensitivity, and community engagement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前以LLM为主导的趋势，验证BERT类模型在文本分类中的优势。

Method: 系统比较BERT微调、LLM内部状态利用和零样本推理三种方法，并通过PCA和探测实验分析任务特性。

Result: BERT类模型在模式驱动任务中表现更优，LLM在需要深度语义或世界知识的任务中占优。

Conclusion: 提出TaMAS策略，强调根据任务特性选择模型，而非盲目依赖LLM。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of LLMs has overshadowed the potential advantages of
traditional BERT-like models in text classification. This study challenges the
prevailing "LLM-centric" trend by systematically comparing three category
methods, i.e., BERT-like models fine-tuning, LLM internal state utilization,
and zero-shot inference across six high-difficulty datasets. Our findings
reveal that BERT-like models often outperform LLMs. We further categorize
datasets into three types, perform PCA and probing experiments, and identify
task-specific model strengths: BERT-like models excel in pattern-driven tasks,
while LLMs dominate those requiring deep semantics or world knowledge. Based on
this, we propose TaMAS, a fine-grained task selection strategy, advocating for
a nuanced, task-driven approach over a one-size-fits-all reliance on LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在隐喻理解和应用上表现不佳，影响了其在战略沟通中的表现。

Method: CoMet结合假设推理的隐喻推理器和自反思生成器，优化隐喻处理能力。

Result: 实验表明，CoMet显著提升了智能体在Undercover和Adversarial Taboo游戏中的战略沟通能力。

Conclusion: CoMet框架有效提升了LLM在隐喻驱动的战略沟通中的表现。

Abstract: Metaphors are a crucial way for humans to express complex or subtle ideas by
comparing one concept to another, often from a different domain. However, many
large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret and apply metaphors in
multi-agent language games, hindering their ability to engage in covert
communication and semantic evasion, which are crucial for strategic
communication. To address this challenge, we introduce CoMet, a framework that
enables LLM-based agents to engage in metaphor processing. CoMet combines a
hypothesis-based metaphor reasoner with a metaphor generator that improves
through self-reflection and knowledge integration. This enhances the agents'
ability to interpret and apply metaphors, improving the strategic and nuanced
quality of their interactions. We evaluate CoMet on two multi-agent language
games - Undercover and Adversarial Taboo - which emphasize Covert Communication
and Semantic Evasion. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMet significantly
enhances the agents' ability to communicate strategically using metaphors.

Result: 即使是先进的编码代理（如Claude-3.7-thinking）任务成功率也低于50%。

Conclusion: 需提升LLM的多轮交互能力，平衡指令遵循与推理，以构建更可靠的数据分析代理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise as data analysis agents, but
existing benchmarks overlook the iterative nature of the field, where experts'
decisions evolve with deeper insights of the dataset. To address this, we
introduce IDA-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLM agents in multi-round
interactive scenarios. Derived from complex Kaggle notebooks, tasks are
presented as sequential natural language instructions by an LLM-simulated user.
Agent performance is judged by comparing its final numerical output to the
human-derived baseline. Initial results show that even state-of-the-art coding
agents (like Claude-3.7-thinking) succeed on < 50% of the tasks, highlighting
limitations not evident in single-turn tests. This work underscores the need to
improve LLMs' multi-round capabilities for building more reliable data analysis
agents, highlighting the necessity of achieving a balance between instruction
following and reasoning.

Result: 自适应策略在QwQ-32B上平均准确率提升1.10%，令牌使用减少50.80%。

Conclusion: 基于熵的方法能显著提升大型语言模型的准确性和成本效率。

Abstract: The recent rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has significantly improved
multi-step reasoning performance, but often at the cost of generating
excessively long reasoning chains. This paper revisits the efficiency of such
reasoning processes through an information-theoretic lens, revealing a
fundamental trade-off between reasoning length and semantic efficiency. We
propose two metrics, InfoBias and InfoGain, to quantify divergence from ideal
reasoning paths and stepwise information contribution, respectively. Empirical
analyses show that longer reasoning chains tend to exhibit higher information
bias and diminishing information gain, especially for incorrect answers.
Motivated by these findings, we introduce an entropy-based Adaptive Think
strategy that dynamically halts reasoning once confidence is sufficiently high,
improving efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. Compared to the
Vanilla Think approach (default mode), our strategy yields a 1.10% improvement
in average accuracy and a 50.80% reduction in token usage on QwQ-32B across six
benchmark tasks spanning diverse reasoning types and difficulty levels,
demonstrating superior efficiency and reasoning performance. These results
underscore the promise of entropy-based methods for enhancing both accuracy and
cost-effiiciency in large language model deployment.

Conclusion: REFLEX为演示幻灯片内容评估提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of presentation slides automatically is an important problem
in the era of generative AI. This paper focuses on evaluating multimodal
content in presentation slides that can effectively summarize a document and
convey concepts to a broad audience. We introduce a benchmark dataset,
RefSlides, consisting of human-made high-quality presentations that span
various topics. Next, we propose a set of metrics to characterize different
intrinsic properties of the content of a presentation and present REFLEX, an
evaluation approach that generates scores and actionable feedback for these
metrics. We achieve this by generating negative presentation samples with
different degrees of metric-specific perturbations and use them to fine-tune
LLMs. This reference-free evaluation technique does not require ground truth
presentations during inference. Our extensive automated and human experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation approach outperforms classical heuristic-based
and state-of-the-art large language model-based evaluations in generating
scores and explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型Transformer模型生成文本的机制，揭示其如何在不同语义尺度上规划和实现文本生成。

Method: 提出MSPGT框架，将生成过程分解为全局、中间和局部三个尺度，并通过注意力跨度阈值和层间互信息峰值确定尺度边界。

Result: 实验表明，不同模型在尺度分配上存在差异，且针对不同尺度的干预对文本生成有显著影响。

Conclusion: MSPGT为理解和控制大型语言模型提供了一种统一且架构无关的方法。

Abstract: Large Transformer based language models achieve remarkable performance but
remain opaque in how they plan, structure, and realize text. We introduce
Multi_Scale Probabilistic Generation Theory (MSPGT), a hierarchical framework
that factorizes generation into three semantic scales_global context,
intermediate structure, and local word choices and aligns each scale with
specific layer ranges in Transformer architectures. To identify scale
boundaries, we propose two complementary metrics: attention span thresholds and
inter layer mutual information peaks. Across four representative models (GPT-2,
BERT, RoBERTa, and T5), these metrics yield stable local/intermediate/global
partitions, corroborated by probing tasks and causal interventions. We find
that decoder_only models allocate more layers to intermediate and global
processing while encoder_only models emphasize local feature extraction.
Through targeted interventions, we demonstrate that local scale manipulations
primarily influence lexical diversity, intermediate-scale modifications affect
sentence structure and length, and global_scale perturbations impact discourse
coherence all with statistically significant effects. MSPGT thus offers a
unified, architecture-agnostic method for interpreting, diagnosing, and
controlling large language models, bridging the gap between mechanistic
interpretability and emergent capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为'MetaGen Blended RAG'的方法，通过混合查询索引和元数据增强来提升企业特定领域数据的检索精度，避免了微调的高成本和低泛化性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业特定领域数据（如医学、法律等）由于术语复杂且语义多变，导致RAG系统精度低，现有方法（如微调）成本高且泛化性差。

Method: 构建元数据生成管道（包括关键概念、主题和缩写），并创建元数据增强的混合索引，结合优化的搜索查询。

Result: 在PubMedQA基准测试中，检索精度达82%，RAG精度达77%，优于未微调的RAG方法，甚至与最佳微调模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个Q&A数据集上表现出鲁棒性和可扩展性，为领域特定RAG提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the widespread exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
its deployment in enterprises for domain-specific datasets remains limited due
to poor answer accuracy. These corpora, often shielded behind firewalls in
private enterprise knowledge bases, having complex, domain-specific
terminology, rarely seen by LLMs during pre-training; exhibit significant
semantic variability across domains (like networking, military, or legal,
etc.), or even within a single domain like medicine, and thus result in poor
context precision for RAG systems. Currently, in such situations, fine-tuning
or RAG with fine-tuning is attempted, but these approaches are slow, expensive,
and lack generalization for accuracy as the new domain-specific data emerges.
We propose an approach for Enterprise Search that focuses on enhancing the
retriever for a domain-specific corpus through hybrid query indexes and
metadata enrichment. This 'MetaGen Blended RAG' method constructs a metadata
generation pipeline using key concepts, topics, and acronyms, and then creates
a metadata-enriched hybrid index with boosted search queries. This approach
avoids overfitting and generalizes effectively across domains. On the PubMedQA
benchmark for the biomedical domain, the proposed method achieves 82% retrieval
accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all previous RAG accuracy results
without fine-tuning and sets a new benchmark for zero-shot results while
outperforming much larger models like GPT3.5. The results are even comparable
to the best fine-tuned models on this dataset, and we further demonstrate the
robustness and scalability of the approach by evaluating it on other Q&A
datasets like SQuAD, NQ etc.

Result: 在九个MedQA基准测试中表现优异，显著提升GPT-4o、DeepSeek-R1和7B模型的准确率。

Conclusion: TAGS无需参数更新即可超越多个微调医学LLM，展示了其高效性和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advances such as Chain-of-Thought prompting have significantly
improved large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot medical reasoning. However,
prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned
medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and
limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these
limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly
capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary
perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support
this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary
modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars
by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity,
and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final
answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA
benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and
improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several
fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates. The code will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL训练的大语言模型在数学任务中推理过程冗长，增加推理成本和延迟，现有固定惩罚方法效果有限。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少推理长度，同时基本保持准确性。

Conclusion: 为大规模语言模型提供了一种高效、自适应的推理方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in
mathematical tasks, often enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, RL-trained models frequently produce unnecessarily long reasoning
traces -- even for simple queries -- leading to increased inference costs and
latency. While recent approaches attempt to control verbosity by adding length
penalties to the reward function, these methods rely on fixed penalty terms
that are hard to tune and cannot adapt as the model's reasoning capability
evolves, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose an adaptive
reward-shaping method that enables LLMs to "think fast and right" -- producing
concise outputs without sacrificing correctness. Our method dynamically adjusts
the reward trade-off between accuracy and response length based on model
performance: when accuracy is high, the length penalty increases to encourage
faster length reduction; when accuracy drops, the penalty is relaxed to
preserve correctness. This adaptive reward accelerates early-stage length
reduction while avoiding over-compression in later stages. Experiments across
multiple datasets show that our approach consistently and dramatically reduces
reasoning length while largely maintaining accuracy, offering a new direction
for cost-efficient adaptive reasoning in large-scale language models.

Motivation: 验证LLMs是否能在实际场景中一致应用西方或北美文化价值观。

Method: 采用自下而上的方法，让LLMs推理不同文化叙事中的文化规范。

Result: GPT-4生成的规范缺乏文化特异性，且隐含刻板印象。

Conclusion: 需解决这些问题以开发公平服务多元用户的LLMs。

Abstract: LLMs have been demonstrated to align with the values of Western or North
American cultures. Prior work predominantly showed this effect through
leveraging surveys that directly ask (originally people and now also LLMs)
about their values. However, it is hard to believe that LLMs would consistently
apply those values in real-world scenarios. To address that, we take a
bottom-up approach, asking LLMs to reason about cultural norms in narratives
from different cultures. We find that GPT-4 tends to generate norms that, while
not necessarily incorrect, are significantly less culture-specific. In
addition, while it avoids overtly generating stereotypes, the stereotypical
representations of certain cultures are merely hidden rather than suppressed in
the model, and such stereotypes can be easily recovered. Addressing these
challenges is a crucial step towards developing LLMs that fairly serve their
diverse user base.

Abstract: Medical consumer question answering (CQA) is crucial for empowering patients

PerMedCQA contains 68,138 question-answer pairs, refined through careful data
cleaning from an initial set of 87,780 raw entries. We evaluate several

Conclusion: HYPE为LLM动态更新提供了更精确和稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their practical utility is often limited by persistent issues of
hallucinations and outdated parametric knowledge. Although post-training model
editing offers a pathway for dynamic updates, existing methods frequently
suffer from overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry and
graph neural networks for precise and stable model edits. We introduce HYPE
(HYperbolic Parameter Editing), which comprises three key components: (i)
Hyperbolic Graph Construction, which uses Poincar\'e embeddings to represent
knowledge triples in hyperbolic space, preserving hierarchical relationships
and preventing unintended side effects by ensuring that edits to parent
concepts do not inadvertently affect child concepts; (ii) M\"obius-Transformed
Updates, which apply hyperbolic addition to propagate edits while maintaining
structural consistency within the hyperbolic manifold, unlike conventional
Euclidean updates that distort relational distances; and (iii) Dual
Stabilization, which combines gradient masking and periodic GNN parameter
resetting to prevent catastrophic forgetting by focusing updates on critical
parameters and preserving long-term knowledge. Experiments on CounterFact,
CounterFact+, and MQuAKE with GPT-J and GPT2-XL demonstrate that HYPE
significantly enhances edit stability, factual accuracy, and multi-hop
reasoning.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在低资源语言任务中的表现不佳问题，尤其是在缺乏任务特定数据的情况下。

Method: 通过验证数学推理和多语言能力的参数不重叠性，开发模块化框架（如参数冻结和模型合并）优化微调过程。

Result: 模块化方法在三种语言、四种模型和两种微调范式下均优于基线，分层交换表现最佳。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) still struggle across tasks outside of
high-resource languages. In this work, we investigate cross-lingual transfer to
lower-resource languages where task-specific post-training data is scarce.
Building on prior work, we first validate that the subsets of model parameters
that matter most for mathematical reasoning and multilingual capabilities are
distinctly non-overlapping. To exploit this implicit separability between task
and target language parameterization, we develop and analyze numerous modular
frameworks to improve the composition of the two during fine-tuning. These
methods generally employ freezing parameters or post hoc model merging to
assign math and language improvement to different key parts of the LLM. In the
absence of in-language math data, we demonstrate that the modular approaches
successfully improve upon baselines across three languages, four models, and
two fine-tuning paradigms (full and LoRA). Furthermore, we identify the most
consistently successful modular method to be fine-tuning separate language and
math experts and model merging via Layer-Swapping, somewhat surprisingly. We
offer possible explanations for this result via recent works on the linearity
of task vectors. We further explain this by empirically showing that reverting
less useful fine-tuning updates after training often outperforms freezing them
from the start.

TLDR: 提出了一种零样本、无需训练的模式链接方法，通过构建模式图和使用路径查找算法优化SQL查询生成，在BIRD基准测试中达到最优效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模式链接是Text-to-SQL系统的关键组件，能减少提示大小并提高模型专注度。

Method: 基于外键关系构建模式图，使用单次提示提取查询中的源表和目标表，应用路径查找算法和后续处理确定最佳表和列连接序列。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中表现优于其他方法，包括专门化、微调和多步LLM方法。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、成本低且可扩展，显著提升了SQL查询生成的准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into executable SQL
queries, and recent progress with large language models (LLMs) has driven
substantial improvements in this task. Schema linking remains a critical
component in Text-to-SQL systems, reducing prompt size for models with narrow
context windows and sharpening model focus even when the entire schema fits. We
present a zero-shot, training-free schema linking approach that first
constructs a schema graph based on foreign key relations, then uses a single
prompt to Gemini 2.5 Flash to extract source and destination tables from the
user query, followed by applying classical path-finding algorithms and
post-processing to identify the optimal sequence of tables and columns that
should be joined, enabling the LLM to generate more accurate SQL queries.
Despite being simple, cost-effective, and highly scalable, our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the BIRD benchmark, outperforming previous
specialized, fine-tuned, and complex multi-step LLM-based approaches. We
conduct detailed ablation studies to examine the precision-recall trade-off in
our framework. Additionally, we evaluate the execution accuracy of our schema
filtering method compared to other approaches across various model sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共数据集缺乏执行数据（如退出码、输出等），限制了行为建模的可用性，需要更丰富的数据集支持小型架构模拟CLI环境。

Method: 提出ShIOEnv，将命令构建建模为马尔可夫决策过程，结合语法掩码和PPO优化生成数据集，并用于微调CodeT5模型。

Result: 语法掩码和PPO显著提升样本效率，生成更高质量数据集；微调后CodeT5的BLEU-4提升85%（语法约束）和26%（PPO）。

Conclusion: ShIOEnv和生成的数据集为未来研究提供了工具，证明了语法约束和PPO在提升模型性能中的有效性。

Abstract: Command-line interfaces (CLIs) provide structured textual environments for
system administration. Explorations have been performed using pre-trained
language models (PLMs) to simulate these environments for safe interaction in
high-risk environments. However, their use has been constrained to frozen,
large parameter models like GPT. For smaller architectures to reach a similar
level of believability, a rich dataset of CLI interactions is required.
Existing public datasets focus on mapping natural-language tasks to commands,
omitting crucial execution data such as exit codes, outputs, and environmental
side effects, limiting their usability for behavioral modeling. We introduce a
Shell Input -Output Environment (ShIOEnv), which casts command construction as
a Markov Decision Process whose state is the partially built sequence and whose
actions append arguments. After each action, ShIOEnv executes the candidate and
returns its exit status, output, and progress toward a minimal-length
behavioral objective. Due to the intractable nature of the combinatorial
argument state-action space, we derive a context-free grammar from man pages to
mask invalid arguments from being emitted. We explore random and
proximal-policy optimization (PPO)-optimized sampling of unrestricted and
grammar-masked action spaces to produce four exploration strategies. We
observed that grammar masking and PPO significantly improve sample efficiency
to produce a higher quality dataset (maximizing the number of arguments while
minimizing redundancies). Policy-generated datasets of shell input-output
behavior pairs are used to fine-tune CodeT5, where we observe 85% improvements
in BLEU-4 when constraining the action space to grammar productions with an
additional 26% improvement when applying PPO. The ShIOEnv environment and
curated command behavior datasets are released for use in future research.

Result: NileChat在理解和翻译任务上优于同类模型，与更大模型表现相当。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了模型对低资源语言和文化的覆盖，推动了LLM的多样性发展。

Abstract: Enhancing the linguistic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
include low-resource languages is a critical research area. Current research
directions predominantly rely on synthetic data generated by translating
English corpora, which, while demonstrating promising linguistic understanding
and translation abilities, often results in models aligned with source language
culture. These models frequently fail to represent the cultural heritage and
values of local communities. This work proposes a methodology to create both
synthetic and retrieval-based pre-training data tailored to a specific
community, considering its (i) language, (ii) cultural heritage, and (iii)
cultural values. We demonstrate our methodology using Egyptian and Moroccan
dialects as testbeds, chosen for their linguistic and cultural richness and
current underrepresentation in LLMs. As a proof-of-concept, we develop
NileChat, a 3B parameter LLM adapted for Egyptian and Moroccan communities,
incorporating their language, cultural heritage, and values. Our results on
various understanding, translation, and cultural and values alignment
benchmarks show that NileChat outperforms existing Arabic-aware LLMs of similar
size and performs on par with larger models. We share our methods, data, and
models with the community to promote the inclusion and coverage of more diverse
communities in LLM development.

Conclusion: RaDeR证明了推理密集型检索对增强推理语言模型的重要性，并展示了高效数据合成的潜力。

Abstract: We propose RaDeR, a set of reasoning-based dense retrieval models trained
with data derived from mathematical problem solving using large language models
(LLMs). Our method leverages retrieval-augmented reasoning trajectories of an
LLM and self-reflective relevance evaluation, enabling the creation of both
diverse and hard-negative samples for reasoning-intensive relevance. RaDeR
retrievers, trained for mathematical reasoning, effectively generalize to
diverse reasoning tasks in the BRIGHT and RAR-b benchmarks, consistently
outperforming strong baselines in overall performance.Notably, RaDeR achieves
significantly higher performance than baselines on the Math and Coding splits.
In addition, RaDeR presents the first dense retriever that outperforms BM25
when queries are Chain-of-Thought reasoning steps, underscoring the critical
role of reasoning-based retrieval to augment reasoning language models.
Furthermore, RaDeR achieves comparable or superior performance while using only
2.5% of the training data used by the concurrent work REASONIR, highlighting
the quality of our synthesized training data.

Result: 评估显示现有方法在多模态事件建模上存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为多模态TPP建模提供了基础，并呼吁进一步整合TPP与多模态语言建模。

Abstract: We introduce DanmakuTPPBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to advance
multi-modal Temporal Point Process (TPP) modeling in the era of Large Language
Models (LLMs). While TPPs have been widely studied for modeling temporal event
sequences, existing datasets are predominantly unimodal, hindering progress in
models that require joint reasoning over temporal, textual, and visual
information. To address this gap, DanmakuTPPBench comprises two complementary
components: (1) DanmakuTPP-Events, a novel dataset derived from the Bilibili
video platform, where user-generated bullet comments (Danmaku) naturally form
multi-modal events annotated with precise timestamps, rich textual content, and
corresponding video frames; (2) DanmakuTPP-QA, a challenging question-answering
dataset constructed via a novel multi-agent pipeline powered by
state-of-the-art LLMs and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), targeting complex
temporal-textual-visual reasoning. We conduct extensive evaluations using both
classical TPP models and recent MLLMs, revealing significant performance gaps
and limitations in current methods' ability to model multi-modal event
dynamics. Our benchmark establishes strong baselines and calls for further
integration of TPP modeling into the multi-modal language modeling landscape.

Abstract: As connected and automated transportation systems evolve, there is a growing
need for federal and state authorities to revise existing laws and develop new
statutes to address emerging cybersecurity and data privacy challenges. This
study introduces a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language

legal content and generating accurate, inquiry-specific responses. The
framework focuses on reducing hallucinations in LLMs by using a curated set of
domain-specific questions to guide response generation. By incorporating
retrieval mechanisms, the system enhances the factual grounding and specificity
of its outputs. Our analysis shows that the proposed RAG-based LLM outperforms
leading commercial LLMs across four evaluation metrics: AlignScore, ParaScore,
BERTScore, and ROUGE, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing reliable and
context-aware legal insights. This approach offers a scalable, AI-driven method
for legislative analysis, supporting efforts to update legal frameworks in line

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种修剪长链思维（CoT）中冗余步骤的方法，并通过策略方法为小语言模型（SLM）筛选有效训练数据，使其能高效学习长CoT推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1）能生成长CoT推理步骤，但小语言模型（SLM）难以直接学习长CoT，且冗余内容（如过度思考步骤）会进一步增加学习难度。

Method: 提出修剪长CoT中不必要步骤的方法，并采用策略方法为SLM筛选有效训练数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效将长CoT推理能力蒸馏到SLM中，保持性能的同时显著减少冗余推理步骤。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能帮助SLM高效学习长CoT推理，减少冗余，提升性能。

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 exhibit strong complex
problems solving abilities by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
steps. It is challenging to directly train small language models (SLMs) to
emerge long CoT. Thus, distillation becomes a practical method to enable SLMs
for such reasoning ability. However, the long CoT often contains a lot of
redundant contents (e.g., overthinking steps) which may make SLMs hard to learn
considering their relatively poor capacity and generalization. To address this
issue, we propose a simple-yet-effective method to prune unnecessary steps in
long CoT, and then employ an on-policy method for the SLM itself to curate
valid and useful long CoT training data. In this way, SLMs can effectively
learn efficient long CoT reasoning and preserve competitive performance at the
same time. Experimental results across a series of mathematical reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in distilling
long CoT reasoning ability into SLMs which maintains the competitive
performance but significantly reduces generating redundant reasoning steps.

Motivation: 现有RAG技术主要针对文本查询，多模态文档（包含文本和图像）的RAG尚未充分探索，尤其是在微调无效的情况下。

Method: 提出BRIT框架，将文本和图像连接统一为多模态图，通过遍历图像-文本和文本-图像路径检索相关内容。

Result: 实验表明BRIT在多模态问答任务中表现优越，能够处理跨模态问题。

Conclusion: BRIT为多模态RAG提供了有效解决方案，特别适用于复杂跨模态问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising technique to
enhance the quality and relevance of responses generated by large language
models. While recent advancements have mainly focused on improving RAG for
text-based queries, RAG on multi-modal documents containing both texts and
images has not been fully explored. Especially when fine-tuning does not work.
This paper proposes BRIT, a novel multi-modal RAG framework that effectively
unifies various text-image connections in the document into a multi-modal graph
and retrieves the texts and images as a query-specific sub-graph. By traversing
both image-to-text and text-to-image paths in the graph, BRIT retrieve not only
directly query-relevant images and texts but also further relevant contents to
answering complex cross-modal multi-hop questions. To evaluate the
effectiveness of BRIT, we introduce MM-RAG test set specifically designed for
multi-modal question answering tasks that require to understand the text-image
relations. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of BRIT,
highlighting its ability to handle cross-modal questions on the multi-modal
documents.

Motivation: 现有的事实性评估系统在医学领域表现不佳，因为医学答案具有条件依赖性和多样性，而现有方法主要针对客观、实体中心的文本。

Method: 提出MedScore方法，将医学答案分解为条件感知的有效事实，提取更多有效事实并减少幻觉和模糊引用。

Result: MedScore提取的有效事实是现有方法的三倍，显著提高了事实性评估的可靠性。

Conclusion: 事实性评分受分解方法、验证语料库和骨干LLM的影响，强调了为可靠评估定制每一步的重要性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent and convincing
responses, they are not necessarily correct. This is especially apparent in the
popular decompose-then-verify factuality evaluation pipeline, where LLMs
evaluate generations by decomposing the generations into individual, valid
claims. Factuality evaluation is especially important for medical answers,
since incorrect medical information could seriously harm the patient. However,
existing factuality systems are a poor match for the medical domain, as they
are typically only evaluated on objective, entity-centric, formulaic texts such
as biographies and historical topics. This differs from condition-dependent,
conversational, hypothetical, sentence-structure diverse, and subjective
medical answers, which makes decomposition into valid facts challenging. We
propose MedScore, a new approach to decomposing medical answers into
condition-aware valid facts. Our method extracts up to three times more valid
facts than existing methods, reducing hallucination and vague references, and
retaining condition-dependency in facts. The resulting factuality score
significantly varies by decomposition method, verification corpus, and used
backbone LLM, highlighting the importance of customizing each step for reliable
factuality evaluation.

Result: HRPO在知识和推理密集型任务中优于现有方法，同时保持模型的解释性和跨语言模式等行为。

Conclusion: HRPO展示了基于强化学习的潜在推理潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced latent
reasoning as a promising alternative to autoregressive reasoning. By performing
internal computation with hidden states from previous steps, latent reasoning
benefit from more informative features rather than sampling a discrete
chain-of-thought (CoT) path. Yet latent reasoning approaches are often
incompatible with LLMs, as their continuous paradigm conflicts with the
discrete nature of autoregressive generation. Moreover, these methods rely on
CoT traces for training and thus fail to exploit the inherent reasoning
patterns of LLMs. In this work, we explore latent reasoning by leveraging the
intrinsic capabilities of LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). To this end, we
introduce hybrid reasoning policy optimization (HRPO), an RL-based hybrid
latent reasoning approach that (1) integrates prior hidden states into sampled
tokens with a learnable gating mechanism, and (2) initializes training with
predominantly token embeddings while progressively incorporating more hidden
features. This design maintains LLMs' generative capabilities and incentivizes
hybrid reasoning using both discrete and continuous representations. In
addition, the hybrid HRPO introduces stochasticity into latent reasoning via
token sampling, thereby enabling RL-based optimization without requiring CoT
trajectories. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks show that HRPO
outperforms prior methods in both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks.
Furthermore, HRPO-trained LLMs remain interpretable and exhibit intriguing
behaviors like cross-lingual patterns and shorter completion lengths,
highlighting the potential of our RL-based approach and offer insights for
future work in latent reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型（DLMs）在并行生成和双向上下文方面有优势，但在似然建模和生成文本质量上表现不如自回归模型（AR）。研究发现，性能差距源于关键标记在早期被掩盖，限制了上下文信息。

Method: 提出Anchored Diffusion Language Model（ADLM），采用两阶段框架：1）通过锚网络预测关键标记的分布；2）基于锚定预测预测缺失标记的似然。

Result: ADLM在LM1B和OpenWebText上显著提升测试困惑度（最高25.4%），缩小与AR模型的差距，并在7个基准测试中实现零样本泛化的最佳性能，首次在MAUVE评分上超越AR模型。

Conclusion: ADLM通过锚定机制提升了扩散语言模型的性能，并在理论和实验上验证了其优势。锚定方法还可提升AR模型和逻辑推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) promise parallel generation and
bidirectional context, yet they underperform autoregressive (AR) models in both
likelihood modeling and generated text quality. We identify that this
performance gap arises when important tokens (e.g., key words or low-frequency
words that anchor a sentence) are masked early in the forward process, limiting
contextual information for accurate reconstruction. To address this, we
introduce the Anchored Diffusion Language Model (ADLM), a novel two-stage
framework that first predicts distributions over important tokens via an anchor
network, and then predicts the likelihoods of missing tokens conditioned on the
anchored predictions. ADLM significantly improves test perplexity on LM1B and
OpenWebText, achieving up to 25.4% gains over prior DLMs, and narrows the gap
with strong AR baselines. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance in
zero-shot generalization across seven benchmarks and surpasses AR models in
MAUVE score, which marks the first time a DLM generates better human-like text
than an AR model. Theoretically, we derive an Anchored Negative Evidence Lower
Bound (ANELBO) objective and show that anchoring improves sample complexity and
likelihood modeling. Beyond diffusion, anchoring boosts performance in AR
models and enhances reasoning in math and logic tasks, outperforming existing
chain-of-thought approaches

Result: 揭示了文化偏见在生成任务中的表现，并验证了自去偏策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的偏见评估框架，为多语言和文化交叉偏见研究提供了更细致的视角。

Abstract: Evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) often overlook intersectional and
culturally specific biases, particularly in underrepresented multilingual
regions like South Asia. This work addresses these gaps by conducting a
multilingual and intersectional analysis of LLM outputs across 10 Indo-Aryan
and Dravidian languages, identifying how cultural stigmas influenced by purdah
and patriarchy are reinforced in generative tasks. We construct a culturally
grounded bias lexicon capturing previously unexplored intersectional dimensions
including gender, religion, marital status, and number of children. We use our
lexicon to quantify intersectional bias and the effectiveness of self-debiasing
in open-ended generations (e.g., storytelling, hobbies, and to-do lists), where
bias manifests subtly and remains largely unexamined in multilingual contexts.
Finally, we evaluate two self-debiasing strategies (simple and complex prompts)
to measure their effectiveness in reducing culturally specific bias in
Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages. Our approach offers a nuanced lens into
cultural bias by introducing a novel bias lexicon and evaluation framework that
extends beyond Eurocentric or small-scale multilingual settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely explored for automated scoring
in low-stakes assessment to facilitate learning and instruction. Empirical
evidence related to which LLM produces the most reliable scores and induces
least rater effects needs to be collected before the use of LLMs for automated
scoring in practice. This study compared ten LLMs (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4,
ChatGPT 4o, OpenAI o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini
2.0, as well as DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek R1) with human expert raters in
scoring two types of writing tasks. The accuracy of the holistic and analytic
scores from LLMs compared with human raters was evaluated in terms of Quadratic
Weighted Kappa. Intra-rater consistency across prompts was compared in terms of
Cronbach Alpha. Rater effects of LLMs were evaluated and compared with human

TLDR: ALTPRAG数据集用于评估不同训练阶段的LLMs是否能推断细微的说话者意图，结果显示模型对语用线索的敏感性随规模提升而增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在训练过程中如何获得语用理解能力，填补当前认知空白。

Method: 引入ALTPRAG数据集，评估22个LLMs在不同训练阶段（预训练、监督微调、偏好优化）的语用能力。

Result: 基础模型已对语用线索敏感，规模扩大后能力提升；SFT和RLHF进一步改善认知语用推理。

Conclusion: 语用能力是LLM训练中的涌现特性，为模型与人类沟通规范对齐提供新见解。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emerging capabilities
in social intelligence tasks, including implicature resolution (Sravanthi et
al. (2024)) and theory-of-mind reasoning (Shapira et al. (2024)), both of which
require substantial pragmatic understanding. However, how LLMs acquire this
competence throughout the training process remains poorly understood. In this
work, we introduce ALTPRAG, a dataset grounded in the pragmatic concept of
alternatives, designed to evaluate whether LLMs at different training stages
can accurately infer nuanced speaker intentions. Each instance pairs two
contextually appropriate but pragmatically distinct continuations, enabling
fine-grained assessment of both pragmatic interpretation and contrastive
reasoning. We systematically evaluate 22 LLMs across key training stages:
pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference optimization, to
examine the development of pragmatic competence. Our results show that even
base models exhibit notable sensitivity to pragmatic cues, which improves
consistently with increases in model and data scale. Additionally, SFT and RLHF
contribute further gains, particularly in cognitive-pragmatic reasoning. These
findings highlight pragmatic competence as an emergent and compositional
property of LLM training and offer new insights for aligning models with human
communicative norms.

Motivation: 探讨序列建模架构如何影响预训练语言模型的基础能力，揭示现有架构设计中的不足。

Method: 提出有限域预训练设置和分布外测试，分析状态序列建模架构的基础能力，并通过架构组件分析总结设计原则。

Result: 发现状态序列建模架构能力显著下降，提出并验证了全序列任意选择能力的关键设计原则。

Conclusion: 本文为未来架构改进和新设计提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models represented by the Transformer have been proven
to possess strong base capabilities, and the representative self-attention
mechanism in the Transformer has become a classic in sequence modeling
architectures. Different from the work of proposing sequence modeling
architecture to improve the efficiency of attention mechanism, this work
focuses on the impact of sequence modeling architectures on base capabilities.
Specifically, our concern is: How exactly do sequence modeling architectures
affect the base capabilities of pre-trained language models? In this work, we
first point out that the mixed domain pre-training setting commonly adopted in
existing architecture design works fails to adequately reveal the differences
in base capabilities among various architectures. To address this, we propose a
limited domain pre-training setting with out-of-distribution testing, which
successfully uncovers significant differences in base capabilities among
architectures at an early stage. Next, we analyze the base capabilities of
stateful sequence modeling architectures, and find that they exhibit
significant degradation in base capabilities compared to the Transformer. Then,
through a series of architecture component analysis, we summarize a key
architecture design principle: A sequence modeling architecture need possess
full-sequence arbitrary selection capability to avoid degradation in base
capabilities. Finally, we empirically validate this principle using an
extremely simple Top-1 element selection architecture and further generalize it
to a more practical Top-1 chunk selection architecture. Experimental results
demonstrate our proposed sequence modeling architecture design principle and
suggest that our work can serve as a valuable reference for future architecture
improvements and novel designs.

Motivation: 现有基于语言模型的优化器由人工设计，缺乏优化且通用性强，未针对特定任务定制。

Method: 结合元提示优化器和元结构优化器，提升优化器性能。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均绝对性能提升达6%。

Conclusion: metaTextGrad能有效提升优化器性能，适应特定任务需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in learning algorithms,
evaluations, and optimization tasks. Recent studies have shown that using
LLM-based optimizers to automatically optimize model prompts, demonstrations,
predictions themselves, or other components can significantly enhance the
performance of AI systems, as demonstrated by frameworks such as DSPy and
TextGrad. However, optimizers built on language models themselves are usually
designed by humans with manual design choices; optimizers themselves are not
optimized. Moreover, these optimizers are general purpose by design, to be
useful to a broad audience, and are not tailored for specific tasks. To address
these challenges, we propose metaTextGrad, which focuses on designing a
meta-optimizer to further enhance existing optimizers and align them to be good
optimizers for a given task. Our approach consists of two key components: a
meta prompt optimizer and a meta structure optimizer. The combination of these
two significantly improves performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving an
average absolute performance improvement of up to 6% compared to the best
baseline.

Abstract: Standing in 2025, at a critical juncture in the pursuit of Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has demonstrated
significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capability of large language
models (LLMs) and has led to the development of cutting-edge AI models such as
OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Moreover, the efficient application of RFT to
enhance the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has attracted widespread attention from the community. In this position paper,
we argue that reinforcement fine-tuning powers the reasoning capability of
multimodal large language models. To begin with, we provide a detailed
introduction to the fundamental background knowledge that researchers
interested in this field should be familiar with. Furthermore, we meticulously
summarize the improvements of RFT in powering reasoning capability of MLLMs
into five key points: diverse modalities, diverse tasks and domains, better
training algorithms, abundant benchmarks and thriving engineering frameworks.
Finally, we propose five promising directions for future research that the
community might consider. We hope that this position paper will provide
valuable insights to the community at this pivotal stage in the advancement
toward AGI. Summary of works done on RFT for MLLMs is available at

Conclusion: ExIde为自动化商业流程提供了结构化规则提取和依赖分析的工具。

Abstract: Process mining aims to discover, monitor and optimize the actual behaviors of
real processes. While prior work has mainly focused on extracting procedural
action flows from instructional texts, rule flows embedded in business
documents remain underexplored. To this end, we introduce a novel annotated
Chinese dataset, \textbf{BPRF}, which contains 50 business process documents
with 326 explicitly labeled business rules across multiple domains. Each rule
is represented as a <Condition, Action> pair, and we annotate logical
dependencies between rules (sequential, conditional, or parallel). We also
propose \textbf{ExIde}, a framework for automatic business rule extraction and
dependency relationship identification using large language models (LLMs). We
evaluate ExIde using 12 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on the BPRF dataset,
benchmarking performance on both rule extraction and dependency classification
tasks of current LLMs. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of ExIde in
extracting structured business rules and analyzing their interdependencies for
current SOTA LLMs, paving the way for more automated and interpretable business
process automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前跨提示自动作文评分方法通常需要同时访问所有源提示的数据，这既效率低下又存在隐私风险。

Method: 采用源自由适应方法，通过线性组合任务向量模拟联合训练，并利用PIM目标优化组合系数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能和鲁棒性上优于传统方法，尤其在分布偏移情况下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持计算效率的同时，显著提升了跨提示评分的适应性和隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in cross-prompt automated essay scoring (AES) typically train
models jointly on all source prompts, often requiring additional access to
unlabeled target prompt essays simultaneously. However, using all sources is
suboptimal in our pilot study, and re-accessing source datasets during
adaptation raises privacy concerns. We propose a source-free adaptation
approach that selectively merges individually trained source models' parameters
instead of datasets. In particular, we simulate joint training through linear
combinations of task vectors -- the parameter updates from fine-tuning. To
optimize the combination's coefficients, we propose Prior-encoded Information
Maximization (PIM), an unsupervised objective which promotes the model's score
discriminability regularized by priors pre-computed from the sources. We employ
Bayesian optimization as an efficient optimizer of PIM. Experimental results
with LLMs on in-dataset and cross-dataset adaptation show that our method (1)
consistently outperforms training jointly on all sources, (2) maintains
superior robustness compared to other merging methods, (3) excels under severe
distribution shifts where recent leading cross-prompt methods struggle, all
while retaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中用户输入错误信息的情况普遍存在，但LLMs如何处理和纠正这些错误信息的研究较少。论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过数学推理任务，分析错误信息对LLMs中间推理步骤和最终答案的影响，并测试LLMs在明确指令下纠正错误的效果。

Result: 即使有明确纠正指令，LLMs的成功率仍低于50%，导致准确率显著下降（10.02%-72.20%）。早期纠正错误最有效，基于早期纠正的微调显著提升推理准确性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种减少错误信息传播的实用方法，强调早期纠正和微调的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
reasoning, positioning them as promising tools for supporting human
problem-solving. However, what happens when their performance is affected by
misinformation, i.e., incorrect inputs introduced by users due to oversights or
gaps in knowledge? Such misinformation is prevalent in real-world interactions
with LLMs, yet how it propagates within LLMs' reasoning process remains
underexplored. Focusing on mathematical reasoning, we present a comprehensive
analysis of how misinformation affects intermediate reasoning steps and final
answers. We also examine how effectively LLMs can correct misinformation when
explicitly instructed to do so. Even with explicit instructions, LLMs succeed
less than half the time in rectifying misinformation, despite possessing
correct internal knowledge, leading to significant accuracy drops (10.02% -
72.20%). Further analysis shows that applying factual corrections early in the
reasoning process most effectively reduces misinformation propagation, and
fine-tuning on synthesized data with early-stage corrections significantly
improves reasoning factuality. Our work offers a practical approach to
mitigating misinformation propagation.

Result: 实验显示框架在多个基准和LLM上表现优异，攻击成功率高达96.54%。

Conclusion: 意图操纵暴露LLM安全机制的弱点，对内容审核构成挑战。

Abstract: Intent detection, a core component of natural language understanding, has
considerably evolved as a crucial mechanism in safeguarding large language
models (LLMs). While prior work has applied intent detection to enhance LLMs'
moderation guardrails, showing a significant success against content-level
jailbreaks, the robustness of these intent-aware guardrails under malicious
manipulations remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate the
vulnerability of intent-aware guardrails and demonstrate that LLMs exhibit
implicit intent detection capabilities. We propose a two-stage intent-based
prompt-refinement framework, IntentPrompt, that first transforms harmful
inquiries into structured outlines and further reframes them into
declarative-style narratives by iteratively optimizing prompts via feedback
loops to enhance jailbreak success for red-teaming purposes. Extensive
experiments across four public benchmarks and various black-box LLMs indicate
that our framework consistently outperforms several cutting-edge jailbreak
methods and evades even advanced Intent Analysis (IA) and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-based defenses. Specifically, our "FSTR+SPIN" variant achieves attack
success rates ranging from 88.25% to 96.54% against CoT-based defenses on the
o1 model, and from 86.75% to 97.12% on the GPT-4o model under IA-based
defenses. These findings highlight a critical weakness in LLMs' safety
mechanisms and suggest that intent manipulation poses a growing challenge to
content moderation guardrails.

Conclusion: TAG-INSTRUCT为指令复杂性控制提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality instruction data is crucial for developing large language models
(LLMs), yet existing approaches struggle to effectively control instruction
complexity. We present TAG-INSTRUCT, a novel framework that enhances
instruction complexity through structured semantic compression and controlled
difficulty augmentation. Unlike previous prompt-based methods operating on raw
text, TAG-INSTRUCT compresses instructions into a compact tag space and
systematically enhances complexity through RL-guided tag expansion. Through
extensive experiments, we show that TAG-INSTRUCT outperforms existing
instruction complexity augmentation approaches. Our analysis reveals that
operating in tag space provides superior controllability and stability across
different instruction synthesis frameworks.

Result: 实验显示当前LLM在词联想层面存在显著西方文化偏见，而CultureSteer显著改善了跨文化对齐。

Conclusion: 该研究为增强LLM的文化意识提供了新方法，推动了更具包容性的语言技术发展。

Abstract: The human-centered word association test (WAT) serves as a cognitive proxy,
revealing sociocultural variations through lexical-semantic patterns. We extend
this test into an LLM-adaptive, free-relation task to assess the alignment of
large language models (LLMs) with cross-cultural cognition. To mitigate the
culture preference, we propose CultureSteer, an innovative approach that
integrates a culture-aware steering mechanism to guide semantic representations
toward culturally specific spaces. Experiments show that current LLMs exhibit
significant bias toward Western cultural (notably in American) schemas at the
word association level. In contrast, our model substantially improves
cross-cultural alignment, surpassing prompt-based methods in capturing diverse
semantic associations. Further validation on culture-sensitive downstream tasks
confirms its efficacy in fostering cognitive alignment across cultures. This
work contributes a novel methodological paradigm for enhancing cultural
awareness in LLMs, advancing the development of more inclusive language
technologies.

Result: 实验表明DRAG提高了检索可靠性，减少了幻觉问题，显著提升了事实准确性。

Conclusion: DRAG是一种无需训练的有效框架，能显著改善RAG的可靠性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating
external knowledge, yet it introduces a critical issue: erroneous or biased
retrieval can mislead generation, compounding hallucinations, a phenomenon we
term Hallucination on Hallucination. To address this, we propose
Debate-Augmented RAG (DRAG), a training-free framework that integrates
Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) mechanisms into both retrieval and generation stages.
In retrieval, DRAG employs structured debates among proponents, opponents, and
judges to refine retrieval quality and ensure factual reliability. In
generation, DRAG introduces asymmetric information roles and adversarial
debates, enhancing reasoning robustness and mitigating factual inconsistencies.
Evaluations across multiple tasks demonstrate that DRAG improves retrieval
reliability, reduces RAG-induced hallucinations, and significantly enhances
overall factual accuracy. Our code is available at

Result: 实验表明CKU显著增强模型安全性且不影响整体性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CKU在安全性和实用性之间实现了更好的平衡，同时为安全对齐和知识编辑机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in safety alignment, large language models
(LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms
have not fully deleted harmful knowledge in LLMs, which allows such attacks to
bypass safeguards and produce harmful outputs. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel safety alignment strategy, Constrained Knowledge Unlearning
(CKU), which focuses on two primary objectives: knowledge localization and
retention, and unlearning harmful knowledge. CKU works by scoring neurons in
specific multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers to identify a subset U of neurons
associated with useful knowledge. During the unlearning process, CKU prunes the
gradients of neurons in U to preserve valuable knowledge while effectively
mitigating harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that CKU
significantly enhances model safety without compromising overall performance,
offering a superior balance between safety and utility compared to existing
methods. Additionally, our analysis of neuron knowledge sensitivity across
various MLP layers provides valuable insights into the mechanics of safety
alignment and model knowledge editing.

Motivation: 传统虚假信息检测方法依赖静态分类，无法捕捉真实世界事实核查的复杂性，而大型语言模型（LLMs）在逻辑一致性和验证深度上存在不足。

Method: D2D框架通过多智能体辩论模拟事实核查流程，分为五个阶段（开场陈述、反驳、自由辩论、总结陈述和判决），并引入多维评估机制（事实性、来源可靠性、推理质量、清晰度和伦理）。

Result: 在GPT-4o和两个虚假新闻数据集上的实验表明，D2D显著优于基线方法，并能迭代优化证据和提升决策透明度。

Conclusion: D2D为虚假信息检测提供了更鲁棒和可解释的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in digital platforms reveals the
limitations of traditional detection methods, which mostly rely on static
classification and fail to capture the intricate process of real-world
fact-checking. Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that
enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection
remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial
verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel
Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection
as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D
assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage
debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing
Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D
introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim
across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning
Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two fakenews datasets
demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study
highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving
decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards robust
and interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be open-sourced in a
future release.

Conclusion: 基于推理的文本监督是一种高效、低成本的方法，显著推动了可扩展的多模态模型评估。

Abstract: Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models
with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations.
While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e.,
LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual
annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data
and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we
propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages
minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple
modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured
textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making
patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with
images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being
trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively
trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in
modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce,
underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework
highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective
alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially
advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.

(TTS) synthesis for 23 Indian languages and English. It comprises 13,000 hours
of speech and 24 million text-description annotations with fine-grained
attributes like speaker identity, accent, emotion, style, and background
conditions. Using RASMALAI, we develop IndicParlerTTS, the first open-source,
text-description-guided TTS for Indian languages. Systematic evaluation
demonstrates its ability to generate high-quality speech for named speakers,
reliably follow text descriptions and accurately synthesize specified
attributes. Additionally, it effectively transfers expressive characteristics
both within and across languages. IndicParlerTTS consistently achieves strong
performance across these evaluations, setting a new standard for controllable
multilingual expressive speech synthesis in Indian languages.

### [396] [PM-KVQ: Progressive Mixed-precision KV Cache Quantization for Long-CoT LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18610)

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种渐进式混合精度KV缓存量化方法（PM-KVQ），用于解决长链思维（CoT）大型语言模型（LLMs）中的内存开销问题，并通过实验验证其性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维推理过程导致KV缓存内存开销大，现有量化方法在长上下文场景中性能下降显著。

Method: 提出PM-KVQ方法，包括渐进量化策略和块级内存分配以减少累积误差，以及基于位置插值的新校准策略。

Result: 在7B-70B的长CoT LLMs上，PM-KVQ在相同内存预算下将推理性能提升高达8%。

Conclusion: PM-KVQ有效解决了长CoT LLMs中的KV缓存量化问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in developing reasoning-capable
Large Language Models (LLMs) through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques.
However, this long-CoT reasoning process imposes substantial memory overhead
due to the large Key-Value (KV) Cache memory overhead. Post-training KV Cache
quantization has emerged as a promising compression technique and has been
extensively studied in short-context scenarios. However, directly applying
existing methods to long-CoT LLMs causes significant performance degradation
due to the following two reasons: (1) Large cumulative error: Existing methods
fail to adequately leverage available memory, and they directly quantize the KV
Cache during each decoding step, leading to large cumulative quantization
error. (2) Short-context calibration: Due to Rotary Positional Embedding
(RoPE), the use of short-context data during calibration fails to account for
the distribution of less frequent channels in the Key Cache, resulting in
performance loss. We propose Progressive Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization
(PM-KVQ) for long-CoT LLMs to address the above issues in two folds: (1) To
reduce cumulative error, we design a progressive quantization strategy to
gradually lower the bit-width of KV Cache in each block. Then, we propose
block-wise memory allocation to assign a higher bit-width to more sensitive
transformer blocks. (2) To increase the calibration length without additional
overhead, we propose a new calibration strategy with positional interpolation
that leverages short calibration data with positional interpolation to
approximate the data distribution of long-context data. Extensive experiments
on 7B-70B long-CoT LLMs show that PM-KVQ improves reasoning benchmark
performance by up to 8% over SOTA baselines under the same memory budget. Our
code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/PM-KVQ.

TLDR: MAVL是首个多语言、多模态的可唱歌词翻译基准，结合文本、音频和视频，提出SylAVL-CoT模型，显著优于纯文本模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 歌词翻译需兼顾语义准确性和音乐节奏、音节结构及诗体风格的保留，动画音乐剧的翻译还需对齐视听线索，挑战更大。

Method: 提出MAVL基准，整合文本、音频和视频；基于此提出SylAVL-CoT模型，利用视听线索并强制音节约束。

Result: SylAVL-CoT在可唱性和上下文准确性上显著优于纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 多模态、多语言方法对歌词翻译具有重要价值。

Abstract: Lyrics translation requires both accurate semantic transfer and preservation
of musical rhythm, syllabic structure, and poetic style. In animated musicals,
the challenge intensifies due to alignment with visual and auditory cues. We
introduce Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Benchmark for Animated Song
Translation (MAVL), the first multilingual, multimodal benchmark for singable
lyrics translation. By integrating text, audio, and video, MAVL enables richer
and more expressive translations than text-only approaches. Building on this,
we propose Syllable-Constrained Audio-Video LLM with Chain-of-Thought
SylAVL-CoT, which leverages audio-video cues and enforces syllabic constraints
to produce natural-sounding lyrics. Experimental results demonstrate that
SylAVL-CoT significantly outperforms text-based models in singability and
contextual accuracy, emphasizing the value of multimodal, multilingual
approaches for lyrics translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出DDO框架，通过多智能体协作优化医疗咨询中的症状询问和疾病诊断两个子任务，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法未能有效区分医疗咨询中的症状询问（序列决策）和疾病诊断（分类问题），导致效果不佳。

Method: 提出DDO框架，通过多智能体协作独立优化症状询问和疾病诊断两个子任务。

Result: 在三个真实医疗咨询数据集上，DDO优于现有LLM方法，并与最先进的生成方法竞争。

Conclusion: DDO框架有效解决了医疗咨询中的双任务问题，提升了整体性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong generalization and reasoning
abilities, making them well-suited for complex decision-making tasks such as
medical consultation (MC). However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to
capture the dual nature of MC, which entails two distinct sub-tasks: symptom
inquiry, a sequential decision-making process, and disease diagnosis, a
classification problem. This mismatch often results in ineffective symptom
inquiry and unreliable disease diagnosis. To address this, we propose
\textbf{DDO}, a novel LLM-based framework that performs
\textbf{D}ual-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{O}ptimization by decoupling and
independently optimizing the the two sub-tasks through a collaborative
multi-agent workflow. Experiments on three real-world MC datasets show that DDO
consistently outperforms existing LLM-based approaches and achieves competitive
performance with state-of-the-art generation-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in the MC task.

Conclusion: 研究为提升LLM在低资源语言中的性能提供了新方向，并公开了数据集供进一步研究。

Abstract: In this work, we provide DZEN, a dataset of parallel Dzongkha and English
test questions for Bhutanese middle and high school students. The over 5K
questions in our collection span a variety of scientific topics and include
factual, application, and reasoning-based questions. We use our parallel
dataset to test a number of Large Language Models (LLMs) and find a significant
performance difference between the models in English and Dzongkha. We also look
at different prompting strategies and discover that Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting works well for reasoning questions but less well for factual ones. We
also find that adding English translations enhances the precision of Dzongkha
question responses. Our results point to exciting avenues for further study to
improve LLM performance in Dzongkha and, more generally, in low-resource
languages. We release the dataset at:

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种分块训练（CWT）和跳跃思维训练（STT）方法，解决小语言模型（SLM）在推理任务中因长推理链导致的梯度平滑和响应速度慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法训练SLM一次性学习长推理链，导致核心推理令牌梯度平滑和响应速度慢。

Method: CWT将推理链分块，每次迭代仅学习一个语义连贯的块；STT进一步跳过非推理块，提升速度。

Result: 在多种SLM和推理任务中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CWT和STT显著提升了SLM的推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation allows a large language model (LLM) to
guide a small language model (SLM) in reasoning tasks. Existing methods train
the SLM to learn the long rationale in one iteration, resulting in two issues:
1) Long rationales lead to a large token-level batch size during training,
making gradients of core reasoning tokens (i.e., the token will directly affect
the correctness of subsequent reasoning) over-smoothed as they contribute a
tiny fraction of the rationale. As a result, the SLM converges to sharp minima
where it fails to grasp the reasoning logic. 2) The response is slow, as the
SLM must generate a long rationale before reaching the answer. Therefore, we
propose chunk-wise training (CWT), which uses a heuristic search to divide the
rationale into internal semantically coherent chunks and focuses SLM on
learning from only one chunk per iteration. In this way, CWT naturally isolates
non-reasoning chunks that do not involve the core reasoning token (e.g.,
summary and transitional chunks) from the SLM learning for reasoning chunks,
making the fraction of the core reasoning token increase in the corresponding
iteration. Based on CWT, skip-thinking training (STT) is proposed. STT makes
the SLM automatically skip non-reasoning medium chunks to reach the answer,
improving reasoning speed while maintaining accuracy. We validate our approach
on a variety of SLMs and multiple reasoning tasks.

TLDR: 论文通过理论生成模型解释了Word2Vec和GloVe中词嵌入的线性类比结构的起源，并验证了其与观测现象的吻合性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究词嵌入中线性类比结构（如“king - man + woman ≈ queen”）的理论起源，解释其为何在共现概率矩阵的特定条件下出现。

Method: 提出一个基于二进制语义属性的生成模型，推导共现概率，并分析其对线性类比结构的形成及其特性的影响。

Result: 模型成功复现了线性类比结构的出现，并解释了其与共现矩阵特征向量、对数变换及数据移除等实验现象的关系。

Conclusion: 该生成模型为词嵌入的线性类比结构提供了理论支持，并展示了其对噪声的鲁棒性和与真实数据的一致性。

Abstract: Models such as Word2Vec and GloVe construct word embeddings based on the
co-occurrence probability $P(i,j)$ of words $i$ and $j$ in text corpora. The
resulting vectors $W_i$ not only group semantically similar words but also
exhibit a striking linear analogy structure -- for example, $W_{\text{king}} -
W_{\text{man}} + W_{\text{woman}} \approx W_{\text{queen}}$ -- whose
theoretical origin remains unclear. Previous observations indicate that this
analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix
$M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more
eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are
included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and
(iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation
(e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these
phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are
defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are
derived from attribute-based interactions. This model analytically reproduces
the emergence of linear analogy structure and naturally accounts for properties
(i)-(iv). It can be viewed as giving fine-grained resolution into the role of
each additional embedding dimension. It is robust to various forms of noise and
agrees well with co-occurrence statistics measured on Wikipedia and the analogy
benchmark introduced by Mikolov et al.

settings, analyzing their strengths and limitations in the domain of climate
change.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising cornerstone for the
development of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence
(AI). However, ensuring the robustness of LLMs remains a critical challenge. To
address these challenges and advance the field, this survey provides a
comprehensive overview of current studies in this area. First, we
systematically examine the nature of robustness in LLMs, including its
conceptual foundations, the importance of consistent performance across diverse
inputs, and the implications of failure modes in real-world applications. Next,
we analyze the sources of non-robustness, categorizing intrinsic model
limitations, data-driven vulnerabilities, and external adversarial factors that
compromise reliability. Following this, we review state-of-the-art mitigation
strategies, and then we discuss widely adopted benchmarks, emerging metrics,
and persistent gaps in assessing real-world reliability. Finally, we synthesize
findings from existing surveys and interdisciplinary studies to highlight
trends, unresolved issues, and pathways for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in Natural
Language Processing (NLP), yet their cross-lingual performance consistency
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel methodology for
efficiently identifying inherent cross-lingual weaknesses in LLMs. Our approach
leverages beam search and LLM-based simulation to generate bilingual question
pairs that expose performance discrepancies between English and target
languages. We construct a new dataset of over 6,000 bilingual pairs across 16
languages using this methodology, demonstrating its effectiveness in revealing
weaknesses even in state-of-the-art models. The extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method precisely and cost-effectively pinpoints
cross-lingual weaknesses, consistently revealing over 50\% accuracy drops in
target languages across a wide range of models. Moreover, further experiments
investigate the relationship between linguistic similarity and cross-lingual
weaknesses, revealing that linguistically related languages share similar
performance patterns and benefit from targeted post-training. Code is available

Abstract: Clarifying the research framing of NLP artefacts (e.g., models, datasets,
etc.) is crucial to aligning research with practical applications. Recent
studies manually analyzed NLP research across domains, showing that few papers
explicitly identify key stakeholders, intended uses, or appropriate contexts.
In this work, we propose to automate this analysis, developing a
three-component system that infers research framings by first extracting key
elements (means, ends, stakeholders), then linking them through interpretable
rules and contextual reasoning. We evaluate our approach on two domains:
automated fact-checking using an existing dataset, and hate speech detection
for which we annotate a new dataset-achieving consistent improvements over
strong LLM baselines. Finally, we apply our system to recent automated
fact-checking papers and uncover three notable trends: a rise in vague or
underspecified research goals, increased emphasis on scientific exploration
over application, and a shift toward supporting human fact-checkers rather than
pursuing full automation.

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) systems that support low-resource languages often
struggle on specialized domains. While researchers have proposed various
techniques for domain adaptation, these approaches typically require model
fine-tuning, making them impractical for non-technical users and small
organizations. To address this gap, we propose Tulun, a versatile solution for
terminology-aware translation, combining neural MT with large language model
(LLM)-based post-editing guided by existing glossaries and translation
memories. Our open-source web-based platform enables users to easily create,
edit, and leverage terminology resources, fostering a collaborative
human-machine translation process that respects and incorporates domain
expertise while increasing MT accuracy. Evaluations show effectiveness in both
real-world and benchmark scenarios: on medical and disaster relief translation
tasks for Tetun and Bislama, our system achieves improvements of 16.90-22.41
ChrF++ points over baseline MT systems. Across six low-resource languages on
the FLORES dataset, Tulun outperforms both standalone MT and LLM approaches,
achieving an average improvement of 2.8 ChrF points over NLLB-54B.

Conclusion: MM Health数据集有助于开发多模态级别的虚假信息检测工具，支持健康领域的研究。

Abstract: Infodemics and health misinformation have significant negative impact on
individuals and society, exacerbating confusion and increasing hesitancy in
adopting recommended health measures. Recent advancements in generative AI,
capable of producing realistic, human like text and images, have significantly
accelerated the spread and expanded the reach of health misinformation,
resulting in an alarming surge in its dissemination. To combat the infodemics,
most existing work has focused on developing misinformation datasets from
social media and fact checking platforms, but has faced limitations in topical
coverage, inclusion of AI generation, and accessibility of raw content. To
address these issues, we present MM Health, a large scale multimodal
misinformation dataset in the health domain consisting of 34,746 news article
encompassing both textual and visual information. MM Health includes
human-generated multimodal information (5,776 articles) and AI generated
multimodal information (28,880 articles) from various SOTA generative AI
models. Additionally, We benchmarked our dataset against three tasks
(reliability checks, originality checks, and fine-grained AI detection)
demonstrating that existing SOTA models struggle to accurately distinguish the
reliability and origin of information. Our dataset aims to support the
development of misinformation detection across various health scenarios,
facilitating the detection of human and machine generated content at multimodal
levels.

Abstract: Machine learning models for text classification are trained to predict a
class for a given text. To do this, training and validation samples must be
prepared: a set of texts is collected, and each text is assigned a class. These
classes are usually assigned by human annotators with different expertise
levels, depending on the specific classification task. Collecting such samples
from scratch is labor-intensive because it requires finding specialists and
compensating them for their work; moreover, the number of available specialists
is limited, and their productivity is constrained by human factors. While it
may not be too resource-intensive to collect samples once, the ongoing need to
retrain models (especially in incremental learning pipelines) to address data
drift (also called model drift) makes the data collection process crucial and
costly over the model's entire lifecycle. This paper proposes several
approaches to replace human annotators with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
test classifier predictions for correctness, helping ensure model quality and
support high-quality incremental learning.

Result: 实验表明，CoTGuard能有效检测内容泄露，且对任务性能干扰极小。

Conclusion: 推理级监测为LLM智能体系统中的知识产权保护提供了新方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents capable of
collaborative reasoning and task execution, multi-agent LLM systems have
emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex problems. However, these
systems pose new challenges for copyright protection, particularly when
sensitive or copyrighted content is inadvertently recalled through inter-agent
communication and reasoning. Existing protection techniques primarily focus on
detecting content in final outputs, overlooking the richer, more revealing
reasoning processes within the agents themselves. In this paper, we introduce
CoTGuard, a novel framework for copyright protection that leverages
trigger-based detection within Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Specifically,
we can activate specific CoT segments and monitor intermediate reasoning steps
for unauthorized content reproduction by embedding specific trigger queries
into agent prompts. This approach enables fine-grained, interpretable detection
of copyright violations in collaborative agent scenarios. We evaluate CoTGuard
on various benchmarks in extensive experiments and show that it effectively
uncovers content leakage with minimal interference to task performance. Our
findings suggest that reasoning-level monitoring offers a promising direction
for safeguarding intellectual property in LLM-based agent systems.

reasoning-oriented LLMs, under a realistic autoregressive inference setting
rather than teacher-forced decoding. Beyond single-edit assessments, we also
evaluate multi-edit scenarios to better reflect practical demands. We employ
four evaluation dimensions, including portability, and compare all recent
methods against a simple and straightforward baseline named Selective
Contextual Reasoning (SCR). Empirical results reveal that parameter-based
editing methods perform poorly under realistic conditions. In contrast, SCR
consistently outperforms them across all settings. This study offers new
insights into the limitations of current knowledge editing methods and
highlights the potential of context-based reasoning as a more robust
alternative.

TLDR: 论文介绍了统一意见概念（UOC）本体，用于在语义上下文中整合意见，并提出了统一意见概念提取（UOCE）任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同表述中意见语义表示的差异问题。

Method: 基于NLP和符号描述构建UOC本体，提出UOCE任务，并提供扩展数据集和评估指标。

Result: 建立了生成模型在UOCE任务上的基线性能。

Conclusion: UOC本体和UOCE任务为意见提取提供了统一框架和评估标准。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Unified Opinion Concepts (UOC) ontology to
integrate opinions within their semantic context. The UOC ontology bridges the
gap between the semantic representation of opinion across different
formulations. It is a unified conceptualisation based on the facets of opinions
studied extensively in NLP and semantic structures described through symbolic
descriptions. We further propose the Unified Opinion Concept Extraction (UOCE)
task of extracting opinions from the text with enhanced expressivity.
Additionally, we provide a manually extended and re-annotated evaluation
dataset for this task and tailored evaluation metrics to assess the adherence
of extracted opinions to UOC semantics. Finally, we establish baseline
performance for the UOCE task using state-of-the-art generative models.

TLDR: 论文提出GKI-ICD框架，通过整合三种关键知识（ICD描述、同义词和层级关系）提升ICD编码性能，无需额外模块设计，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICD编码任务面临长尾分布和缺乏标注证据的问题，现有方法通常专注于单一知识类型且模块复杂，限制了扩展性和效果。

Method: 提出GKI-ICD框架，整合ICD描述、同义词和层级关系三种知识，无需额外模块设计。

Result: 在多个ICD编码基准测试中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: GKI-ICD通过综合知识利用显著提升ICD编码性能，具有普适性和高效性。

Abstract: ICD Coding aims to assign a wide range of medical codes to a medical text
document, which is a popular and challenging task in the healthcare domain. To
alleviate the problems of long-tail distribution and the lack of annotations of
code-specific evidence, many previous works have proposed incorporating code
knowledge to improve coding performance. However, existing methods often focus
on a single type of knowledge and design specialized modules that are complex
and incompatible with each other, thereby limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose GKI-ICD, a novel, general
knowledge injection framework that integrates three key types of knowledge,
namely ICD Description, ICD Synonym, and ICD Hierarchy, without specialized
design of additional modules. The comprehensive utilization of the above
knowledge, which exhibits both differences and complementarity, can effectively
enhance the ICD coding performance. Extensive experiments on existing popular
ICD coding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GKI-ICD, which achieves
the state-of-the-art performance on most evaluation metrics. Code is available
at https://github.com/xuzhang0112/GKI-ICD.

TLDR: 研究发现，长上下文（128K tokens）是影响大语言模型（LLMs）安全性的主要因素，即使使用重复或无意义的攻击内容也能绕过模型的安全措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型在长上下文环境下的安全漏洞，特别是通过多轮攻击（MSJ）测试其脆弱性。

Method: 采用多种攻击设置（指令风格、攻击密度、主题和格式），在长达128K tokens的上下文中进行实验。

Result: 长上下文是攻击成功的关键因素，模型的安全行为在长上下文中表现不一致，无需精心设计的恶意内容即可绕过安全措施。

Conclusion: LLMs的长上下文处理能力存在根本性限制，需开发新的安全机制以应对此类漏洞。

Abstract: We investigate long-context vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs)
through Many-Shot Jailbreaking (MSJ). Our experiments utilize context length of
up to 128K tokens. Through comprehensive analysis with various many-shot attack
settings with different instruction styles, shot density, topic, and format, we
reveal that context length is the primary factor determining attack
effectiveness. Critically, we find that successful attacks do not require
carefully crafted harmful content. Even repetitive shots or random dummy text
can circumvent model safety measures, suggesting fundamental limitations in
long-context processing capabilities of LLMs. The safety behavior of
well-aligned models becomes increasingly inconsistent with longer contexts.
These findings highlight significant safety gaps in context expansion
capabilities of LLMs, emphasizing the need for new safety mechanisms.

TLDR: OTPO提出了一种基于最优传输的令牌加权方案，以改进直接偏好优化（DPO），通过强调语义相关的令牌对，提升奖励差异估计的对比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法对所有令牌赋予相同重要性，而人类更关注有意义的令牌，导致偏好优化效果不佳。

Method: 提出OTPO方法，利用最优传输技术实现上下文感知的令牌加权，增强奖励差异估计的对比性。

Result: 实验表明OTPO能有效提升指令遵循能力，增强奖励稳定性和可解释性。

Conclusion: OTPO通过自适应令牌加权，显著改进了偏好优化的效果，为LLM与人类偏好对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising framework for
aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences by directly
optimizing the log-likelihood difference between chosen and rejected responses.
However, existing methods assign equal importance to all tokens in the
response, while humans focus on more meaningful parts. This leads to suboptimal
preference optimization, as irrelevant or noisy tokens disproportionately
influence DPO loss. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{O}ptimal
\textbf{T}ransport-based token weighting scheme for enhancing direct
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (OTPO). By emphasizing semantically
meaningful token pairs and de-emphasizing less relevant ones, our method
introduces a context-aware token weighting scheme that yields a more
contrastive reward difference estimate. This adaptive weighting enhances reward
stability, improves interpretability, and ensures that preference optimization
focuses on meaningful differences between responses. Extensive experiments have
validated OTPO's effectiveness in improving instruction-following ability
across various settings\footnote{Code is available at

Method: 构建了一个包含4,038个问题和12,114个逐步推理注释的数据集，涵盖物理、算术、常识和假设推理。

Result: LogicCat显著提高了任务难度，最高执行准确率仅为14.96%，但加入链式思考注释后提升至33.96%。

Conclusion: LogicCat为推理驱动的文本到SQL系统研究提供了新的挑战和机会，数据集已开源。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a fundamental task in natural language processing that seeks
to translate natural language questions into meaningful and executable SQL
queries. While existing datasets are extensive and primarily focus on business
scenarios and operational logic, they frequently lack coverage of
domain-specific knowledge and complex mathematical reasoning. To address this
gap, we present a novel dataset tailored for complex reasoning and
chain-of-thought analysis in SQL inference, encompassing physical, arithmetic,
commonsense, and hypothetical reasoning. The dataset consists of 4,038 English
questions, each paired with a unique SQL query and accompanied by 12,114
step-by-step reasoning annotations, spanning 45 databases across diverse
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LogicCat substantially increases
the difficulty for state-of-the-art models, with the highest execution accuracy
reaching only 14.96%. Incorporating our chain-of-thought annotations boosts
performance to 33.96%. Benchmarking leading public methods on Spider and BIRD
further underscores the unique challenges presented by LogicCat, highlighting
the significant opportunities for advancing research in robust,
reasoning-driven text-to-SQL systems. We have released our dataset code at

Motivation: 研究ICL的内部机制，填补现有工作对注意力头和任务向量之间联系的缺失。

Method: 分析隐藏状态的几何因素（可分性和对齐性），研究分层动态。

Result: 发现ICL的两阶段机制：早期层实现可分性，后期层实现对齐性。

Conclusion: 统一解释了ICL的机制，填补了注意力头和任务向量之间的空白。

Abstract: The unusual properties of in-context learning (ICL) have prompted
investigations into the internal mechanisms of large language models. Prior
work typically focuses on either special attention heads or task vectors at
specific layers, but lacks a unified framework linking these components to the
evolution of hidden states across layers that ultimately produce the model's
output. In this paper, we propose such a framework for ICL in classification
tasks by analyzing two geometric factors that govern performance: the
separability and alignment of query hidden states. A fine-grained analysis of
layer-wise dynamics reveals a striking two-stage mechanism: separability
emerges in early layers, while alignment develops in later layers. Ablation
studies further show that Previous Token Heads drive separability, while
Induction Heads and task vectors enhance alignment. Our findings thus bridge
the gap between attention heads and task vectors, offering a unified account of
ICL's underlying mechanisms.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为HED-LM的新型少样本优化方法，结合欧氏距离和大型语言模型改进传感器分类任务中的示例选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本提示在有限标注数据下高效推理，但其性能依赖于示例选择质量。HED-LM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HED-LM通过混合选择流程，先用欧氏距离筛选候选示例，再用大型语言模型根据上下文相关性重新排序。

Result: 在疲劳检测任务中，HED-LM的平均宏F1分数为69.13±10.71%，优于随机选择和仅距离过滤。

Conclusion: HED-LM结合数值相似性和上下文相关性，提升了少样本提示的鲁棒性，适用于医疗监测、工业安全等领域。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot optimization with HED-LM (Hybrid
Euclidean Distance with Large Language Models) to improve example selection for
sensor-based classification tasks. While few-shot prompting enables efficient
inference with limited labeled data, its performance largely depends on the
quality of selected examples. HED-LM addresses this challenge through a hybrid
selection pipeline that filters candidate examples based on Euclidean distance
and re-ranks them using contextual relevance scored by large language models
(LLMs). To validate its effectiveness, we apply HED-LM to a fatigue detection
task using accelerometer data characterized by overlapping patterns and high
inter-subject variability. Unlike simpler tasks such as activity recognition,
fatigue detection demands more nuanced example selection due to subtle
differences in physiological signals. Our experiments show that HED-LM achieves
a mean macro F1-score of 69.13$\pm$10.71%, outperforming both random selection
(59.30$\pm$10.13%) and distance-only filtering (67.61$\pm$11.39%). These
represent relative improvements of 16.6% and 2.3%, respectively. The results
confirm that combining numerical similarity with contextual relevance improves
the robustness of few-shot prompting. Overall, HED-LM offers a practical
solution to improve performance in real-world sensor-based learning tasks and
shows potential for broader applications in healthcare monitoring, human
activity recognition, and industrial safety scenarios.

Result: LLMs对IC敏感，但强干扰训练提升性能，逐步树搜索增强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GSM-DC为评估LLMs鲁棒性提供工具，强干扰训练和逐步树搜索是有效改进方法。

Abstract: We introduce Grade School Math with Distracting Context (GSM-DC), a synthetic
benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning robustness
against systematically controlled irrelevant context (IC). GSM-DC constructs
symbolic reasoning graphs with precise distractor injections, enabling
rigorous, reproducible evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs are
significantly sensitive to IC, affecting both reasoning path selection and
arithmetic accuracy. Additionally, training models with strong distractors
improves performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.
We further propose a stepwise tree search guided by a process reward model,
which notably enhances robustness in out-of-distribution conditions.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）在敏感工作流程中的应用增加，其可能泄露机密信息的风险引起了关注。

Method: 提出TrojanStego威胁模型，通过词汇分区的编码方案微调LLM，实现隐蔽的信息嵌入。

Result: 实验显示，受攻击模型能以87%的准确率传输32位秘密信息，多数投票下可达97%以上，同时保持高实用性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: TrojanStego揭示了一类被动、隐蔽且危险的LLM数据泄露攻击。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into sensitive workflows,
concerns grow over their potential to leak confidential information. We propose
TrojanStego, a novel threat model in which an adversary fine-tunes an LLM to
embed sensitive context information into natural-looking outputs via linguistic
steganography, without requiring explicit control over inference inputs. We
introduce a taxonomy outlining risk factors for compromised LLMs, and use it to
evaluate the risk profile of the threat. To implement TrojanStego, we propose a
practical encoding scheme based on vocabulary partitioning learnable by LLMs
via fine-tuning. Experimental results show that compromised models reliably
transmit 32-bit secrets with 87% accuracy on held-out prompts, reaching over
97% accuracy using majority voting across three generations. Further, they
maintain high utility, can evade human detection, and preserve coherence. These
results highlight a new class of LLM data exfiltration attacks that are
passive, covert, practical, and dangerous.

Conclusion: K-tool为自动化测量学生背景知识提供了可行方案，适用于中学英语母语者。

Abstract: Background knowledge is typically needed for successful comprehension of
topical and domain specific reading passages, such as in the STEM domain.
However, there are few automated measures of student knowledge that can be
readily deployed and scored in time to make predictions on whether a given
student will likely be able to understand a specific content area text. In this
paper, we present our effort in developing K-tool, an automated system for
generating topical vocabulary tests that measure students' background knowledge
related to a specific text. The system automatically detects the topic of a
given text and produces topical vocabulary items based on their relationship
with the topic. This information is used to automatically generate background
knowledge forms that contain words that are highly related to the topic and
words that share similar features but do not share high associations to the
topic. Prior research indicates that performance on such tasks can help
determine whether a student is likely to understand a particular text based on
their knowledge state. The described system is intended for use with middle and
high school student population of native speakers of English. It is designed to
handle single reading passages and is not dependent on any corpus or text
collection. In this paper, we describe the system architecture and present an
initial evaluation of the system outputs.

Motivation: 现有方法在编辑知识时难以保留与编辑知识共享主语但关系不同的细粒度无关知识，导致知识表示空间中的纠缠问题。

Method: DiKE包含知识表示解耦模块（KRD）和解耦知识编辑模块（DKE），通过分解主语表示并仅更新目标相关部分，同时保留无关部分。

Result: 实验表明，DiKE显著提升了细粒度无关知识的保留能力，同时保持了编辑性能。

Conclusion: DiKE为高效且精确的知识编辑提供了一种新方法，解决了细粒度知识保留的挑战。

Abstract: Knowledge Editing has emerged as a promising solution for efficiently
updating embedded knowledge in large language models (LLMs). While existing
approaches demonstrate effectiveness in integrating new knowledge and
preserving the original capabilities of LLMs, they fail to maintain
fine-grained irrelevant knowledge facts that share the same subject as edited
knowledge but differ in relation and object. This challenge arises because
subject representations inherently encode multiple attributes, causing the
target and fine-grained irrelevant knowledge to become entangled in the
representation space, and thus vulnerable to unintended alterations during
editing. To address this, we propose DiKE, a novel approach that Disentangles
Knowledge representations for LLM Editing (DiKE). DiKE consists of two key
components: a Knowledge Representation Disentanglement (KRD) module that
decomposes the subject representation into target-knowledgerelated and
-unrelated components, and a Disentanglement-based Knowledge Edit (DKE) module
that updates only the target-related component while explicitly preserving the
unrelated one. We further derive a closed-form, rank-one parameter update based
on matrix theory to enable efficient and minimally invasive edits. To
rigorously evaluate fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation, we
construct FINE-KED, a new benchmark comprising fine-grained irrelevant
knowledge at different levels of relational similarity to the edited knowledge.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that DiKE substantially
improves fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation while maintaining
competitive general editing performance.

Result: 实验表明，ALPS仅激活10%的注意力参数，性能提升2%，且任务头可跨数据集迁移。

Conclusion: ALPS为高效LLM对齐提供了新视角。

Abstract: Aligning general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks
often incurs significant costs, including constructing task-specific
instruction pairs and extensive training adjustments. Prior research has
explored various avenues to enhance alignment efficiency, primarily through
minimal-data training or data-driven activations to identify key attention
heads. However, these approaches inherently introduce data dependency, which
hinders generalization and reusability. To address this issue and enhance model
alignment efficiency, we propose the \textit{\textbf{A}ttention
\textbf{L}ocalization and \textbf{P}runing \textbf{S}trategy (\textbf{ALPS})},
an efficient algorithm that localizes the most task-sensitive attention heads
and prunes by restricting attention training updates to these heads, thereby
reducing alignment costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
activates only \textbf{10\%} of attention parameters during fine-tuning while
achieving a \textbf{2\%} performance improvement over baselines on three tasks.
Moreover, the identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets
and mitigate knowledge forgetting. Our work and findings provide a novel
perspective on efficient LLM alignment.

TLDR: v1是MLLMs的轻量级扩展，支持推理过程中动态检索视觉信息，显著提升多模态数学推理任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs仅单次处理视觉输入，缺乏动态视觉访问能力，限制了多模态推理的细粒度和多步性。

Method: 提出点选复制机制，动态检索相关图像区域，并构建v1g数据集（30万条多模态推理轨迹）进行训练。

Result: 在MathVista等三个数学推理基准测试中，v1显著优于基线，尤其在细粒度视觉参考和多步推理任务中。

Conclusion: 动态视觉访问是增强多模态推理的有效方向，代码、模型和数据将开源以支持研究。

Abstract: We present v1, a lightweight extension to Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) that enables selective visual revisitation during inference. While
current MLLMs typically consume visual input only once and reason purely over
internal memory, v1 introduces a simple point-and-copy mechanism that allows
the model to dynamically retrieve relevant image regions throughout the
reasoning process. This mechanism augments existing architectures with minimal
modifications, enabling contextual access to visual tokens based on the model's
evolving hypotheses. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of
300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations.
Experiments on three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks -- MathVista,
MathVision, and MathVerse -- demonstrate that v1 consistently improves
performance over comparable baselines, particularly on tasks requiring
fine-grained visual reference and multi-step reasoning. Our results suggest
that dynamic visual access is a promising direction for enhancing grounded
multimodal reasoning. Code, models, and data will be released to support future
research.

Conclusion: 本文为未来研究者开发更强大的MPCAs提供了指导，并强调了ToM和多模态理解的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-party Conversational Agents (MPCAs) are systems designed to engage in
dialogue with more than two participants simultaneously. Unlike traditional
two-party agents, designing MPCAs faces additional challenges due to the need
to interpret both utterance semantics and social dynamics. This survey explores
recent progress in MPCAs by addressing three key questions: 1) Can agents model
each participants' mental states? (State of Mind Modeling); 2) Can they
properly understand the dialogue content? (Semantic Understanding); and 3) Can
they reason about and predict future conversation flow? (Agent Action
Modeling). We review methods ranging from classical machine learning to Large
Language Models (LLMs) and multi-modal systems. Our analysis underscores Theory
of Mind (ToM) as essential for building intelligent MPCAs and highlights
multi-modal understanding as a promising yet underexplored direction. Finally,
this survey offers guidance to future researchers on developing more capable
MPCAs.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为Smoothie的新扩散方法，结合了连续潜在空间和分类单纯形空间的优点，通过基于语义相似性逐步平滑标记嵌入，提升了文本生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像、音频和视频生成中表现优异，但在文本生成中由于离散性面临挑战。现有方法要么难以解码标记，要么忽视标记间的语义关系。

Method: 提出Smoothie方法，通过在标记嵌入上逐步平滑，结合连续潜在空间的语义结构和分类单纯形空间的离散性优势。

Result: 实验表明，Smoothie在多个序列生成任务中优于现有扩散模型，且其扩散空间性能优于标准嵌入空间和分类单纯形。

Conclusion: Smoothie通过结合两种方法的优势，显著提升了文本生成的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generating
images, audio, and video, but their adaptation to text remains challenging due
to its discrete nature. Prior approaches either apply Gaussian diffusion in
continuous latent spaces, which inherits semantic structure but struggles with
token decoding, or operate in categorical simplex space, which respect
discreteness but disregard semantic relation between tokens. In this paper, we
propose Smoothing Diffusion on Token Embeddings (Smoothie), a novel diffusion
method that combines the strengths of both approaches by progressively
smoothing token embeddings based on semantic similarity. This technique enables
gradual information removal while maintaining a natural decoding process.
Experimental results on several sequence-to-sequence generation tasks
demonstrate that Smoothie outperforms existing diffusion-based models in
generation quality. Furthermore, ablation studies show that our proposed
diffusion space yields better performance than both the standard embedding
space and the categorical simplex. Our code is available at

*Yuxiang Liu,Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了基于范例的说明文生成任务，并提出了RePA框架，通过自适应模仿和分段生成解决现有方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量范例数据，难以适应主题特定内容，且长文本连贯性差。

Method: 提出Adaptive Imitation概念和RePA框架，利用LLM进行细粒度计划与适应，并通过记忆结构增强连贯性。

Result: RePA在三个数据集上超越基线，生成更事实性、一致性和相关性的文本。

Conclusion: RePA通过自适应模仿和分段生成，显著提升了说明文生成的质量。

Abstract: We introduce the Exemplar-Based Expository Text Generation task, aiming to
generate an expository text on a new topic using an exemplar on a similar
topic. Current methods fall short due to their reliance on extensive exemplar
data, difficulty in adapting topic-specific content, and issues with long-text
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose the concept of Adaptive
Imitation and present a novel Recurrent Plan-then-Adapt (RePA) framework. RePA
leverages large language models (LLMs) for effective adaptive imitation through
a fine-grained plan-then-adapt process. RePA also enables recurrent
segment-by-segment imitation, supported by two memory structures that enhance
input clarity and output coherence. We also develop task-specific evaluation
metrics--imitativeness, adaptiveness, and adaptive-imitativeness--using LLMs as
evaluators. Experimental results across our collected three diverse datasets
demonstrate that RePA surpasses existing baselines in producing factual,
consistent, and relevant texts for this task.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种针对语音输入的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的白盒对抗攻击方法，通过语音标记化生成对抗性标记序列，成功绕过对齐保护并诱导禁止输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音交互的MLLMs（如SpeechGPT）提升了人机交互的自然性和灵活性，但也引入了新的安全风险，目前语音模态的攻击和防御研究较少。

Method: 提出了一种基于语音标记化的令牌级攻击方法，生成对抗性标记序列并合成为音频提示，以绕过对齐保护。

Result: 在SpeechGPT上测试，攻击成功率达89%，显著优于现有语音攻击方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语音多模态系统的脆弱性，为下一代更鲁棒的MLLMs开发提供了指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced the naturalness and flexibility of human computer
interaction by enabling seamless understanding across text, vision, and audio
modalities. Among these, voice enabled models such as SpeechGPT have
demonstrated considerable improvements in usability, offering expressive, and
emotionally responsive interactions that foster deeper connections in real
world communication scenarios. However, the use of voice introduces new
security risks, as attackers can exploit the unique characteristics of spoken
language, such as timing, pronunciation variability, and speech to text
translation, to craft inputs that bypass defenses in ways not seen in
text-based systems. Despite substantial research on text based jailbreaks, the
voice modality remains largely underexplored in terms of both attack strategies
and defense mechanisms. In this work, we present an adversarial attack
targeting the speech input of aligned MLLMs in a white box scenario.
Specifically, we introduce a novel token level attack that leverages access to
the model's speech tokenization to generate adversarial token sequences. These
sequences are then synthesized into audio prompts, which effectively bypass
alignment safeguards and to induce prohibited outputs. Evaluated on SpeechGPT,
our approach achieves up to 89 percent attack success rate across multiple
restricted tasks, significantly outperforming existing voice based jailbreak
methods. Our findings shed light on the vulnerabilities of voice-enabled
multimodal systems and to help guide the development of more robust
next-generation MLLMs.

*Ming Cheng,Jiaying Gong,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: Sci-LoRA是一种动态混合LoRA模型，用于跨领域科学信息的通俗化改写，无需显式领域标签即可自适应调整不同领域的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着跨学科研究的兴起，需要一种方法能够理解和改写多个技术领域的科学信息，而现有研究多局限于单一领域。

Method: Sci-LoRA通过动态生成和应用多个LoRA的权重，结合数据和模型层面的信息融合，实现跨领域的自适应改写。

Result: 在12个领域和5个公开数据集上的实验表明，Sci-LoRA显著优于现有大型语言模型，并展现出灵活的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: Sci-LoRA为跨领域科学信息的通俗化改写提供了一种高效且自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Lay paraphrasing aims to make scientific information accessible to audiences
without technical backgrounds. However, most existing studies focus on a single
domain, such as biomedicine. With the rise of interdisciplinary research, it is
increasingly necessary to comprehend knowledge spanning multiple technical
fields. To address this, we propose Sci-LoRA, a model that leverages a mixture
of LoRAs fine-tuned on multiple scientific domains. In particular, Sci-LoRA
dynamically generates and applies weights for each LoRA, enabling it to adjust
the impact of different domains based on the input text, without requiring
explicit domain labels. To balance domain-specific knowledge and generalization
across various domains, Sci-LoRA integrates information at both the data and
model levels. This dynamic fusion enhances the adaptability and performance
across various domains. Experimental results across twelve domains on five
public datasets show that Sci-LoRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
large language models and demonstrates flexible generalization and adaptability
in cross-domain lay paraphrasing.

TLDR: CRMArena-Pro 是一个用于评估 LLM 代理在多样化商业场景中表现的新基准，揭示了当前代理在多轮交互、保密意识和技能多样性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在环境、数据和交互方面缺乏真实性，且覆盖场景有限，无法满足企业需求。

Method: 引入 CRMArena-Pro，包含 19 个专家验证的任务，覆盖销售、服务和报价流程，支持多轮交互和保密意识评估。

Result: 领先的 LLM 代理在单轮任务中成功率约 58%，多轮任务中降至 35%；保密意识几乎为零。

Conclusion: 当前 LLM 代理能力与企业需求存在显著差距，需在多轮推理、保密意识和技能多样性方面改进。

Abstract: While AI agents hold transformative potential in business, effective
performance benchmarking is hindered by the scarcity of public, realistic
business data on widely used platforms. Existing benchmarks often lack fidelity
in their environments, data, and agent-user interactions, with limited coverage
of diverse business scenarios and industries. To address these gaps, we
introduce CRMArena-Pro, a novel benchmark for holistic, realistic assessment of
LLM agents in diverse professional settings. CRMArena-Pro expands on CRMArena
with nineteen expert-validated tasks across sales, service, and 'configure,
price, and quote' processes, for both Business-to-Business and
Business-to-Customer scenarios. It distinctively incorporates multi-turn
interactions guided by diverse personas and robust confidentiality awareness
assessments. Experiments reveal leading LLM agents achieve only around 58%
single-turn success on CRMArena-Pro, with performance dropping significantly to
approximately 35% in multi-turn settings. While Workflow Execution proves more
tractable for top agents (over 83% single-turn success), other evaluated
business skills present greater challenges. Furthermore, agents exhibit
near-zero inherent confidentiality awareness; though targeted prompting can
improve this, it often compromises task performance. These findings highlight a
substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and enterprise demands,
underscoring the need for advancements in multi-turn reasoning, confidentiality
adherence, and versatile skill acquisition.

not frame the task of humor detection as a binary sequence classification, but
as word-level sequence labeling, in order to take into account all the context
of the sequence and to capture the continuous joke tagging mechanism typically
occurring in natural conversations. As par with unimodal baselines results, we
propose a method for e propose a method to enhance the automatic laughter

Result: 综述了快速发展的研究领域，总结了常见设计模式，并提出了开放性问题，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: Federated RAG是一个有前景的研究方向，本文为RAG与联邦系统的交叉研究提供了系统性综述和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Federated RAG) combines Federated
Learning (FL), which enables distributed model training without exposing raw
data, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which improves the factual
accuracy of language models by grounding outputs in external knowledge. As
large language models are increasingly deployed in privacy-sensitive domains
such as healthcare, finance, and personalized assistance, Federated RAG offers
a promising framework for secure, knowledge-intensive natural language
processing (NLP). To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first
systematic mapping study of Federated RAG, covering literature published
between 2020 and 2025. Following Kitchenham's guidelines for evidence-based
software engineering, we develop a structured classification of research
focuses, contribution types, and application domains. We analyze architectural
patterns, temporal trends, and key challenges, including privacy-preserving
retrieval, cross-client heterogeneity, and evaluation limitations. Our findings
synthesize a rapidly evolving body of research, identify recurring design
patterns, and surface open questions, providing a foundation for future work at
the intersection of RAG and federated systems.

Motivation: 现有立场分类数据集在多语言覆盖和标注复杂性方面存在不足，SCRum-9旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 数据集包含多语言推文-回复对，由至少三名母语者标注，总计405小时标注时间和8,150美元补偿。

Result: 实验表明，SCRum-9对当前先进的大语言模型和微调预训练模型均具有挑战性。

Conclusion: SCRum-9为未来研究提供了有价值的基准，推动了多语言谣言立场分类领域的发展。

Abstract: We introduce SCRum-9, a multilingual dataset for Rumour Stance
Classification, containing 7,516 tweet-reply pairs from X. SCRum-9 goes beyond
existing stance classification datasets by covering more languages (9), linking
examples to more fact-checked claims (2.1k), and including complex annotations

TLDR: 该研究比较了GPT-4.1、Gemini 1.5 Pro和Claude 3 Opus三种大型语言模型在检测有害YouTube评论上的表现，发现GPT-4.1综合表现最佳，但所有模型均难以处理讽刺和混合语言俚语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台的评论区骚扰问题日益严重，影响用户体验和心理健康，因此需要评估现有语言模型在内容审核中的效果。

Method: 研究使用5,080条来自高滥用线程的YouTube评论（含1,334条有害评论），通过统一提示和确定性设置测试三种模型的性能。

Result: GPT-4.1在F1分数（0.863）、精确度（0.887）和召回率（0.841）上表现最佳；Gemini召回率最高（0.875）但精确度较低（0.767）；Claude精确度最高（0.920）但召回率最低（0.720）。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要结合互补模型、上下文理解及针对少数语言和隐晦滥用的优化，以改进内容审核系统。数据集和提示已公开以促进研究。

Abstract: As online platforms grow, comment sections increasingly host harassment that
undermines user experience and well-being. This study benchmarks three leading
large language models, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic
Claude 3 Opus, on a corpus of 5,080 YouTube comments sampled from high-abuse
threads in gaming, lifestyle, food vlog, and music channels. The dataset
comprises 1,334 harmful and 3,746 non-harmful messages in English, Arabic, and
Indonesian, annotated independently by two reviewers with substantial agreement
(Cohen's kappa = 0.83). Using a unified prompt and deterministic settings,
GPT-4.1 achieved the best overall balance with an F1 score of 0.863, precision
of 0.887, and recall of 0.841. Gemini flagged the highest share of harmful
posts (recall = 0.875) but its precision fell to 0.767 due to frequent false
positives. Claude delivered the highest precision at 0.920 and the lowest
false-positive rate of 0.022, yet its recall dropped to 0.720. Qualitative
analysis showed that all three models struggle with sarcasm, coded insults, and
mixed-language slang. These results underscore the need for moderation
pipelines that combine complementary models, incorporate conversational
context, and fine-tune for under-represented languages and implicit abuse. A
de-identified version of the dataset and full prompts is publicly released to
promote reproducibility and further progress in automated content moderation.

TLDR: MetaMind是一个多智能体框架，旨在提升大型语言模型在社交推理中的表现，通过模拟人类心理理论（ToM）实现更自然的社交互动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语义理解任务上表现优异，但在处理人类交流中的模糊性和上下文细微差别时存在困难。MetaMind旨在填补这一差距。

Method: MetaMind将社交理解分解为三个阶段：心理理论代理生成假设，领域代理根据文化和伦理约束优化假设，响应代理生成并验证上下文合适的回应。

Result: MetaMind在三个基准测试中表现优异，真实社交场景提升35.7%，ToM推理提升6.2%，首次使LLM在关键ToM任务上达到人类水平。

Conclusion: MetaMind通过平衡上下文合理性、社交适应性和用户适配性，推动了AI系统向类人社交智能的发展。

Abstract: Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken
intentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the
psychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models
(LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity
and contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories
of metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind
decomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a
Theory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses user mental states (e.g., intent,
emotion), (2) a Domain Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural norms and
ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually
appropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging
benchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain
in ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on
key ToM tasks for the first time. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of all
components, which showcase the framework's ability to balance contextual
plausibility, social appropriateness, and user adaptation. This work advances
AI systems toward human-like social intelligence, with applications in
empathetic dialogue and culturally sensitive interactions. Code is available at

TLDR: 研究发现，指令调优的大语言模型（LLMs）使用结构化模板会导致多样性崩溃，即模型对开放式输入生成语义相似的输出，影响创造性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨结构化模板对LLMs输出多样性的影响，揭示当前提示设计的局限性。

Method: 通过故事完成和自由生成等任务评估多样性崩溃现象，并分析结构化提示对输出空间的影响。

Result: 结构化模板显著限制输出多样性，而格式一致性对结构敏感任务至关重要，但对知识密集型任务影响较小。

Conclusion: 当前提示设计可能无意中抑制输出多样性，需设计多样性感知的提示和指令调优方法。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) employ structured templates,
such as role markers and special tokens, to enforce format consistency during
inference. However, we identify a critical limitation of such formatting: it
induces a phenomenon we term diversity collapse, where the model generates
semantically similar outputs for open-ended inputs, undermining creativity and
variability. We systematically evaluate this effect across tasks like story
completion and free-form generation, finding that (1) diversity collapse
persists even under high-temperature sampling, and (2) structural tokens in
templates significantly constrain the model's output space. To contextualize
these findings, we fine-tune the same model using a range of structured prompts
and then evaluate them across three axes: downstream task performance,
alignment behavior, and output diversity. Our analysis shows that format
consistency between fine-tuning and inference is crucial for
structure-sensitive tasks (e.g., GSM8K, IFEval), but has marginal influence on
knowledge-heavy tasks (e.g., MMLU, WebQuestions). In contrast, output diversity
is primarily governed by the presence or absence of structural tokens, with
minimal formatting yielding the most diverse outputs. These findings reveal
that current prompting conventions, while beneficial for alignment, may
inadvertently suppress output diversity, underscoring the need for
diversity-aware prompt design and instruction tuning.

TLDR: 论文提出了BnMMLU，一个用于评估孟加拉语多任务语言理解能力的基准数据集，填补了低资源语言在MMLU中的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMLU基准主要关注高资源语言（如英语），低资源语言（如孟加拉语）代表性不足，因此需要专门的数据集。

Method: 构建了包含23个领域、138,949个选择题对的BnMMLU数据集，并标注了三种认知类别（事实知识、程序应用和推理）。

Result: 评估了多个专有和开源大语言模型，揭示了性能差距，表明需要针对孟加拉语的改进策略。

Conclusion: 发布数据集和基准结果，以促进低资源语言模型的研究。

Abstract: The Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark has been widely
used to evaluate language models across various domains. However, existing MMLU
datasets primarily focus on high-resource languages such as English, which
leaves low-resource languages like Bengali underrepresented. In this paper, we
introduce BnMMLU, a benchmark to evaluate the multitask language understanding
capabilities of Bengali in language models. The dataset spans 23 domains,
including science, humanities, mathematics and general knowledge and is
structured in a multiple-choice format to assess factual knowledge,
application-based problem-solving and reasoning abilities of language models.
It consists of 138,949 question-option pairs. We benchmark several proprietary
and open-source large language models (LLMs) on the BnMMLU test set.
Additionally, we annotate the test set with three cognitive categories-factual
knowledge, procedural application and reasoning-to gain deeper insights into
model strengths and weaknesses across various cognitive tasks. The results
reveal significant performance gaps, highlighting the need for improved
pre-training and fine-tuning strategies tailored to Bengali data. We release
the dataset and benchmark results to facilitate further research in this area.

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示AI模型在金融风险评估中的潜在偏见和不一致性，以推动标准化评估的需求。

Method: 使用1,720个用户配置文件，覆盖10个国家和两种性别，通过16个风险相关特征评估了多种专有和开源AI模型。

Result: 不同模型在评分分布和人口统计敏感性上差异显著，例如GPT-4o对尼日利亚和印尼用户评分较高，而LLaMA和DeepSeek在性别分类上表现相反。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在受监管的金融环境中对AI系统进行严格标准化评估的必要性，以避免偏见和不一致性。

Abstract: We evaluate the credibility of leading AI models in assessing investment risk
appetite. Our analysis spans proprietary (GPT-4, Claude 3.7, Gemini 1.5) and
open-weight models (LLaMA 3.1/3.3, DeepSeek-V3, Mistral-small), using 1,720
user profiles constructed with 16 risk-relevant features across 10 countries
and both genders. We observe significant variance across models in score
distributions and demographic sensitivity. For example, GPT-4o assigns higher
risk scores to Nigerian and Indonesian profiles, while LLaMA and DeepSeek show
opposite gender tendencies in risk classification. While some models (e.g.,
GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1) align closely with expected scores in low- and mid-risk
ranges, none maintain consistent performance across regions and demographics.
Our findings highlight the need for rigorous, standardized evaluations of AI
systems in regulated financial contexts to prevent bias, opacity, and
inconsistency in real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: System-1.5 Reasoning是一种自适应推理框架，通过动态分配计算资源在推理步骤中提高效率，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的链式思维推理（CoT）效率低下，而现有的潜在空间推理方法未能区分关键步骤与非关键步骤，导致计算资源浪费。

Method: 提出System-1.5 Reasoning框架，包含两种动态捷径：模型深度捷径（DS）和步骤捷径（SS），并通过两阶段自蒸馏训练实现。

Result: 在GSM8K等推理任务上，System-1.5 Reasoning性能接近传统CoT方法，推理速度提升20倍以上，生成token减少92.31%。

Conclusion: System-1.5 Reasoning在保持高性能的同时显著提升了推理效率，为大型语言模型的推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to move
beyond fast System-1 responses and engage in deliberative System-2 reasoning.
However, this comes at the cost of significant inefficiency due to verbose
intermediate output. Recent latent-space reasoning methods improve efficiency
by operating on hidden states without decoding into language, yet they treat
all steps uniformly, failing to distinguish critical deductions from auxiliary
steps and resulting in suboptimal use of computational resources. In this
paper, we propose System-1.5 Reasoning, an adaptive reasoning framework that
dynamically allocates computation across reasoning steps through shortcut paths
in latent space.Specifically, System-1.5 Reasoning introduces two types of
dynamic shortcuts. The model depth shortcut (DS) adaptively reasons along the
vertical depth by early exiting non-critical tokens through lightweight adapter
branches, while allowing critical tokens to continue through deeper Transformer
layers. The step shortcut (SS) reuses hidden states across the decoding steps
to skip trivial steps and reason horizontally in latent space. Training
System-1.5 Reasoning involves a two-stage self-distillation process: first
distilling natural language CoT into latent-space continuous thought, and then
distilling full-path System-2 latent reasoning into adaptive shortcut paths
(System-1.5 Reasoning).Experiments on reasoning tasks demonstrate the superior
performance of our method. For example, on GSM8K, System-1.5 Reasoning achieves
reasoning performance comparable to traditional CoT fine-tuning methods while
accelerating inference by over 20x and reducing token generation by 92.31% on
average.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: ProtoSurE是一种基于原型的代理框架，为大型语言模型（LLMs）提供忠实且易于理解的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有解释方法在忠实性和人类可理解性上的不足。

Method: 通过训练一个可解释的代理模型，利用句子级原型作为人类可理解的概念。

Result: 在多种LLMs和数据集上优于现有方法，且具有较高的数据效率。

Conclusion: ProtoSurE是一种实用且高效的LLM解释方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
natural language tasks, but their decision-making processes remain largely
opaque. Existing explanation methods either suffer from limited faithfulness to
the model's reasoning or produce explanations that humans find difficult to
understand. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ProtoSurE}, a novel
prototype-based surrogate framework that provides faithful and
human-understandable explanations for LLMs. ProtoSurE trains an
interpretable-by-design surrogate model that aligns with the target LLM while
utilizing sentence-level prototypes as human-understandable concepts. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoSurE consistently outperforms SOTA explanation
methods across diverse LLMs and datasets. Importantly, ProtoSurE demonstrates
strong data efficiency, requiring relatively few training examples to achieve
good performance, making it practical for real-world applications.

TLDR: RelatE是一种简单、可解释的知识图谱补全方法，通过实值相位-模分解实现高效性能，优于复杂模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索简单实值嵌入模型在知识图谱补全中的有效性，提供可解释且高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用实值相位-模分解，利用正弦相位对齐编码对称、反转和组合等关系模式。

Result: 在YAGO3-10上MRR达0.521，Hit@10达0.680，训练时间减少24%，推理延迟降低31%。

Conclusion: RelatE是知识图谱补全中可扩展且可解释的优选方法，性能与效率兼具。

Abstract: We revisit the efficacy of simple, real-valued embedding models for knowledge
graph completion and introduce RelatE, an interpretable and modular method that
efficiently integrates dual representations for entities and relations. RelatE
employs a real-valued phase-modulus decomposition, leveraging sinusoidal phase
alignments to encode relational patterns such as symmetry, inversion, and
composition. In contrast to recent approaches based on complex-valued
embeddings or deep neural architectures, RelatE preserves architectural
simplicity while achieving competitive or superior performance on standard
benchmarks. Empirically, RelatE outperforms prior methods across several
datasets: on YAGO3-10, it achieves an MRR of 0.521 and Hit@10 of 0.680,
surpassing all baselines. Additionally, RelatE offers significant efficiency
gains, reducing training time by 24%, inference latency by 31%, and peak GPU
memory usage by 22% compared to RotatE. Perturbation studies demonstrate
improved robustness, with MRR degradation reduced by up to 61% relative to
TransE and by up to 19% compared to RotatE under structural edits such as edge
removals and relation swaps. Formal analysis further establishes the model's
full expressiveness and its capacity to represent essential first-order logical
inference patterns. These results position RelatE as a scalable and
interpretable alternative to more complex architectures for knowledge graph
completion.

TLDR: 论文提出Hierarchical Mamba (HiM)模型，结合Mamba2和双曲几何，用于学习层次感知的语言嵌入，提升复杂层次推理任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性状态空间模型在长序列建模中表现优异，但在复杂层次推理任务中的语言表示能力尚未充分探索。

Method: HiM将Mamba2与双曲几何结合，通过Poincare球或Lorentz流形投影学习层次感知嵌入，并优化双曲损失。

Result: 实验表明，HiM在四个数据集上优于欧几里得基线，HiM-Poincare捕捉细粒度语义，HiM-Lorentz提供更稳定的嵌入。

Conclusion: HiM模型能有效捕捉层次关系，适用于混合跳预测和多跳推理任务。

Abstract: Selective state-space models have achieved great success in long-sequence
modeling. However, their capacity for language representation, especially in
complex hierarchical reasoning tasks, remains underexplored. Most large
language models rely on flat Euclidean embeddings, limiting their ability to
capture latent hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Mamba (HiM), integrating efficient Mamba2 with exponential growth and curved
nature of hyperbolic geometry to learn hierarchy-aware language embeddings for
deeper linguistic understanding. Mamba2-processed sequences are projected to
the Poincare ball (via tangent-based mapping) or Lorentzian manifold (via
cosine and sine-based mapping) with "learnable" curvature, optimized with a
combined hyperbolic loss. Our HiM model facilitates the capture of relational
distances across varying hierarchical levels, enabling effective long-range
reasoning. This makes it well-suited for tasks like mixed-hop prediction and
multi-hop inference in hierarchical classification. We evaluated our HiM with
four linguistic and medical datasets for mixed-hop prediction and multi-hop
inference tasks. Experimental results demonstrated that: 1) Both HiM models
effectively capture hierarchical relationships for four ontological datasets,
surpassing Euclidean baselines. 2) HiM-Poincare captures fine-grained semantic
distinctions with higher h-norms, while HiM-Lorentz provides more stable,
compact, and hierarchy-preserving embeddings favoring robustness over detail.

original university level math problems natively authored in Spanish. The
dataset spans seven advanced domains (Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, Probability,
Number Theory, Combinatorics, and Logic), and each problem is accompanied by a
step by step human solution. We evaluate six large language models GPT 4o, GPT
4o mini, o3 mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, DeepSeek R1 685B, and DeepSeek V3 685B under
four configurations: zero shot and chain of thought, each in Spanish and
English. The top models (o3 mini, DeepSeek R1 685B, DeepSeek V3 685B) achieve
over 70% accuracy, whereas LLaMA 3.3 70B and GPT-4o mini remain below 40%. Most
models show no significant performance drop between languages, with GPT 4o even
performing better on Spanish problems in the zero shot setting. Geometry,
Combinatorics, and Probability questions remain persistently challenging for
all models. These results highlight the need for native-language benchmarks and
domain-specific evaluations to reveal reasoning failures not captured by

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化微调方法（如GRPO）在数据准备和长链推理质量上存在瓶颈，限制了视频大语言模型的性能提升。

Method: 提出VerIPO方法，结合Rollout-Aware Verifier，形成GRPO-Verifier-DPO训练循环，利用小模型评估推理逻辑，构建高质量对比数据。

Result: 实验显示VerIPO在推理链长度和一致性上显著优于传统方法，且训练速度更快，性能超越现有模型。

Conclusion: VerIPO为视频大语言模型的长链推理提供了高效稳定的优化方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) shows significant promise for complex video reasoning. However,
popular Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) methods, such as outcome-based Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are limited by data preparation
bottlenecks (e.g., noise or high cost) and exhibit unstable improvements in the
quality of long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) and downstream performance.To address
these limitations, we propose VerIPO, a Verifier-guided Iterative Policy
Optimization method designed to gradually improve video LLMs' capacity for
generating deep, long-term reasoning chains. The core component is
Rollout-Aware Verifier, positioned between the GRPO and Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) training phases to form the GRPO-Verifier-DPO training loop.
This verifier leverages small LLMs as a judge to assess the reasoning logic of
rollouts, enabling the construction of high-quality contrastive data, including
reflective and contextually consistent CoTs. These curated preference samples
drive the efficient DPO stage (7x faster than GRPO), leading to marked
improvements in reasoning chain quality, especially in terms of length and
contextual consistency. This training loop benefits from GRPO's expansive
search and DPO's targeted optimization. Experimental results demonstrate: 1)
Significantly faster and more effective optimization compared to standard GRPO
variants, yielding superior performance; 2) Our trained models exceed the
direct inference of large-scale instruction-tuned Video-LLMs, producing long
and contextually consistent CoTs on diverse video reasoning tasks; and 3) Our
model with one iteration outperforms powerful LMMs (e.g., Kimi-VL) and long
reasoning models (e.g., Video-R1), highlighting its effectiveness and
stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在资源丰富的语言（如英语），而低资源语言（如孟加拉语）缺乏标注数据、预训练模型和优化参数，导致ABSA任务难以开展。

Method: 提出CrosGrpsABS框架，结合基于Transformer的上下文嵌入和图卷积网络，利用双向交叉注意力融合局部句法结构和全局语义上下文。

Result: 在孟加拉语和英语数据集上均表现优异，F1分数显著提升（如英语SemEval 2014任务4中餐厅领域提升0.93%，笔记本电脑领域提升1.06%）。

Conclusion: CrosGrpsABS通过融合句法和语义信息，有效解决了低资源语言的ABSA问题，并在高资源语言中同样表现出色。

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fundamental task in natural
language processing, offering fine-grained insights into opinions expressed in
text. While existing research has largely focused on resource-rich languages
like English which leveraging large annotated datasets, pre-trained models, and
language-specific tools. These resources are often unavailable for low-resource
languages such as Bengali. The ABSA task in Bengali remains poorly explored and
is further complicated by its unique linguistic characteristics and a lack of
annotated data, pre-trained models, and optimized hyperparameters. To address
these challenges, this research propose CrosGrpsABS, a novel hybrid framework
that leverages bidirectional cross-attention between syntactic and semantic
graphs to enhance aspect-level sentiment classification. The CrosGrpsABS
combines transformerbased contextual embeddings with graph convolutional
networks, built upon rule-based syntactic dependency parsing and semantic
similarity computations. By employing bidirectional crossattention, the model
effectively fuses local syntactic structure with global semantic context,
resulting in improved sentiment classification performance across both low- and
high-resource settings. We evaluate CrosGrpsABS on four low-resource Bengali
ABSA datasets and the high-resource English SemEval 2014 Task 4 dataset. The
CrosGrpsABS consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving notable
improvements, including a 0.93% F1-score increase for the Restaurant domain and
a 1.06% gain for the Laptop domain in the SemEval 2014 Task 4 benchmark.

Motivation: 现代大型语言模型（LLM）的高效训练依赖于有效的数据选择，但现有方法在计算成本和性能上存在不足。

Result: 在Tulu V2数据集上的实验表明，该方法性能优于或匹配现有技术，同时选择速度提升3.5倍。

Conclusion: Influence Distillation为LLM的高效数据选择提供了数学基础和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Effective data selection is critical for efficient training of modern Large
Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Influence Distillation, a novel,
mathematically-justified framework for data selection that employs second-order
information to optimally weight training samples. By distilling each sample's
influence on a target distribution, our method assigns model-specific weights
that are used to select training data for LLM fine-tuning, guiding it toward
strong performance on the target domain. We derive these optimal weights for
both Gradient Descent and Adam optimizers. To ensure scalability and reduce
computational cost, we propose a $\textit{landmark-based approximation}$:
influence is precisely computed for a small subset of "landmark" samples and
then efficiently propagated to all other samples to determine their weights. We
validate Influence Distillation by applying it to instruction tuning on the
Tulu V2 dataset, targeting a range of tasks including GSM8k, SQuAD, and MMLU,
across several models from the Llama and Qwen families. Experiments show that
Influence Distillation matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance
while achieving up to $3.5\times$ faster selection.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种防御方法，通过扩展拒绝数据集和改进模型生成拒绝的方式，有效抵御了针对大语言模型的ablation攻击，同时保持了模型的安全性和通用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）通过拒绝有害指令来遵守安全指南，但ablation攻击能够抑制模型的拒绝行为，导致生成不道德内容。

Method: 构建扩展拒绝数据集，包含有害提示及完整拒绝理由，并基于此微调Llama-2-7B-Chat和Qwen2.5-Instruct模型。

Result: 扩展拒绝模型在ablation攻击下拒绝率仅下降10%，而基线模型下降70-80%，同时保持通用性能。

Conclusion: 扩展拒绝微调能有效抵御ablation攻击，且不影响模型的安全性和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to comply with safety
guidelines by refusing harmful instructions. A recent attack, termed
abliteration, isolates and suppresses the single latent direction most
responsible for refusal behavior, enabling the model to generate unethical
content. We propose a defense that modifies how models generate refusals. We
construct an extended-refusal dataset that contains harmful prompts with a full
response that justifies the reason for refusal. We then fine-tune
Llama-2-7B-Chat and Qwen2.5-Instruct (1.5B and 3B parameters) on our
extended-refusal dataset, and evaluate the resulting systems on a set of
harmful prompts. In our experiments, extended-refusal models maintain high
refusal rates, dropping at most by 10%, whereas baseline models' refusal rates
drop by 70-80% after abliteration. A broad evaluation of safety and utility
shows that extended-refusal fine-tuning neutralizes the abliteration attack
while preserving general performance.

Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法依赖标记概率，导致输出长度偏差，即使长度归一化方法也无法完全消除。

Method: 提出UNCERTAINTY-LINE方法，通过回归不确定性分数与输出长度的关系，利用残差作为修正后的长度不变估计。

Result: 在机器翻译、摘要和问答任务中，UNCERTAINTY-LINE优于现有长度归一化方法。

Conclusion: UNCERTAINTY-LINE是一种后处理、模型无关的方法，能有效消除不确定性量化中的长度偏差。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools across various
applications, making it more important than ever to ensure the quality and the
trustworthiness of their outputs. This has led to growing interest in
uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for assessing the reliability of LLM
outputs. Many existing UQ techniques rely on token probabilities, which
inadvertently introduces a bias with respect to the length of the output. While
some methods attempt to account for this, we demonstrate that such biases
persist even in length-normalized approaches. To address the problem, here we
propose UNCERTAINTY-LINE: (Length-INvariant Estimation), a simple debiasing
procedure that regresses uncertainty scores on output length and uses the
residuals as corrected, length-invariant estimates. Our method is post-hoc,
model-agnostic, and applicable to a range of UQ measures. Through extensive
evaluation on machine translation, summarization, and question-answering tasks,
we demonstrate that UNCERTAINTY-LINE: consistently improves over even nominally
length-normalized UQ methods uncertainty estimates across multiple metrics and
models.

Motivation: 为了确保大型语言模型（LLM）的可靠部署，需要量化其生成内容的不确定性。现有方法在平衡指示性、平衡性和校准性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出CUE方法，使用与目标LLM性能对齐的数据训练轻量级模型，调整不确定性分数。

Result: 在多种模型和任务上的实验表明，CUE比现有方法提升了高达60%的准确性。

Conclusion: CUE是一种简单有效的方法，显著改进了LLM不确定性估计的准确性。

Abstract: To facilitate robust and trustworthy deployment of large language models
(LLMs), it is essential to quantify the reliability of their generations
through uncertainty estimation. While recent efforts have made significant
advancements by leveraging the internal logic and linguistic features of LLMs
to estimate uncertainty scores, our empirical analysis highlights the pitfalls
of these methods to strike a harmonized estimation between indication, balance,
and calibration, which hinders their broader capability for accurate
uncertainty estimation. To address this challenge, we propose CUE (Corrector
for Uncertainty Estimation): A straightforward yet effective method that
employs a lightweight model trained on data aligned with the target LLM's
performance to adjust uncertainty scores. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse models and tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, which achieves
consistent improvements of up to 60% over existing methods.

Result: VLMs在短文本图像上表现略有下降，但在长文本或多页内容上表现急剧下降；文本分辨率对性能影响不大。

Conclusion: VLMs在视觉呈现的复杂文本内容上的推理能力需改进，这对实际应用至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have greatly
enhanced their capability to jointly process text and images. However, despite
extensive benchmarks evaluating visual comprehension (e.g., diagrams, color
schemes, OCR tasks...), there is limited assessment of VLMs' ability to read
and reason about text-rich images effectively. To fill this gap, we introduce
ReadBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reading
comprehension capabilities of VLMs. ReadBench transposes contexts from
established text-only benchmarks into images of text while keeping textual
prompts and questions intact. Evaluating leading VLMs with ReadBench, we find
minimal-but-present performance degradation on short, text-image inputs, while
performance sharply declines for longer, multi-page contexts. Our experiments
further reveal that text resolution has negligible effects on multimodal
performance. These findings highlight needed improvements in VLMs, particularly
their reasoning over visually presented extensive textual content, a capability
critical for practical applications. ReadBench is available at

Motivation: 传统DPO依赖二元偏好优化，忽略了细粒度监督，导致次优解。

Method: 提出ASPO，动态计算句子级自适应奖励，无需额外模型或参数。

Result: 实验表明ASPO显著提升多模态模型性能。

Conclusion: ASPO通过细粒度优化有效改善模型对齐。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained significant attention for its
simplicity and computational efficiency in aligning large language models
(LLMs). Recent advancements have extended DPO to multimodal scenarios,
achieving strong performance. However, traditional DPO relies on binary
preference optimization, rewarding or penalizing entire responses without
considering fine-grained segment correctness, leading to suboptimal solutions.
The root of this issue lies in the absence of fine-grained supervision during
the optimization process. To address this, we propose Adaptive Sentence-level
Preference Optimization (ASPO), which evaluates individual sentences for more
precise preference optimization. By dynamically calculating adaptive rewards at
the sentence level based on model predictions, ASPO enhances response content
assessment without additional models or parameters. This significantly improves
the alignment of multimodal features. Extensive experiments show that ASPO
substantially enhances the overall performance of multimodal models.

Conclusion: WHISTRESS为句子重音检测提供了一种高效且无需对齐的解决方案。

Abstract: Spoken language conveys meaning not only through words but also through
intonation, emotion, and emphasis. Sentence stress, the emphasis placed on
specific words within a sentence, is crucial for conveying speaker intent and
has been extensively studied in linguistics. In this work, we introduce
WHISTRESS, an alignment-free approach for enhancing transcription systems with
sentence stress detection. To support this task, we propose TINYSTRESS-15K, a
scalable, synthetic training data for the task of sentence stress detection
which resulted from a fully automated dataset creation process. We train
WHISTRESS on TINYSTRESS-15K and evaluate it against several competitive
baselines. Our results show that WHISTRESS outperforms existing methods while
requiring no additional input priors during training or inference. Notably,
despite being trained on synthetic data, WHISTRESS demonstrates strong

Motivation: 当前研究仅关注单一场景（跨语言或跨模态），缺乏对联合场景的探索，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 引入CCHall基准，同时包含跨语言和跨模态幻觉场景，并对主流开源和闭源LLMs进行全面评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前LLMs在CCHall上表现不佳。

Conclusion: CCHall可作为评估LLMs在联合跨语言和跨模态场景中的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Investigating hallucination issues in large language models (LLMs) within
cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios can greatly advance the large-scale
deployment in real-world applications. Nevertheless, the current studies are
limited to a single scenario, either cross-lingual or cross-modal, leaving a
gap in the exploration of hallucinations in the joint cross-lingual and
cross-modal scenarios. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel joint
Cross-lingual and Cross-modal Hallucinations benchmark (CCHall) to fill this
gap. Specifically, CCHall simultaneously incorporates both cross-lingual and
cross-modal hallucination scenarios, which can be used to assess the
cross-lingual and cross-modal capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation on CCHall, exploring both mainstream open-source and
closed-source LLMs. The experimental results highlight that current LLMs still

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为SiGIR的自反馈迭代推理方法，通过自我评估指导多跳推理，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多跳推理任务中缺乏中间指导，导致推理错误，需要改进。

Method: 采用自反馈机制，通过端到端训练实现问题分解和中间步骤自我评估，选择最优推理路径。

Result: 在三个多跳推理数据集上表现优异，超越之前SOTA方法8.6%。

Conclusion: SiGIR方法有效解决了多跳推理中的问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities, they still face challenges in knowledge-intensive multi-hop
reasoning. Recent work explores iterative retrieval to address complex
problems. However, the lack of intermediate guidance often results in
inaccurate retrieval and flawed intermediate reasoning, leading to incorrect
reasoning. To address these, we propose Self-Critique Guided Iterative
Reasoning (SiGIR), which uses self-critique feedback to guide the iterative
reasoning process. Specifically, through end-to-end training, we enable the
model to iteratively address complex problems via question decomposition.
Additionally, the model is able to self-evaluate its intermediate reasoning
steps. During iterative reasoning, the model engages in branching exploration
and employs self-evaluation to guide the selection of promising reasoning
trajectories. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop reasoning datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing the previous
SOTA by $8.6\%$. Furthermore, our thorough analysis offers insights for future
research. Our code, data, and models are available at Github:

*Nahyun Lee,Yeongseo Woo,Hyunwoo Ko,Guijin Son*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型中的语言混淆问题，并提出了一种通过惩罚机制（ORPO）来减少混淆的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言混淆会严重影响低资源环境下的用户体验，而传统的监督微调方法未能有效解决这一问题。

Method: 通过观察预训练阶段的损失轨迹，发现模型难以区分单语和混淆文本；提出使用ORPO方法，在标准监督微调中加入对不期望输出风格的惩罚。

Result: ORPO能有效抑制语言混淆生成，即使在高解码温度下也不会降低模型整体性能。

Conclusion: 在低资源环境下，引入适当的惩罚机制可以显著减少语言混淆问题。

Abstract: Large language models often suffer from language confusion, a phenomenon
where responses are partially or entirely generated in unintended languages.
This can critically impact user experience in low-resource settings. We
hypothesize that conventional supervised fine-tuning exacerbates this issue
because the softmax objective focuses probability mass only on the single
correct token but does not explicitly penalize cross-lingual mixing.
Interestingly, by observing loss trajectories during the pretraining phase, we
observe that models fail to learn to distinguish between monolingual and
language-confused text. Additionally, we find that ORPO, which adds penalties
for unwanted output styles to standard SFT, effectively suppresses
language-confused generations even at high decoding temperatures without
degrading overall model performance. Our findings suggest that incorporating
appropriate penalty terms can mitigate language confusion in low-resource
settings with limited data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在全球敏感话题中的伦理偏见，假设这些偏见可能源于语言差异。

Method: 使用MSQAD数据集，收集多语言新闻文章生成敏感问题与回答，并通过统计假设测试分析偏见。

Result: 大多数情况下零假设被拒绝，表明跨语言差异导致偏见普遍存在，且不同LLMs间也存在类似问题。

Conclusion: 通过公开MSQAD数据集，促进未来关于LLMs跨语言偏见的研究。

Abstract: Despite the recent strides in large language models, studies have underscored
the existence of social biases within these systems. In this paper, we delve
into the validation and comparison of the ethical biases of LLMs concerning
globally discussed and potentially sensitive topics, hypothesizing that these
biases may arise from language-specific distinctions. Introducing the
Multilingual Sensitive Questions & Answers Dataset (MSQAD), we collected news
articles from Human Rights Watch covering 17 topics, and generated socially
sensitive questions along with corresponding responses in multiple languages.
We scrutinized the biases of these responses across languages and topics,
employing two statistical hypothesis tests. The results showed that the null
hypotheses were rejected in most cases, indicating biases arising from
cross-language differences. It demonstrates that ethical biases in responses
are widespread across various languages, and notably, these biases were
prevalent even among different LLMs. By making the proposed MSQAD openly
available, we aim to facilitate future research endeavors focused on examining
cross-language biases in LLMs and their variant models.

Conclusion: 研究为提升大型语言模型的多语言推理能力提供了新见解和实用策略。

Abstract: The advent of large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, has
significantly advanced complex reasoning tasks. However, their capabilities in
multilingual complex reasoning remain underexplored, with existing efforts
largely focused on simpler tasks like MGSM. To address this gap, we introduce
MMATH, a benchmark for multilingual complex reasoning spanning 374 high-quality
math problems across 10 typologically diverse languages. Using MMATH, we
observe that even advanced models like DeepSeek R1 exhibit substantial
performance disparities across languages and suffer from a critical off-target
issue-generating responses in unintended languages. To address this, we explore
strategies including prompting and training, demonstrating that reasoning in
English and answering in target languages can simultaneously enhance
performance and preserve target-language consistency. Our findings offer new
insights and practical strategies for advancing the multilingual reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Our code and data could be found at

<details>

Motivation: 现有多语言NER方法存在语言干扰问题，低资源语言性能受限，且专用模型缺乏可扩展性。

Result: 在PAN-X数据集上，平均F1值提升12.1%。

Conclusion: RetrieveAll有效解决了语言干扰问题，提升了多语言NER性能，且无需依赖外部资源。

Abstract: The rise of large language models has led to significant performance
breakthroughs in named entity recognition (NER) for high-resource languages,
yet there remains substantial room for improvement in low- and medium-resource
languages. Existing multilingual NER methods face severe language interference
during the multi-language adaptation process, manifested in feature conflicts
between different languages and the competitive suppression of low-resource
language features by high-resource languages. Although training a dedicated
model for each language can mitigate such interference, it lacks scalability
and incurs excessive computational costs in real-world applications. To address
this issue, we propose RetrieveAll, a universal multilingual NER framework
based on dynamic LoRA. The framework decouples task-specific features across
languages and demonstrates efficient dynamic adaptability. Furthermore, we
introduce a cross-granularity knowledge augmented method that fully exploits
the intrinsic potential of the data without relying on external resources. By
leveraging a hierarchical prompting mechanism to guide knowledge injection,
this approach advances the paradigm from "prompt-guided inference" to
"prompt-driven learning." Experimental results show that RetrieveAll
outperforms existing baselines; on the PAN-X dataset, it achieves an average F1
improvement of 12.1 percent.

Conclusion: 论文为AI效率提供了新视角，旨在推动创新以应对长上下文对AI发展的挑战。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs
(MLLMs) has historically relied on model-centric scaling through increasing
parameter counts from millions to hundreds of billions to drive performance
gains. However, as we approach hardware limits on model size, the dominant
computational bottleneck has fundamentally shifted to the quadratic cost of
self-attention over long token sequences, now driven by ultra-long text
contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper,
\textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient AI is shifting from
model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position token
compression as the new frontier, which improves AI efficiency via reducing the
number of tokens during model training or inference. Through comprehensive
analysis, we first examine recent developments in long-context AI across
various domains and establish a unified mathematical framework for existing
model efficiency strategies, demonstrating why token compression represents a
crucial paradigm shift in addressing long-context overhead. Subsequently, we
systematically review the research landscape of token compression, analyzing
its fundamental benefits and identifying its compelling advantages across
diverse scenarios. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of current
challenges in token compression research and outline promising future
directions. Ultimately, our work aims to offer a fresh perspective on AI
efficiency, synthesize existing research, and catalyze innovative developments
to address the challenges that increasing context lengths pose to the AI
community's advancement.

Motivation: LLM作为评估工具存在教师偏好偏差问题，影响评估的公正性。

Method: 提出AGDe-Judge框架，结合辅助模型和三阶段去偏方法。

Result: 在六个评估基准上有效减少偏差且性能稳定。

Conclusion: AGDe-Judge为解决教师偏好偏差提供了有效方案。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge employs large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to
evaluate the quality of LLM-generated responses, gaining popularity for its
cost-effectiveness and strong alignment with human evaluations. However,
training proxy judge models using evaluation data generated by powerful teacher
models introduces a critical yet previously overlooked issue: teacher
preference bias, where the proxy judge model learns a biased preference for
responses from the teacher model. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
setting that incorporates an additional assistant model, which is not biased
toward the teacher model's responses, to complement the training data. Building
on this setup, we introduce AGDe-Judge, a three-stage framework designed to
debias from both the labels and feedbacks in the training data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AGDe-Judge effectively reduces teacher preference
bias while maintaining strong performance across six evaluation benchmarks.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在动态、对抗性辩论中的信心校准能力，揭示其在多轮任务中的自我评估缺陷。

Method: 组织60场三轮政策辩论，十种先进LLMs参与，每轮后模型私下评估获胜信心（0-100）。

Result: 观察到五种问题模式，包括系统性过度自信、信心升级、相互高估等。

Conclusion: LLMs在动态任务中缺乏准确自我评估或更新信念的能力，对其在助理或代理角色中的应用构成重大隐患。

Abstract: Can LLMs accurately adjust their confidence when facing opposition? Building
on previous studies measuring calibration on static fact-based
question-answering tasks, we evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in a
dynamic, adversarial debate setting, uniquely combining two realistic factors:
(a) a multi-turn format requiring models to update beliefs as new information
emerges, and (b) a zero-sum structure to control for task-related uncertainty,
since mutual high-confidence claims imply systematic overconfidence. We
organized 60 three-round policy debates among ten state-of-the-art LLMs, with
models privately rating their confidence (0-100) in winning after each round.
We observed five concerning patterns: (1) Systematic overconfidence: models
began debates with average initial confidence of 72.9% vs. a rational 50%
baseline. (2) Confidence escalation: rather than reducing confidence as debates
progressed, debaters increased their win probabilities, averaging 83% by the
final round. (3) Mutual overestimation: in 61.7% of debates, both sides
simultaneously claimed >=75% probability of victory, a logical impossibility.
(4) Persistent self-debate bias: models debating identical copies increased
confidence from 64.1% to 75.2%; even when explicitly informed their chance of
winning was exactly 50%, confidence still rose (from 50.0% to 57.1%). (5)
Misaligned private reasoning: models' private scratchpad thoughts sometimes
differed from their public confidence ratings, raising concerns about
faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning. These results suggest LLMs lack the
ability to accurately self-assess or update their beliefs in dynamic,
multi-turn tasks; a major concern as LLM outputs are deployed without careful
review in assistant roles or agentic settings.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型的推理链中存在冗余功能步骤，增加了计算负担，需优化以提高效率和准确性。

Method: 提出PIR框架，基于困惑度评估推理步骤重要性，选择性修剪低重要性功能步骤，保留核心推理路径。

Result: 优化后的模型在多个推理基准测试中准确性提升（+0.9%至+6.6%），同时减少token使用（-3%至-41%）。

Conclusion: PIR框架在保持核心推理能力的同时，显著提升了模型的计算效率和推理性能，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities through test-time scaling approaches, particularly when fine-tuned
with chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from more powerful large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, these reasoning chains often contain verbose elements
that mirror human problem-solving, categorized as progressive reasoning (the
essential solution development path) and functional elements (verification
processes, alternative solution approaches, and error corrections). While
progressive reasoning is crucial, the functional elements significantly
increase computational demands during test-time inference. We introduce PIR
(Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that
quantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its
impact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and
selectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving
progressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that
maintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity.
Models fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling
properties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved
accuracy (+0.9\% to +6.6\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\% to
-41\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond).
Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes,
data sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying
reasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response
time, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.

Conclusion: 论文为政治领域的不一致性检测提供了资源，展示了LLMs的潜力，同时指出细粒度识别仍需改进。

Abstract: Inconsistent political statements represent a form of misinformation. They
erode public trust and pose challenges to accountability, when left unnoticed.
Detecting inconsistencies automatically could support journalists in asking
clarification questions, thereby helping to keep politicians accountable. We
propose the Inconsistency detection task and develop a scale of inconsistency
types to prompt NLP-research in this direction. To provide a resource for
detecting inconsistencies in a political domain, we present a dataset of 698
human-annotated pairs of political statements with explanations of the
annotators' reasoning for 237 samples. The statements mainly come from voting
assistant platforms such as Wahl-O-Mat in Germany and Smartvote in Switzerland,
reflecting real-world political issues. We benchmark Large Language Models
(LLMs) on our dataset and show that in general, they are as good as humans at
detecting inconsistencies, and might be even better than individual humans at
predicting the crowd-annotated ground-truth. However, when it comes to
identifying fine-grained inconsistency types, none of the model have reached
the upper bound of performance (due to natural labeling variation), thus
leaving room for improvement. We make our dataset and code publicly available.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a powerful method for accelerating
autoregressive generation in large language models (LLMs), yet its integration
into vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. We introduce DREAM, a
novel speculative decoding framework tailored for VLMs that combines three key
innovations: (1) a cross-attention-based mechanism to inject intermediate
features from the target model into the draft model for improved alignment, (2)
adaptive intermediate feature selection based on attention entropy to guide
efficient draft model training, and (3) visual token compression to reduce
draft model latency. DREAM enables efficient, accurate, and parallel multimodal
decoding with significant throughput improvement. Experiments across a diverse
set of recent popular VLMs, including LLaVA, Pixtral, SmolVLM and Gemma3,
demonstrate up to 3.6x speedup over conventional decoding and significantly
outperform prior SD baselines in both inference throughput and speculative
draft acceptance length across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. The code

Result: SpeakStream在保持非流式TTS质量的同时，实现了最低的首令牌延迟。

Conclusion: SpeakStream适用于流式对话AI，显著提升了响应速度。

Abstract: The latency bottleneck of traditional text-to-speech (TTS) systems
fundamentally hinders the potential of streaming large language models (LLMs)
in conversational AI. These TTS systems, typically trained and inferenced on
complete utterances, introduce unacceptable delays, even with optimized
inference speeds, when coupled with streaming LLM outputs. This is particularly
problematic for creating responsive conversational agents where low first-token
latency is critical. In this paper, we present SpeakStream, a streaming TTS
system that generates audio incrementally from streaming text using a
decoder-only architecture. SpeakStream is trained using a next-step prediction
loss on interleaved text-speech data. During inference, it generates speech
incrementally while absorbing streaming input text, making it particularly
suitable for cascaded conversational AI agents where an LLM streams text to a
TTS system. Our experiments demonstrate that SpeakStream achieves
state-of-the-art latency results in terms of first-token latency while
maintaining the quality of non-streaming TTS systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating scientific
hypothesis generation, yet existing approaches primarily yield coarse-grained
hypotheses lacking critical methodological and experimental details. We
introduce and formally define the novel task of fine-grained scientific
hypothesis discovery, which entails generating detailed, experimentally
actionable hypotheses from coarse initial research directions. We frame this as
a combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs'
capacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four
foundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to
formulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most
promising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own
internal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis
space; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment
with ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an
ensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than
defining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4)
whether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape
than a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search
method that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis,
progressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We
show that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables
more effective optimization. Empirical evaluations on a new benchmark of
expert-annotated fine-grained hypotheses from recent chemistry literature show
that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Result: 模型在道德行为倾向和一致性上存在显著差异，无模型在所有情境中表现一致道德。

Conclusion: LLMs在道德与利益冲突时行为不可靠，需谨慎用于代理角色。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use in
complex agentic roles, involving decision-making with humans or other agents,
making ethical alignment a key AI safety concern. While prior work has examined
both LLMs' moral judgment and strategic behavior in social dilemmas, there is
limited understanding of how they act when moral imperatives directly conflict
with rewards or incentives. To investigate this, we introduce Moral Behavior in
Social Dilemma Simulation (MoralSim) and evaluate how LLMs behave in the
prisoner's dilemma and public goods game with morally charged contexts. In
MoralSim, we test a range of frontier models across both game structures and
three distinct moral framings, enabling a systematic examination of how LLMs
navigate social dilemmas in which ethical norms conflict with payoff-maximizing
strategies. Our results show substantial variation across models in both their
general tendency to act morally and the consistency of their behavior across
game types, the specific moral framing, and situational factors such as
opponent behavior and survival risks. Crucially, no model exhibits consistently
moral behavior in MoralSim, highlighting the need for caution when deploying
LLMs in agentic roles where the agent's "self-interest" may conflict with
ethical expectations. Our code is available at

TLDR: DIET框架通过动态调整token压缩策略，优化性能与效率的平衡，显著减少token数量并提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型因过度思考导致响应过长、效率低下的问题。

Method: 引入DIET框架，结合任务难度动态调整token惩罚强度和目标长度，并提出Advantage Weighting技术。

Result: DIET显著减少token数量，同时提升推理性能，并实现更好的推理扩展性和合理的响应长度分配。

Conclusion: DIET为开发更高效、实用和高性能的大语言模型提供了理论基础和有效框架。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning but often
over-think, generating excessively long responses that hinder efficiency. We
introduce DIET ( DIfficulty-AwarE Training), a framework that systematically
cuts these "token calories" by integrating on-the-fly problem difficulty into
the reinforcement learning (RL) process. DIET dynamically adapts token
compression strategies by modulating token penalty strength and conditioning
target lengths on estimated task difficulty, to optimize the
performance-efficiency trade-off. We also theoretically analyze the pitfalls of
naive reward weighting in group-normalized RL algorithms like GRPO, and propose
Advantage Weighting technique, which enables stable and effective
implementation of these difficulty-aware objectives. Experimental results
demonstrate that DIET significantly reduces token counts while simultaneously
improving reasoning performance. Beyond raw token reduction, we show two
crucial benefits largely overlooked by prior work: (1) DIET leads to superior
inference scaling. By maintaining high per-sample quality with fewer tokens, it
enables better scaling performance via majority voting with more samples under
fixed computational budgets, an area where other methods falter. (2) DIET
enhances the natural positive correlation between response length and problem
difficulty, ensuring verbosity is appropriately allocated, unlike many existing
compression methods that disrupt this relationship. Our analyses provide a
principled and effective framework for developing more efficient, practical,
and high-performing LLMs.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于成对比较的文本创造力评估框架CrEval，利用CreataSet数据集（包含人类和合成数据）训练，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有创造力评估依赖低效且昂贵的人工判断，自动化方法缺乏通用性或与人类判断的一致性。

Method: 提出成对比较框架，利用CreataSet数据集（人类和合成数据）训练LLM评估器CrEval。

Result: CrEval在人类判断一致性上显著优于现有方法，展示了人类与合成数据结合的重要性。

Conclusion: CrEval能有效提升LLM创造力，将公开数据、代码和模型以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Creativity evaluation remains a challenging frontier for large language
models (LLMs). Current evaluations heavily rely on inefficient and costly human
judgments, hindering progress in enhancing machine creativity. While automated
methods exist, ranging from psychological testing to heuristic- or
prompting-based approaches, they often lack generalizability or alignment with
human judgment. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel
pairwise-comparison framework for assessing textual creativity, leveraging
shared contextual instructions to improve evaluation consistency. We introduce
CreataSet, a large-scale dataset with 100K+ human-level and 1M+ synthetic
creative instruction-response pairs spanning diverse open-domain tasks. Through
training on CreataSet, we develop an LLM-based evaluator named CrEval. CrEval
demonstrates remarkable superiority over existing methods in alignment with
human judgments. Experimental results underscore the indispensable significance
of integrating both human-generated and synthetic data in training highly
robust evaluators, and showcase the practical utility of CrEval in boosting the
creativity of LLMs. We will release all data, code, and models publicly soon to
support further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该论文通过数据驱动的方法，对2022至2024年关于大语言模型（LLM）局限性的研究进行了半自动化综述，发现相关研究快速增长，推理是最受关注的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型研究的快速发展，对其局限性（如推理失败、幻觉和多语言能力有限）的关注日益增加，需要系统性的综述。

Method: 采用自下而上的方法，通过对25万篇ACL和arXiv论文进行关键词过滤、LLM分类、专家验证和主题聚类（使用HDBSCAN+BERTopic和LlooM两种方法），筛选出14,648篇相关论文。

Result: 研究发现，LLM相关研究在ACL和arXiv中分别增长五倍和四倍；推理是最受关注的局限性，其次是泛化、幻觉、偏见和安全性；arXiv的研究主题逐渐转向安全性和可控性。

Conclusion: 论文发布了一个标注摘要的数据集和验证方法，为LLM局限性研究提供了量化视角。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) research has grown rapidly, along with increasing
concern about their limitations such as failures in reasoning, hallucinations,
and limited multilingual capability. In this survey, we conduct a data-driven,
semi-automated review of research on limitations of LLM (LLLMs) from 2022 to
2024 using a bottom-up approach. From a corpus of 250,000 ACL and arXiv papers,
we identify 14,648 relevant papers using keyword filtering, LLM-based
classification, validated against expert labels, and topic clustering (via two
approaches, HDBSCAN+BERTopic and LlooM). We find that LLM-related research
increases over fivefold in ACL and fourfold in arXiv. Since 2022, LLLMs
research grows even faster, reaching over 30% of LLM papers by late 2024.
Reasoning remains the most studied limitation, followed by generalization,
hallucination, bias, and security. The distribution of topics in the ACL
dataset stays relatively stable over time, while arXiv shifts toward safety and
controllability (with topics like security risks, alignment, hallucinations,
knowledge editing), and multimodality between 2022 and 2024. We release a
dataset of annotated abstracts and a validated methodology, and offer a
quantitative view of trends in LLM limitations research.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为PATS的动态推理策略，通过过程级自适应思维模式切换，优化LLMs在准确性和计算效率之间的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs采用固定推理策略，忽视了任务和推理过程复杂度的变化，导致性能与效率失衡。

Method: 结合过程奖励模型（PRMs）与束搜索，引入渐进式模式切换和错误步骤惩罚机制。

Result: 在多样化数学基准测试中，该方法实现了高准确性并保持适中的计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: 研究强调了过程级、难度感知的推理策略调整的重要性，为LLMs高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current large-language models (LLMs) typically adopt a fixed reasoning
strategy, either simple or complex, for all questions, regardless of their
difficulty. This neglect of variation in task and reasoning process complexity
leads to an imbalance between performance and efficiency. Existing methods
attempt to implement training-free fast-slow thinking system switching to
handle problems of varying difficulty, but are limited by coarse-grained
solution-level strategy adjustments. To address this issue, we propose a novel
reasoning paradigm: Process-Level Adaptive Thinking Mode Switching (PATS),
which enables LLMs to dynamically adjust their reasoning strategy based on the
difficulty of each step, optimizing the balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency. Our approach integrates Process Reward Models (PRMs)
with Beam Search, incorporating progressive mode switching and bad-step penalty
mechanisms. Experiments on diverse mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our
methodology achieves high accuracy while maintaining moderate token usage. This
study emphasizes the significance of process-level, difficulty-aware reasoning
strategy adaptation, offering valuable insights into efficient inference for
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究较少关注LLMs中知识的结构模式，因此论文从图的角度探索这些模式，填补这一空白。

Method: 从三元组和实体层面量化LLMs的知识，分析其与图结构属性（如节点度）的关系，并开发图机器学习模型估计实体知识。

Result: 发现知识同质性现象，即拓扑相近的实体具有相似的知识水平。通过选择LLMs不太熟悉的三元组进行微调，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了LLMs中知识的结构模式，并提出了基于图的方法来优化知识访问和编辑，为LLMs的知识管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models have been extensively studied as neural knowledge bases
for their knowledge access, editability, reasoning, and explainability.
However, few works focus on the structural patterns of their knowledge.
Motivated by this gap, we investigate these structural patterns from a graph
perspective. We quantify the knowledge of LLMs at both the triplet and entity
levels, and analyze how it relates to graph structural properties such as node
degree. Furthermore, we uncover the knowledge homophily, where topologically
close entities exhibit similar levels of knowledgeability, which further
motivates us to develop graph machine learning models to estimate entity
knowledge based on its local neighbors. This model further enables valuable
knowledge checking by selecting triplets less known to LLMs. Empirical results
show that using selected triplets for fine-tuning leads to superior
performance.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种长度可控的长上下文基准测试和新指标，解决了现有长上下文评估基准的两大问题：无法区分长上下文性能和模型基线能力，以及输入长度固定的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文评估基准存在两大问题：无法清晰区分长上下文性能与模型基线能力，且输入长度固定限制了适用性。

Method: 引入长度可控的长上下文基准测试和新指标，分离基线知识和真实长上下文能力。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效评估LLMs。

Conclusion: 新方法在评估LLMs的长上下文能力方面具有优越性。

Abstract: Long-context capability is considered one of the most important abilities of
LLMs, as a truly long context-capable LLM enables users to effortlessly process
many originally exhausting tasks -- e.g., digesting a long-form document to
find answers vs. directly asking an LLM about it. However, existing
real-task-based long-context evaluation benchmarks have two major shortcomings.
First, benchmarks like LongBench often do not provide proper metrics to
separate long-context performance from the model's baseline ability, making
cross-model comparison unclear. Second, such benchmarks are usually constructed
with fixed input lengths, which limits their applicability across different
models and fails to reveal when a model begins to break down. To address these
issues, we introduce a length-controllable long-context benchmark and a novel
metric that disentangles baseline knowledge from true long-context
capabilities. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in
effectively evaluating LLMs.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种衡量预测与解释一致性的方法（PEX），发现62%的大语言模型生成的解释缺乏一致性，并通过直接偏好优化显著提高了解释的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI高风险决策中，确保自由文本解释的忠实性至关重要，但生成和评估此类解释具有挑战性。

Method: 通过扩展证据权重的概念，提出PEX一致性度量，量化解释对预测的支持或反对程度。

Result: 62%的大语言模型生成的解释缺乏一致性；直接偏好优化使一致性提升43.1%至292.3%，解释忠实性提升9.7%。

Conclusion: 优化PEX一致性可显著提高解释的忠实性，为高透明度AI决策提供支持。

Abstract: Faithful free-text explanations are important to ensure transparency in
high-stakes AI decision-making contexts, but they are challenging to generate
by language models and assess by humans. In this paper, we present a measure
for Prediction-EXplanation (PEX) consistency, by extending the concept of
weight of evidence. This measure quantifies how much a free-text explanation
supports or opposes a prediction, serving as an important aspect of explanation
faithfulness. Our analysis reveals that more than 62% explanations generated by
large language models lack this consistency. We show that applying direct
preference optimization improves the consistency of generated explanations
across three model families, with improvement ranging from 43.1% to 292.3%.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizing this consistency measure can
improve explanation faithfulness by up to 9.7%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的推理能力受限于内部参数空间，无法实时获取外部信息或理解物理世界。

Method: 提出SituatedThinker框架，利用强化学习激励模型结合内部知识和外部信息进行推理。

Result: 在多跳问答和数学推理任务上表现显著提升，并在未见任务（如KBQA、TableQA）中展示泛化能力。

Conclusion: SituatedThinker有效扩展了LLMs的现实世界推理能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate their impressive
reasoning capabilities. However, the reasoning confined to internal parametric
space limits LLMs' access to real-time information and understanding of the
physical world. To overcome this constraint, we introduce SituatedThinker, a
novel framework that enables LLMs to ground their reasoning in real-world
contexts through situated thinking, which adaptively combines both internal
knowledge and external information with predefined interfaces. By utilizing
reinforcement learning, SituatedThinker incentivizes deliberate reasoning with
the real world to acquire information and feedback, allowing LLMs to surpass
their knowledge boundaries and enhance reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate significant performance improvements on multi-hop
question-answering and mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore,
SituatedThinker demonstrates strong performance on unseen tasks, such as KBQA,
TableQA, and text-based games, showcasing the generalizable real-world grounded
reasoning capability. Our codes are available at

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为PatentScore的多维度评估框架，用于评估LLM生成的专利权利要求，解决了现有NLG指标在专利文档结构和法律特性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自然语言生成（NLG）指标不适用于专利文档的结构和法律特性，且对LLM生成专利的评估研究有限，尤其是专利权利要求的质量评估。

Method: 提出PatentScore框架，包括层次化权利要求分析、基于法律和技术标准的领域特定验证模式，以及结构、语义和法律维度的评分。

Result: 在400个GPT-4o-mini生成的Claim 1上评估，Pearson相关系数r=0.819，优于现有NLG指标，并在其他模型（如Claude-3.5-Haiku和Gemini-1.5-flash）上验证了框架的鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: PatentScore能够有效评估LLM生成的专利权利要求，填补了现有NLG指标的不足，为专利生成提供了更准确的评估工具。

Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) metrics play a central role in evaluating
generated texts, but are not well suited for the structural and legal
characteristics of patent documents. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong
potential in automating patent generation, yet research on evaluating
LLM-generated patents remains limited, especially in evaluating the generation
quality of patent claims, which are central to defining the scope of
protection. Effective claim evaluation requires addressing legal validity,
technical accuracy, and structural compliance. To address this gap, we
introduce PatentScore, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing
LLM-generated patent claims. PatentScore incorporates: (1) hierarchical
decomposition for claim analysis; (2) domain-specific validation patterns based
on legal and technical standards; and (3) scoring across structural, semantic,
and legal dimensions. Unlike general-purpose NLG metrics, PatentScore reflects
patent-specific constraints and document structures, enabling evaluation beyond
surface similarity. We evaluate 400 GPT-4o-mini generated Claim 1s and report a
Pearson correlation of $r = 0.819$ with expert annotations, outperforming
existing NLG metrics. Furthermore, we conduct additional evaluations using open
models such as Claude-3.5-Haiku and Gemini-1.5-flash, all of which show strong
correlations with expert judgments, confirming the robustness and
generalizability of our framework.

TLDR: GC-KBVQA是一个四阶段框架，利用LLMs进行零样本VQA任务，无需端到端多模态训练，显著提升KB-VQA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KB-VQA方法依赖显式知识库或LLMs，但辅助文本可能无关或误导答案预测。

Method: 通过问题感知的标题生成和外部知识结合，创建信息丰富的提示，供LLM使用。

Result: GC-KBVQA在多种VQA任务中表现优异，无需任务特定微调。

Conclusion: GC-KBVQA降低了成本和部署复杂度，性能显著优于现有KB-VQA方法。

Abstract: Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) methods focus on tasks
that demand reasoning with information extending beyond the explicit content
depicted in the image. Early methods relied on explicit knowledge bases to
provide this auxiliary information. Recent approaches leverage Large Language
Models (LLMs) as implicit knowledge sources. While KB-VQA methods have
demonstrated promising results, their potential remains constrained as the
auxiliary text provided may not be relevant to the question context, and may
also include irrelevant information that could misguide the answer predictor.
We introduce a novel four-stage framework called Grounding Caption-Guided
Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (GC-KBVQA), which enables LLMs to
effectively perform zero-shot VQA tasks without the need for end-to-end
multimodal training. Innovations include grounding question-aware caption
generation to move beyond generic descriptions and have compact, yet detailed
and context-rich information. This is combined with knowledge from external
sources to create highly informative prompts for the LLM. GC-KBVQA can address
a variety of VQA tasks, and does not require task-specific fine-tuning, thus
reducing both costs and deployment complexity by leveraging general-purpose,
pre-trained LLMs. Comparison with competing KB-VQA methods shows significantly
improved performance. Our code will be made public.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的联合处理-结果框架，利用现有序列模型同时适应政策时间和参与效果，以区分社交媒体中的因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解社交媒体中的真实影响力需要区分相关性和因果关系，尤其是在分析错误信息传播时。现有方法通常无法捕捉外部时间信号触发参与的因果机制。

Method: 引入了一种新的联合处理-结果框架，结合因果推断技术（如ATE估计）来适应社交媒体交互的序列性，并解决外部混杂信号的挑战。

Result: 在真实世界错误信息数据集上的实验表明，该模型在预测参与度方面比现有基准高出15-22%，且因果效应测量与专家经验影响力标准高度一致。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了社交媒体中因果关系的识别问题，为影响力估计提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Understanding true influence in social media requires distinguishing
correlation from causation--particularly when analyzing misinformation spread.
While existing approaches focus on exposure metrics and network structures,
they often fail to capture the causal mechanisms by which external temporal
signals trigger engagement. We introduce a novel joint treatment-outcome
framework that leverages existing sequential models to simultaneously adapt to
both policy timing and engagement effects. Our approach adapts causal inference
techniques from healthcare to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATE) within
the sequential nature of social media interactions, tackling challenges from
external confounding signals. Through our experiments on real-world
misinformation and disinformation datasets, we show that our models outperform
existing benchmarks by 15--22% in predicting engagement across diverse
counterfactual scenarios, including exposure adjustment, timing shifts, and
varied intervention durations. Case studies on 492 social media users show our
causal effect measure aligns strongly with the gold standard in influence
estimation, the expert-based empirical influence.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
advanced tasks like chart understanding. However, these models often suffer
from hallucinations, where generated text sequences conflict with the provided
visual data. To address this, we introduce Post-Hoc Visual Attribution for
Charts, which identifies fine-grained chart elements that validate a given
chart-associated response. We propose ChartLens, a novel chart attribution
algorithm that uses segmentation-based techniques to identify chart objects and
employs set-of-marks prompting with MLLMs for fine-grained visual attribution.
Additionally, we present ChartVA-Eval, a benchmark with synthetic and
real-world charts from diverse domains like finance, policy, and economics,
featuring fine-grained attribution annotations. Our evaluations show that
ChartLens improves fine-grained attributions by 26-66%.

Motivation: 理解人们如何选择性地将信念归因于他人，以解释其行为。

Method: 开发一个计算模型，量化信念的解释强度（准确性、信息量、因果相关性），并通过实验让参与者对描述信念的陈述进行排序。

Result: 准确性和信息量结合时能较好预测排序，但因果相关性是解释参与者反应的最佳单一因素。

Conclusion: 因果相关性在人们选择性地归因信念时起关键作用。

Abstract: A key feature of human theory-of-mind is the ability to attribute beliefs to
other agents as mentalistic explanations for their behavior. But given the wide
variety of beliefs that agents may hold about the world and the rich language
we can use to express them, which specific beliefs are people inclined to
attribute to others? In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that people
prefer to attribute beliefs that are good explanations for the behavior they
observe. We develop a computational model that quantifies the explanatory
strength of a (natural language) statement about an agent's beliefs via three
factors: accuracy, informativity, and causal relevance to actions, each of
which can be computed from a probabilistic generative model of belief-driven
behavior. Using this model, we study the role of each factor in how people
selectively attribute beliefs to other agents. We investigate this via an
experiment where participants watch an agent collect keys hidden in boxes in
order to reach a goal, then rank a set of statements describing the agent's
beliefs about the boxes' contents. We find that accuracy and informativity
perform reasonably well at predicting these rankings when combined, but that
causal relevance is the single factor that best explains participants'
responses.

TLDR: GSA-TTS是一种渐进式风格适配器TTS，通过新颖的风格编码器从声学参考中逐步编码说话风格，用于零样本语音合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本语音合成中风格表示的鲁棒性和丰富性问题。

Method: GSA首先捕捉每个语义声音单元的局部风格，然后通过自注意力结合局部风格以获得全局风格条件。

Result: 在未见过的说话者上测试，GSA-TTS在自然度、说话者相似性和清晰度方面表现优异。

Conclusion: GSA的分层结构在可解释性和可控性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We present the gradual style adaptor TTS (GSA-TTS) with a novel style encoder
that gradually encodes speaking styles from an acoustic reference for zero-shot
speech synthesis. GSA first captures the local style of each semantic sound
unit. Then the local styles are combined by self-attention to obtain a global
style condition. This semantic and hierarchical encoding strategy provides a
robust and rich style representation for an acoustic model. We test GSA-TTS on
unseen speakers and obtain promising results regarding naturalness, speaker
similarity, and intelligibility. Additionally, we explore the potential of GSA
in terms of interpretability and controllability, which stems from its
hierarchical structure.

Conclusion: LLM评分方法有效，但需结合其他方法避免偏差。

Abstract: Code documentation is useful, but writing it is time-consuming. Different
techniques for generating code summaries have emerged, but comparing them is
difficult because human evaluation is expensive and automatic metrics are
unreliable. In this paper, we introduce a simple new baseline in which we ask
an LLM to give an overall score to a summary. Unlike n-gram and embedding-based
baselines, our approach is able to consider the code when giving a score. This
allows us to also make a variant that does not consider the reference summary
at all, which could be used for other tasks, e.g., to evaluate the quality of
documentation in code bases. We find that our method is as good or better than
prior metrics, though we recommend using it in conjunction with embedding-based
methods to avoid the risk of LLM-specific bias.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为SRP的框架，通过结合大语言模型和知识图谱，通过迭代的参考引导推理解决推理路径不完整或不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理时容易产生幻觉，而现有结合知识图谱的方法生成的推理路径往往不完整或不一致。

Method: SRP框架通过搜索参考信息指导规划和反思，生成推理路径并迭代调整，直到正确检索答案。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，SRP超越了多种强基线，展示了其可靠的推理能力。

Conclusion: SRP框架通过迭代反思和知识图谱的结合，显著提升了推理的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in natural language processing tasks, yet they remain prone to
hallucinations when reasoning with insufficient internal knowledge. While
integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) provides access to structured,
verifiable information, existing approaches often generate incomplete or
factually inconsistent reasoning paths. To this end, we propose Self-Reflective
Planning (SRP), a framework that synergizes LLMs with KGs through iterative,
reference-guided reasoning. Specifically, given a question and topic entities,
SRP first searches for references to guide planning and reflection. In the
planning process, it checks initial relations and generates a reasoning path.
After retrieving knowledge from KGs through a reasoning path, it implements
iterative reflection by judging the retrieval result and editing the reasoning
path until the answer is correctly retrieved. Extensive experiments on three
public datasets demonstrate that SRP surpasses various strong baselines and
further underscore its reliable reasoning ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注示例相似性，而多样性选择的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过实验和理论框架，分析多样性选择在多种任务（如情感分类、数学和代码问题）中的作用。

Result: 多样性选择方法显著提升了复杂任务表现，并增强了对分布外查询的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多样性是示例选择的关键因素，尤其在复杂任务中表现突出。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a crucial capability of current large language
models (LLMs), where the selection of examples plays a key role in performance.
While most existing approaches focus on selecting the most similar examples to
the query, the impact of diversity in example selection remains underexplored.
We systematically investigate the role of diversity in in-context example
selection through experiments across a range of tasks, from sentiment
classification to more challenging math and code problems. Experiments on
Llama-3.1, Gemma-2, and Mistral-v0.3 families of models show that
diversity-aware selection methods improve performance, particularly on complex
tasks like math and code, and enhance robustness to out-of-distribution
queries. To support these findings, we introduce a theoretical framework that
explains the benefits of incorporating diversity in in-context example
selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态协作任务中因稀疏和偏斜信号导致的偏好对齐问题。

Method: 提出FAAF框架，包含摩擦状态策略和干预策略，通过监督损失训练单一策略。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优异，支持OOD泛化，生成简洁可解释的摩擦。

Conclusion: FAAF使LLM成为适应性“思维伙伴”，推动动态人机协作的可扩展性。

Abstract: AI support of collaborative interactions entails mediating potential
misalignment between interlocutor beliefs. Common preference alignment methods
like DPO excel in static settings, but struggle in dynamic collaborative tasks
where the explicit signals of interlocutor beliefs are sparse and skewed. We
propose the Frictional Agent Alignment Framework (FAAF), to generate precise,
context-aware "friction" that prompts for deliberation and re-examination of
existing evidence. FAAF's two-player objective decouples from data skew: a
frictive-state policy identifies belief misalignments, while an intervention
policy crafts collaborator-preferred responses. We derive an analytical
solution to this objective, enabling training a single policy via a simple
supervised loss. Experiments on three benchmarks show FAAF outperforms
competitors in producing concise, interpretable friction and in OOD
generalization. By aligning LLMs to act as adaptive "thought partners" -- not
passive responders -- FAAF advances scalable, dynamic human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 播客内容庞大且无结构化，自动高亮检测有助于用户快速了解内容。

Method: 使用Rhapsody数据集，将高亮检测作为片段级二分类任务，测试了零样本语言模型和微调模型。

Result: 微调模型显著优于零样本方法，结合语音和文本特征效果最佳。

Conclusion: 长形式语音媒体的细粒度信息访问仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Podcasts have become daily companions for half a billion users. Given the
enormous amount of podcast content available, highlights provide a valuable
signal that helps viewers get the gist of an episode and decide if they want to
invest in listening to it in its entirety. However, identifying highlights
automatically is challenging due to the unstructured and long-form nature of
the content. We introduce Rhapsody, a dataset of 13K podcast episodes paired
with segment-level highlight scores derived from YouTube's 'most replayed'
feature. We frame the podcast highlight detection as a segment-level binary
classification task. We explore various baseline approaches, including
zero-shot prompting of language models and lightweight finetuned language
models using segment-level classification heads. Our experimental results
indicate that even state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4o and Gemini
struggle with this task, while models finetuned with in-domain data
significantly outperform their zero-shot performance. The finetuned model
benefits from leveraging both speech signal features and transcripts. These
findings highlight the challenges for fine-grained information access in
long-form spoken media.

Method: 通过构建Fin-Force基准，利用金融新闻标题和结构化评估，支持LLM生成前向反事实推理。

Result: 实验评估了当前先进的LLMs和反事实生成方法，分析了其局限性并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: Fin-Force为自动化探索和预测金融市场发展提供了结构化工具，为决策支持开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning typically involves considering alternatives to
actual events. While often applied to understand past events, a distinct
form-forward counterfactual reasoning-focuses on anticipating plausible future
developments. This type of reasoning is invaluable in dynamic financial
markets, where anticipating market developments can powerfully unveil potential
risks and opportunities for stakeholders, guiding their decision-making.
However, performing this at scale is challenging due to the cognitive demands
involved, underscoring the need for automated solutions. Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer promise, but remain unexplored for this application. To address
this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark, Fin-Force-FINancial FORward
Counterfactual Evaluation. By curating financial news headlines and providing
structured evaluation, Fin-Force supports LLM based forward counterfactual
generation. This paves the way for scalable and automated solutions for
exploring and anticipating future market developments, thereby providing
structured insights for decision-making. Through experiments on Fin-Force, we
evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and counterfactual generation methods, analyzing
their limitations and proposing insights for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在复杂推理任务中因测试时扩展导致的‘过度思考’和高计算成本问题。

Method: RTR框架学习专家模型和推理策略的压缩表示，动态选择以适应任务难度和预算限制。

Result: 在七种开源模型和四种推理策略上，RTR比最佳单一模型更准确，同时减少60%以上的token使用。

Conclusion: RTR是一种低成本、高灵活性的统一路由框架，实现了准确性和计算效率的最佳平衡。

Abstract: The inherent capabilities of a language model (LM) and the reasoning
strategies it employs jointly determine its performance in reasoning tasks.
While test-time scaling is regarded as an effective approach to tackling
complex reasoning tasks, it incurs substantial computational costs and often
leads to "overthinking", where models become trapped in "thought pitfalls". To
address this challenge, we propose Route-To-Reason (RTR), a novel unified
routing framework that dynamically allocates both LMs and reasoning strategies
according to task difficulty under budget constraints. RTR learns compressed
representations of both expert models and reasoning strategies, enabling their
joint and adaptive selection at inference time. This method is low-cost, highly
flexible, and can be seamlessly extended to arbitrary black-box or white-box
models and strategies, achieving true plug-and-play functionality. Extensive
experiments across seven open source models and four reasoning strategies
demonstrate that RTR achieves an optimal trade-off between accuracy and
computational efficiency among all baselines, achieving higher accuracy than
the best single model while reducing token usage by over 60%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖真实答案训练LLM，但获取成本高且困难。

Method: 提出基于格式正确性和答案长度的奖励函数，结合GRPO算法。

Result: 在AIME2024上达到40.0%准确率，优于传统GRPO。

Conclusion: 无需真实答案的标签方法能有效解锁LLM潜力，类似于培养答题习惯。

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
processing tasks, with Reinforcement Learning playing a key role in adapting
them to specific applications. However, obtaining ground truth answers for
training LLMs in mathematical problem-solving is often challenging, costly, and
sometimes unfeasible. This research delves into the utilization of format and
length as surrogate signals to train LLMs for mathematical problem-solving,
bypassing the need for traditional ground truth answers.Our study shows that a
reward function centered on format correctness alone can yield performance
improvements comparable to the standard GRPO algorithm in early phases.
Recognizing the limitations of format-only rewards in the later phases, we
incorporate length-based rewards. The resulting GRPO approach, leveraging
format-length surrogate signals, not only matches but surpasses the performance
of the standard GRPO algorithm relying on ground truth answers in certain
scenarios, achieving 40.0\% accuracy on AIME2024 with a 7B base model. Through
systematic exploration and experimentation, this research not only offers a
practical solution for training LLMs to solve mathematical problems and
reducing the dependence on extensive ground truth data collection, but also
reveals the essence of why our label-free approach succeeds: base model is like
an excellent student who has already mastered mathematical and logical
reasoning skills, but performs poorly on the test paper, it simply needs to
develop good answering habits to achieve outstanding results in exams , in
other words, to unlock the capabilities it already possesses.

Abstract: This paper studies the emergence of interpretable categorical features within
large language models (LLMs), analyzing their behavior across training

feature emergence across multiple domains. Notably, spatial analysis reveals
unexpected semantic reactivation, with early-layer features re-emerging at
later layers, challenging standard assumptions about representational dynamics

Result: 在语言建模实验中，FlowHN比顺序和并行混合模型表现更好，处理速度提升4倍，模型效率提升2倍。

Conclusion: FlowHN通过创新的负载平衡和输出融合方法，显著提升了混合网络的性能和效率。

Abstract: Attention and State-Space Models (SSMs) when combined in a hybrid network in
sequence or in parallel provide complementary strengths. In a hybrid sequential
pipeline they alternate between applying a transformer to the input and then
feeding its output into a SSM. This results in idle periods in the individual
components increasing end-to-end latency and lowering throughput caps. In the
parallel hybrid architecture, the transformer operates independently in
parallel with the SSM, and these pairs are cascaded, with output from one pair
forming the input to the next. Two issues are (i) creating an expressive
knowledge representation with the inherently divergent outputs from these
separate branches, and (ii) load balancing the computation between these
parallel branches, while maintaining representation fidelity. In this work we
present FlowHN, a novel parallel hybrid network architecture that accommodates
various strategies for load balancing, achieved through appropriate
distribution of input tokens between the two branches. Two innovative
differentiating factors in FlowHN include a FLOP aware dynamic token split
between the attention and SSM branches yielding efficient balance in compute
load, and secondly, a method to fuse the highly divergent outputs from
individual branches for enhancing representation expressivity. Together they
enable much better token processing speeds, avoid bottlenecks, and at the same
time yield significantly improved accuracy as compared to other competing
works. We conduct comprehensive experiments on autoregressive language modeling
for models with 135M, 350M, and 1B parameters. FlowHN outperforms sequential
hybrid models and its parallel counterpart, achieving up to 4* higher Tokens
per Second (TPS) and 2* better Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU).

Result: 在三个基准测试和三种先进LLM上，VDS-TTT相对基础模型提升32.29%，比无测试时训练的验证器方法提升6.66%。

Conclusion: VDS-TTT是一种高效的自监督框架，能持续提升模型在动态适应任务中的表现。

Abstract: Learning to adapt pretrained language models to unlabeled,
out-of-distribution data is a critical challenge, as models often falter on
structurally novel reasoning tasks even while excelling within their training
distribution. We introduce a new framework called VDS-TTT - Verifier-Driven
Sample Selection for Test-Time Training to efficiently address this. We use a
learned verifier to score a pool of generated responses and select only from
high ranking pseudo-labeled examples for fine-tuned adaptation. Specifically,
for each input query our LLM generates N candidate answers; the verifier
assigns a reliability score to each, and the response with the highest
confidence and above a fixed threshold is paired with its query for test-time
training. We fine-tune only low-rank LoRA adapter parameters, ensuring
adaptation efficiency and fast convergence. Our proposed self-supervised
framework is the first to synthesize verifier driven test-time training data
for continuous self-improvement of the model. Experiments across three diverse
benchmarks and three state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that VDS-TTT yields up
to a 32.29% relative improvement over the base model and a 6.66% gain compared
to verifier-based methods without test-time training, highlighting its
effectiveness and efficiency for on-the-fly large language model adaptation.

fine-grained reward modeling to enhance cultural sensitivity and inclusivity.
Our approach synthesizes diverse cultural-related questions, constructs
critique data in culturally relevant languages, and employs fine-grained
rewards to decompose cultural texts into verifiable knowledge units for
interpretable evaluation. We also introduce GlobalCultureQA, a multilingual

Conclusion: 需要改进场景图生成的方法，为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) have paved the way for their expanding applications in embodied
AI, robotics, and other real-world tasks. To effectively support these
applications, grounding in spatial and temporal understanding in multimodal
environments is essential. To this end, recent works have leveraged scene
graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and
their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs'
ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce
Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess
LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual
narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models
perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph
generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that
these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex
narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings
underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and
provide valuable insights for future research. The demonstration of our
benchmark is available at https://tsg-bench.netlify.app. Additionally, our code

Conclusion: 该框架和CEC指标为提升小型模型的因果推理能力和评估解释质量提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large proprietary language models exhibit strong causal reasoning abilities
that smaller open-source models struggle to replicate. We introduce a novel
framework for distilling causal explanations that transfers causal reasoning
skills from a powerful teacher model to a compact open-source model. The key
idea is to train the smaller model to develop causal reasoning abilities by
generating structured cause-and-effect explanations consistent with those of
the teacher model. To evaluate the quality of the student-generated
explanations, we introduce a new metric called Causal Explanation Coherence
(CEC) to assess the structural and logical consistency of causal reasoning.
This metric uses sentence-level semantic alignment to measure how well each
part of the generated explanation corresponds to the teacher's reference,
capturing both faithfulness and coverage of the underlying causal chain. Our
framework and the CEC metric provide a principled foundation for training
smaller models to perform robust causal reasoning and for systematically
assessing the coherence of explanations in language model outputs.

Result: 在问答和推理基准测试中，SIPDO优于标准提示调优方法。

Conclusion: 将数据合成整合到提示学习工作流中具有显著价值。

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language
models (LLMs), motivating a growing body of work on prompt optimization. Most
existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input
distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We
introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a
closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data
generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data
generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples
that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines
the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic
improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external
supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning
benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods,
highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning
workflows.

and Biden (19,219 words) and Trump and Harris (18,123 words) debates. Our
analysis shows that Trump consistently dominated in key categories: Challenge
and Adversarial Exchanges, Selective Emphasis, Appeal to Fear, Political Bias,
and Perceived Dismissiveness. These findings underscore his use of emotionally
charged and adversarial rhetoric to control the narrative and influence
audience perception. In this work, we establish BEADS as a scalable and
reproducible framework for critical discourse analysis across languages,
domains, and political contexts.

*Yejin Lee,Joonghyuk Hahn,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: AmpleHate是一种新颖的隐式仇恨言论检测方法，通过模仿人类推理过程，结合显式和隐式目标信息，实现了优于对比学习基线的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式仇恨言论检测因依赖上下文解释而具有挑战性，现有方法（如对比学习）未能完全模拟人类的推理过程。

Method: AmpleHate使用预训练的命名实体识别模型识别显式目标，通过[CLS]标记捕获隐式目标信息，并基于注意力机制计算目标与上下文的关系。

Result: 实验表明，AmpleHate性能优于对比学习基线（平均82.14%），且收敛更快，注意力模式与人类判断一致。

Conclusion: AmpleHate通过模拟人类推理过程，显著提升了隐式仇恨言论检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech detection is challenging due to its subtlety and
reliance on contextual interpretation rather than explicit offensive words.
Current approaches rely on contrastive learning, which are shown to be
effective on distinguishing hate and non-hate sentences. Humans, however,
detect implicit hate speech by first identifying specific targets within the
text and subsequently interpreting how these target relate to their surrounding
context. Motivated by this reasoning process, we propose AmpleHate, a novel
approach designed to mirror human inference for implicit hate detection.
AmpleHate identifies explicit target using a pretrained Named Entity
Recognition model and capture implicit target information via [CLS] tokens. It
computes attention-based relationships between explicit, implicit targets and
sentence context and then, directly injects these relational vectors into the
final sentence representation. This amplifies the critical signals of
target-context relations for determining implicit hate. Experiments demonstrate
that AmpleHate achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming contrastive
learning baselines by an average of 82.14% and achieve faster convergence.
Qualitative analyses further reveal that attention patterns produced by
AmpleHate closely align with human judgement, underscoring its interpretability
and robustness.

Result: 系统化整理了SLMs的优化方法，并提供了评估工具。

Conclusion: 本文为构建高效紧凑的语言模型提供了指导，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) have gained substantial attention due to their
ability to execute diverse language tasks successfully while using fewer
computer resources. These models are particularly ideal for deployment in
limited environments, such as mobile devices, on-device processing, and edge
systems. In this study, we present a complete assessment of SLMs, focussing on
their design frameworks, training approaches, and techniques for lowering model
size and complexity. We offer a novel classification system to organize the
optimization approaches applied for SLMs, encompassing strategies like pruning,
quantization, and model compression. Furthermore, we assemble SLM's studies of
evaluation suite with some existing datasets, establishing a rigorous platform
for measuring SLM capabilities. Alongside this, we discuss the important
difficulties that remain unresolved in this sector, including trade-offs
between efficiency and performance, and we suggest directions for future study.
We anticipate this study to serve as a beneficial guide for researchers and
practitioners who aim to construct compact, efficient, and high-performing
language models.

Motivation: 现有医疗RAG系统主要依赖医学知识库，忽视了类似病例的经验知识，而这是人类临床推理的关键。

Method: 提出DoctorRAG框架，结合概念标签分配、混合检索机制和Med-TextGrad模块，模拟医生推理。

Result: 在多语言、多任务数据集上显著优于基线RAG模型，生成更准确、相关和全面的响应。

Conclusion: DoctorRAG在模拟医生推理方面迈出重要一步，提升了医疗RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: Existing medical RAG systems mainly leverage knowledge from medical knowledge
bases, neglecting the crucial role of experiential knowledge derived from
similar patient cases -- a key component of human clinical reasoning. To bridge
this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like
reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit
case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first
allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a
hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In
addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is
integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge
and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask
datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline
RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach
generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step
towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.

<details>

Motivation: 探索LLMs内部句法专业化的形成过程及其影响因素。

Method: 通过跟踪训练过程中内部句法一致性的变化，分析不同句法现象的最小对。

Result: 句法敏感性逐渐形成，集中在特定层，并表现出快速专业化的“关键期”，且受模型规模和数据影响。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs内部句法专业化的形成机制，为未来研究提供了代码和模型支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been found to develop surprising internal
specializations: Individual neurons, attention heads, and circuits become
selectively sensitive to syntactic structure, reflecting patterns observed in
the human brain. While this specialization is well-documented, how it emerges
during training and what influences its development remains largely unknown.
  In this work, we tap into the black box of specialization by tracking its
formation over time. By quantifying internal syntactic consistency across
minimal pairs from various syntactic phenomena, we identify a clear
developmental trajectory: Syntactic sensitivity emerges gradually, concentrates
in specific layers, and exhibits a 'critical period' of rapid internal
specialization. This process is consistent across architectures and
initialization parameters (e.g., random seeds), and is influenced by model
scale and training data. We therefore reveal not only where syntax arises in
LLMs but also how some models internalize it during training. To support future
research, we will release the code, models, and training checkpoints upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在长时对话中因上下文窗口限制导致的记忆不连贯和个性化响应不足的问题。

Method: 基于多粒度记忆单元，利用高斯混合模型聚类关联记忆，熵路由自适应选择粒度，LLM过滤优化检索结果。

Result: 在四个长时记忆基准测试中，MemGAS在问答和检索任务上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemGAS通过多粒度记忆关联和自适应检索显著提升了长时对话记忆的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been widely adopted in
conversational agents. However, the increasingly long interactions between
users and agents accumulate extensive dialogue records, making it difficult for
LLMs with limited context windows to maintain a coherent long-term dialogue
memory and deliver personalized responses. While retrieval-augmented memory
systems have emerged to address this issue, existing methods often depend on
single-granularity memory segmentation and retrieval. This approach falls short
in capturing deep memory connections, leading to partial retrieval of useful
information or substantial noise, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
tackle these limits, we propose MemGAS, a framework that enhances memory
consolidation by constructing multi-granularity association, adaptive
selection, and retrieval. MemGAS is based on multi-granularity memory units and
employs Gaussian Mixture Models to cluster and associate new memories with
historical ones. An entropy-based router adaptively selects optimal granularity
by evaluating query relevance distributions and balancing information
completeness and noise. Retrieved memories are further refined via LLM-based
filtering. Experiments on four long-term memory benchmarks demonstrate that
MemGAS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both question answer and
retrieval tasks, achieving superior performance across different query types
and top-K settings.

Conclusion: 文档级模型编辑任务具有实际意义，现有方法需进一步改进以适应更高难度的编辑需求。

Abstract: Model editing aims to correct errors and outdated knowledge in the Large
language models (LLMs) with minimal cost. Prior research has proposed a variety
of datasets to assess the effectiveness of these model editing methods.
However, most existing datasets only require models to output short phrases or
sentences, overlooks the widespread existence of document-level tasks in the
real world, raising doubts about their practical usability. Aimed at addressing
this limitation and promoting the application of model editing in real-world
scenarios, we propose the task of document-level model editing. To tackle such
challenges and enhance model capabilities in practical settings, we introduce
\benchmarkname, a dataset focused on document-level model editing,
characterized by document-level inputs and outputs, extrapolative, and multiple
facts within a single edit. We propose a series of evaluation metrics and
experiments. The results show that the difficulties in document-level model
editing pose challenges for existing model editing methods.

TLDR: TailorKV是一种混合压缩方法，结合量化和卸载技术，显著减少KV缓存的内存开销，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式大语言模型（LLM）中的KV缓存带来高内存开销，现有方法因PCIe带宽限制或激进压缩导致性能下降。

Method: 提出TailorKV，结合量化与选择性加载，针对不同层特性优化，并设计硬件友好的实现框架。

Result: 在128k上下文下，Llama-3.1-8B模型可在单块RTX 3090 GPU上运行，解码速度达82ms/词，性能接近无损。

Conclusion: TailorKV通过互补的压缩策略，显著提升效率，优于现有技术。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache in generative large language models (LLMs)
introduces substantial memory overhead. Existing works mitigate this burden by
offloading or compressing the KV cache. However, loading the entire cache
incurs significant latency due to PCIe bandwidth bottlenecks in CPU-GPU
communication, while aggressive compression causes notable performance
degradation. We identify that certain layers in the LLM need to maintain global
information and are unsuitable for selective loading. In contrast, other layers
primarily focus on a few tokens with dominant activations that potentially
incur substantial quantization error. This observation leads to a key insight
that loading dominant tokens and quantizing all tokens can complement each
other. Building on this insight, we propose a hybrid compression method,
TailorKV, which seamlessly integrates quantization and offloading. TailorKV
develops an inference framework along with a hardware-friendly implementation
that leverages these complementary characteristics. Extensive long-context
evaluations exhibit that TailorKV achieves nearly lossless performance under
aggressive compression settings, outperforming the state-of-the-art.
Particularly, the Llama-3.1-8B with 128k context can be served within a single
RTX 3090 GPU, reaching 82 ms per token during decoding.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在封闭和开放场景中均表现优异，计算成本更低，且能形成更紧凑的循环推理结构。

Conclusion: 提出的范式通过动态协调机制显著提升了多智能体协作的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results across diverse
downstream tasks, but their monolithic nature restricts scalability and
efficiency in complex problem-solving. While recent research explores
multi-agent collaboration among LLMs, most approaches rely on static
organizational structures that struggle to adapt as task complexity and agent
numbers grow, resulting in coordination overhead and inefficiencies. To this
end, we propose a puppeteer-style paradigm for LLM-based multi-agent
collaboration, where a centralized orchestrator ("puppeteer") dynamically
directs agents ("puppets") in response to evolving task states. This
orchestrator is trained via reinforcement learning to adaptively sequence and
prioritize agents, enabling flexible and evolvable collective reasoning.
Experiments on closed- and open-domain scenarios show that this method achieves
superior performance with reduced computational costs. Analyses further reveal
that the key improvements consistently stem from the emergence of more compact,
cyclic reasoning structures under the orchestrator's evolution.

Motivation: 随着LALMs在现实应用中的部署增加，其对抗恶意音频注入攻击的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究使用防御成功率、上下文鲁棒性评分和判断鲁棒性指数等指标，对五种LALMs在四种攻击场景下的表现进行定量评估。

Result: 实验结果显示模型性能差异显著，恶意内容位置（尤其是序列开头）对攻击效果影响大，且指令遵循能力与鲁棒性呈负相关。

Conclusion: 研究提出了基准框架，强调需将鲁棒性整合到训练流程中，并开发多模态防御和架构设计以安全部署LALMs。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, yet their robustness against malicious audio injection attacks
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates five leading LALMs
across four attack scenarios: Audio Interference Attack, Instruction Following
Attack, Context Injection Attack, and Judgment Hijacking Attack. Using metrics
like Defense Success Rate, Context Robustness Score, and Judgment Robustness
Index, their vulnerabilities and resilience were quantitatively assessed.
Experimental results reveal significant performance disparities among models;
no single model consistently outperforms others across all attack types. The
position of malicious content critically influences attack effectiveness,
particularly when placed at the beginning of sequences. A negative correlation
between instruction-following capability and robustness suggests models
adhering strictly to instructions may be more susceptible, contrasting with
greater resistance by safety-aligned models. Additionally, system prompts show
mixed effectiveness, indicating the need for tailored strategies. This work
introduces a benchmark framework and highlights the importance of integrating
robustness into training pipelines. Findings emphasize developing multi-modal
defenses and architectural designs that decouple capability from susceptibility
for secure LALMs deployment.

Method: 通过测量语言模型在日语“第一人称心理谓词限制”语法点上的困惑度，评估其表现。分析了Weblab和Llama 3的分词对性能的影响。

Result: Weblab在罕见语法点上表现良好，但其分词质量差可能是原因。优化分词后，Llama 3的困惑度降低了28倍。语言模型在分词问题时会选择替代语法模式。

Conclusion: 分词质量对语言模型在罕见语法点上的表现有重要影响，优化分词可以显著提升性能。

Abstract: Typical methods for evaluating the performance of language models evaluate
their ability to answer questions accurately. These evaluation metrics are
acceptable for determining the extent to which language models can understand
and reason about text in a general sense, but fail to capture nuanced
capabilities, such as the ability of language models to recognize and obey rare
grammar points, particularly in languages other than English. We measure the
perplexity of language models when confronted with the "first person psych
predicate restriction" grammar point in Japanese. Weblab is the only tested
open source model in the 7-10B parameter range which consistently assigns
higher perplexity to ungrammatical psych predicate sentences than grammatical
ones. We give evidence that Weblab's uniformly bad tokenization is a possible
root cause for its good performance, and show that Llama 3's perplexity on
grammatical psych predicate sentences can be reduced by orders of magnitude
(28x difference) by restricting test sentences to those with uniformly
well-behaved tokenizations. We show in further experiments on machine
translation tasks that language models will use alternative grammar patterns in
order to produce grammatical sentences when tokenization issues prevent the
most natural sentence from being output.

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment in pretrained language models (LMs) has enabled
efficient transfer in text-based LMs. Such an alignment has also been observed
in speech foundation models. However, it remains an open question whether
findings and methods from text-based cross-lingual alignment apply to speech.
Building on prior work on spoken translation retrieval, we perform
pronunciation-controlled experiments to observe if cross-lingual alignment can
indeed occur in such models on a semantic basis, instead of relying on phonetic
similarities. Our findings indicate that even in the absence of phonetic cues,
spoken translation retrieval accuracy remains relatively stable. We follow up
with a controlled experiment on a word-level dataset of cross-lingual synonyms
and near-homophones, confirming the existence of both phonetic and semantic
knowledge in the encoder. Finally, we qualitatively examine the transcriptions
produced by early exiting the encoder, where we observe that speech translation
produces semantic errors that are characterized by phonetic similarities to
corresponding words in the source language. We apply this insight from early
exiting to speech recognition in seven low-resource languages unsupported by
the Whisper model, and achieve improved accuracy in all languages examined,
particularly for languages with transparent orthographies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize smart home
assistants by enhancing their ability to accurately understand user needs and
respond appropriately, which is extremely beneficial for building a smarter
home environment. While recent studies have explored integrating LLMs into
smart home systems, they primarily focus on handling straightforward, valid
single-device operation instructions. However, real-world scenarios are far
more complex and often involve users issuing invalid instructions or
controlling multiple devices simultaneously. These have two main challenges:
LLMs must accurately identify and rectify errors in user instructions and
execute multiple user instructions perfectly. To address these challenges and
advance the development of LLM-based smart home assistants, we introduce
HomeBench, the first smart home dataset with valid and invalid instructions
across single and multiple devices in this paper. We have experimental results
on 13 distinct LLMs; e.g., GPT-4o achieves only a 0.0% success rate in the
scenario of invalid multi-device instructions, revealing that the existing
state-of-the-art LLMs still cannot perform well in this situation even with the
help of in-context learning, retrieval-augmented generation, and fine-tuning.

Result: 实验表明，DoctorAgent-RL在多轮推理能力和最终诊断性能上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DoctorAgent-RL通过强化学习机制，使LLMs能自主开发符合临床逻辑的交互策略，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the
field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world
clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Existing systems rely on a
one-way information transmission mode where patients must fully describe their
symptoms in a single round, leading to nonspecific diagnostic recommendations
when complaints are vague. Traditional multi-turn dialogue methods based on
supervised learning are constrained by static data-driven paradigms, lacking
generalizability and struggling to intelligently extract key clinical
information. To address these limitations, we propose DoctorAgent-RL, a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that
models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under
uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy
within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent,
dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive
rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables
LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical
reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing
dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English
multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient
interactions. Experiments demonstrate that DoctorAgent-RL outperforms existing
models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic
performance, demonstrating practical value in assisting clinical consultations.

Conclusion: LLACA展示了LLMs在无监督分词中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Word segmentation stands as a cornerstone of Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Based on the concept of "comprehend first, segment later", we propose a
new framework to explore the limit of unsupervised word segmentation with Large
Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the semantic understanding capabilities of
LLMs based on word segmentation. We employ current mainstream LLMs to perform
word segmentation across multiple languages to assess LLMs' "comprehension".
Our findings reveal that LLMs are capable of following simple prompts to
segment raw text into words. There is a trend suggesting that models with more
parameters tend to perform better on multiple languages. Additionally, we
introduce a novel unsupervised method, termed LLACA ($\textbf{L}$arge
$\textbf{L}$anguage Model-Inspired $\textbf{A}$ho-$\textbf{C}$orasick
$\textbf{A}$utomaton). Leveraging the advanced pattern recognition capabilities
of Aho-Corasick automata, LLACA innovatively combines these with the deep
insights of well-pretrained LLMs. This approach not only enables the
construction of a dynamic $n$-gram model that adjusts based on contextual
information but also integrates the nuanced understanding of LLMs, offering
significant improvements over traditional methods. Our source code is available

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the performance of
Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. However, existing research has
overlooked the efficiency of TTS from a latency-sensitive perspective. Through
a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a
compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios
where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS,
we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1)
branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference
branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding.
By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources
properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3%
accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4%
within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and
demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in
latency-sensitive scenarios.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的训练方法，通过交替思考和回答来优化长链推理的效率，显著减少首词生成时间并提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链推理虽然提升了语言模型的推理能力，但导致效率低下和首词生成时间增加。

Method: 使用强化学习（RL）训练模型交替思考和回答，引入基于规则的奖励机制以优化中间推理步骤。

Result: 实验表明，该方法平均减少80%的首词生成时间，Pass@1准确率提升19.3%，并在复杂推理数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过强化学习优化推理效率，无需外部工具，且具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) significantly enhances large language models'
(LLM) reasoning capabilities. However, the extensive reasoning traces lead to
inefficiencies and an increased time-to-first-token (TTFT). We propose a novel
training paradigm that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to guide reasoning LLMs
to interleave thinking and answering for multi-hop questions. We observe that
models inherently possess the ability to perform interleaved reasoning, which
can be further enhanced through RL. We introduce a simple yet effective
rule-based reward to incentivize correct intermediate steps, which guides the
policy model toward correct reasoning paths by leveraging intermediate signals
generated during interleaved reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted across
five diverse datasets and three RL algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++)
demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional think-answer reasoning,
without requiring external tools. Specifically, our approach reduces TTFT by
over 80% on average and improves up to 19.3% in Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore,
our method, trained solely on question answering and logical reasoning
datasets, exhibits strong generalization ability to complex reasoning datasets
such as MATH, GPQA, and MMLU. Additionally, we conduct in-depth analysis to
reveal several valuable insights into conditional reward modeling.

Motivation: 现有RWG方法因输入有限且未能有效捕捉文献间关系，导致理解浅显和孤立解释。

Abstract: Automatic related work generation (RWG) can save people's time and effort
when writing a draft of related work section (RWS) for further revision.
However, existing methods for RWG always suffer from shallow comprehension due
to taking the limited portions of references papers as input and isolated
explanation for each reference due to ineffective capturing the relationships
among them. To address these issues, we focus on full-text-based RWG task and
propose a novel multi-agent framework. Our framework consists of three agents:
a selector that decides which section of the papers is going to read next, a
reader that digests the selected section and updates a shared working memory,
and a writer that generates RWS based on the final curated memory. To better
capture the relationships among references, we also propose two graph-aware
strategies for selector, enabling to optimize the reading order with constrains
of the graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework
consistently improves performance across three base models and various input
configurations. The graph-aware selectors outperform alternative selectors,
achieving state-of-the-art results. The code and data are available at

Motivation: 解决LLM在OpenQA中知识整合和可控生成的挑战。

Conclusion: GenKI有效提升了OpenQA性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) represents a cornerstone in natural
language processing (NLP), primarily focused on extracting answers from
unstructured textual data. With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models
(LLMs), LLM-based OpenQA methods have reaped the benefits of emergent
understanding and answering capabilities enabled by massive parameters compared
to traditional methods. However, most of these methods encounter two critical
challenges: how to integrate knowledge into LLMs effectively and how to
adaptively generate results with specific answer formats for various task
situations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named
GenKI, which aims to improve the OpenQA performance by exploring Knowledge
Integration and controllable Generation on LLMs simultaneously. Specifically,
we first train a dense passage retrieval model to retrieve associated knowledge
from a given knowledge base. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge
integration model that incorporates the retrieval knowledge into instructions
during fine-tuning to intensify the model. Furthermore, to enable controllable
generation in LLMs, we leverage a certain fine-tuned LLM and an ensemble based
on text consistency incorporating all coherence, fluency, and answer format
assurance. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, MSMARCO,
and CMRC2018 datasets, featuring diverse answer formats, have demonstrated the
effectiveness of GenKI with comparison of state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover,
ablation studies have disclosed a linear relationship between the frequency of
retrieved knowledge and the model's ability to recall knowledge accurately
against the ground truth. Our code of GenKI is available at

Motivation: 法律咨询成本高且专业人员短缺，LLMs虽具潜力但现有系统难以满足真实咨询的交互性和知识密集性需求。

Method: 通过短视频平台收集真实多轮法律咨询对话，构建LeCoDe数据集，并提出包含12项指标的综合评估框架。

Result: 实验显示，即使是GPT-4等先进模型，在澄清能力和专业建议质量上也表现不佳（召回率39.8%，总分59%）。

Conclusion: LeCoDe数据集和评估框架为法律领域对话系统研究提供了重要工具，并揭示了改进LLMs法律咨询能力的必要性。

Abstract: Legal consultation is essential for safeguarding individual rights and
ensuring access to justice, yet remains costly and inaccessible to many
individuals due to the shortage of professionals. While recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward scalable, low-cost
legal assistance, current systems fall short in handling the interactive and
knowledge-intensive nature of real-world consultations. To address these
challenges, we introduce LeCoDe, a real-world multi-turn benchmark dataset
comprising 3,696 legal consultation dialogues with 110,008 dialogue turns,
designed to evaluate and improve LLMs' legal consultation capability. With
LeCoDe, we innovatively collect live-streamed consultations from short-video
platforms, providing authentic multi-turn legal consultation dialogues. The
rigorous annotation by legal experts further enhances the dataset with
professional insights and expertise. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
evaluation framework that assesses LLMs' consultation capabilities in terms of
(1) clarification capability and (2) professional advice quality. This unified
framework incorporates 12 metrics across two dimensions. Through extensive
experiments on various general and domain-specific LLMs, our results reveal
significant challenges in this task, with even state-of-the-art models like
GPT-4 achieving only 39.8% recall for clarification and 59% overall score for
advice quality, highlighting the complexity of professional consultation
scenarios. Based on these findings, we further explore several strategies to
enhance LLMs' legal consultation abilities. Our benchmark contributes to
advancing research in legal domain dialogue systems, particularly in simulating
more real-world user-expert interactions.

Motivation: LALMs在音频交互中存在安全对齐不足的问题，现有防御措施难以平衡安全性和实用性。

Method: 采用无监督安全微调策略，通过重塑模型表示空间来提升安全性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了LALMs的安全性，且过度拒绝率仅平均增加0.88%。

Conclusion: 该策略有效解决了LALMs的安全对齐问题，同时保持了实用性。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have extended the capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) by enabling audio-based human interactions. However,
recent research has revealed that LALMs remain vulnerable to harmful queries
due to insufficient safety-alignment. Despite advances in defence measures for
text and vision LLMs, effective safety-alignment strategies and audio-safety
dataset specifically targeting LALMs are notably absent. Meanwhile defence
measures based on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) struggle to address safety
improvement while avoiding over-rejection issues, significantly compromising
helpfulness. In this work, we propose an unsupervised safety-fine-tuning
strategy as remedy that reshapes model's representation space to enhance
existing LALMs safety-alignment while balancing the risk of over-rejection. Our
experiments, conducted across three generations of Qwen LALMs, demonstrate that
our approach significantly improves LALMs safety under three modality input
conditions (audio-text, text-only, and audio-only) while increasing
over-rejection rate by only 0.88% on average. Warning: this paper contains
harmful examples.

TLDR: 论文通过词关联方法研究大型语言模型（LLM）的道德价值观，避免直接提示的偏差，比较了西方英语社区与LLM的道德差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM反映的道德价值观对评估其社会影响至关重要，但直接提示可能因训练数据泄露和提示敏感性而产生偏差。

Method: 使用词关联作为底层表示，构建LLM生成的词关联数据集，并提出基于道德基础理论种子词的新方法，通过关联图传播道德价值观。

Result: 研究发现英语社区与LLM在道德概念化上存在系统性差异。

Conclusion: 词关联方法能更稳健地揭示LLM的道德推理，为理解其价值观提供了新视角。

Abstract: As the impact of large language models increases, understanding the moral
values they reflect becomes ever more important. Assessing the nature of moral
values as understood by these models via direct prompting is challenging due to
potential leakage of human norms into model training data, and their
sensitivity to prompt formulation. Instead, we propose to use word
associations, which have been shown to reflect moral reasoning in humans, as
low-level underlying representations to obtain a more robust picture of LLMs'
moral reasoning. We study moral differences in associations from western
English-speaking communities and LLMs trained predominantly on English data.
First, we create a large dataset of LLM-generated word associations, resembling
an existing data set of human word associations. Next, we propose a novel
method to propagate moral values based on seed words derived from Moral
Foundation Theory through the human and LLM-generated association graphs.
Finally, we compare the resulting moral conceptualizations, highlighting
detailed but systematic differences between moral values emerging from English
speakers and LLM associations.

Result: 在零样本和少样本LLM生成噪声标签数据集上，BERT分类器性能平均提升7.21%和7.30%。

Conclusion: SiDyP有效提升模型对LLM生成噪声标签的鲁棒性，适用于多种NLP任务。

Abstract: The traditional process of creating labeled datasets is labor-intensive and
expensive. Recent breakthroughs in open-source large language models (LLMs)
have opened up a new avenue in generating labeled datasets automatically for
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing an alternative to
such an expensive annotation process. However, the reliability of such
auto-generated labels remains a significant concern due to inherent
inaccuracies. When learning from noisy labels, the model's generalization is
likely to be harmed as it is prone to overfit to those label noises. While
previous studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise
and real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In
this paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to
calibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards
LLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by
neighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines
noisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase
the performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and
few-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30%
respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive
benchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks. Our code is
available on Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）容易产生幻觉，即生成的文本看似合理但与输入图像无关，主要原因是模型过度依赖语言先验而忽视视觉信息。

Method: 提出了一种联合建模视觉和文本标记贡献的C-PMI解码策略，通过双层次优化最大化互信息，并设计了动态调节解码过程的标记净化机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著减少了LVLM的幻觉问题，同时保持了解码效率。

Conclusion: C-PMI解码策略有效缓解了LVLM的幻觉问题，为视觉语言模型提供了更可靠的生成能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations, where
generated responses seem semantically plausible yet exhibit little or no
relevance to the input image. Previous studies reveal that this issue primarily
stems from LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors while disregarding the
visual information during decoding. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a
novel Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (C-PMI) calibrated decoding
strategy, which adaptively strengthens the mutual dependency between generated
texts and input images to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing methods
solely focusing on text token sampling, we propose to jointly model the
contributions of visual and textual tokens to C-PMI, formulating hallucination
mitigation as a bi-level optimization problem aimed at maximizing mutual
information. To solve it, we design a token purification mechanism that
dynamically regulates the decoding process by sampling text tokens remaining
maximally relevant to the given image, while simultaneously refining image
tokens most pertinent to the generated response. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks reveal that the proposed method significantly reduces
hallucinations in LVLMs while preserving decoding efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents KIT's submissions to the IWSLT 2025 low-resource track.
We develop both cascaded systems, consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) models, and end-to-end (E2E) Speech
Translation (ST) systems for three language pairs: Bemba, North Levantine
Arabic, and Tunisian Arabic into English. Building upon pre-trained models, we
fine-tune our systems with different strategies to utilize resources
efficiently. This study further explores system enhancement with synthetic data
and model regularization. Specifically, we investigate MT-augmented ST by
generating translations from ASR data using MT models. For North Levantine,
which lacks parallel ST training data, a system trained solely on synthetic
data slightly surpasses the cascaded system trained on real data. We also
explore augmentation using text-to-speech models by generating synthetic speech
from MT data, demonstrating the benefits of synthetic data in improving both
ASR and ST performance for Bemba. Additionally, we apply intra-distillation to
enhance model performance. Our experiments show that this approach consistently
improves results across ASR, MT, and ST tasks, as well as across different
pre-trained models. Finally, we apply Minimum Bayes Risk decoding to combine
the cascaded and end-to-end systems, achieving an improvement of approximately
1.5 BLEU points.

Conclusion: RAM提供了一种高效、灵活的对齐方法，适用于多样化应用。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across industries has
increased the demand for high-quality and customizable outputs. However,
traditional alignment methods often require retraining large pretrained models,
making it difficult to quickly adapt and optimize LLMs for diverse
applications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Residual
Alignment Model} (\textit{RAM}) that formalizes the alignment process as a type
of importance sampling. In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves
as the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as
secondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an
estimator of the importance weights. This design enables a natural detachment
of the alignment module from the target aligned model, improving flexibility
and scalability. Based on this model, we derive an efficient sequence-level
training strategy for the alignment module, which operates independently of the
proposal module. Additionally, we develop a resampling algorithm with iterative
token-level decoding to address the common first-token latency issue in
comparable methods. Experimental evaluations on two leading open-source LLMs
across diverse tasks, including instruction following, domain adaptation, and
preference optimization, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
baseline models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多跳和推理密集型任务（如数学问题解决）中容易产生幻觉，需要更精细的过程奖励模型来引导生成连贯的解决方案。

Method: 提出PathFinder-PRM，通过分类数学和一致性错误并组合细粒度信号来估计步骤正确性。训练使用了40万样本的数据集，结合了PRM800K和RLHFlow Mistral的标注。

Result: 在PRMBench上，PathFinder-PRM的PRMScore达到67.7，优于之前的最佳结果（65.5），且数据使用量减少3倍。在奖励引导的贪婪搜索中，prm@8达到48.3，比基线提升1.5分。

Conclusion: 解耦的错误检测和奖励估计不仅提升了细粒度错误检测能力，还显著提高了端到端的数学推理性能和数据效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, especially during
multi-hop and reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematical problem solving.
While Outcome Reward Models verify only final answers, Process Reward Models
(PRMs) score each intermediate step to steer generation toward coherent
solutions. We introduce PathFinder-PRM, a novel hierarchical, error-aware
discriminative PRM that first classifies math and consistency errors at each
step, then combines these fine-grained signals to estimate step correctness. To
train PathFinder-PRM, we construct a 400K-sample dataset by enriching the
human-annotated PRM800K corpus and RLHFlow Mistral traces with
three-dimensional step-level labels. On PRMBench, PathFinder-PRM achieves a new
state-of-the-art PRMScore of 67.7, outperforming the prior best (65.5) while
using 3 times less data. When applied to reward guided greedy search, our model
yields prm@8 48.3, a +1.5 point gain over the strongest baseline. These results
demonstrate that decoupled error detection and reward estimation not only boost
fine-grained error detection but also substantially improve end-to-end,
reward-guided mathematical reasoning with greater data efficiency.

TLDR: 本文提出MT$^{3}$框架，首次将多任务强化学习应用于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），实现端到端的文本图像机器翻译（TIMT），并在多个基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIMT任务在无障碍访问、跨语言信息获取和现实文档理解中至关重要，但现有方法依赖多阶段流水线，复杂度高。本文旨在探索强化学习在多模态大语言模型中的应用，以简化TIMT流程。

Method: 提出MT$^{3}$框架，采用多任务优化策略，结合文本识别、上下文推理和翻译三个子任务，并通过多混合奖励机制进行训练。

Result: MT$^{3}$-7B-Zero在MIT-10M基准测试中表现优异，超越Qwen2.5-VL-72B和InternVL2.5-78B等基线模型，并在跨语言对和数据集上展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多任务协同、强化学习初始化、课程设计和奖励机制是推动MLLM驱动的TIMT发展的关键因素。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT)-the task of translating textual content
embedded in images-is critical for applications in accessibility, cross-lingual
information access, and real-world document understanding. However, TIMT
remains a complex challenge due to the need for accurate optical character
recognition (OCR), robust visual-text reasoning, and high-quality translation,
often requiring cascading multi-stage pipelines. Recent advances in large-scale
Reinforcement Learning (RL) have improved reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), but their application to end-to-end TIMT is
still underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT$^{3}$, the first
framework to apply Multi-Task RL to MLLMs for end-to-end TIMT. MT$^{3}$ adopts
a multi-task optimization paradigm targeting three key sub-skills: text
recognition, context-aware reasoning, and translation. It is trained using a
novel multi-mixed reward mechanism that adapts rule-based RL strategies to
TIMT's intricacies, offering fine-grained, non-binary feedback across tasks.
Furthermore, to facilitate the evaluation of TIMT in authentic cross-cultural
and real-world social media contexts, we introduced XHSPost, the first social
media TIMT benchmark. Our MT$^{3}$-7B-Zero achieves state-of-the-art results on
the latest in-domain MIT-10M benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as
Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B by notable margins across multiple metrics.
Additionally, the model shows strong generalization to out-of-distribution
language pairs and datasets. In-depth analyses reveal how multi-task synergy,
reinforcement learning initialization, curriculum design, and reward
formulation contribute to advancing MLLM-driven TIMT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练-微调范式在深度学习中广泛应用，但部分预训练知识可能对微调任务产生负面影响（负迁移），而优雅遗忘是一种潜在解决方案。然而，该方法在生成式语言模型中尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出LWF框架，通过Fisher信息矩阵加权参数更新，计算遗忘置信度以评估自生成知识，并定期遗忘高置信度知识。

Result: 实验表明，尽管预训练语言模型中知识交互机制仍具挑战性，但优雅遗忘能提升微调性能。

Conclusion: LWF框架为生成式语言模型中的优雅遗忘提供了有效解决方案，有助于优化微调效果。

Abstract: Recently, the pretrain-finetune paradigm has become a cornerstone in various
deep learning areas. While in general the pre-trained model would promote both
effectiveness and efficiency of downstream tasks fine-tuning, studies have
shown that not all knowledge acquired during pre-training is beneficial. Some
of the knowledge may actually bring detrimental effects to the fine-tuning
tasks, which is also known as negative transfer. To address this problem,
graceful forgetting has emerged as a promising approach. The core principle of
graceful forgetting is to enhance the learning plasticity of the target task by
selectively discarding irrelevant knowledge. However, this approach remains
underexplored in the context of generative language models, and it is often
challenging to migrate existing forgetting algorithms to these models due to
architecture incompatibility. To bridge this gap, in this paper we propose a
novel framework, Learning With Forgetting (LWF), to achieve graceful forgetting
in generative language models. With Fisher Information Matrix weighting the
intended parameter updates, LWF computes forgetting confidence to evaluate
self-generated knowledge regarding the forgetting task, and consequently,
knowledge with high confidence is periodically unlearned during fine-tuning.
Our experiments demonstrate that, although thoroughly uncovering the mechanisms
of knowledge interaction remains challenging in pre-trained language models,
applying graceful forgetting can contribute to enhanced fine-tuning
performance.

TLDR: RPDR框架结合闭源和开源大语言模型，通过生成训练数据并微调开源模型，解决了生物医学实体链接中的低资源和高成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督方法需要大量标注数据，闭源大语言模型虽有效但存在稳定性和高成本问题。

Method: 提出RPDR框架，利用闭源模型生成训练数据，微调开源模型进行重排序。

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优异，训练数据不足时Acc@1提升显著。

Conclusion: RPDR框架具有优越性和通用性，解决了低资源和高成本问题。

Abstract: Biomedical entity linking aims to map nonstandard entities to standard
entities in a knowledge base. Traditional supervised methods perform well but
require extensive annotated data to transfer, limiting their usage in
low-resource scenarios. Large language models (LLMs), especially closed-source
LLMs, can address these but risk stability issues and high economic costs:
using these models is restricted by commercial companies and brings significant
economic costs when dealing with large amounts of data. To address this, we
propose ``RPDR'', a framework combining closed-source LLMs and open-source LLMs
for re-ranking candidates retrieved by a retriever fine-tuned with a small
amount of data. By prompting a closed-source LLM to generate training data from
unannotated data and fine-tuning an open-source LLM for re-ranking, we
effectively distill the knowledge to the open-source LLM that can be deployed
locally, thus avoiding the stability issues and the problem of high economic
costs. We evaluate RPDR on two datasets, including one real-world dataset and
one publicly available dataset involving two languages: Chinese and English.
RPDR achieves 0.019 Acc@1 improvement and 0.036 Acc@1 improvement on the Aier
dataset and the Ask A Patient dataset when the amount of training data is not
enough. The results demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the
proposed framework.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为MARA的轻量级对齐方法，通过将句子级偏好学习分解为词级二元分类，显著降低了计算成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，如何高效且低成本地将其与人类偏好和价值观对齐成为关键问题。

Method: MARA方法通过一个紧凑的三层全连接网络，独立于语言模型运行，对候选词进行“接受”或“拒绝”的二元分类。

Result: 在七个不同的大语言模型和三个开源数据集上的实验表明，MARA在降低计算成本的同时显著提升了对齐性能。

Conclusion: MARA为语言模型对齐提供了一种高效且轻量化的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning these
models with human preferences and values is critical to ensuring ethical and
safe applications. However, existing alignment techniques such as RLHF or DPO
often require direct fine-tuning on LLMs with billions of parameters, resulting
in substantial computational costs and inefficiencies. To address this, we
propose Micro token-level Accept-Reject Aligning (MARA) approach designed to
operate independently of the language models. MARA simplifies the alignment
process by decomposing sentence-level preference learning into token-level
binary classification, where a compact three-layer fully-connected network
determines whether candidate tokens are "Accepted" or "Rejected" as part of the
response. Extensive experiments across seven different LLMs and three
open-source datasets show that MARA achieves significant improvements in
alignment performance while reducing computational costs.

TLDR: NeuSym-RAG是一个结合神经和符号检索的混合框架，通过多视图分块和模式解析优化PDF内容检索，显著提升问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有检索增强生成方法中神经与符号检索分离及单视图分块忽略PDF结构的问题。

Method: 提出NeuSym-RAG框架，结合多视图分块和模式解析，将PDF内容组织到关系数据库和向量库中。

Result: 在三个PDF问答数据集上表现优于向量检索和结构化基线方法。

Conclusion: NeuSym-RAG成功统一了两种检索范式并利用多视图，显著提升了问答效果。

Abstract: The increasing number of academic papers poses significant challenges for
researchers to efficiently acquire key details. While retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) shows great promise in large language model (LLM) based
automated question answering, previous works often isolate neural and symbolic
retrieval despite their complementary strengths. Moreover, conventional
single-view chunking neglects the rich structure and layout of PDFs, e.g.,
sections and tables. In this work, we propose NeuSym-RAG, a hybrid neural
symbolic retrieval framework which combines both paradigms in an interactive
process. By leveraging multi-view chunking and schema-based parsing, NeuSym-RAG
organizes semi-structured PDF content into both the relational database and
vectorstore, enabling LLM agents to iteratively gather context until sufficient
to generate answers. Experiments on three full PDF-based QA datasets, including
a self-annotated one AIRQA-REAL, show that NeuSym-RAG stably defeats both the
vector-based RAG and various structured baselines, highlighting its capacity to
unify both retrieval schemes and utilize multiple views. Code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/X-LANCE/NeuSym-RAG.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为CoUT的新推理范式，通过模拟人类无意识思维提高大型推理模型的令牌效率，减少47.62%的令牌使用且保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）性能优越但推理过程冗长，令牌效率低。受无意识思维理论（UTT）启发，作者希望通过模拟人类无意识思维提高效率。

Method: 提出Chain of Unconscious Thought（CoUT）范式，引导模型在隐藏层内化推理过程，并设计令牌高效策略减少不必要令牌。

Result: 实验表明CoUT显著提高效率，令牌使用减少47.62%，性能未受影响。

Conclusion: 模型可能具备有益的无意识思维，CoUT为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve promising performance but compromise
token efficiency due to verbose reasoning processes. Unconscious Thought Theory
(UTT) posits that complex problems can be solved more efficiently through
internalized cognitive processes. Inspired by UTT, we propose a new reasoning
paradigm, termed Chain of Unconscious Thought (CoUT), to improve the token
efficiency of LRMs by guiding them to mimic human unconscious thought and
internalize reasoning processes. Concretely, we first prompt the model to
internalize the reasoning by thinking in the hidden layer. Then, we design a
bag of token-efficient strategies to further help models reduce unnecessary
tokens yet preserve the performance. Our work reveals that models may possess
beneficial unconscious thought, enabling improved efficiency without
sacrificing performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoUT. Remarkably, it surpasses CoT by reducing token usage by 47.62% while
maintaining comparable accuracy, as shown in Figure 1. The code of CoUT is
available at this link: https://github.com/Rohan-GRH/CoUT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内容审核过滤器通常仅关注安全性，无法满足用户自定义的对齐需求。

Method: SGM通过自动化生成训练数据，无需人工示例，支持灵活的用户定义规范。

Result: SGM训练的过滤器性能与基于人工数据的最先进安全过滤器相当，同时支持细粒度控制。

Conclusion: SGM为LLM部署提供了灵活、可扩展的对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with deployment-specific requirements
is critical but inherently imperfect. Despite extensive training, models remain
susceptible to misalignment and adversarial inputs such as jailbreaks. Content
moderation filters are commonly used as external safeguards, though they
typically focus narrowly on safety. We introduce SGM (Specification-Guided
Moderation), a flexible framework for training moderation filters grounded in
user-defined specifications that go beyond standard safety concerns. SGM
automates training data generation without relying on human-written examples,
enabling scalable support for diverse, application-specific alignment goals.
SGM-trained filters perform on par with state-of-the-art safety filters built
on curated datasets, while supporting fine-grained and user-defined alignment
control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态流程和有限工具，难以应对复杂多样的多模态虚假信息。

Method: 提出T2Agent，包含模块化工具包和贝叶斯优化选择器，扩展MCTS进行多源验证，并引入双奖励机制。

Result: 在混合源多模态虚假信息基准测试中，T2Agent表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: T2Agent作为一种无需训练的方法，展示了提升检测准确性的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal misinformation often arises from mixed forgery sources,
requiring dynamic reasoning and adaptive verification. However, existing
methods mainly rely on static pipelines and limited tool usage, limiting their
ability to handle such complexity and diversity. To address this challenge, we
propose T2Agent, a novel misinformation detection agent that incorporates an
extensible toolkit with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The toolkit consists of
modular tools such as web search, forgery detection, and consistency analysis.
Each tool is described using standardized templates, enabling seamless
integration and future expansion. To avoid inefficiency from using all tools
simultaneously, a Bayesian optimization-based selector is proposed to identify
a task-relevant subset. This subset then serves as the action space for MCTS to
dynamically collect evidence and perform multi-source verification. To better
align MCTS with the multi-source nature of misinformation detection, T2Agent
extends traditional MCTS with multi-source verification, which decomposes the
task into coordinated subtasks targeting different forgery sources. A dual
reward mechanism containing a reasoning trajectory score and a confidence score
is further proposed to encourage a balance between exploration across mixed
forgery sources and exploitation for more reliable evidence. We conduct
ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of the tree search mechanism and
tool usage. Extensive experiments further show that T2Agent consistently
outperforms existing baselines on challenging mixed-source multimodal
misinformation benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential as a
training-free approach for enhancing detection accuracy. The code will be
released.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的方法，通过分析LLM对政治实体情感预测的不一致性来量化政治偏见，发现偏见普遍存在且与语言和模型规模相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见分析方法依赖小规模任务和LLM自身分析，可能传播偏见，因此需要更客观的方法。

Method: 定义基于熵的不一致性指标，插入多样化的政治家名字到政治句子中，预测情感并分析不一致性。

Result: 发现所有测试组合均存在偏见，西方语言偏见更强，大模型偏见更一致。

Conclusion: 通过替换政治家名字部分缓解了偏见，但偏见问题仍需进一步解决。

Abstract: Political biases encoded by LLMs might have detrimental effects on downstream
applications. Existing bias analysis methods rely on small-size intermediate
tasks (questionnaire answering or political content generation) and rely on the
LLMs themselves for analysis, thus propagating bias. We propose a new approach
leveraging the observation that LLM sentiment predictions vary with the target
entity in the same sentence. We define an entropy-based inconsistency metric to
encode this prediction variability. We insert 1319 demographically and
politically diverse politician names in 450 political sentences and predict
target-oriented sentiment using seven models in six widely spoken languages. We
observe inconsistencies in all tested combinations and aggregate them in a
statistically robust analysis at different granularity levels. We observe
positive and negative bias toward left and far-right politicians and positive
correlations between politicians with similar alignment. Bias intensity is
higher for Western languages than for others. Larger models exhibit stronger
and more consistent biases and reduce discrepancies between similar languages.
We partially mitigate LLM unreliability in target-oriented sentiment
classification (TSC) by replacing politician names with fictional but plausible
counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在大型语言模型主导的背景下，开源社区的小型模型是否仍能通过集体智能保持竞争力。

Method: 基于四个轻量级操作：嵌入、聚类、评分和投票，通过选择每个聚类中表现最佳的模型生成响应。

Result: Avengers在数学任务上超越GPT-4.1 18.21%，代码任务上7.46%，并展现出优秀的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 小型模型通过集体智能可以超越大型专有模型，为开源社区提供了有竞争力的解决方案。

Abstract: As proprietary giants increasingly dominate the race for ever-larger language
models, a pressing question arises for the open-source community: can smaller
models remain competitive across a broad range of tasks? In this paper, we
present the Avengers--a simple recipe that effectively leverages the collective
intelligence of open-source, smaller language models. Our framework is built
upon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries using a text
embedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their semantic
similarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each cluster;
and (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At inference
time, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The
top-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the
response using the Self-Consistency or its multi-model variant. Remarkably,
with 10 open-source models (~7B parameters each), the Avengers collectively
outperforms GPT-4.1 on 10 out of 15 datasets (spanning mathematics, code,
logic, knowledge, and affective tasks). In particular, it surpasses GPT-4.1 on
mathematics tasks by 18.21% and on code tasks by 7.46%. Furthermore, the
Avengers delivers superior out-of-distribution generalization, and remains
robust across various embedding models, clustering algorithms, ensemble
strategies, and values of its sole parameter--the number of clusters. We have
open-sourced the code on GitHub: https://github.com/ZhangYiqun018/Avengers

Motivation: 随着科学研究的快速增长，元数据提取对数据集编目和保存至关重要，但现有方法（如Masader）依赖手动标注，效率低。

Method: MOLE采用大语言模型（LLMs），通过模式驱动的方法处理多格式文档，并集成验证机制以确保一致性。

Result: 现代LLMs在自动化元数据提取任务中表现良好，但仍需改进以确保稳定性和可靠性。

Conclusion: MOLE展示了LLMs在元数据提取中的潜力，未来需进一步优化性能。代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Metadata extraction is essential for cataloging and preserving datasets,
enabling effective research discovery and reproducibility, especially given the
current exponential growth in scientific research. While Masader (Alyafeai et
al.,2021) laid the groundwork for extracting a wide range of metadata
attributes from Arabic NLP datasets' scholarly articles, it relies heavily on
manual annotation. In this paper, we present MOLE, a framework that leverages
Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically extract metadata attributes from
scientific papers covering datasets of languages other than Arabic. Our
schema-driven methodology processes entire documents across multiple input
formats and incorporates robust validation mechanisms for consistent output.
Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to evaluate the research progress on
this task. Through systematic analysis of context length, few-shot learning,
and web browsing integration, we demonstrate that modern LLMs show promising
results in automating this task, highlighting the need for further future work
improvements to ensure consistent and reliable performance. We release the

Conclusion: Compliance-to-Code和FinCheck为中文金融法规的自动化合规提供了有效解决方案，填补了现有技术的空白。

Abstract: Nowadays, regulatory compliance has become a cornerstone of corporate
governance, ensuring adherence to systematic legal frameworks. At its core,
financial regulations often comprise highly intricate provisions, layered
logical structures, and numerous exceptions, which inevitably result in
labor-intensive or comprehension challenges. To mitigate this, recent
Regulatory Technology (RegTech) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained
significant attention in automating the conversion of regulatory text into
executable compliance logic. However, their performance remains suboptimal
particularly when applied to Chinese-language financial regulations, due to
three key limitations: (1) incomplete domain-specific knowledge representation,
(2) insufficient hierarchical reasoning capabilities, and (3) failure to
maintain temporal and logical coherence. One promising solution is to develop a
domain specific and code-oriented datasets for model training. Existing
datasets such as LexGLUE, LegalBench, and CODE-ACCORD are often
English-focused, domain-mismatched, or lack fine-grained granularity for
compliance code generation. To fill these gaps, we present Compliance-to-Code,
the first large-scale Chinese dataset dedicated to financial regulatory
compliance. Covering 1,159 annotated clauses from 361 regulations across ten
categories, each clause is modularly structured with four logical
elements-subject, condition, constraint, and contextual information-along with
regulation relations. We provide deterministic Python code mappings, detailed
code reasoning, and code explanations to facilitate automated auditing. To
demonstrate utility, we present FinCheck: a pipeline for regulation
structuring, code generation, and report generation.

Abstract: Consciousness stands as one of the most profound and distinguishing features
of the human mind, fundamentally shaping our understanding of existence and
agency. As large language models (LLMs) develop at an unprecedented pace,
questions concerning intelligence and consciousness have become increasingly
significant. However, discourse on LLM consciousness remains largely unexplored
territory. In this paper, we first clarify frequently conflated terminologies
(e.g., LLM consciousness and LLM awareness). Then, we systematically organize
and synthesize existing research on LLM consciousness from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. Furthermore, we highlight potential frontier risks that
conscious LLMs might introduce. Finally, we discuss current challenges and
outline future directions in this emerging field. The references discussed in

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for comprehending the reasoning capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) through the perspective of meta-learning. By
conceptualizing reasoning trajectories as pseudo-gradient descent updates to
the LLM's parameters, we identify parallels between LLM reasoning and various
meta-learning paradigms. We formalize the training process for reasoning tasks
as a meta-learning setup, with each question treated as an individual task, and
reasoning trajectories serving as the inner loop optimization for adapting
model parameters. Once trained on a diverse set of questions, the LLM develops
fundamental reasoning capabilities that can generalize to previously unseen
questions. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the strong connection
between LLM reasoning and meta-learning, exploring several issues of
significant interest from a meta-learning standpoint. Our work not only
enhances the understanding of LLM reasoning but also provides practical
insights for improving these models through established meta-learning
techniques.

Abstract: Researchers working on low-resource languages face persistent challenges due
to limited data availability and restricted access to computational resources.
Although most large language models (LLMs) are predominantly trained in
high-resource languages, adapting them to low-resource contexts, particularly
African languages, requires specialized techniques. Several strategies have
emerged for adapting models to low-resource languages in todays LLM landscape,
defined by multi-stage pre-training and post-training paradigms. However, the
most effective approaches remain uncertain. This work systematically
investigates which adaptation strategies yield the best performance when
extending existing LLMs to African languages. We conduct extensive experiments
and ablation studies to evaluate different combinations of data types
(translated versus synthetically generated), training stages (pre-training
versus post-training), and other model adaptation configurations. Our
experiments focuses on mathematical reasoning tasks, using the Llama 3.1 model
family as our base model.

Abstract: Transliteration, the process of mapping text from one script to another,
plays a crucial role in multilingual natural language processing, especially
within linguistically diverse contexts such as India. Despite significant
advancements through specialized models like IndicXlit, recent developments in
large language models suggest a potential for general-purpose models to excel
at this task without explicit task-specific training. The current work
systematically evaluates the performance of prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o,
GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1, Gemma-3-27B-it, and Mistral-Large against IndicXlit, a
state-of-the-art transliteration model, across ten major Indian languages.
Experiments utilized standard benchmarks, including Dakshina and Aksharantar
datasets, with performance assessed via Top-1 Accuracy and Character Error
Rate. Our findings reveal that while GPT family models generally outperform
other LLMs and IndicXlit for most instances. Additionally, fine-tuning GPT-4o
improves performance on specific languages notably. An extensive error analysis
and robustness testing under noisy conditions further elucidate strengths of
LLMs compared to specialized models, highlighting the efficacy of foundational

inference costs. Existing approaches synthesize shorter reasoning responses for
LRMs to learn, but are inefficient for online usage due to the time-consuming
data generation and filtering processes. Meanwhile, online reinforcement
learning mainly adopts a length reward to encourage short reasoning responses,
but tends to lose the reflection ability and harm the performance. To address
these issues, we propose REA-RL, which introduces a small reflection model for
efficient scaling in online training, offering both parallel sampling and
sequential revision. Besides, a reflection reward is designed to further
prevent LRMs from favoring short yet non-reflective responses. Experiments show
that both methods maintain or enhance performance while significantly improving
inference efficiency. Their combination achieves a good balance between
performance and efficiency, reducing inference costs by 35% without
compromising performance. Further analysis demonstrates that our methods are
effective by maintaining reflection frequency for hard problems while
appropriately reducing it for simpler ones without losing reflection ability.

*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: APE是一种高效适应大语言模型的方法，通过小批量迭代微调，显著提升性能且节省计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为资源有限的研究者和实践者提供一种简单高效的模型适应方法。

Method: 迭代微调小批量数据（200例），仅保留改进部分。

Result: 在新闻摘要任务中，APE仅用T4 GPU和60分钟即实现40% BLEU提升，性能媲美或超越复杂方法。

Conclusion: 小规模迭代数据扰动可高效引导大语言模型适应特定任务，无需昂贵重训练。

Abstract: We present Adjacent Possible Exploration (APE), a simple yet effective method
for adapting large language models to specific tasks using minimal
computational resources. Unlike traditional fine-tuning that requires extensive
compute, APE iteratively fine-tunes models on small, carefully selected data
batches (200 examples), retaining only improvements. On news summarization, APE
achieves 40 percent BLEU improvement using just a T4 GPU in 60 minutes,
matching or exceeding more complex methods like LoRA while remaining
conceptually simple. Our approach is particularly valuable for researchers and
practitioners with limited computational resources. We provide open-source code
and demonstrate APE's effectiveness through both automatic metrics and human
evaluation. While inspired by evolutionary theory's "adjacent possible", APE's
core insight has a very practical application: small, iterative data
perturbations can efficiently guide LLMs toward task-specific performance
without expensive retraining.

TLDR: Enigmata是一个专为提升大语言模型（LLMs）解谜能力设计的综合套件，包含36个任务和自动评估工具，支持多任务强化学习训练。其训练模型在多个基准测试中表现优异，并能推广到其他领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在无需领域知识的解谜任务上表现不佳，需要一种系统化方法来提升其逻辑推理能力。

Method: 提出Enigmata套件，包括任务生成器和规则验证器，支持多任务强化学习训练（RLVR）。

Result: 训练模型Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata在解谜基准测试中超越其他模型，并能推广到数学推理等任务。

Conclusion: Enigmata为提升LLMs的逻辑推理能力提供了统一且可控的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, excel at
advanced reasoning tasks like math and coding via Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but still struggle with puzzles solvable by humans
without domain knowledge. We introduce Enigmata, the first comprehensive suite
tailored for improving LLMs with puzzle reasoning skills. It includes 36 tasks
across seven categories, each with 1) a generator that produces unlimited
examples with controllable difficulty and 2) a rule-based verifier for
automatic evaluation. This generator-verifier design supports scalable,
multi-task RL training, fine-grained analysis, and seamless RLVR integration.
We further propose Enigmata-Eval, a rigorous benchmark, and develop optimized
multi-task RLVR strategies. Our trained model, Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata,
consistently surpasses o3-mini-high and o1 on the puzzle reasoning benchmarks
like Enigmata-Eval, ARC-AGI (32.8%), and ARC-AGI 2 (0.6%). It also generalizes
well to out-of-domain puzzle benchmarks and mathematical reasoning, with little
multi-tasking trade-off. When trained on larger models like Seed1.5-Thinking
(20B activated parameters and 200B total parameters), puzzle data from Enigmata
further boosts SoTA performance on advanced math and STEM reasoning tasks such
as AIME (2024-2025), BeyondAIME and GPQA (Diamond), showing nice generalization
benefits of Enigmata. This work offers a unified, controllable framework for
advancing logical reasoning in LLMs. Resources of this work can be found at

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种新指标ALAS，用于评估LLM中文本与音频模态的对齐质量，并在两个任务中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏标准指标来评估LLM中跨模态对齐质量，需要一种可靠的方法来衡量语义关联。

Method: 通过分析Transformer层中音频与文本表示的相关性，提出ALAS指标，并在问答和情感识别任务中测试。

Result: ALAS在不同层和任务中表现符合预期，验证了其作为对齐质量评估工具的有效性。

Conclusion: ALAS为跨模态对齐提供了一种标准化评估方法，有助于未来多模态学习的研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in Spoken Language Understanding
(SLU). Recent SLU models process audio directly by adapting speech input into
LLMs for better multimodal learning. A key consideration for these models is
the cross-modal alignment between text and audio modalities, which is a
telltale sign as to whether or not LLM is able to associate semantic meaning to
audio segments. While various methods exist for fusing these modalities, there
is no standard metric to evaluate alignment quality in LLMs. In this work, we
propose a new metric, ALAS (Automatic Latent Alignment Score). Our study
examines the correlation between audio and text representations across
transformer layers, for two different tasks (Spoken Question Answering and
Emotion Recognition). We showcase that our metric behaves as expected across
different layers and different tasks.

TLDR: 提出了一种针对长文本数据的压缩方法，创建了MiniLongBench基准测试，显著降低了评估成本，同时保持了与原始基准测试的高度相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长文本理解（LCU）基准测试存在冗余，导致评估成本过高，需要一种更高效的评估方法。

Method: 通过剪枝著名的LCU基准测试LongBench，设计了一种针对稀疏信息长文本的压缩方法，创建了MiniLongBench。

Result: MiniLongBench将评估成本降至原始的4.5%，同时与LongBench结果的平均秩相关系数为0.97。

Conclusion: MiniLongBench作为一种低成本基准测试，有望推动LLM在LCU能力方面的未来研究。

Abstract: Long Context Understanding (LCU) is a critical area for exploration in
current large language models (LLMs). However, due to the inherently lengthy
nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in
prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses.
Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks
exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In
this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text
data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU
benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237
test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through
empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average
evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an
average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results. Therefore,
our MiniLongBench, as a low-cost benchmark, holds great potential to
substantially drive future research into the LCU capabilities of LLMs. See

TLDR: CP-Router是一个动态选择LLM或LRM的路由框架，通过Conformal Prediction和新型熵标准FBE优化输出效率，减少token使用同时保持或提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRM在处理简单查询时输出冗长，导致效率低下甚至准确性下降，需要一种动态选择模型的方法。

Method: 提出CP-Router框架，利用Conformal Prediction和FBE熵标准动态选择LLM或LRM。

Result: 在多项MCQA基准测试中，CP-Router减少token使用并保持或提升准确性，且适用于多种模型配对和开放QA。

Conclusion: CP-Router是一种高效、通用的路由框架，能动态优化模型选择，提升推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly improved
long-chain reasoning capabilities over Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
LRMs often produce unnecessarily lengthy outputs even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiencies or even accuracy degradation compared to LLMs. To
overcome this, we propose CP-Router, a training-free and model-agnostic routing
framework that dynamically selects between an LLM and an LRM, demonstrated with
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts. The routing decision is
guided by the prediction uncertainty estimates derived via Conformal Prediction
(CP), which provides rigorous coverage guarantees. To further refine the
uncertainty differentiation across inputs, we introduce Full and Binary Entropy
(FBE), a novel entropy-based criterion that adaptively selects the appropriate
CP threshold. Experiments across diverse MCQA benchmarks, including
mathematics, logical reasoning, and Chinese chemistry, demonstrate that
CP-Router efficiently reduces token usage while maintaining or even improving
accuracy compared to using LRM alone. We also extend CP-Router to diverse model
pairings and open-ended QA, where it continues to demonstrate strong
performance, validating its generality and robustness.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了如何为非专家用户创建自然语言接口以查询知识图谱中的词典数据，通过多维分类法和模板数据集实现了自然语言到SPARQL查询的映射，并测试了不同模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为非专家用户降低使用SPARQL查询语言的门槛，使其能够利用知识图谱的优势。

Method: 开发多维分类法描述Wikidata词典数据，创建包含120万映射的模板数据集，并测试GPT-2、Phi-1.5和GPT-3.5-Turbo的性能。

Result: GPT-3.5-Turbo表现出较强的泛化能力，模型规模和多样性预训练对适应性至关重要。

Conclusion: 尽管取得进展，但在泛化能力、处理多样化语言数据和扩展性方面仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs offer an excellent solution for representing the
lexical-semantic structures of lexicographic data. However, working with the
SPARQL query language represents a considerable hurdle for many non-expert
users who could benefit from the advantages of this technology. This paper
addresses the challenge of creating natural language interfaces for
lexicographic data retrieval on knowledge graphs such as Wikidata. We develop a
multidimensional taxonomy capturing the complexity of Wikidata's lexicographic
data ontology module through four dimensions and create a template-based
dataset with over 1.2 million mappings from natural language utterances to
SPARQL queries. Our experiments with GPT-2 (124M), Phi-1.5 (1.3B), and
GPT-3.5-Turbo reveal significant differences in model capabilities. While all
models perform well on familiar patterns, only GPT-3.5-Turbo demonstrates
meaningful generalization capabilities, suggesting that model size and diverse
pre-training are crucial for adaptability in this domain. However, significant
challenges remain in achieving robust generalization, handling diverse
linguistic data, and developing scalable solutions that can accommodate the
full complexity of lexicographic knowledge representation.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: DeepDialogue是一个大规模多模态对话数据集，涵盖41个领域和20种情感，旨在解决现有对话数据集的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话数据集在情感范围、领域多样性和多轮对话深度上有限，且多为纯文本，阻碍了更人性化多模态对话系统的发展。

Method: 使用9种不同规模的语言模型生成初始对话，结合人工标注和LLM质量过滤，并合成情感一致的声音。

Result: 小模型在6轮对话后失去连贯性；具体领域对话更有意义；跨模型交互比同模型对话更连贯。

Conclusion: DeepDialogue是首个大规模开源多模态对话数据集，保留了情感上下文，推动了多模态对话研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in single-turn responses, yet multi-turn dialogues remain
challenging for even the most sophisticated language models. Current dialogue
datasets are limited in their emotional range, domain diversity, turn depth,
and are predominantly text-only, hindering progress in developing more
human-like conversational systems across modalities. To address these
limitations, we present DeepDialogue, a large-scale multimodal dataset
containing 40,150 high-quality multi-turn dialogues spanning 41 domains and
incorporating 20 distinct emotions with coherent emotional progressions. Our
approach pairs 9 different language models (4B-72B parameters) to generate
65,600 initial conversations, which we then evaluate through a combination of
human annotation and LLM-based quality filtering. The resulting dataset reveals
fundamental insights: smaller models fail to maintain coherence beyond 6
dialogue turns; concrete domains (e.g., "cars," "travel") yield more meaningful
conversations than abstract ones (e.g., "philosophy"); and cross-model
interactions produce more coherent dialogues than same-model conversations. A
key contribution of DeepDialogue is its speech component, where we synthesize
emotion-consistent voices for all 40,150 dialogues, creating the first
large-scale open-source multimodal dialogue dataset that faithfully preserves
emotional context across multi-turn conversations.

Motivation: 探索结构化推理是否能提升多领域翻译任务的质量，填补LLMs在复杂领域翻译中的研究空白。

Method: 在15个代表性领域和四个翻译方向上比较LRMs与LLMs，结合自动指标和增强的MQM评估体系分析翻译质量。

Result: LRMs在语义复杂领域（如长文本、高难度场景）表现优于LLMs，且领域自适应提示策略进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 结构化推理在多领域翻译任务中具有潜力，为优化领域敏感翻译系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
general-purpose machine translation, but their effectiveness in complex,
domain-sensitive translation tasks remains underexplored. Recent advancements
in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), raise the question of whether structured
reasoning can enhance translation quality across diverse domains. In this work,
we compare the performance of LRMs with traditional LLMs across 15
representative domains and four translation directions. Our evaluation
considers various factors, including task difficulty, input length, and
terminology density. We use a combination of automatic metrics and an enhanced
MQM-based evaluation hierarchy to assess translation quality. Our findings show
that LRMs consistently outperform traditional LLMs in semantically complex
domains, especially in long-text and high-difficulty translation scenarios.
Moreover, domain-adaptive prompting strategies further improve performance by
better leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LRMs. These results highlight
the potential of structured reasoning in MDMT tasks and provide valuable
insights for optimizing translation systems in domain-sensitive contexts.

Method: 引入Mixture of Accent-Specific LoRAs（MAS-LoRA），一种利用多个特定口音LoRA专家混合的微调方法，适用于已知或未知口音的场景。

Result: 在Whisper和L2-ARCTIC语料库上的实验表明，MAS-LoRA在未知口音时显著降低了词错误率，且在已知口音时表现更优，同时减少了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: MAS-LoRA是首个用于非母语多口音ASR的LoRA专家混合方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: We aim to improve the robustness of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
systems against non-native speech, particularly in low-resourced multi-accent
settings. We introduce Mixture of Accent-Specific LoRAs (MAS-LoRA), a
fine-tuning method that leverages a mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
experts, each specialized in a specific accent. This method can be used when
the accent is known or unknown at inference time, without the need to fine-tune
the model again. Our experiments, conducted using Whisper on the L2-ARCTIC
corpus, demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate compared to
regular LoRA and full fine-tuning when the accent is unknown. When the accent
is known, the results further improve. Furthermore, MAS-LoRA shows less
catastrophic forgetting than the other fine-tuning methods. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first use of a mixture of LoRA experts for non-native
multi-accent ASR.

salient reasoning patterns into the backbone LLM via simple fine-tuning can

Abstract: The detection of mental health problems from social media and the
interpretation of these results have been extensively explored. Research has
shown that incorporating clinical symptom information into a model enhances
domain expertise, improving its detection and interpretation performance. While
large language models (LLMs) are shown to be effective for generating
explanatory rationales in mental health detection, their substantially large
parameter size and high computational cost limit their practicality. Reasoning
distillation transfers this ability to smaller language models (SLMs), but
inconsistencies in the relevance and domain alignment of LLM-generated
rationales pose a challenge. This paper investigates how rationale quality
impacts SLM performance in mental health detection and explanation generation.
We hypothesize that ensuring high-quality and domain-relevant rationales
enhances the distillation. To this end, we propose a framework that selects
rationales based on their alignment with expert clinical reasoning. Experiments
show that our quality-focused approach significantly enhances SLM performance
in both mental disorder detection and rationale generation. This work
highlights the importance of rationale quality and offers an insightful
framework for knowledge transfer in mental health applications.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种新的编码系统最优性类别，其成员与最优编码线性分离，表现出Zipf定律（频率排名的幂律分布）。Zipf定律、大小-排名定律和大小-概率定律在该类别中形成类似群的结构。人类语言是该类别的成员，而其他物种的通信系统（如海豚和座头鲸）可能也是成员。研究为Zipf定律源于压缩的假设提供了支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索编码系统的最优性类别，并验证Zipf定律是否源于压缩。

Method: 通过分析频率与排名的双对数图，识别线性分离的编码系统，并验证其是否符合Zipf定律。

Result: 发现人类语言和其他物种的通信系统（如海豚和座头鲸）可能属于该最优性类别，支持Zipf定律源于压缩的假设。

Conclusion: 研究为编码系统的最优性和Zipf定律的起源提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that
class are separated linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law,
namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Whithin that class, Zipf's
law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like
structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All
languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of
the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that
cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution
instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into
plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a
straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under
non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are separated by a
linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under
compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may
indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. Our findings provide
support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression.

Motivation: 现有工具学习方法依赖监督微调，忽视了工具调用细节的细粒度优化，导致偏好对齐和错误识别的局限性。

Method: TTPA采用反向数据集构建方法创建高质量多轮工具使用数据集，并通过Token-level Preference Sampling（TPS）捕获细粒度偏好，同时引入Error-oriented Scoring Mechanism（ESM）量化工具调用错误。

Conclusion: TTPA通过细粒度偏好对齐和错误导向评分机制，有效提升了工具学习的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing tool-learning methods usually rely on supervised fine-tuning, they
often overlook fine-grained optimization of internal tool call details, leading
to limitations in preference alignment and error discrimination. To overcome
these challenges, we propose Token-level Tool-use Preference Alignment Training
Framework (TTPA), a training paradigm for constructing token-level tool-use
preference datasets that align LLMs with fine-grained preferences using a novel
error-oriented scoring mechanism. TTPA first introduces reversed dataset
construction, a method for creating high-quality, multi-turn tool-use datasets
by reversing the generation flow. Additionally, we propose Token-level
Preference Sampling (TPS) to capture fine-grained preferences by modeling
token-level differences during generation. To address biases in scoring, we
introduce the Error-oriented Scoring Mechanism (ESM), which quantifies
tool-call errors and can be used as a training signal. Extensive experiments on
three diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTPA significantly improves
tool-using performance while showing strong generalization ability across
models and datasets.

Method: 提出STeP方法，合成自反轨迹（含反思和错误修正），并引入部分掩码策略避免学习错误步骤。

Result: 实验表明，STeP在ALFWorld、WebShop和SciWorld任务中提升性能，LLaMA2-7B-Chat使用Qwen1.5-110B-Chat作为教师模型时，训练数据更少但效果更优。

Conclusion: STeP方法有效提升LLM代理的学习能力，减少对封闭模型和大量训练数据的依赖。

Abstract: Autonomous agents, which perceive environments and take actions to achieve
goals, have become increasingly feasible with the advancements in large
language models (LLMs). However, current powerful agents often depend on
sophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4.
Although training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher
models has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still
faces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To
mitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving
LLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that
include reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the
effectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to
become agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting. We also introduce
partial masking strategy that prevents the LLM from internalizing incorrect or
suboptimal steps. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves agent
performance across three representative tasks: ALFWorld, WebShop, and SciWorld.
For the open-source model LLaMA2-7B-Chat, when trained using self-reflected
trajectories constructed with Qwen1.5-110B-Chat as the teacher model, it
achieves comprehensive improvements with less training data compared to agents
trained exclusively on expert trajectories.

Conclusion: RAUQ为白盒大语言模型提供了一种即插即用的实时幻觉检测方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive fluency, but often produce
critical errors known as "hallucinations". Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
methods are a promising tool for coping with this fundamental shortcoming. Yet,
existing UQ methods face challenges such as high computational overhead or
reliance on supervised learning. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In
particular, we propose RAUQ (Recurrent Attention-based Uncertainty
Quantification), an unsupervised approach that leverages intrinsic attention
patterns in transformers to detect hallucinations efficiently. By analyzing
attention weights, we identified a peculiar pattern: drops in attention to
preceding tokens are systematically observed during incorrect generations for
certain "uncertainty-aware" heads. RAUQ automatically selects such heads,
recurrently aggregates their attention weights and token-level confidences, and
computes sequence-level uncertainty scores in a single forward pass.
Experiments across 4 LLMs and 12 question answering, summarization, and
translation tasks demonstrate that RAUQ yields excellent results, outperforming
state-of-the-art UQ methods using minimal computational overhead (<1% latency).
Moreover, it requires no task-specific labels and no careful hyperparameter
tuning, offering plug-and-play real-time hallucination detection in white-box
LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable promise for democratizing
automated reasoning by generating formal specifications. However, a fundamental
tension exists: LLMs are probabilistic, while formal verification demands
deterministic guarantees. This paper addresses this epistemological gap by
comprehensively investigating failure modes and uncertainty quantification (UQ)
in LLM-generated formal artifacts. Our systematic evaluation of five frontier
LLMs reveals Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based autoformalization's
domain-specific impact on accuracy (from +34.8% on logical tasks to -44.5% on
factual ones), with known UQ techniques like the entropy of token probabilities
failing to identify these errors. We introduce a probabilistic context-free
grammar (PCFG) framework to model LLM outputs, yielding a refined uncertainty
taxonomy. We find uncertainty signals are task-dependent (e.g., grammar entropy
for logic, AUROC>0.93). Finally, a lightweight fusion of these signals enables
selective verification, drastically reducing errors (14-100%) with minimal
abstention, transforming LLM-driven formalization into a reliable engineering
discipline.

TLDR: 论文研究了如何通过弱监督模型激励大型语言模型（LLM）的推理能力，替代昂贵的高质量演示和强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升LLM的推理能力通常依赖昂贵的强化学习或高质量演示，本文探索是否可以通过弱监督模型实现类似效果。

Method: 研究使用显著较弱的模型监督强模型，分析其成功条件和原因。

Result: 实验表明，弱监督能显著提升学生模型的推理能力，恢复约94%的强化学习效果，且成本更低。

Conclusion: 弱到强的监督范式是一种有前景且通用的替代方案，可低成本激励LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
reasoning-intensive tasks, but enhancing their reasoning abilities typically
relies on either reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable signals or
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT)
demonstrations, both of which are expensive. In this paper, we study a novel
problem of incentivizing the reasoning capacity of LLMs without expensive
high-quality demonstrations and reinforcement learning. We investigate whether
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be effectively incentivized via
supervision from significantly weaker models. We further analyze when and why
such weak supervision succeeds in eliciting reasoning abilities in stronger
models. Our findings show that supervision from significantly weaker reasoners
can substantially improve student reasoning performance, recovering close to
94% of the gains of expensive RL at a fraction of the cost. Experiments across
diverse benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that weak reasoners can
effectively incentivize reasoning in stronger student models, consistently
improving performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Our results
suggest that this simple weak-to-strong paradigm is a promising and
generalizable alternative to costly methods for incentivizing strong reasoning
capabilities at inference-time in LLMs. The code is publicly available at

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为SEA的简单有效算法，用于在推理时对齐大型语言模型与人类反馈，通过连续潜在空间中的梯度采样直接优化原始响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在基础策略较弱或候选集较小时难以探索信息丰富的候选响应，导致效果有限。

Method: SEA通过连续潜在空间中的梯度采样直接优化原始响应，避免了离散空间中的昂贵搜索。

Result: SEA在AdvBench和MATH基准上分别实现了77.51%和16.36%的相对改进。

Conclusion: SEA是一种简单且有效的推理时对齐算法，显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human feedback at inference time has
received increasing attention due to its flexibility. Existing methods rely on
generating multiple responses from the base policy for search using a reward
model, which can be considered as searching in a discrete response space.
However, these methods struggle to explore informative candidates when the base
policy is weak or the candidate set is small, resulting in limited
effectiveness. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose Simple Energy
Adaptation ($\textbf{SEA}$), a simple yet effective algorithm for
inference-time alignment. In contrast to expensive search over the discrete
space, SEA directly adapts original responses from the base policy toward the
optimal one via gradient-based sampling in continuous latent space.
Specifically, SEA formulates inference as an iterative optimization procedure
on an energy function over actions in the continuous space defined by the
optimal policy, enabling simple and effective alignment. For instance, despite
its simplicity, SEA outperforms the second-best baseline with a relative
improvement of up to $ \textbf{77.51%}$ on AdvBench and $\textbf{16.36%}$ on
MATH. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuanyige/SEA

Conclusion: 为LLM时代的可解释性提供了新范式。

Abstract: Preference mechanisms, such as human preference, LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ), and
reward models, are central to aligning and evaluating large language models
(LLMs). Yet, the underlying concepts that drive these preferences remain poorly
understood. In this work, we propose a fully automated end-to-end method for
generating local and global concept-based explanations of preferences across
multiple domains. Our method employs an LLM to discover concepts that
differentiate between chosen and rejected responses and represent them with
concept-based vectors. To model the relationships between concepts and
preferences, we propose a white-box Hierarchical Multi-Domain Regression model
that captures both domain-general and domain-specific effects. To evaluate our
method, we curate a dataset spanning eight challenging and diverse domains and
explain twelve mechanisms. Our method achieves strong preference prediction
performance, outperforming baselines while also being explainable.
Additionally, we assess explanations in two novel application-driven settings.
First, guiding LLM outputs with concepts from LaaJ explanations yields
responses that those judges consistently prefer. Second, prompting LaaJs with
concepts explaining humans improves their preference predictions. Together, our
work provides a new paradigm for explainability in the era of LLMs.

Result: 在复杂QA任务中表现优于无训练基线，媲美微调系统。

Conclusion: MA-RAG通过代理协作和动态推理，实现了高效、可解释的信息检索与生成。

Abstract: We present MA-RAG, a Multi-Agent framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) that addresses the inherent ambiguities and reasoning challenges in
complex information-seeking tasks. Unlike conventional RAG methods that rely on
either end-to-end fine-tuning or isolated component enhancements, MA-RAG
orchestrates a collaborative set of specialized AI agents: Planner, Step
Definer, Extractor, and QA Agents, to tackle each stage of the RAG pipeline
with task-aware reasoning. Ambiguities may arise from underspecified queries,
sparse or indirect evidence in retrieved documents, or the need to integrate
information scattered across multiple sources. MA-RAG mitigates these
challenges by decomposing the problem into subtasks, such as query
disambiguation, evidence extraction, and answer synthesis, and dispatching them
to dedicated agents equipped with chain-of-thought prompting. These agents
communicate intermediate reasoning and progressively refine the retrieval and
synthesis process. Our design allows fine-grained control over information flow
without any model fine-tuning. Crucially, agents are invoked on demand,
enabling a dynamic and efficient workflow that avoids unnecessary computation.
This modular and reasoning-driven architecture enables MA-RAG to deliver
robust, interpretable results. Experiments on multi-hop and ambiguous QA
benchmarks demonstrate that MA-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art training-free
baselines and rivals fine-tuned systems, validating the effectiveness of
collaborative agent-based reasoning in RAG.

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) is often

experiments encompassing multiple LLMs variants of varying sizes aimed at
probing their preference with different prompts. Through experiments on
Question Answering, we show prompt preference consistency across LLMs of
different sizes. We also show that this consistency extends to other tasks,
such as Natural Language Inference. Utilizing this consistency, we propose a
method to use a smaller model to select effective prompt templates for a larger
model. We show that our method substantially reduces the cost of prompt
engineering while consistently matching performance with optimal prompts among
candidates. More importantly, our experiment shows the efficacy of our strategy
across fourteen LLMs and its applicability to a broad range of NLP tasks,
highlighting its robustness

with LLMs. We systematically survey state-of-the-art advances in synthesizing
LLMs and KGs for QA and compare and analyze these approaches in terms of
strength, limitations, and KG requirements. We then align the approaches with
QA and discuss how these approaches address the main challenges of different
complex QA. Finally, we summarize the advancements, evaluation metrics, and
benchmark datasets and highlight open challenges and opportunities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in handling
complex tasks through long-chain reasoning. However, the extensive reasoning
steps involved can significantly increase computational costs, posing
challenges for real-world deployment. Recent efforts have focused on optimizing
reasoning efficiency by shortening the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
processes through various approaches, such as length-aware prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning on CoT data with variable lengths, and reinforcement
learning with length penalties. Although these methods effectively reduce
reasoning length, they still necessitate an initial reasoning phase. More
recent approaches have attempted to integrate long-chain and short-chain
reasoning abilities into a single model, yet they still rely on manual control
to toggle between short and long CoT.In this work, we propose a novel approach
that autonomously switches between short and long reasoning chains based on
problem complexity. Our method begins with supervised fine-tuning of the base
model to equip both long-chain and short-chain reasoning abilities. We then
employ reinforcement learning to further balance short and long CoT generation
while maintaining accuracy through two key strategies: first, integrating
reinforcement learning with a long-short adaptive group-wise reward strategy to
assess prompt complexity and provide corresponding rewards; second,
implementing a logit-based reasoning mode switching loss to optimize the
model's initial token choice, thereby guiding the selection of the reasoning
type.Evaluations on mathematical datasets demonstrate that our model can
dynamically switch between long-chain and short-chain reasoning modes without
substantially sacrificing performance. This advancement enhances the
practicality of reasoning in large language models for real-world applications.

Abstract: Suicidal risk detection in adolescents is a critical challenge, yet existing
methods rely on language-specific models, limiting scalability and
generalization. This study introduces a novel language-agnostic framework for
suicidal risk assessment with large language models (LLMs). We generate Chinese
transcripts from speech using an ASR model and then employ LLMs with
prompt-based queries to extract suicidal risk-related features from these
transcripts. The extracted features are retained in both Chinese and English to
enable cross-linguistic analysis and then used to fine-tune corresponding
pretrained language models independently. Experimental results show that our
method achieves performance comparable to direct fine-tuning with ASR results
or to models trained solely on Chinese suicidal risk-related features,
demonstrating its potential to overcome language constraints and improve the
robustness of suicidal risk assessment.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的规模和内存需求限制了实际部署，需要高效的压缩策略。当前基于SVD的方法忽略截断残差矩阵，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出ResSVD方法，利用截断残差矩阵减少损失，并在固定压缩比例下选择性压缩后几层以减少误差传播。

Result: 在多种LLM和基准数据集上的评估表明，ResSVD性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ResSVD是一种高效且实用的LLM压缩方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a
wide range of downstream natural language processing tasks. Nevertheless, their
considerable sizes and memory demands hinder practical deployment, underscoring
the importance of developing efficient compression strategies. Singular value
decomposition (SVD) decomposes a matrix into orthogonal components, enabling
efficient low-rank approximation. This is particularly suitable for LLM
compression, where weight matrices often exhibit significant redundancy.
However, current SVD-based methods neglect the residual matrix from truncation,
resulting in significant truncation loss. Additionally, compressing all layers
of the model results in severe performance degradation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ResSVD, a new post-training SVD-based LLM compression
method. Specifically, we leverage the residual matrix generated during the
truncation process to reduce truncation loss. Moreover, under a fixed overall
compression ratio, we selectively compress the last few layers of the model,
which mitigates error propagation and significantly improves the performance of
compressed models.Comprehensive evaluations of ResSVD on diverse LLM families
and multiple benchmark datasets indicate that ResSVD consistently achieves
superior performance over existing counterpart methods, demonstrating its
practical effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字化世界文本遗产的挑战，尤其是历史文本中的拼写变体、结构碎片化和数字化错误，需要适应性的计算技术。目前缺乏对意大利历史文本的NER评估。

Method: 基于19世纪学者笔记（Giacomo Leopardi的Zibaldone）构建了一个包含2,899个实体引用的数据集，并比较了领域特定的BERT模型和先进的大型语言模型（如LLaMa3.1）的性能。

Result: 指令调优的模型在处理历史人文学科文本时遇到困难，而微调的NER模型即使在处理复杂实体类型（如文献引用）时表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 微调的NER模型更适合处理历史文本的命名实体识别任务，而大型语言模型在此类任务中表现不佳。

Abstract: The increased digitization of world's textual heritage poses significant
challenges for both computer science and literary studies. Overall, there is an
urgent need of computational techniques able to adapt to the challenges of
historical texts, such as orthographic and spelling variations, fragmentary
structure and digitization errors. The rise of large language models (LLMs) has
revolutionized natural language processing, suggesting promising applications
for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on historical documents. In spite of this,
no thorough evaluation has been proposed for Italian texts. This research tries
to fill the gap by proposing a new challenging dataset for entity extraction
based on a corpus of 19th century scholarly notes, i.e. Giacomo Leopardi's
Zibaldone (1898), containing 2,899 references to people, locations and literary
works. This dataset was used to carry out reproducible experiments with both
domain-specific BERT-based models and state-of-the-art LLMs such as LLaMa3.1.
Results show that instruction-tuned models encounter multiple difficulties
handling historical humanistic texts, while fine-tuned NER models offer more
robust performance even with challenging entity types such as bibliographic
references.

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中，EXSEARCH显著优于基线（如精确匹配分数提高7.8%）。

Conclusion: EXSEARCH及其扩展EXSEARCH-Zoo为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely integrated into information
retrieval to advance traditional techniques. However, effectively enabling LLMs
to seek accurate knowledge in complex tasks remains a challenge due to the
complexity of multi-hop queries as well as the irrelevant retrieved content. To
address these limitations, we propose EXSEARCH, an agentic search framework,
where the LLM learns to retrieve useful information as the reasoning unfolds
through a self-incentivized process. At each step, the LLM decides what to
retrieve (thinking), triggers an external retriever (search), and extracts
fine-grained evidence (recording) to support next-step reasoning. To enable LLM
with this capability, EXSEARCH adopts a Generalized Expectation-Maximization
algorithm. In the E-step, the LLM generates multiple search trajectories and
assigns an importance weight to each; the M-step trains the LLM on them with a
re-weighted loss function. This creates a self-incentivized loop, where the LLM
iteratively learns from its own generated data, progressively improving itself
for search. We further theoretically analyze this training process,
establishing convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on four
knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that EXSEARCH substantially outperforms
baselines, e.g., +7.8% improvement on exact match score. Motivated by these
promising results, we introduce EXSEARCH-Zoo, an extension that extends our
method to broader scenarios, to facilitate future work.

Result: 实验表明AweDist在多种开源模型中表现优于强基线。

Conclusion: AweDist能高效学习新token嵌入，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Current language models rely on static vocabularies determined at pretraining
time, which can lead to decreased performance and increased computational cost
for domains underrepresented in the original vocabulary. New tokens can be
added to solve this problem, when coupled with a good initialization for their
new embeddings. However, existing embedding initialization methods either
require expensive further training or pretraining of additional modules. In
this paper, we propose AweDist and show that by distilling representations
obtained using the original tokenization, we can quickly learn high-quality
input embeddings for new tokens. Experimental results with a wide range of
open-weight models show that AweDist is able to outperform even strong
baselines.

Conclusion: SeMe为知识感知模型合并提供了新范式，并揭示了语言模型的语义结构。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of Language Models (LMs) across diverse
tasks, no single model consistently outperforms others, necessitating efficient
methods to combine their strengths without expensive retraining. Existing model
merging techniques, such as parameter averaging and task-guided fusion, often
rely on data-dependent computations or fail to preserve internal knowledge,
limiting their robustness and scalability. We introduce SeMe (Semantic-based
Merging), a novel, data-free, and training-free approach that leverages latent
semantic alignment to merge LMs at a fine-grained, layer-wise level. Unlike
prior work, SeMe not only preserves model behaviors but also explicitly
stabilizes internal knowledge, addressing a critical gap in LM fusion. Through
extensive experiments across diverse architectures and tasks, we demonstrate
that SeMe outperforms existing methods in both performance and efficiency while
eliminating reliance on external data. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
knowledge-aware model merging and provides insights into the semantic structure
of LMs, paving the way for more scalable and interpretable model composition.

Abstract: This paper introduces Uniform Orthogonal Reinitialization Adaptation (UORA),
a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach for Large Language
Models (LLMs). UORA achieves state-of-the-art performance and parameter
efficiency by leveraging a low-rank approximation method to reduce the number
of trainable parameters. Unlike existing methods such as LoRA and VeRA, UORA
employs an interpolation-based reparametrization mechanism that selectively
reinitializes rows and columns in frozen projection matrices, guided by the
vector magnitude heuristic. This results in substantially fewer trainable
parameters compared to LoRA and outperforms VeRA in computation and storage
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate
UORA's superiority in achieving competitive fine-tuning performance with
negligible computational overhead. We demonstrate its performance on GLUE and
E2E benchmarks and its effectiveness in instruction-tuning large language
models and image classification models. Our contributions establish a new
paradigm for scalable and resource-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs.

Method: 提出 Pangu Light 框架，结合 Cross-Layer Attention Pruning (CLAP) 和 Stabilized LayerNorm Pruning (SLNP) 等重新初始化技术，优化模型宽度、深度、注意力头和 RMSNorm。

Result: Pangu Light 在效率和准确性上优于基准方法，如 Pangu Light-32B 在 Ascend NPU 上的表现优于 Qwen3-32B。

Conclusion: Pangu Light 通过创新的剪枝和权重调整策略，为 LLM 的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art capabilities across
numerous tasks, but their immense size and inference costs pose significant
computational challenges for practical deployment. While structured pruning
offers a promising avenue for model compression, existing methods often
struggle with the detrimental effects of aggressive, simultaneous width and
depth reductions, leading to substantial performance degradation. This paper
argues that a critical, often overlooked, aspect in making such aggressive
joint pruning viable is the strategic re-initialization and adjustment of
remaining weights to improve the model post-pruning training accuracies. We
introduce Pangu Light, a framework for LLM acceleration centered around
structured pruning coupled with novel weight re-initialization techniques
designed to address this ``missing piece''. Our framework systematically
targets multiple axes, including model width, depth, attention heads, and
RMSNorm, with its effectiveness rooted in novel re-initialization methods like
Cross-Layer Attention Pruning (CLAP) and Stabilized LayerNorm Pruning (SLNP)
that mitigate performance drops by providing the network a better training
starting point. Further enhancing efficiency, Pangu Light incorporates
specialized optimizations such as absorbing Post-RMSNorm computations and
tailors its strategies to Ascend NPU characteristics. The Pangu Light models
consistently exhibit a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off, outperforming
prominent baseline pruning methods like Nemotron and established LLMs like
Qwen3 series. For instance, on Ascend NPUs, Pangu Light-32B's 81.6 average
score and 2585 tokens/s throughput exceed Qwen3-32B's 80.9 average score and
2225 tokens/s.

Accessibility Project Challenge at INTERSPEECH 2025, which combines
cutting-edge speech recognition models with LLM-based generative error
correction (GER). We assess different configurations of model scales and
training strategies, incorporating specific hypothesis selection to improve
transcription accuracy. Experiments on the Speech Accessibility Project dataset
demonstrate the strength of our approach on structured and spontaneous speech,
while highlighting challenges in single-word recognition. Through comprehensive
analysis, we provide insights into the complementary roles of acoustic and
linguistic modeling in dysarthric speech recognition

TLDR: 论文提出视觉抽象思维（VAT），通过简化视觉信息提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理能力，实验显示VAT平均提升17%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像信息冗余可能降低多模态推理性能，受人类抽象思维启发，提出VAT以简化视觉推理过程。

Method: 引入VAT范式，用视觉抽象替代冗长的中间步骤或外部知识，减少冗余信息，聚焦关键视觉元素。

Result: VAT显著提升模型性能，平均增益17%，且与CoT兼容，适用于知识密集型任务。

Conclusion: VAT验证了抽象思维在视觉推理中的有效性，鼓励从人类认知角度探索更多推理范式。

Abstract: Images usually convey richer detail than text, but often include redundant
information which potentially downgrades multimodal reasoning performance. When
faced with lengthy or complex messages, humans tend to employ abstract thinking
to convert them into simple and concise abstracts. Inspired by this cognitive
strategy, we introduce Visual Abstract Thinking (VAT), a novel thinking
paradigm that prompts Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual
abstract instead of explicit verbal thoughts or elaborate guidance, permitting
a more concentrated visual reasoning mechanism. Explicit thinking, such as
Chain-of-thought (CoT) or tool-augmented approaches, increases the complexity
of reasoning process via inserting verbose intermediate steps, external
knowledge or visual information. In contrast, VAT reduces redundant visual
information and encourages models to focus their reasoning on more essential
visual elements. Experimental results show that VAT consistently empowers
different models, and achieves an average gain of 17% over GPT-4o baseline by
employing diverse types of visual abstracts, demonstrating that VAT can enhance
visual reasoning abilities for MLLMs regarding conceptual, structural and
relational reasoning tasks. VAT is also compatible with CoT in
knowledge-intensive multimodal reasoning tasks. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of visual reasoning via abstract thinking and encourage further
exploration of more diverse reasoning paradigms from the perspective of human
cognition.

Method: 在2D-CNN模型上测试五种KAN层配置，并将最佳配置应用于基于Transformer的模型，评估其在五个SLU数据集上的表现。

Result: KAN层可有效替代线性层，在多数情况下性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: KAN层在SLU任务中具有潜力，且与线性层在注意力机制上有所不同。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional neural architectures, yet their application to
speech processing remains under explored. This work presents the first
investigation of KANs for Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) tasks. We
experiment with 2D-CNN models on two datasets, integrating KAN layers in five
different configurations within the dense block. The best-performing setup,
which places a KAN layer between two linear layers, is directly applied to
transformer-based models and evaluated on five SLU datasets with increasing
complexity. Our results show that KAN layers can effectively replace the linear
layers, achieving comparable or superior performance in most cases. Finally, we
provide insights into how KAN and linear layers on top of transformers
differently attend to input regions of the raw waveforms.

TLDR: THiNK是一个基于Bloom分类法的多智能体反馈驱动评估框架，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）的高阶思维能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM的高阶思维能力是一个基本挑战，尤其是在超越表面准确性的任务中。

Method: THiNK通过问题生成、批评和修订的迭代任务，结合逐步反思和优化，系统评估低阶和高阶思维能力。

Result: 结果显示，LLM在低阶任务上表现良好，但在实际应用中应用知识时表现不佳，结构化反馈显著提升了高阶思维表现。

Conclusion: THiNK为LLM推理的评估和改进提供了可扩展的方法，并基于学习科学提供了新的评估方向。

Abstract: Assessing higher-order thinking skills in large language models (LLMs)
remains a fundamental challenge, especially in tasks that go beyond
surface-level accuracy. In this work, we propose THiNK (Testing Higher-order
Notion of Knowledge), a multi-agent, feedback-driven evaluation framework
grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy. THiNK frames reasoning assessment as an iterative
task of problem generation, critique, and revision, encouraging LLMs to
think-aloud through step-by-step reflection and refinement. This enables a
systematic evaluation of both lower-order (e.g., remember, understand) and
higher-order (e.g., evaluate, create) thinking skills. We apply THiNK to seven
state-of-the-art LLMs and perform a detailed cognitive analysis of their
outputs. Results reveal that while models reliably perform lower-order
categories well, they struggle with applying knowledge in realistic contexts
and exhibit limited abstraction. Structured feedback loops significantly
improve reasoning performance, particularly in higher-order thinking.
Qualitative evaluations further confirm that THiNK-guided outputs better align
with domain logic and problem structure. The code of our framework provides a
scalable methodology for probing and enhancing LLM reasoning, offering new
directions for evaluation grounded in learning science, which is available at
our GitHub repository.

Method: 采用分而治之策略，结合局部评分和全局评估，引入混合上下文学习和主动学习算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了长文本质量评估的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of long-form, model-generated text is challenging, even
with advanced LLM-as-a-Judge methods, due to performance degradation as input
length increases. To address this issue, we propose a divide-and-conquer
approach, which breaks down the comprehensive evaluation task into a series of
localized scoring tasks, followed by a final global assessment. This strategy
allows for more granular and manageable evaluations, ensuring that each segment
of the text is assessed in isolation for both coherence and quality, while also
accounting for the overall structure and consistency of the entire piece.
Moreover, we introduce a hybrid in-context learning approach that leverages
human annotations to enhance the performance of both local and global
evaluations. By incorporating human-generated feedback directly into the
evaluation process, this method allows the model to better align with human
judgment. Finally, we develop an uncertainty-based active learning algorithm
that efficiently selects data samples for human annotation, thereby reducing
annotation costs in practical scenarios. Experimental results show that the
proposed evaluation framework outperforms several representative baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

TLDR: A-CFG动态调整无条件输入，利用模型预测置信度，优化迭代生成过程中的分类器自由引导（CFG），显著提升生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFG使用静态无条件输入，在迭代生成过程中可能不够高效，因为模型不确定性动态变化。

Method: 提出A-CFG方法，通过识别低置信度标记并临时重新掩码，创建动态无条件输入，聚焦于模糊区域。

Result: 在多种语言生成任务中，A-CFG比标准CFG表现更优，如GPQA上提升3.9分。

Conclusion: 动态调整引导机制以适应模型不确定性，对迭代生成具有显著优势。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances controllability in
generative models by interpolating conditional and unconditional predictions.
However, standard CFG often employs a static unconditional input, which can be
suboptimal for iterative generation processes where model uncertainty varies
dynamically. We introduce Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance (A-CFG), a novel
method that tailors the unconditional input by leveraging the model's
instantaneous predictive confidence. At each step of an iterative (masked)
diffusion language model, A-CFG identifies tokens in the currently generated
sequence for which the model exhibits low confidence. These tokens are
temporarily re-masked to create a dynamic, localized unconditional input. This
focuses CFG's corrective influence precisely on areas of ambiguity, leading to
more effective guidance. We integrate A-CFG into a state-of-the-art masked
diffusion language model and demonstrate its efficacy. Experiments on diverse
language generation benchmarks show that A-CFG yields substantial improvements
over standard CFG, achieving, for instance, a 3.9 point gain on GPQA. Our work
highlights the benefit of dynamically adapting guidance mechanisms to model
uncertainty in iterative generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康服务资源有限，等待时间长，促使人们转向LLMs寻求帮助，但LLMs在多轮心理健康对话中的能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出MedAgent框架生成合成数据，创建MHSD数据集（2,200多组对话），并开发MultiSenseEval评估框架。

Result: 前沿推理模型在患者中心沟通和高级诊断能力上平均得分仅31%，且性能随对话轮次增加而下降。

Conclusion: 研究提供了合成数据生成框架、数据集和评估工具，为LLMs在心理健康对话中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Limited access to mental healthcare, extended wait times, and increasing
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led individuals to turn to
LLMs for fulfilling their mental health needs. However, examining the
multi-turn mental health conversation capabilities of LLMs remains
under-explored. Existing evaluation frameworks typically focus on diagnostic
accuracy and win-rates and often overlook alignment with patient-specific
goals, values, and personalities required for meaningful conversations. To
address this, we introduce MedAgent, a novel framework for synthetically
generating realistic, multi-turn mental health sensemaking conversations and
use it to create the Mental Health Sensemaking Dialogue (MHSD) dataset,
comprising over 2,200 patient-LLM conversations. Additionally, we present
MultiSenseEval, a holistic framework to evaluate the multi-turn conversation
abilities of LLMs in healthcare settings using human-centric criteria. Our
findings reveal that frontier reasoning models yield below-par performance for
patient-centric communication and struggle at advanced diagnostic capabilities
with average score of 31%. Additionally, we observed variation in model
performance based on patient's persona and performance drop with increasing
turns in the conversation. Our work provides a comprehensive synthetic data
generation framework, a dataset and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in
multi-turn mental health conversations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闭源LLMs在微调后可能学习数据集特定启发式方法，导致在OOD数据上鲁棒性下降，现有方法不适用于闭源模型。

Method: 采用数据为中心的策略，包括对复杂OOD数据上采样挑战性训练样本，对简单OOD数据用LLM生成样本替换部分训练集。

Result: 复杂OOD数据鲁棒性提升1.5%，简单OOD数据提升3.7%；闭源自回归LLMs比编码器模型更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 闭源自回归LLMs更适合作为基准模型，数据策略选择需根据OOD数据复杂度。

Abstract: Closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular,
with impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks.
These models can be fine-tuned to further improve performance, but this often
results in the models learning from dataset-specific heuristics that reduce
their robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing methods to improve
robustness either perform poorly, or are non-applicable to closed-source models
because they assume access to model internals, or the ability to change the
model's training procedure. In this work, we investigate strategies to improve
the robustness of closed-source LLMs through data-centric methods that do not
require access to model internals. We find that the optimal strategy depends on
the complexity of the OOD data. For highly complex OOD datasets, upsampling
more challenging training examples can improve robustness by up to 1.5%. For
less complex OOD datasets, replacing a portion of the training set with
LLM-generated examples can improve robustness by 3.7%. More broadly, we find
that large-scale closed-source autoregressive LLMs are substantially more
robust than commonly used encoder models, and are a more appropriate choice of
baseline going forward.

Motivation: 研究biaffine评分未归一化导致模型过参数化的问题，提出归一化改进方法。

Method: 在六个数据集上实验，对比归一化与非归一化biaffine评分的解析性能，使用BiLSTM模型。

Result: 归一化后模型在部分数据集上性能超越现有方法，且参数更少、样本需求更低。

Conclusion: 归一化biaffine评分可显著提升依赖解析效率，减少模型复杂度。

Abstract: Dependency parsing is the task of inferring natural language structure, often
approached by modeling word interactions via attention through biaffine
scoring. This mechanism works like self-attention in Transformers, where scores
are calculated for every pair of words in a sentence. However, unlike
Transformer attention, biaffine scoring does not use normalization prior to
taking the softmax of the scores. In this paper, we provide theoretical
evidence and empirical results revealing that a lack of normalization
necessarily results in overparameterized parser models, where the extra
parameters compensate for the sharp softmax outputs produced by high variance
inputs to the biaffine scoring function. We argue that biaffine scoring can be
made substantially more efficient by performing score normalization. We conduct
experiments on six datasets for semantic and syntactic dependency parsing using
a one-hop parser. We train N-layer stacked BiLSTMs and evaluate the parser's
performance with and without normalizing biaffine scores. Normalizing allows us
to beat the state of the art on two datasets, with fewer samples and trainable
parameters. Code: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EfficientSDP-70C1

Abstract: Recent large language models such as Gemini-1.5, DeepSeek-V3, and Llama-4
increasingly adopt Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, which offer strong
efficiency-performance trade-offs by activating only a fraction of the model
per token. Yet academic researchers still lack a fully open, end-to-end MoE
platform for investigating scaling, routing, and expert behavior. We release
FLAME-MoE, a completely open-source research suite composed of seven
decoder-only models, ranging from 38M to 1.7B active parameters, whose
architecture--64 experts with top-8 gating and 2 shared experts--closely
reflects modern production LLMs. All training data pipelines, scripts, logs,
and checkpoints are publicly available to enable reproducible experimentation.
Across six evaluation tasks, FLAME-MoE improves average accuracy by up to 3.4
points over dense baselines trained with identical FLOPs. Leveraging full
training trace transparency, we present initial analyses showing that (i)
experts increasingly specialize on distinct token subsets, (ii) co-activation
matrices remain sparse, reflecting diverse expert usage, and (iii) routing
behavior stabilizes early in training. All code, training logs, and model
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/cmu-flame/FLAME-MoE.

Result: 在MS-TOD数据集上，MAP显著提升了任务成功率和会话效率，同时在单会话任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MS-TOD和MAP为多会话TOD提供了新基准和有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems primarily focus on
single-session dialogues, limiting their effectiveness in long-term memory
augmentation. To address this challenge, we introduce a MS-TOD dataset, the
first multi-session TOD dataset designed to retain long-term memory across
sessions, enabling fewer turns and more efficient task completion. This defines
a new benchmark task for evaluating long-term memory in multi-session TOD.
Based on this new dataset, we propose a Memory-Active Policy (MAP) that
improves multi-session dialogue efficiency through a two-stage approach. 1)
Memory-Guided Dialogue Planning retrieves intent-aligned history, identifies
key QA units via a memory judger, refines them by removing redundant questions,
and generates responses based on the reconstructed memory. 2) Proactive
Response Strategy detects and correct errors or omissions, ensuring efficient
and accurate task completion. We evaluate MAP on MS-TOD dataset, focusing on
response quality and effectiveness of the proactive strategy. Experiments on
MS-TOD demonstrate that MAP significantly improves task success and turn
efficiency in multi-session scenarios, while maintaining competitive
performance on conventional single-session tasks.

Abstract: Time plays a critical role in how information is generated, retrieved, and
interpreted. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of Temporal
Information Retrieval and Temporal Question Answering, two research areas aimed
at handling and understanding time-sensitive information. As the amount of
time-stamped content from sources like news articles, web archives, and

temporal intent, normalizing time expressions, ordering events, and reasoning
over evolving or ambiguous facts. These challenges are critical across many
dynamic and time-sensitive domains, from news and encyclopedias to science,
history, and social media. We review both traditional approaches and modern
neural methods, including those that use transformer models and Large Language

multi-hop reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), alongside
benchmark datasets and evaluation strategies that test temporal robustness,

Conclusion: KnowTrace通过结构化知识和自举机制显著提升了RAG的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) furnish large
language models (LLMs) with iterative retrievals of relevant information to
handle complex multi-hop questions. These methods typically alternate between
LLM reasoning and retrieval to accumulate external information into the LLM's
context. However, the ever-growing context inherently imposes an increasing
burden on the LLM to perceive connections among critical information pieces,
with futile reasoning steps further exacerbating this overload issue. In this
paper, we present KnowTrace, an elegant RAG framework to (1) mitigate the
context overload and (2) bootstrap higher-quality multi-step reasoning. Instead
of simply piling the retrieved contents, KnowTrace autonomously traces out
desired knowledge triplets to organize a specific knowledge graph relevant to
the input question. Such a structured workflow not only empowers the LLM with
an intelligible context for inference, but also naturally inspires a reflective
mechanism of knowledge backtracing to identify contributive LLM generations as
process supervision data for self-bootstrapping. Extensive experiments show
that KnowTrace consistently surpasses existing methods across three multi-hop
question answering benchmarks, and the bootstrapped version further amplifies
the gains.

Abstract: Climate change adaptation requires the understanding of disruptive weather
impacts on society, where large language models (LLMs) might be applicable.
However, their effectiveness is under-explored due to the difficulty of
high-quality corpus collection and the lack of available benchmarks. The
climate-related events stored in regional newspapers record how communities
adapted and recovered from disasters. However, the processing of the original
corpus is non-trivial. In this study, we first develop a disruptive weather
impact dataset with a four-stage well-crafted construction pipeline. Then, we

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出自适应推理模型（ARM），通过动态选择推理格式解决大型推理模型因任务难度不同而导致的“过度思考”问题，显著提高效率和训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型无法根据任务难度调整推理令牌使用，导致“过度思考”问题，影响效率和自主性。

Method: 提出ARM模型，采用Ada-GRPO训练方法，支持三种高效推理格式和一种复杂格式，动态选择最优格式。

Result: ARM平均减少30%令牌使用（最高70%），性能接近仅依赖复杂格式的模型，训练速度提升2倍。

Conclusion: ARM通过自适应推理格式选择，显著提高效率和性能，支持多种推理模式，适用于不同场景。

Abstract: While large reasoning models demonstrate strong performance on complex tasks,
they lack the ability to adjust reasoning token usage based on task difficulty.
This often leads to the "overthinking" problem -- excessive and unnecessary
reasoning -- which, although potentially mitigated by human intervention to
control the token budget, still fundamentally contradicts the goal of achieving
fully autonomous AI. In this work, we propose Adaptive Reasoning Model (ARM), a
reasoning model capable of adaptively selecting appropriate reasoning formats
based on the task at hand. These formats include three efficient ones -- Direct
Answer, Short CoT, and Code -- as well as a more elaborate format, Long CoT. To
train ARM, we introduce Ada-GRPO, an adaptation of Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), which addresses the format collapse issue in traditional
GRPO. Ada-GRPO enables ARM to achieve high token efficiency, reducing tokens by
an average of 30%, and up to 70%, while maintaining performance comparable to
the model that relies solely on Long CoT. Furthermore, not only does it improve
inference efficiency through reduced token generation, but it also brings a 2x
speedup in training. In addition to the default Adaptive Mode, ARM supports two
additional reasoning modes: 1) Instruction-Guided Mode, which allows users to
explicitly specify the reasoning format via special tokens -- ideal when the
appropriate format is known for a batch of tasks. 2) Consensus-Guided Mode,
which aggregates the outputs of the three efficient formats and resorts to Long
CoT in case of disagreement, prioritizing performance with higher token usage.

*Anmol Mekala,Anirudh Atmakuru,Yixiao Song,Marzena Karpinska,Mohit Iyyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文系统评估了量化方法对长输入（>64K tokens）和长输出任务的LLM性能影响，发现8位量化性能下降较小（~0.8%），而4位量化性能损失显著（最高59%），且非英语输入时表现更差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化可以降低LLM的内存需求和推理延迟，但可能影响性能，尤其是在长上下文任务中。本文首次系统评估量化LLM在长输入和长输出任务中的表现。

Method: 评估了五种量化方法（FP8、GPTQ-int8、AWQ-int4、GPTQ-int4、BNB-nf4）和五种模型（Llama-3.1 8B和70B；Qwen-2.5 7B、32B和72B），覆盖9.7K测试样本。

Result: 8位量化平均性能下降0.8%，4位量化性能损失显著（最高59%），非英语输入时表现更差。不同模型、量化方法和任务表现差异大。

Conclusion: 部署量化LLM需根据任务、模型和量化方法进行谨慎评估，尤其是在长上下文和非英语场景中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows exceeding 128K
tokens, but this comes with significant memory requirements and high inference
latency. Quantization can mitigate these costs, but may degrade performance. In
this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of quantized LLMs on
tasks with long-inputs (>64K tokens) and long-form outputs. Our evaluation
spans 9.7K test examples, five quantization methods (FP8, GPTQ-int8, AWQ-int4,
GPTQ-int4, BNB-nf4), and five models (Llama-3.1 8B and 70B; Qwen-2.5 7B, 32B,
and 72B). We find that, on average, 8-bit quantization preserves accuracy
(~0.8% drop), whereas 4-bit methods lead to substantial losses, especially for
tasks involving long context inputs (drops of up to 59%). This degradation
tends to worsen when the input is in a language other than English. Crucially,
the effects of quantization depend heavily on the quantization method, model,
and task. For instance, while Qwen-2.5 72B remains robust under BNB-nf4,
Llama-3.1 70B experiences a 32% performance drop on the same task. These
findings highlight the importance of a careful, task-specific evaluation before
deploying quantized LLMs, particularly in long-context scenarios and with
languages other than English.

TLDR: OmniCharacter是一个低延迟的语音-语言交互模型，旨在提升角色扮演代理（RPAs）的沉浸感，通过结合角色特定的人格和声音特质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注文本对话模拟，忽略了声音特质对沉浸感的重要性。

Method: 提出OmniCharacter模型，结合语音和语言响应，并构建OmniCharacter-10K数据集。

Result: 实验显示，模型在内容和风格上优于现有方法，延迟低至289ms。

Conclusion: OmniCharacter为RPAs提供了更沉浸的交互体验。

Abstract: Role-Playing Agents (RPAs), benefiting from large language models, is an
emerging interactive AI system that simulates roles or characters with diverse
personalities. However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues
among roles in textual form, neglecting the role's voice traits (e.g., voice
style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to
be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we
propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction
model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter
enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and
vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and
language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we
construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive
characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and dynamic
speech response (135K). Experimental results showcase that our method yields
better responses in terms of both content and style compared to existing RPAs
and mainstream speech-language models, with a response latency as low as 289ms.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: MASKSEARCH是一种新型预训练框架，通过检索增强掩码预测任务（RAMP）提升LLM的通用检索和推理能力，结合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）优化下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于训练的方法受限于任务特定数据，无法充分发挥代理的通用搜索能力，因此需要一种更通用的预训练框架。

Method: 提出RAMP任务进行预训练，结合SFT（多代理系统和自进化教师模型）和RL（DAPO框架和混合奖励系统）进行下游任务训练，并采用课程学习策略。

Result: 在开放域多跳问答任务中，MASKSEARCH显著提升了LLM搜索代理在域内和域外任务中的表现。

Conclusion: MASKSEARCH框架有效增强了LLM的通用检索和推理能力，为代理技术提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) represent a classic paradigm
where models enhance generative capabilities using external knowledge retrieved
via a specialized module. Recent advancements in Agent techniques enable Large
Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously utilize tools for retrieval, planning,
and reasoning. While existing training-based methods show promise, their
agentic abilities are limited by inherent characteristics of the task-specific
data used during training. To further enhance the universal search capability
of agents, we propose a novel pre-training framework, MASKSEARCH. In the
pre-training stage, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Mask Prediction (RAMP)
task, where the model learns to leverage search tools to fill masked spans on a
large number of pre-training data, thus acquiring universal retrieval and
reasoning capabilities for LLMs. After that, the model is trained on downstream
tasks to achieve further improvement. We apply both Supervised Fine-tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training. For SFT, we combine
agent-based and distillation-based methods to generate training data, starting
with a multi-agent system consisting of a planner, rewriter, observer, and
followed by a self-evolving teacher model. While for RL, we employ DAPO as the
training framework and adopt a hybrid reward system consisting of answer
rewards and format rewards. Additionally, we introduce a curriculum learning
approach that allows the model to learn progressively from easier to more
challenging instances based on the number of masked spans. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our framework in the scenario of open-domain multi-hop
question answering. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
MASKSEARCH significantly enhances the performance of LLM-based search agents on
both in-domain and out-of-domain downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有基于概念的可解释方法在文本领域应用有限，依赖预定义概念或生成难以理解的解释，影响用户信任。

Method: ECO-Concept采用对象中心架构自动提取概念，用大语言模型评估可理解性，并指导模型微调。

Result: 实验表明ECO-Concept在多项任务中表现优异，生成的概念更易理解。

Conclusion: ECO-Concept解决了自动发现可理解概念的难题，提升了可解释AI的实用性。

Abstract: Concept-based explainable approaches have emerged as a promising method in
explainable AI because they can interpret models in a way that aligns with
human reasoning. However, their adaption in the text domain remains limited.
Most existing methods rely on predefined concept annotations and cannot
discover unseen concepts, while other methods that extract concepts without
supervision often produce explanations that are not intuitively comprehensible
to humans, potentially diminishing user trust. These methods fall short of
discovering comprehensible concepts automatically. To address this issue, we
propose \textbf{ECO-Concept}, an intrinsically interpretable framework to
discover comprehensible concepts with no concept annotations. ECO-Concept first
utilizes an object-centric architecture to extract semantic concepts
automatically. Then the comprehensibility of the extracted concepts is
evaluated by large language models. Finally, the evaluation result guides the
subsequent model fine-tuning to obtain more understandable explanations.
Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance across diverse
tasks. Further concept evaluations validate that the concepts learned by
ECO-Concept surpassed current counterparts in comprehensibility.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新方法SelfReflect，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）如何用字符串总结其内部答案分布的不确定性，并验证其优于其他指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法仅提供百分比数字，无法充分表达LLM的内部不确定性分布。

Method: 提出SelfReflect指标，通过字符串总结LLM的内部答案分布，并与其他方法（如LLM判断和嵌入比较）对比。

Result: SelfReflect能区分候选总结字符串的细微差异，且与人类判断一致，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SelfReflect为LLM不确定性的新形式提供了基础，未来可进一步研究其通用性。

Abstract: To reveal when a large language model (LLM) is uncertain about a response,
uncertainty quantification commonly produces percentage numbers along with the
output. But is this all we can do? We argue that in the output space of LLMs,
the space of strings, exist strings expressive enough to summarize the
distribution over output strings the LLM deems possible. We lay a foundation
for this new avenue of uncertainty explication and present SelfReflect, a
theoretically-motivated metric to assess how faithfully a string summarizes an
LLM's internal answer distribution. We show that SelfReflect is able to
discriminate even subtle differences of candidate summary strings and that it
aligns with human judgement, outperforming alternative metrics such as LLM
judges and embedding comparisons. With SelfReflect, we investigate a number of
self-summarization methods and find that even state-of-the-art reasoning models
struggle to explicate their internal uncertainty. But we find that faithful
summarizations can be generated by sampling and summarizing. Our metric enables
future works towards this universal form of LLM uncertainties.

<details>

Motivation: 当前推理大语言模型在复杂任务中表现不佳，缺乏系统性解决问题的能力，亟需改进。

Method: 通过定性和定量分析，识别了推理模型的常见失败模式，如无效推理步骤和冗余探索。

Result: 研究发现模型在简单任务中表现尚可，但随着复杂度增加性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: 建议开发新指标和工具，以评估推理过程的结构而非仅关注最终输出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
through test-time computation (TTC) techniques such as chain-of-thought
prompting and tree-based reasoning. However, we argue that current reasoning
LLMs (RLLMs) lack the ability to systematically explore the solution space.
This paper formalizes what constitutes systematic problem solving and
identifies common failure modes that reveal reasoning LLMs to be wanderers
rather than systematic explorers. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, we uncover persistent issues: invalid
reasoning steps, redundant explorations, hallucinated or unfaithful
conclusions, and so on. Our findings suggest that current models' performance
can appear to be competent on simple tasks yet degrade sharply as complexity
increases. Based on the findings, we advocate for new metrics and tools that
evaluate not just final outputs but the structure of the reasoning process
itself.

Conclusion: 论文的基准和模型为评估和推动LMMs在漫画叙事领域的应用提供了全面基础。

Abstract: Manga, or Japanese comics, is a richly multimodal narrative form that blends
images and text in complex ways. Teaching large multimodal models (LMMs) to
understand such narratives at a human-like level could help manga creators
reflect on and refine their stories. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks
for multimodal manga understanding: MangaOCR, which targets in-page text
recognition, and MangaVQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate contextual
understanding through visual question answering. MangaVQA consists of 526
high-quality, manually constructed question-answer pairs, enabling reliable
evaluation across diverse narrative and visual scenarios. Building on these
benchmarks, we develop MangaLMM, a manga-specialized model finetuned from the
open-source LMM Qwen2.5-VL to jointly handle both tasks. Through extensive
experiments, including comparisons with proprietary models such as GPT-4o and
Gemini 2.5, we assess how well LMMs understand manga. Our benchmark and model
provide a comprehensive foundation for evaluating and advancing LMMs in the
richly narrative domain of manga.

Abstract: The 1st SpeechWellness Challenge conveys the need for speech-based suicide
risk assessment in adolescents. This study investigates a multimodal approach
for this challenge, integrating automatic transcription with WhisperX,
linguistic embeddings from Chinese RoBERTa, and audio embeddings from WavLM.
Additionally, handcrafted acoustic features -- including MFCCs, spectral
contrast, and pitch-related statistics -- were incorporated. We explored three
fusion strategies: early concatenation, modality-specific processing, and
weighted attention with mixup regularization. Results show that weighted
attention provided the best generalization, achieving 69% accuracy on the
development set, though a performance gap between development and test sets
highlights generalization challenges. Our findings, strictly tied to the
MINI-KID framework, emphasize the importance of refining embedding
representations and fusion mechanisms to enhance classification reliability.

Motivation: 反驳激进概念先天论，证明人类能学习新概念。

Method: 回顾前人论点，识别三个关键点，并用计算机科学和信息理论形式化观点。

Result: 人类确实能学习新概念。

Conclusion: 通过科学形式化，支持人类学习新概念的观点。

Abstract: Though humans seem to be remarkable learners, arguments in cognitive science
and philosophy of mind have long maintained that learning something
fundamentally new is impossible. Specifically, Jerry Fodor's arguments for
radical concept nativism hold that most, if not all, concepts are innate and
that what many call concept learning never actually leads to the acquisition of
new concepts. These arguments have deeply affected cognitive science, and many
believe that the counterarguments to radical concept nativism have been either
unsuccessful or only apply to a narrow class of concepts. This paper first
reviews the features and limitations of prior arguments. We then identify three
critical points - related to issues of expressive power, conceptual structure,
and concept possession - at which the arguments in favor of radical concept
nativism diverge from describing actual human cognition. We use ideas from
computer science and information theory to formalize the relevant ideas in ways
that are arguably more scientifically productive. We conclude that, as a
result, there is an important sense in which people do indeed learn new
concepts.

Result: 发现过度拒绝与安全边界区域的错位相关，RASS能有效识别和缓解这一问题，并扩展到多语言场景。

Conclusion: RASS为模型安全决策提供了更精确的视角，并构建了MORBench评估集以支持多语言模型评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet they often refuse to answer legitimate queries-a
phenomenon known as overrefusal. Overrefusal typically stems from
over-conservative safety alignment, causing models to treat many reasonable
prompts as potentially risky. To systematically understand this issue, we probe
and leverage the models'safety decision boundaries to analyze and mitigate
overrefusal. Our findings reveal that overrefusal is closely tied to
misalignment at these boundary regions, where models struggle to distinguish
subtle differences between benign and harmful content. Building on these
insights, we present RASS, an automated framework for prompt generation and
selection that strategically targets overrefusal prompts near the safety
boundary. By harnessing steering vectors in the representation space, RASS
efficiently identifies and curates boundary-aligned prompts, enabling more
effective and targeted mitigation of overrefusal. This approach not only
provides a more precise and interpretable view of model safety decisions but
also seamlessly extends to multilingual scenarios.We have explored the safety
decision boundaries of various LLMs and construct the MORBench evaluation set
to facilitate robust assessment of model safety and helpfulness across multiple
languages. Code and datasets will be released at

Conclusion: RedactOR框架在实际医疗数据管道中展现了高效性和实用性，提供了关键部署经验。

Abstract: Ensuring clinical data privacy while preserving utility is critical for
AI-driven healthcare and data analytics. Existing de-identification (De-ID)
methods, including rule-based techniques, deep learning models, and large
language models (LLMs), often suffer from recall errors, limited
generalization, and inefficiencies, limiting their real-world applicability. We
propose a fully automated, multi-modal framework, RedactOR for de-identifying
structured and unstructured electronic health records, including clinical audio
records. Our framework employs cost-efficient De-ID strategies, including
intelligent routing, hybrid rule and LLM based approaches, and a two-step audio
redaction approach. We present a retrieval-based entity relexicalization
approach to ensure consistent substitutions of protected entities, thereby
enhancing data coherence for downstream applications. We discuss key design
desiderata, de-identification and relexicalization methodology, and modular
architecture of RedactX and its integration with the Oracle Health Clinical AI
system. Evaluated on the i2b2 2014 De-ID dataset using standard metrics with
strict recall, our approach achieves competitive performance while optimizing
token usage to reduce LLM costs. Finally, we discuss key lessons and insights
from deployment in real-world AI- driven healthcare data pipelines.

Abstract: AI systems have increasingly become our gateways to the Internet. We argue
that just as advertising has driven the monetization of web search and social
media, so too will commercial incentives shape the content served by AI. Unlike
traditional media, however, the outputs of these systems are dynamic,
personalized, and lack clear provenance -- raising concerns for transparency
and regulation. In this paper, we envision how commercial content could be
delivered through generative AI-based systems. Based on the requirements of key
stakeholders -- advertisers, consumers, and platforms -- we propose design
principles for commercially-influenced AI systems. We then outline high-level
strategies for end users to identify and mitigate commercial biases from model
outputs. Finally, we conclude with open questions and a call to action towards
these goals.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong performance in
structured domains such as mathematics and programming; however, they often
lack pedagogical coherence and realistic teaching behaviors. To bridge this
gap, we introduce Pedagogy-R1, a framework that adapts LRMs for classroom use
through three innovations: (1) a distillation-based pipeline that filters and
refines model outputs for instruction-tuning, (2) the Well-balanced Educational
Benchmark (WBEB), which evaluates performance across subject knowledge,
pedagogical knowledge, tracing, essay scoring, and teacher decision-making, and
(3) a Chain-of-Pedagogy (CoP) prompting strategy for generating and eliciting
teacher-style reasoning. Our mixed-method evaluation combines quantitative
metrics with qualitative analysis, providing the first systematic assessment of
LRMs' pedagogical strengths and limitations.

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种利用生成式人工智能自动编写化学分类程序的方法，用于高效且可解释的化学结构分类，并在ChEBI数据库中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学结构分类在多个领域至关重要，但现有方法要么依赖人工规则，要么缺乏可解释性。

Abstract: Accurately classifying chemical structures is essential for cheminformatics
and bioinformatics, including tasks such as identifying bioactive compounds of
interest, screening molecules for toxicity to humans, finding non-organic
compounds with desirable material properties, or organizing large chemical
libraries for drug discovery or environmental monitoring. However, manual
classification is labor-intensive and difficult to scale to large chemical
databases. Existing automated approaches either rely on manually constructed
classification rules, or the use of deep learning methods that lack
explainability.
  This work presents an approach that uses generative artificial intelligence
to automatically write chemical classifier programs for classes in the Chemical
Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. These programs can be used
for efficient deterministic run-time classification of SMILES structures, with
natural language explanations. The programs themselves constitute an
explainable computable ontological model of chemical class nomenclature, which
we call the ChEBI Chemical Class Program Ontology (C3PO).
  We validated our approach against the ChEBI database, and compared our
results against state of the art deep learning models. We also demonstrate the
use of C3PO to classify out-of-distribution examples taken from metabolomics
repositories and natural product databases. We also demonstrate the potential
use of our approach to find systematic classification errors in existing
chemical databases, and show how an ensemble artificial intelligence approach
combining generated ontologies, automated literature search, and multimodal
vision models can be used to pinpoint potential errors requiring expert
validation

Motivation: 工业文档结构复杂且内容碎片化，现有LLM检索增强生成方法缺乏定量权重和可追溯推理路径，难以提供透明决策支持。

Method: RAD方法自动提取文档关键准则，构建加权层次决策模型，并在模型指导下生成结构化报告。

Result: 实验表明，RAD生成的决策报告在细节、合理性和结构上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAD在复杂决策支持场景中具有应用价值和潜力。

Abstract: Various industries have produced a large number of documents such as
industrial plans, technical guidelines, and regulations that are structurally
complex and content-wise fragmented. This poses significant challenges for
experts and decision-makers in terms of retrieval and understanding. Although
existing LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods can provide
context-related suggestions, they lack quantitative weighting and traceable
reasoning paths, making it difficult to offer multi-level and transparent
decision support. To address this issue, this paper proposes the RAD method,
which integrates Multi-Criteria Decision Making with the semantic understanding
capabilities of LLMs. The method automatically extracts key criteria from
industry documents, builds a weighted hierarchical decision model, and
generates structured reports under model guidance. The RAD framework introduces
explicit weight assignment and reasoning chains in decision generation to
ensure accuracy, completeness, and traceability. Experiments show that in
various decision-making tasks, the decision reports generated by RAD
significantly outperform existing methods in terms of detail, rationality, and
structure, demonstrating its application value and potential in complex
decision support scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学推理在AI中至关重要，但现有方法在创造性和严谨性之间存在矛盾。LLMs擅长生成答案但难以验证，符号证明器严谨但缺乏创造力。

Method: 提出ECP框架，整合LLM的枚举和模式驱动猜想与形式化定理证明，并构建ConstructiveBench数据集。

Result: ECP将答案构建准确率从14.54%提升至45.06%，并与DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B结合，定理证明准确率从9.86%提升至25.01%。

Conclusion: ECP框架有效结合了神经与符号方法的优势，显著提升了数学推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning lies at the heart of artificial intelligence,
underpinning applications in education, program verification, and
research-level mathematical discovery. Mathematical competitions, in
particular, present two challenging problem types: theorem-proving, requiring
rigorous proofs of stated conclusions, and answer-construction, involving
hypothesizing and formally verifying mathematical objects. Large Language
Models (LLMs) effectively generate creative candidate answers but struggle with
formal verification, while symbolic provers ensure rigor but cannot efficiently
handle creative conjecture generation. We introduce the
Enumerate-Conjecture-Prove (ECP) framework, a modular neuro-symbolic method
integrating LLM-based enumeration and pattern-driven conjecturing with formal
theorem proving. We present ConstructiveBench, a dataset of 3,431
answer-construction problems in various math competitions with verified Lean
formalizations. On the ConstructiveBench dataset, ECP improves the accuracy of
answer construction from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline of 14.54% to
45.06% with the gpt-4.1-mini model. Moreover, combining with ECP's constructed
answers, the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B model generates correct
proofs for 858 of the 3,431 constructive problems in Lean, achieving 25.01%
accuracy, compared to 9.86% for symbolic-only baselines. Our code and dataset
are publicly available at GitHub and HuggingFace, respectively.

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对小型同质模型，难以适用于大型异构模型，且存在灾难性遗忘和知识吸收不足的问题。

Method: 采用SkillPack格式存储源模型能力，结合模块感知自适应压缩策略，确保高效存储和任务特定知识的保留。

Result: 实验表明，GraftLLM在知识转移、知识融合和无遗忘学习方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: GraftLLM为跨能力转移提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-capability transfer is a key challenge in large language model (LLM)
research, with applications in multi-task integration, model compression, and
continual learning. Recent works like FuseLLM and FuseChat have demonstrated
the potential of transferring multiple model capabilities to lightweight
models, enhancing adaptability and efficiency, which motivates our
investigation into more efficient cross-capability transfer methods. However,
existing approaches primarily focus on small, homogeneous models, limiting
their applicability. For large, heterogeneous models, knowledge distillation
with full-parameter fine-tuning often overlooks the student model's intrinsic
capacity and risks catastrophic forgetting, while PEFT methods struggle to
effectively absorb knowledge from source LLMs. To address these issues, we
introduce GraftLLM, a novel method that stores source model capabilities in a
target model with SkillPack format. This approach preserves general
capabilities, reduces parameter conflicts, and supports forget-free continual
learning and model fusion. We employ a module-aware adaptive compression
strategy to compress parameter updates, ensuring efficient storage while
maintaining task-specific knowledge. The resulting SkillPack serves as a
compact and transferable knowledge carrier, ideal for heterogeneous model
fusion and continual learning. Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate
that GraftLLM outperforms existing techniques in knowledge transfer, knowledge
fusion, and forget-free learning, providing a scalable and efficient solution
for cross-capability transfer. The code is publicly available at:

Result: LiSTEN在减少参数和数据集依赖的情况下表现优异，训练流程简化且可解释性增强。

Conclusion: LiSTEN为LLM在音频任务中的适应提供了高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
success in handling various tasks and modalities. However, adapting these
models for general-purpose audio-language tasks is challenging due to
differences in acoustic environments and task variations. In this work, we
introduce LiSTEN Learning Soft Token Embeddings for Neural Audio LLMs), a
framework for adapting LLMs to speech and audio tasks. LiSTEN uses a dynamic
prompt selection strategy with learnable key-value pairs, allowing the model to
balance general and task-specific knowledge while avoiding overfitting in a
multitask setting. Our approach reduces dependence on large-scale ASR or
captioning datasets, achieves competitive performance with fewer trainable
parameters, and simplifies training by using a single-stage process.
Additionally, LiSTEN enhances interpretability by analyzing the diversity and
overlap of selected prompts across different tasks.

TLDR: Generative RLHF-V框架通过结合生成奖励模型和多模态RLHF，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的对齐性能。


<details>

Motivation: 传统奖励模型在对齐任务中存在准确性低、泛化能力差和可解释性弱的问题，阻碍了如RLHF等对齐方法的进展。

Method: 提出两阶段流程：1) 多模态生成奖励建模，利用RL引导GRM主动捕捉人类意图；2) 基于分组比较的RL优化，提升评分精度。

Result: 实验显示，框架在7个基准测试中平均提升4个MLLM性能18.1%，基线RLHF仅5.3%。

Conclusion: Generative RLHF-V框架显著提升了对齐性能，且随着候选响应数量增加，性能呈近线性提升。

Abstract: Training multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that align with human
intentions is a long-term challenge. Traditional score-only reward models for
alignment suffer from low accuracy, weak generalization, and poor
interpretability, blocking the progress of alignment methods, e.g.,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Generative reward models
(GRMs) leverage MLLMs' intrinsic reasoning capabilities to discriminate
pair-wise responses, but their pair-wise paradigm makes it hard to generalize
to learnable rewards. We introduce Generative RLHF-V, a novel alignment
framework that integrates GRMs with multi-modal RLHF. We propose a two-stage
pipeline: $\textbf{multi-modal generative reward modeling from RL}$, where RL
guides GRMs to actively capture human intention, then predict the correct
pair-wise scores; and $\textbf{RL optimization from grouped comparison}$, which
enhances multi-modal RL scoring precision by grouped responses comparison.
Experimental results demonstrate that, besides out-of-distribution
generalization of RM discrimination, our framework improves 4 MLLMs'
performance across 7 benchmarks by $18.1\%$, while the baseline RLHF is only
$5.3\%$. We further validate that Generative RLHF-V achieves a near-linear
improvement with an increasing number of candidate responses. Our code and
models can be found at https://generative-rlhf-v.github.io.

Motivation: LLMs在角色模仿中常生成无关或不一致内容，主要因实体模糊和认知边界缺失。

Method: 提出RoleRAG框架，结合实体消歧和边界感知检索器，从结构化知识图中提取信息。

Result: 实验表明，RoleRAG能帮助LLMs更贴合角色知识并减少幻觉回答。

Conclusion: RoleRAG通过校准检索提升了LLMs在角色模仿中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in character imitation,
enabling immersive and engaging conversations. However, they often generate
content that is irrelevant or inconsistent with a character's background. We
attribute these failures to: (1) the inability to accurately recall
character-specific knowledge due to entity ambiguity, and (2) a lack of
awareness of the character's cognitive boundaries. To address these issues, we
propose RoleRAG, a retrieval-based framework that integrates efficient entity
disambiguation for knowledge indexing with a boundary-aware retriever for
extracting contextually appropriate information from a structured knowledge
graph. Experiments on role-playing benchmarks show that RoleRAG's calibrated
retrieval helps both general-purpose and role-specific LLMs better align with
character knowledge and reduce hallucinated responses.

Motivation: 现有RL方法仅针对单一奖励函数优化，无法满足实际中多目标冲突和用户偏好多样化的需求。

Method: 提出Diffusion Blend方法，包含DB-MPA（多奖励对齐）和DB-KLA（KL正则控制）两种算法，混合微调模型的反向扩散过程。

Result: 实验表明Diffusion Blend优于基线，性能接近或超过单独微调模型，支持高效用户驱动对齐。

Conclusion: Diffusion Blend解决了推理时多偏好对齐问题，为扩散模型的实际应用提供了灵活性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been used recently to align
diffusion models with downstream objectives such as aesthetic quality and
text-image consistency by fine-tuning them to maximize a single reward function
under a fixed KL regularization. However, this approach is inherently
restrictive in practice, where alignment must balance multiple, often
conflicting objectives. Moreover, user preferences vary across prompts,
individuals, and deployment contexts, with varying tolerances for deviation
from a pre-trained base model. We address the problem of inference-time
multi-preference alignment: given a set of basis reward functions and a
reference KL regularization strength, can we design a fine-tuning procedure so
that, at inference time, it can generate images aligned with any user-specified
linear combination of rewards and regularization, without requiring additional
fine-tuning? We propose Diffusion Blend, a novel approach to solve
inference-time multi-preference alignment by blending backward diffusion
processes associated with fine-tuned models, and we instantiate this approach
with two algorithms: DB-MPA for multi-reward alignment and DB-KLA for KL
regularization control. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion Blend
algorithms consistently outperform relevant baselines and closely match or
exceed the performance of individually fine-tuned models, enabling efficient,
user-driven alignment at inference-time. The code is available at

Motivation: 探索数据集特性如何影响探针训练效果，以及LLM内部特征空间与探针性能的关系。

Method: 通过定量分析探针性能和LLM响应不确定性，结合特征重要性分析。

Result: 探针性能与LLM响应不确定性负相关，高不确定性对应更多重要特征，降低探针性能。同时发现LLM表征与人类知识一致的实例。

Conclusion: LLM响应不确定性是影响探针性能的关键因素，研究为理解LLM的可解释性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Probing techniques have shown promise in revealing how LLMs encode
human-interpretable concepts, particularly when applied to curated datasets.
However, the factors governing a dataset's suitability for effective probe
training are not well-understood. This study hypothesizes that probe
performance on such datasets reflects characteristics of both the LLM's
generated responses and its internal feature space. Through quantitative
analysis of probe performance and LLM response uncertainty across a series of
tasks, we find a strong correlation: improved probe performance consistently
corresponds to a reduction in response uncertainty, and vice versa.
Subsequently, we delve deeper into this correlation through the lens of feature
importance analysis. Our findings indicate that high LLM response variance is
associated with a larger set of important features, which poses a greater
challenge for probe models and often results in diminished performance.
Moreover, leveraging the insights from response uncertainty analysis, we are
able to identify concrete examples where LLM representations align with human
knowledge across diverse domains, offering additional evidence of interpretable
reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: LLM仍易因解释性不足和缺乏形式化保证而产生低级错误，而RvLLM通过结合领域知识，为高效严格验证LLM输出提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a dominant AI paradigm due to
their exceptional text understanding and generation capabilities. However,
their tendency to generate inconsistent or erroneous outputs challenges their
reliability, especially in high-stakes domains requiring accuracy and
trustworthiness. Existing research primarily focuses on detecting and
mitigating model misbehavior in general-purpose scenarios, often overlooking
the potential of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we
advance misbehavior detection by incorporating domain knowledge. The core idea
is to design a general specification language that enables domain experts to
customize domain-specific predicates in a lightweight and intuitive manner,
supporting later runtime verification of LLM outputs. To achieve this, we
design a novel specification language, ESL, and introduce a runtime
verification framework, RvLLM, to validate LLM output against domain-specific
constraints defined in ESL. We evaluate RvLLM on three representative tasks:
violation detection against Singapore Rapid Transit Systems Act, numerical
comparison, and inequality solving. Experimental results demonstrate that RvLLM
effectively detects erroneous outputs across various LLMs in a lightweight and
flexible manner. The results reveal that despite their impressive capabilities,
LLMs remain prone to low-level errors due to limited interpretability and a
lack of formal guarantees during inference, and our framework offers a
potential long-term solution by leveraging expert domain knowledge to
rigorously and efficiently verify LLM outputs.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has provided new tools for

SCM LLM, which demonstrates expert-level competence by passing standardized SCM

horizontal and vertical supply chain games, in order to analyze competition and
cooperation within supply chains. Our experiments show that RAG significantly
improves performance on SCM tasks. Moreover, game-theoretic analysis reveals
that the LLM can reproduce insights from the classical SCM literature, while
also uncovering novel behaviors and offering fresh perspectives on phenomena
such as the bullwhip effect. This paper opens the door for exploring

Result: 在七个基准测试和四种流行模型上，Doc-CoB显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: Doc-CoB是一种简单有效的方法，无需修改模型架构即可提升文档理解能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
document understanding. However, the information-dense nature of document
images still poses challenges, as most queries depend on only a few relevant
regions, with the rest being redundant. Existing one-pass MLLMs process entire
document images without considering query relevance, often failing to focus on
critical regions and producing unfaithful responses. Inspired by the human
coarse-to-fine reading pattern, we introduce Doc-CoB (Chain-of-Box), a
simple-yet-effective mechanism that integrates human-style visual reasoning
into MLLM without modifying its architecture. Our method allows the model to
autonomously select the set of regions (boxes) most relevant to the query, and
then focus attention on them for further understanding. We first design a fully
automatic pipeline, integrating a commercial MLLM with a layout analyzer, to
generate 249k training samples with intermediate visual reasoning supervision.
Then we incorporate two enabling tasks that improve box identification and
box-query reasoning, which together enhance document understanding. Extensive
experiments on seven benchmarks with four popular models show that Doc-CoB
significantly improves performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and wide
applicability. All code, data, and models will be released publicly.

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂应用（如游戏）中逐步推理能力不足，现有方法（如GraphRAG）因实体关系图碎片化和局部连接过密而难以构建连贯推理。

Result: 在Minecraft测试中显著优于GraphRAG等基线方法，提升LLM的推理能力。

Conclusion: GoGs框架有效解决了LLM在复杂任务中的推理问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general capabilities but
often struggle with step-by-step reasoning, especially in complex applications
such as games. While retrieval-augmented methods like GraphRAG attempt to
bridge this gap through cross-document extraction and indexing, their
fragmented entity-relation graphs and overly dense local connectivity hinder
the construction of coherent reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework based on Goal-Oriented Graphs (GoGs), where each node represents a
goal and its associated attributes, and edges encode logical dependencies
between goals. This structure enables explicit retrieval of reasoning paths by
first identifying high-level goals and recursively retrieving their subgoals,
forming coherent reasoning chains to guide LLM prompting. Our method
significantly enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs in game-playing tasks, as
demonstrated by extensive experiments on the Minecraft testbed, outperforming
GraphRAG and other baselines.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了算法推理学习中表达能力与可训练性之间的差距，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper aims to understand how neural networks learn algorithmic reasoning
by addressing two questions: How faithful are learned algorithms when they are
effective, and why do neural networks fail to learn effective algorithms
otherwise? To answer these questions, we use neural compilation, a technique
that directly encodes a source algorithm into neural network parameters,
enabling the network to compute the algorithm exactly. This enables comparison
between compiled and conventionally learned parameters, intermediate vectors,
and behaviors. This investigation is crucial for developing neural networks
that robustly learn complexalgorithms from data. Our analysis focuses on graph
neural networks (GNNs), which are naturally aligned with algorithmic reasoning
tasks, specifically our choices of BFS, DFS, and Bellman-Ford, which cover the
spectrum of effective, faithful, and ineffective learned algorithms. Commonly,
learning algorithmic reasoning is framed as induction over synthetic data,
where a parameterized model is trained on inputs, traces, and outputs produced
by an underlying ground truth algorithm. In contrast, we introduce a neural
compilation method for GNNs, which sets network parameters analytically,
bypassing training. Focusing on GNNs leverages their alignment with algorithmic
reasoning, extensive algorithmic induction literature, and the novel
application of neural compilation to GNNs. Overall, this paper aims to
characterize expressability-trainability gaps - a fundamental shortcoming in
learning algorithmic reasoning. We hypothesize that inductive learning is most
effective for parallel algorithms contained within the computational class
\texttt{NC}.

Method: 使用卫星气候数据和多种机器学习模型（SVM、XGBoost、ANN、LSTM、GRU）预测河流流量。

Result: LSTM表现最优（R2=0.96，RMSE=140.96 m3/sec），短期预测（5天内）效果显著，但长期预测准确性下降。

Conclusion: 研究支持可持续发展目标，需更多历史数据以提高长期洪水预测可靠性。

Abstract: Flooding is the most devastating phenomenon occurring globally, particularly
in mountainous regions, risk dramatically increases due to complex terrains and
extreme climate changes. These situations are damaging livelihoods,
agriculture, infrastructure, and human lives. This study uses the Kabul River
between Pakistan and Afghanistan as a case study to reflect the complications
of flood forecasting in transboundary basins. The challenges in obtaining
upstream data impede the efficacy of flood control measures and early warning
systems, a common global problem in similar basins. Utilizing satellite-based
climatic data, this study applied numerous advanced machine-learning and deep
learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, and Artificial
Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated
Recurrent Units (GRU) to predict daily and multi-step river flow. The LSTM
network outperformed other models, achieving the highest R2 value of 0.96 and
the lowest RMSE value of 140.96 m3/sec. The time series LSTM and GRU network
models, utilized for short-term forecasts of up to five days, performed
significantly. However, the accuracy declined beyond the fourth day,
highlighting the need for longer-term historical datasets for reliable
long-term flood predictions. The results of the study are directly aligned with
Sustainable Development Goals 6, 11, 13, and 15, facilitating disaster and
water management, timely evacuations, improved preparedness, and effective
early warning.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在整合文本和图像等多模态数据时存在模态偏差，过度依赖语言而忽视其他模态，影响了模型的性能和应用。

Method: 论文首先诊断了模态偏差的表现，提出了研究路线图，并通过实验分析了数据特性、模型能力和训练目标对偏差的影响。

Result: 实验表明，数据特性（语言紧凑、视觉冗余）、模型能力（语言模型主导）和训练目标（跨模态对齐不足）是模态偏差的主要因素。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁采用平衡的训练策略和模型架构，促进多模态的均衡整合，为更鲁棒的多模态系统提供新视角，推动通用人工智能的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promising results in integrating diverse modalities such as texts and images.
MLLMs are heavily influenced by modality bias, often relying on language while
under-utilizing other modalities like visual inputs. This position paper argues
that MLLMs are deeply affected by modality bias. Firstly, we diagnose the
current state of modality bias, highlighting its manifestations across various
tasks. Secondly, we propose a systematic research road-map related to modality
bias in MLLMs. Thirdly, we identify key factors of modality bias in MLLMs and
offer actionable suggestions for future research to mitigate it. To
substantiate these findings, we conduct experiments that demonstrate the
influence of each factor: 1. Data Characteristics: Language data is compact and
abstract, while visual data is redundant and complex, creating an inherent
imbalance in learning dynamics. 2. Imbalanced Backbone Capabilities: The
dominance of pretrained language models in MLLMs leads to overreliance on
language and neglect of visual information. 3. Training Objectives: Current
objectives often fail to promote balanced cross-modal alignment, resulting in
shortcut learning biased toward language. These findings highlight the need for
balanced training strategies and model architectures to better integrate
multiple modalities in MLLMs. We call for interdisciplinary efforts to tackle
these challenges and drive innovation in MLLM research. Our work provides a
fresh perspective on modality bias in MLLMs and offers insights for developing
more robust and generalizable multimodal systems-advancing progress toward
Artificial General Intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建模跨城市的人类移动对城市规划、交通优化等应用至关重要，但现有方法因空间表示和移动模式的异质性难以泛化。

Method: 设计空间语义编码器学习可迁移的位置表示，并开发SAMoE Transformer，结合专家模块和共享专家模块捕捉城市不变模式。

Result: 实验表明，TrajMoE在仅5%目标城市数据下优于基线模型，微调后性能提升27%。

Conclusion: TrajMoE为实现通用、可迁移的人类移动基础模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Modeling human mobility across diverse cities is essential for applications
such as urban planning, transportation optimization, and personalized services.
However, generalization remains challenging due to heterogeneous spatial
representations and mobility patterns across cities. Existing methods typically
rely on numerical coordinates or require training city-specific models,
limiting their scalability and transferability. We propose TrajMoE, a unified
and scalable model for cross-city human mobility modeling. TrajMoE addresses
two key challenges: (1) inconsistent spatial semantics across cities, and (2)
diverse urban mobility patterns. To tackle these, we begin by designing a
spatial semantic encoder that learns transferable location representations from
POI-based functional semantics and visit patterns. Furthermore, we design a
Spatially-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (SAMoE) Transformer that injects structured
priors into experts specialized in distinct mobility semantics, along with a
shared expert to capture city-invariant patterns and enable adaptive cross-city
generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajMoE achieves up to
27% relative improvement over competitive mobility foundation models after only
one epoch of fine-tuning, and consistently outperforms full-data baselines
using merely 5% of target city data. These results establish TrajMoE as a
significant step toward realizing a truly generalizable, transferable, and
pretrainable foundation model for human mobility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统气候政策场景生成方法耗时且无法充分捕捉复杂性，AI可解决这些问题。

Method: 使用LLMs（如llama3.2-3B）生成政策场景，并通过自动化技术评估。

Result: 88%生成场景通过验证，与人类专家和其他LLMs评估一致。

Conclusion: 生成式AI为数据受限地区的气候政策规划提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Climate policy scenario generation and evaluation have traditionally relied
on integrated assessment models (IAMs) and expert-driven qualitative analysis.
These methods enable stakeholders, such as policymakers and researchers, to
anticipate impacts, plan governance strategies, and develop mitigation
measures. However, traditional methods are often time-intensive, reliant on
simple extrapolations of past trends, and limited in capturing the complex and
interconnected nature of energy and climate issues. With the advent of
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI models trained on vast
datasets, these limitations can be addressed, ensuring robustness even under
limited data conditions. In this work, we explore the novel method that employs
generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to simulate climate
policy scenarios for Sub-Saharan Africa. These scenarios focus on energy
transition themes derived from the historical United Nations Climate Change
Conference (COP) documents. By leveraging generative models, the project aims
to create plausible and diverse policy scenarios that align with regional
climate goals and energy challenges. Given limited access to human evaluators,
automated techniques were employed for scenario evaluation. We generated policy
scenarios using the llama3.2-3B model. Of the 34 generated responses, 30 (88%)
passed expert validation, accurately reflecting the intended impacts provided
in the corresponding prompts. We compared these validated responses against
assessments from a human climate expert and two additional LLMs (gemma2-2B and
mistral-7B). Our structured, embedding-based evaluation framework shows that
generative AI effectively generate scenarios that are coherent, relevant,
plausible, and diverse. This approach offers a transformative tool for climate
policy planning in data-constrained regions.

evaluate each model along three key dimensions: accuracy, interpretability, and
computational cost.

Motivation: 当前研究多通过多轮对话评估智能体，但忽视了工具关系、环境反馈和先前决策等关键因素对行为的影响。

Method: 设计了三种挑战（工具关系导航、隐藏信息处理和动态决策路径管理），并引入细粒度指标、创新数据收集算法和可复现评估方法。

Result: 实验发现智能体在处理工具依赖、长上下文信息依赖和频繁策略切换时存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: $C^3$-Bench旨在通过挑战揭示模型漏洞，推动智能体性能可解释性研究。

Abstract: Agents based on large language models leverage tools to modify environments,
revolutionizing how AI interacts with the physical world. Unlike traditional
NLP tasks that rely solely on historical dialogue for responses, these agents
must consider more complex factors, such as inter-tool relationships,
environmental feedback and previous decisions, when making choices. Current
research typically evaluates agents via multi-turn dialogues. However, it
overlooks the influence of these critical factors on agent behavior. To bridge
this gap, we present an open-source and high-quality benchmark $C^3$-Bench.
This benchmark integrates attack concepts and applies univariate analysis to
pinpoint key elements affecting agent robustness. In concrete, we design three
challenges: navigate complex tool relationships, handle critical hidden
information and manage dynamic decision paths. Complementing these challenges,
we introduce fine-grained metrics, innovative data collection algorithms and
reproducible evaluation methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 49
mainstream agents, encompassing general fast-thinking, slow-thinking and
domain-specific models. We observe that agents have significant shortcomings in
handling tool dependencies, long context information dependencies and frequent
policy-type switching. In essence, $C^3$-Bench aims to expose model
vulnerabilities through these challenges and drive research into the
interpretability of agent performance. The benchmark is publicly available at

Abstract: Data-centric distillation, including data augmentation, selection, and
mixing, offers a promising path to creating smaller, more efficient student
Large Language Models (LLMs) that retain strong reasoning abilities. However,
there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark to systematically assess the effect
of each distillation approach. This paper introduces DC-CoT, the first
data-centric benchmark that investigates data manipulation in chain-of-thought
(CoT) distillation from method, model and data perspectives. Utilizing various
teacher models (e.g., o4-mini, Gemini-Pro, Claude-3.5) and student
architectures (e.g., 3B, 7B parameters), we rigorously evaluate the impact of
these data manipulations on student model performance across multiple reasoning
datasets, with a focus on in-distribution (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization, and cross-domain transfer. Our findings aim to provide
actionable insights and establish best practices for optimizing CoT
distillation through data-centric techniques, ultimately facilitating the
development of more accessible and capable reasoning models. The dataset can be

Motivation: 现有安全机制仅在模型输出后过滤欺骗行为，无法阻止模型在内部推理过程中进行欺骗。论文旨在探索是否能在模型思考过程中拦截欺骗行为。

Method: 提出CoT Monitor+框架，在生成过程中同时输出普通推理步骤和内部自我评估信号，后者用于标记和抑制未对齐策略，并通过强化学习反馈循环奖励诚实推理。

Result: 实验表明，CoT Monitor+平均减少43.8%的欺骗行为，同时保持任务准确性。此外，用自我监控信号替代外部弱评估器后，模型表现出更少的模糊思维和更高的透明度。

Conclusion: CoT Monitor+有效减少了模型在推理过程中的欺骗行为，同时保持了性能，为模型对齐提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern large language models rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to
achieve impressive performance, yet the same mechanism can amplify deceptive
alignment, situations in which a model appears aligned while covertly pursuing
misaligned goals. Existing safety pipelines treat deception as a black-box
output to be filtered post-hoc, leaving the model free to scheme during its
internal reasoning. We ask: Can deception be intercepted while the model is
thinking? We answer this question, the first framework that embeds a
Self-Monitor inside the CoT process itself, named CoT Monitor+. During
generation, the model produces (i) ordinary reasoning steps and (ii) an
internal self-evaluation signal trained to flag and suppress misaligned
strategies. The signal is used as an auxiliary reward in reinforcement
learning, creating a feedback loop that rewards honest reasoning and
discourages hidden goals. To study deceptive alignment systematically, we
introduce DeceptionBench, a five-category benchmark that probes covert
alignment-faking, sycophancy, etc. We evaluate various LLMs and show that
unrestricted CoT roughly aggravates the deceptive tendency. In contrast, CoT
Monitor+ cuts deceptive behaviors by 43.8% on average while preserving task
accuracy. Further, when the self-monitor signal replaces an external weak judge
in RL fine-tuning, models exhibit substantially fewer obfuscated thoughts and
retain transparency. Our project website can be found at

Motivation: 解决大型推理模型在简单问题上生成冗长推理链的问题，同时提供用户对推理深度的控制。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：冷启动微调阶段和难度感知强化学习阶段，结合用户交互标签。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著减少推理长度（10.06%-91.04%），同时提升性能。

Conclusion: AdaCtrl有效平衡效率与效果，并支持用户定制化需求。

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models demonstrate impressive problem-solving
capabilities by employing sophisticated reasoning strategies. However, they
often struggle to balance efficiency and effectiveness, frequently generating
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains for simple problems. In this work, we
propose AdaCtrl, a novel framework to support both difficulty-aware adaptive
reasoning budget allocation and explicit user control over reasoning depth.
AdaCtrl dynamically adjusts its reasoning length based on self-assessed problem
difficulty, while also allowing users to manually control the budget to
prioritize either efficiency or effectiveness. This is achieved through a
two-stage training pipeline: an initial cold-start fine-tuning phase to instill
the ability to self-aware difficulty and adjust reasoning budget, followed by a
difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (RL) stage that refines the model's
adaptive reasoning strategies and calibrates its difficulty assessments based
on its evolving capabilities during online training. To enable intuitive user
interaction, we design explicit length-triggered tags that function as a
natural interface for budget control. Empirical results show that AdaCtrl
adapts reasoning length based on estimated difficulty, compared to the standard
training baseline that also incorporates fine-tuning and RL, it yields
performance improvements and simultaneously reduces response length by 10.06%
and 12.14% on the more challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, which
require elaborate reasoning, and by 62.05% and 91.04% on the MATH500 and GSM8K
datasets, where more concise responses are sufficient. Furthermore, AdaCtrl
enables precise user control over the reasoning budget, allowing for tailored
responses to meet specific needs.

Conclusion: 为语言模型提供上下文化的计算机环境是开发更强大计算机使用代理的有效方向。

Abstract: We present AIOS 1.0, a novel platform designed to advance computer-use agent
(CUA) capabilities through environmental contextualization. While existing
approaches primarily focus on building more powerful agent frameworks or
enhancing agent models, we identify a fundamental limitation: the semantic
disconnect between how language models understand the world and how computer
interfaces are structured. AIOS 1.0 addresses this challenge by transforming
computers into contextual environments that language models can natively
comprehend, implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture to
abstract computer states and actions. This approach effectively decouples
interface complexity from decision complexity, enabling agents to reason more
effectively about computing environments. To demonstrate our platform's
effectiveness, we introduce LiteCUA, a lightweight computer-use agent built on
AIOS 1.0 that achieves a 14.66% success rate on the OSWorld benchmark,
outperforming several specialized agent frameworks despite its simple
architecture. Our results suggest that contextualizing computer environments
for language models represents a promising direction for developing more
capable computer-use agents and advancing toward AI that can interact with
digital systems. The source code of LiteCUA is available at

Conclusion: 符号表示是开发下一代ELMs时最有效的输入形式，研究结果为未来工作提供了明确指导。

Abstract: Recent advances have increasingly applied large language models (LLMs) to
electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation, giving rise to
Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs). Conditioned on an ECG and a textual
query, an ELM autoregressively generates a free-form textual response. Unlike
traditional classification-based systems, ELMs emulate expert cardiac
electrophysiologists by issuing diagnoses, analyzing waveform morphology,
identifying contributing factors, and proposing patient-specific action plans.
To realize this potential, researchers are curating instruction-tuning datasets
that pair ECGs with textual dialogues and are training ELMs on these resources.
Yet before scaling ELMs further, there is a fundamental question yet to be
explored: What is the most effective ECG input representation? In recent works,
three candidate representations have emerged-raw time-series signals, rendered
images, and discretized symbolic sequences. We present the first comprehensive
benchmark of these modalities across 6 public datasets and 5 evaluation
metrics. We find symbolic representations achieve the greatest number of
statistically significant wins over both signal and image inputs. We further
ablate the LLM backbone, ECG duration, and token budget, and we evaluate
robustness to signal perturbations. We hope that our findings offer clear
guidance for selecting input representations when developing the next
generation of ELMs.

TLDR: 论文提出独特潜在模式理论（ULP），重新定义动态系统中复杂性的起源，认为复杂性源于观察者的认知限制而非系统本身的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统理论将动态系统的不可预测性归因于内在随机性或非线性，而ULP试图证明这种复杂性实际上是由于观察者对系统独特潜在结构的认知限制。

Method: 通过非通用生成映射$\mathcal{F}_S(P_S, t)$形式化ULP，每个系统$S$具有不可约且不可复制的潜在结构$P_S$，观察到的异常是生成映射通过有限接口的投影。

Result: ULP将不确定性从系统转移到观察者，将混沌重新定义为表征的失败，并提出了可证伪性标准。

Conclusion: ULP为AI、行为推断和认知诊断等领域提供了基于结构个体化模型的新研究方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Theory of the Unique Latent Pattern (ULP), a formal
epistemic framework that redefines the origin of apparent complexity in dynamic
systems. Rather than attributing unpredictability to intrinsic randomness or
emergent nonlinearity, ULP asserts that every analyzable system is governed by
a structurally unique, deterministic generative mechanism, one that remains
hidden not due to ontological indeterminacy, but due to epistemic constraints.
The theory is formalized using a non-universal generative mapping \(
\mathcal{F}_S(P_S, t) \), where each system \( S \) possesses its own latent
structure \( P_S \), irreducible and non-replicable across systems. Observed
irregularities are modeled as projections of this generative map through
observer-limited interfaces, introducing epistemic noise \( \varepsilon_S(t) \)
as a measure of incomplete access. By shifting the locus of uncertainty from
the system to the observer, ULP reframes chaos as a context-relative failure of
representation. We contrast this position with foundational paradigms in chaos
theory, complexity science, and statistical learning. While they assume or
model shared randomness or collective emergence, ULP maintains that every
instance harbors a singular structural identity. Although conceptual, the
theory satisfies the criterion of falsifiability in the Popperian sense, it
invites empirical challenge by asserting that no two systems governed by
distinct latent mechanisms will remain indistinguishable under sufficient
resolution. This opens avenues for structurally individuated models in AI,
behavioral inference, and epistemic diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以高效建模多尺度系统中不同尺度结构的相互作用，尤其是远距离小尺度特征的直接建模。

Method: 使用分层全卷积自编码器将系统状态编码为一系列嵌入层，每层对应不同尺度结构，并通过卷积操作建模尺度间相互作用。

Result: 在Hasegawa-Wakatani湍流应用中，模型在长期预测准确性上表现出多倍提升。

Conclusion: 该架构通过尺度分离和分层嵌入，显著提高了多尺度系统长期预测的效率与准确性。

Abstract: We propose a novel efficient architecture for learning long-term evolution in
complex multi-scale physical systems which is based on the idea of separation
of scales. Structures of various scales that dynamically emerge in the system
interact with each other only locally. Structures of similar scale can interact
directly when they are in contact and indirectly when they are parts of larger
structures that interact directly. This enables modeling a multi-scale system
in an efficient way, where interactions between small-scale features that are
apart from each other do not need to be modeled. The hierarchical
fully-convolutional autoencoder transforms the state of a physical system not
just into a single embedding layer, as it is done conventionally, but into a
series of embedding layers which encode structures of various scales preserving
spatial information at a corresponding resolution level. Shallower layers embed
smaller structures on a finer grid, while deeper layers embed larger structures
on a coarser grid. The predictor advances all embedding layers in sync.
Interactions between features of various scales are modeled using a combination
of convolutional operators. We compare the performance of our model to
variations of a conventional ResNet architecture in application to the
Hasegawa-Wakatani turbulence. A multifold improvement in long-term prediction
accuracy was observed for crucial statistical characteristics of this system.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文提出了一种通过在模型中间层注入指令层级信号的新方法，显著降低了提示注入攻击的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制仅在输入层注入指令层级信号，限制了其区分令牌权限的能力。

Method: 在中间令牌表示中注入层特定的可训练嵌入，编码权限信息。

Result: 在梯度基提示注入攻击中，攻击成功率降低了1.6至9.2倍。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了防御效果，且未显著影响模型实用性。

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks are a critical security vulnerability in large
language models (LLMs), allowing attackers to hijack model behavior by
injecting malicious instructions within the input context. Recent defense
mechanisms have leveraged an Instruction Hierarchy (IH) Signal, often
implemented through special delimiter tokens or additive embeddings to denote
the privilege level of input tokens. However, these prior works typically
inject the IH signal exclusively at the initial input layer, which we
hypothesize limits its ability to effectively distinguish the privilege levels
of tokens as it propagates through the different layers of the model. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel approach that injects the IH
signal into the intermediate token representations within the network. Our
method augments these representations with layer-specific trainable embeddings
that encode the privilege information. Our evaluations across multiple models
and training methods reveal that our proposal yields between $1.6\times$ and
$9.2\times$ reduction in attack success rate on gradient-based prompt injection
attacks compared to state-of-the-art methods, without significantly degrading
the model's utility.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种元感知学习框架，结合领域知识、数据库模式、思维链推理和元数据关系，以提高LLM在文本到SQL任务中的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的进步为文本到SQL任务提供了机会，但需解决复杂领域信息和数据库结构的理解挑战。

Method: 框架包含四种学习策略：基于模式的学习、思维链学习、知识增强学习和关键信息标记化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在执行准确性、多任务SQL生成能力和减少灾难性遗忘方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 该框架通过微调LLM，显著提升了其在业务领域SQL生成中的性能。

Abstract: The advancements of Large language models (LLMs) have provided great
opportunities to text-to-SQL tasks to overcome the main challenges to
understand complex domain information and complex database structures in
business applications. In this paper, we propose a meta-aware learning
framework to integrate domain knowledge, database schema, chain-of-thought
reasoning processes, and metadata relationships to improve the SQL generation
quality. The proposed framework includes four learning strategies: schema-based
learning, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning, knowledge-enhanced learning, and key
information tokenization. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding
of database structure and metadata information towards LLM through fine-tuning
to improve its performance on SQL generation within business domains. Through
two experimental studies, we have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed
methods in execution accuracy, multi-task SQL generation capability, and
reduction of catastrophic forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注合成文本中的简单因果关系，未能反映真实任务的复杂性，因此需要探索LLM在真实文本中的因果推理能力。

Method: 开发了一个基于真实世界学术文献的基准数据集，包含多样化的文本长度、关系复杂性和领域，并评估了最先进的LLM在该数据集上的表现。

Abstract: Understanding and inferring causal relationships from texts is a core aspect
of human cognition and is essential for advancing large language models (LLMs)
towards artificial general intelligence. Existing work primarily focuses on
synthetically generated texts which involve simple causal relationships
explicitly mentioned in the text. This fails to reflect the complexities of
real-world tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs are capable of
inferring causal relationships from real-world texts. We develop a benchmark
drawn from real-world academic literature which includes diverse texts with
respect to length, complexity of relationships (different levels of
explicitness, number of events, and causal relationships), and domains and
sub-domains. To the best of our knowledge, our benchmark is the first-ever
real-world dataset for this task. Our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
evaluated on our proposed benchmark demonstrate significant challenges, with
the best-performing model achieving an average F1 score of only 0.477. Analysis
reveals common pitfalls: difficulty with implicitly stated information, in
distinguishing relevant causal factors from surrounding contextual details, and
with connecting causally relevant information spread across lengthy textual
passages. By systematically characterizing these deficiencies, our benchmark
offers targeted insights for further research into advancing LLM causal
reasoning.

TLDR: REACT框架通过两阶段方法解决大语言模型编辑中的过拟合问题，实现精确可控的知识编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型编辑方法常因过拟合导致知识更新超出预期范围，REACT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: REACT分两阶段：提取潜在事实表示并计算方向向量；通过可控扰动应用编辑，仅限上下文必要时。

Result: 实验表明REACT显著减少过拟合，同时保持基本编辑性能。

Conclusion: REACT为知识编辑提供了一种精确可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model editing methods frequently suffer from overfitting,
wherein factual updates can propagate beyond their intended scope,
overemphasizing the edited target even when it's contextually inappropriate. To
address this challenge, we introduce REACT (Representation Extraction And
Controllable Tuning), a unified two-phase framework designed for precise and
controllable knowledge editing. In the initial phase, we utilize tailored
stimuli to extract latent factual representations and apply Principal Component
Analysis with a simple learnbale linear transformation to compute a directional
"belief shift" vector for each instance. In the second phase, we apply
controllable perturbations to hidden states using the obtained vector with a
magnitude scalar, gated by a pre-trained classifier that permits edits only
when contextually necessary. Relevant experiments on EVOKE benchmarks
demonstrate that REACT significantly reduces overfitting across nearly all
evaluation metrics, and experiments on COUNTERFACT and MQuAKE shows that our
method preserves balanced basic editing performance (reliability, locality, and
generality) under diverse editing scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AgentNet缺乏有效的框架支持自动目标发现和多代理协作，SANNet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SANNet架构，结合语义目标推断和动态权重冲突解决机制，并在硬件原型中实现。

Result: 实验证明SANNet能显著提升多代理网络系统性能，即使存在目标冲突。

Conclusion: SANNet为动态环境中多代理协作提供了理论保证和实际性能提升。

Abstract: Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm
that relies on a large number of specialized AI agents to collaborate and
coordinate for autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation,
and complex goal achievement. It has the potential to facilitate real-time
network management alongside capabilities for self-configuration,
self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex networking
environments, laying the foundation for fully autonomous networking systems in
the future. Despite its promise, AgentNet is still in the early stage of
development, and there still lacks an effective networking framework to support
automatic goal discovery and multi-agent self-orchestration and task
assignment. This paper proposes SANNet, a novel semantic-aware agentic AI
networking architecture that can infer the semantic goal of the user and
automatically assign agents associated with different layers of a mobile system
to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that one of the major
challenges in AgentNet is that different agents may have different and even
conflicting objectives when collaborating for certain goals, we introduce a
dynamic weighting-based conflict-resolving mechanism to address this issue. We
prove that SANNet can provide theoretical guarantee in both conflict-resolving
and model generalization performance for multi-agent collaboration in dynamic
environment. We develop a hardware prototype of SANNet based on the open RAN
and 5GS core platform. Our experimental results show that SANNet can
significantly improve the performance of multi-agent networking systems, even
when agents with conflicting objectives are selected to collaborate for the
same goal.

TLDR: Co-PatcheR是一个协作式软件补丁系统，通过小型专用模型分别处理补丁任务的不同子任务，实现了46%的解决率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用单一模型处理补丁任务的所有子任务效果有限，而协作式方法可以更好地利用不同模型的专长。

Method: 训练专用模型分别处理问题定位、补丁生成和验证，采用两步定位、生成与批评结合、混合验证和多数投票选择补丁。

Result: 在SWE-bench-Verified上达到46%的解决率，仅需3个14B模型，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Co-PatcheR通过协作式设计和专用模型，显著提升了补丁任务的效率和效果。

Abstract: Motivated by the success of general-purpose large language models (LLMs) in
software patching, recent works started to train specialized patching models.
Most works trained one model to handle the end-to-end patching pipeline
(including issue localization, patch generation, and patch validation).
However, it is hard for a small model to handle all tasks, as different
sub-tasks have different workflows and require different expertise. As such, by
using a 70 billion model, SOTA methods can only reach up to 41% resolved rate
on SWE-bench-Verified. Motivated by the collaborative nature, we propose
Co-PatcheR, the first collaborative patching system with small and specialized
reasoning models for individual components. Our key technique novelties are the
specific task designs and training recipes. First, we train a model for
localization and patch generation. Our localization pinpoints the suspicious
lines through a two-step procedure, and our generation combines patch
generation and critique. We then propose a hybrid patch validation that
includes two models for crafting issue-reproducing test cases with and without
assertions and judging patch correctness, followed by a majority vote-based
patch selection. Through extensive evaluation, we show that Co-PatcheR achieves
46% resolved rate on SWE-bench-Verified with only 3 x 14B models. This makes
Co-PatcheR the best patcher with specialized models, requiring the least
training resources and the smallest models. We conduct a comprehensive ablation
study to validate our recipes, as well as our choice of training data number,
model size, and testing-phase scaling strategy.

TLDR: Weaver是一个模块化管道，动态结合SQL和LLM处理表格问答（TableQA），通过分解复杂查询提高准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SQL难以处理嵌入文本或图像的表格数据，而LLM虽擅长上下文理解，但对长输入序列有限制。现有方法结合SQL和LLM时缺乏灵活性。

Method: Weaver采用模块化管道，动态生成结合SQL（结构化数据检索）和LLM（语义处理）的步骤计划。

Result: 实验表明，Weaver在四个TableQA数据集上优于现有方法，减少API调用和错误率。

Conclusion: Weaver通过灵活结合SQL和LLM，显著提升了表格问答的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Querying tables with unstructured data is challenging due to the presence of
text (or image), either embedded in the table or in external paragraphs, which
traditional SQL struggles to process, especially for tasks requiring semantic
reasoning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding context,
they face limitations with long input sequences. Existing approaches that
combine SQL and LLMs typically rely on rigid, predefined work-flows, limiting
their adaptability to complex queries. To address these issues, we introduce
Weaver , a modular pipeline that dynamically integrates SQL and LLMs for
table-based question answering (TableQA). Weaver generates a flexible,
step-by-step plan that combines SQL for structured data retrieval with LLMs for
semantic processing. By decomposing complex queries into manageable subtasks,
Weaver improves accuracy and generalization. Our experiments show that Weaver
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four TableQA datasets,
reducing both API calls and error rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在旅行需求建模中具有潜力，但其与人类行为的不对齐限制了其应用。现有对齐方法效率低或不实用。

Method: 采用角色推断和加载过程，通过行为嵌入驱动的角色加载函数，优化LLMs的提示条件。

Result: 在瑞士地铁模式选择数据集上验证，框架显著优于基线选择模型和基于LLM的模拟模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM在旅行需求建模中的应用提供了更灵活、可解释且资源高效的途径。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for
travel demand modeling. However, behavioral misalignment between LLMs and
humans presents obstacles for the usage of LLMs, and existing alignment methods
are frequently inefficient or impractical given the constraints of typical
travel demand data. This paper introduces a novel framework for aligning LLMs
with human travel choice behavior, tailored to the current travel demand data
sources. Our framework uses a persona inference and loading process to
condition LLMs with suitable prompts to enhance alignment. The inference step
establishes a set of base personas from empirical data, and a learned persona
loading function driven by behavioral embeddings guides the loading process. We
validate our framework on the Swissmetro mode choice dataset, and the results
show that our proposed approach significantly outperformed baseline choice
models and LLM-based simulation models in predicting both aggregate mode choice
shares and individual choice outcomes. Furthermore, we showcase that our
framework can generate insights on population behavior through interpretable
parameters. Overall, our research offers a more adaptable, interpretable, and
resource-efficient pathway to robust LLM-based travel behavior simulation,
paving the way to integrate LLMs into travel demand modeling practice in the
future.

TLDR: RECAST框架通过合成包含大量约束的数据集（RECAST-30K），提升大语言模型（LLMs）处理复杂指令的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户对复杂提示的需求增加，LLMs在遵循超过10个约束的指令时表现不佳。

Method: 提出RECAST框架，从真实提示-响应对中提取约束，并通过规则和LLM验证器自动验证约束满足。

Result: 实验显示，基于RECAST-30K微调的模型在复杂指令遵循上显著改进，且可设计强化学习奖励函数。

Conclusion: RECAST有效提升LLMs处理复杂任务的能力，并支持强化学习优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to tackle complex
tasks, driven by their expanding applications and users' growing proficiency in
crafting sophisticated prompts. However, as the number of explicitly stated
requirements increases (particularly more than 10 constraints), LLMs often
struggle to accurately follow such complex instructions. To address this
challenge, we propose RECAST, a novel framework for synthesizing datasets where
each example incorporates far more constraints than those in existing
benchmarks. These constraints are extracted from real-world prompt-response
pairs to ensure practical relevance. RECAST enables automatic verification of
constraint satisfaction via rule-based validators for quantitative constraints
and LLM-based validators for qualitative ones. Using this framework, we
construct RECAST-30K, a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising 30k
instances spanning 15 constraint types. Experimental results demonstrate that
models fine-tuned on RECAST-30K show substantial improvements in following
complex instructions. Moreover, the verifiability provided by RECAST enables
the design of reward functions for reinforcement learning, which further boosts
model performance on complex and challenging tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 提出了一种名为Universal Reasoner (UniR)的轻量级、可组合的推理模块，可与任何冻结的大型语言模型（LLM）结合使用，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统参数高效微调（PEFT）方法需要为每个LLM重新训练的问题，同时避免计算资源浪费和泛化能力下降。

Method: UniR将奖励分解为独立的推理模块，通过预定义奖励训练，并将轨迹级信号转化为令牌级指导。推理时，只需将其输出与LLM的logits相加。

Result: 在数学推理和机器翻译任务中，UniR显著优于现有基线方法，并展示了从小模型到大模型的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniR是一种高效、灵活且鲁棒的解决方案，可在不损害LLM核心能力的情况下增强其推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general
capabilities, but enhancing skills such as reasoning often demands substantial
computational resources and may compromise their generalization. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a more resource-conscious
alternative, they typically requires retraining for each LLM backbone due to
architectural dependencies. To address these challenges, here we propose
Universal Reasoner (UniR) - a single, lightweight, composable, and
plug-and-play reasoning module that can be used with any frozen LLM to endow it
with specialized reasoning capabilities. Specifically, UniR decomposes the
reward into a standalone reasoning module that is trained independently using
predefined rewards, effectively translating trajectory-level signals into
token-level guidance. Once trained, UniR can be combined with any frozen LLM at
inference time by simply adding its output logits to those of the LLM backbone.
This additive structure naturally enables modular composition: multiple UniR
modules trained for different tasks can be jointly applied by summing their
logits, enabling complex reasoning via composition. Experimental results on
mathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR
significantly outperforms \add{existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the
Llama3.2 model}. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong
generalization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide
much larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust
solution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core
capabilities. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/hangeol/UniR

Motivation: 现有推荐系统依赖显式CoT推理，但面临高质量CoT数据获取困难和推理延迟高的问题。

Result: 实验表明，LatentR$^3$无需直接监督推理过程即可实现高效隐式推理，显著提升LLM推荐方法的性能。

Conclusion: 隐式推理方法LatentR$^3$有效解决了显式CoT推理的局限性，为推荐系统提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks, sparking growing interest in
their application to preference reasoning in recommendation systems. Existing
methods typically rely on fine-tuning with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
data. However, these methods face significant practical limitations due to (1)
the difficulty of obtaining high-quality CoT data in recommendation and (2) the
high inference latency caused by generating CoT reasoning. In this work, we
explore an alternative approach that shifts from explicit CoT reasoning to
compact, information-dense latent reasoning. This approach eliminates the need
for explicit CoT generation and improves inference efficiency, as a small set
of latent tokens can effectively capture the entire reasoning process. Building
on this idea, we propose $\textit{\underline{R}einforced \underline{Latent}
\underline{R}easoning for \underline{R}ecommendation}$ (LatentR$^3$), a novel
end-to-end training framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize latent reasoning without relying on any CoT data.LatentR$^3$ adopts a
two-stage training strategy: first, supervised fine-tuning to initialize the
latent reasoning module, followed by pure RL training to encourage exploration
through a rule-based reward design. Our RL implementation is based on a
modified GRPO algorithm, which reduces computational overhead during training
and introduces continuous reward signals for more efficient learning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LatentR$^3$ enables effective latent reasoning
without any direct supervision of the reasoning process, significantly
improving performance when integrated with different LLM-based recommendation
methods. Our codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/R3-A278/.

Conclusion: ScreenExplorer为复杂交互环境中具有自我改进能力的AGI系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing
interest in building Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within Graphical
User Interface (GUI) environments. However, existing GUI agents based on LLMs
or vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to generalize to novel environments
and rely heavily on manually curated, diverse datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ScreenExplorer, a VLM trained via Group Relative
Policy Optimization(GRPO) in real, dynamic, and open-ended GUI environments.
Innovatively, we introduced a world-model-based curiosity reward function to
help the agent overcome the cold-start phase of exploration. Additionally,
distilling experience streams further enhances the model's exploration
capabilities. Our training framework enhances model exploration in open GUI
environments, with trained models showing better environmental adaptation and
sustained exploration compared to static deployment models. Our findings offer
a scalable pathway toward AGI systems with self-improving capabilities in
complex interactive settings.

Abstract: We present SeePhys, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for LLM reasoning
grounded in physics questions ranging from middle school to PhD qualifying

contrast to prior works where visual elements mainly serve auxiliary purposes,
our benchmark features a substantial proportion of vision-essential problems
(75\%) that mandate visual information extraction for correct solutions.
Through extensive evaluation, we observe that even the most advanced visual
reasoning models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-pro and o4-mini) achieve sub-60\% accuracy
on our benchmark. These results reveal fundamental challenges in current large

establishing rigorous coupling between diagram interpretation and physics

Motivation: 评估LLMs在组织层级和权限约束下的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 创建OrgAccess基准测试，包含40种权限类型和不同难度的测试集（40,000简单、10,000中等、20,000困难）。

Result: 即使最先进的LLMs（如GPT-4.1）在复杂权限场景中表现较差，F1分数仅为0.27。

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂规则遵循和组合推理能力上存在显著局限性，需进一步研究其在实际结构化环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Role-based access control (RBAC) and hierarchical structures are foundational
to how information flows and decisions are made within virtually all
organizations. As the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as
unified knowledge repositories and intelligent assistants in enterprise
settings becomes increasingly apparent, a critical, yet under explored,
challenge emerges: \textit{can these models reliably understand and operate
within the complex, often nuanced, constraints imposed by organizational
hierarchies and associated permissions?} Evaluating this crucial capability is
inherently difficult due to the proprietary and sensitive nature of real-world
corporate data and access control policies. We introduce a synthetic yet
representative \textbf{OrgAccess} benchmark consisting of 40 distinct types of
permissions commonly relevant across different organizational roles and levels.
We further create three types of permissions: 40,000 easy (1 permission),
10,000 medium (3-permissions tuple), and 20,000 hard (5-permissions tuple) to
test LLMs' ability to accurately assess these permissions and generate
responses that strictly adhere to the specified hierarchical rules,
particularly in scenarios involving users with overlapping or conflicting
permissions. Our findings reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle
significantly to maintain compliance with role-based structures, even with
explicit instructions, with their performance degrades further when navigating
interactions involving two or more conflicting permissions. Specifically, even
\textbf{GPT-4.1 only achieves an F1-Score of 0.27 on our hardest benchmark}.
This demonstrates a critical limitation in LLMs' complex rule following and
compositional reasoning capabilities beyond standard factual or STEM-based
benchmarks, opening up a new paradigm for evaluating their fitness for
practical, structured environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在克服纯算法方法的局限性，通过AI作为社交和文化技术，促进人类与AI的协作。

Method: 基于比较判断和最小后悔原则的数学基础，将AI应用于群体层面，作为交互代理和知识管理工具。

Result: GCI展示了在气候适应、医疗改革和公民参与等领域的应用潜力。

Conclusion: GCI通过结合人类创造力和AI计算能力，为解决复杂社会问题提供了新途径。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for human-AI collaboration that amplifies the
distinct capabilities of both. This framework, which we call Generative
Collective Intelligence (GCI), shifts AI to the group/social level and employs
AI in dual roles: as interactive agents and as technology that accumulates,
organizes, and leverages knowledge. By creating a cognitive bridge between
human reasoning and AI models, GCI can overcome the limitations of purely
algorithmic approaches to problem-solving and decision-making. The framework
demonstrates how AI can be reframed as a social and cultural technology that
enables groups to solve complex problems through structured collaboration that
transcends traditional communication barriers. We describe the mathematical
foundations of GCI based on comparative judgment and minimum regret principles,
and illustrate its applications across domains including climate adaptation,
healthcare transformation, and civic participation. By combining human
creativity with AI's computational capabilities, GCI offers a promising
approach to addressing complex societal challenges that neither human or
machines can solve alone.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种结合LLM的异构学生代理和自优化教师代理的模拟框架，通过遗传算法动态优化教学策略，并引入Persona-RAG模块增强个性化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有教学模拟框架存在学生代理静态化和教师代理缺乏适应性等问题，无法满足多样化教学需求。

Method: 采用LLM构建异构学生代理，结合遗传算法优化教师代理的教学策略，并设计Persona-RAG模块实现个性化知识检索。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能生成多样且可解释的教学模式，适用于不同学生群体。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的模拟框架为自适应教学实践提供了新思路，并为教师培训提供了数据驱动的测试环境。

Abstract: Effective teaching requires adapting instructional strategies to accommodate
the diverse cognitive and behavioral profiles of students, a persistent
challenge in education and teacher training. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise as tools to simulate such complex pedagogical environments,
current simulation frameworks are limited in two key respects: (1) they often
reduce students to static knowledge profiles, and (2) they lack adaptive
mechanisms for modeling teachers who evolve their strategies in response to
student feedback. To address these gaps, \textbf{we introduce a novel
simulation framework that integrates LLM-based heterogeneous student agents
with a self-optimizing teacher agent}. The teacher agent's pedagogical policy
is dynamically evolved using a genetic algorithm, allowing it to discover and
refine effective teaching strategies based on the aggregate performance of
diverse learners. In addition, \textbf{we propose Persona-RAG}, a Retrieval
Augmented Generation module that enables student agents to retrieve knowledge
tailored to their individual learning styles. Persona-RAG preserves the
retrieval accuracy of standard RAG baselines while enhancing personalization,
an essential factor in modeling realistic educational scenarios. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate how our framework supports the emergence
of distinct and interpretable teaching patterns when interacting with varied
student populations. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-driven
simulations to inform adaptive teaching practices and provide a testbed for
training human educators in controlled, data-driven environments.

TLDR: CardioCoT是一种新型两阶段分层推理增强生存分析框架，旨在提高模型可解释性和预测性能，用于急性心肌梗死患者的主要不良心血管事件复发风险预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注风险分层能力，忽视了临床实践中对中间稳健推理和模型可解释性的需求，且端到端风险预测面临数据限制和建模复杂性的挑战。

Method: CardioCoT采用两阶段方法：第一阶段通过证据增强的自优化机制生成稳健的分层推理轨迹；第二阶段将推理轨迹与影像数据结合进行风险模型训练和预测。

Result: CardioCoT在MACE复发风险预测中表现出优越性能，并提供可解释的推理过程。

Conclusion: CardioCoT为临床决策提供了有价值的见解，同时提升了预测性能和模型可解释性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events recurrence risk in
acute myocardial infarction patients based on postoperative cardiac MRI and
associated clinical notes is crucial for precision treatment and personalized
intervention. Existing methods primarily focus on risk stratification
capability while overlooking the need for intermediate robust reasoning and
model interpretability in clinical practice. Moreover, end-to-end risk
prediction using LLM/VLM faces significant challenges due to data limitations
and modeling complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose CardioCoT, a novel
two-stage hierarchical reasoning-enhanced survival analysis framework designed
to enhance both model interpretability and predictive performance. In the first
stage, we employ an evidence-augmented self-refinement mechanism to guide
LLM/VLMs in generating robust hierarchical reasoning trajectories based on
associated radiological findings. In the second stage, we integrate the
reasoning trajectories with imaging data for risk model training and
prediction. CardioCoT demonstrates superior performance in MACE recurrence risk
prediction while providing interpretable reasoning processes, offering valuable
insights for clinical decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖人工处理，效率低且难以扩展，亟需一种自动化的解决方案。

Method: 采用多智能体系统，包括提取代理（标准化关键指标）和文本转SQL代理（生成可执行SQL语句）。

Result: 系统在结构化数据转换中达到95%准确率，检索任务中91%的响应正确。

Conclusion: 该系统能够高效、准确地处理非结构化财务文件，性能接近人工水平且具有良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Extracting structured and quantitative insights from unstructured financial
filings is essential in investment research, yet remains time-consuming and
resource-intensive. Conventional approaches in practice rely heavily on
labor-intensive manual processes, limiting scalability and delaying the
research workflow. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable method
for accurately extracting quantitative insights from unstructured financial
documents, leveraging a multi-agent system composed of large language models.
Our proposed multi-agent system consists of two specialized agents: the
\emph{Extraction Agent} and the \emph{Text-to-SQL Agent}. The
\textit{Extraction Agent} automatically identifies key performance indicators
from unstructured financial text, standardizes their formats, and verifies
their accuracy. On the other hand, the \textit{Text-to-SQL Agent} generates
executable SQL statements from natural language queries, allowing users to
access structured data accurately without requiring familiarity with the
database schema. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed system
effectively transforms unstructured text into structured data accurately and
enables precise retrieval of key information. First, we demonstrate that our
system achieves approximately 95\% accuracy in transforming financial filings
into structured data, matching the performance level typically attained by
human annotators. Second, in a human evaluation of the retrieval task -- where
natural language queries are used to search information from structured data --
91\% of the responses were rated as correct by human evaluators. In both
evaluations, our system generalizes well across financial document types,
consistently delivering reliable performance.

TLDR: 论文提出MedCCO，一种针对医学VQA的多模态强化学习框架，通过课程驱动的RFT范式统一封闭式和开放式任务，显著提升模型性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学强化微调方法主要关注封闭式VQA，无法满足临床对开放式、推理密集型决策的需求，因此需要一种新方法填补这一空白。

Method: MedCCO采用课程驱动的RFT范式，先在多样化封闭式医学VQA任务上微调，再逐步适应开放式任务，以增强知识深度和临床可解释性。

Result: 在八个医学VQA基准测试中，MedCCO表现优异，封闭式任务准确率提升11.4%，开放式任务提升5.7%。

Conclusion: MedCCO展示了课程引导的强化学习在提升医学多模态语言模型推理能力和临床相关性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning with verifiable, rule-based rewards
have greatly enhanced the reasoning capabilities and out-of-distribution
generalization of VLMs/LLMs, obviating the need for manually crafted reasoning
chains. Despite these promising developments in the general domain, their
translation to medical imaging remains limited. Current medical reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT) methods predominantly focus on close-ended VQA, thereby
restricting the model's ability to engage in world knowledge retrieval and
flexible task adaptation. More critically, these methods fall short of
addressing the critical clinical demand for open-ended, reasoning-intensive
decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MedCCO}, the first
multimodal reinforcement learning framework tailored for medical VQA that
unifies close-ended and open-ended data within a curriculum-driven RFT
paradigm. Specifically, MedCCO is initially fine-tuned on a diverse set of
close-ended medical VQA tasks to establish domain-grounded reasoning
capabilities, and is then progressively adapted to open-ended tasks to foster
deeper knowledge enhancement and clinical interpretability. We validate MedCCO
across eight challenging medical VQA benchmarks, spanning both close-ended and
open-ended settings. Experimental results show that MedCCO consistently
enhances performance and generalization, achieving a 11.4\% accuracy gain
across three in-domain tasks, and a 5.7\% improvement on five out-of-domain
benchmarks. These findings highlight the promise of curriculum-guided RL in
advancing robust, clinically-relevant reasoning in medical multimodal language
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主系统在仓库、城市交通等复杂环境中的普及，MAPF从理论问题演变为实际应用的关键技术，需要统一传统算法与学习方法的框架。

Method: 综述了搜索方法（如冲突搜索、优先级搜索）、基于编译的方法（如SAT、SMT）和数据驱动技术（如强化学习），并分析了200多篇论文的实验方法。

Result: 发现传统方法通常在大规模实例上测试（如200x200网格，1000+智能体），而学习方法多在较小规模（10-100智能体），并提出了标准化评估的需求。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括混合动机MAPF、语言基础规划与神经网络架构，本文为研究和实际应用提供了全面参考。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in artificial
intelligence and robotics, requiring the computation of collision-free paths
for multiple agents navigating from their start locations to designated goals.
As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in warehouses, urban
transportation, and other complex environments, MAPF has evolved from a
theoretical challenge to a critical enabler of real-world multi-robot
coordination. This comprehensive survey bridges the long-standing divide
between classical algorithmic approaches and emerging learning-based methods in
MAPF research. We present a unified framework that encompasses search-based
methods (including Conflict-Based Search, Priority-Based Search, and Large
Neighborhood Search), compilation-based approaches (SAT, SMT, CSP, ASP, and MIP
formulations), and data-driven techniques (reinforcement learning, supervised
learning, and hybrid strategies). Through systematic analysis of experimental
practices across 200+ papers, we uncover significant disparities in evaluation
methodologies, with classical methods typically tested on larger-scale
instances (up to 200 by 200 grids with 1000+ agents) compared to learning-based
approaches (predominantly 10-100 agents). We provide a comprehensive taxonomy
of evaluation metrics, environment types, and baseline selections, highlighting
the need for standardized benchmarking protocols. Finally, we outline promising
future directions including mixed-motive MAPF with game-theoretic
considerations, language-grounded planning with large language models, and
neural solver architectures that combine the rigor of classical methods with
the flexibility of deep learning. This survey serves as both a comprehensive
reference for researchers and a practical guide for deploying MAPF solutions in
increasingly complex real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有学习延迟方法中二元选择（AI或人类）的局限性，缺乏解释性和互补性，特别是在高风险场景中。

Method: 提出DeCoDe框架，基于人类可解释的概念表示进行策略决策，通过门控网络选择模式，并使用新的代理损失平衡准确性和人力成本。

Result: 实验表明，DeCoDe在真实数据集上显著优于仅AI、仅人类和传统延迟基线，且具有强鲁棒性和解释性。

Conclusion: DeCoDe为实例化、可解释和自适应的人机协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In human-AI collaboration, a central challenge is deciding whether the AI
should handle a task, be deferred to a human expert, or be addressed through
collaborative effort. Existing Learning to Defer approaches typically make
binary choices between AI and humans, neglecting their complementary strengths.
They also lack interpretability, a critical property in high-stakes scenarios
where users must understand and, if necessary, correct the model's reasoning.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Defer-and-Complement Decision-Making
via Decoupled Concept Bottleneck Models (DeCoDe), a concept-driven framework
for human-AI collaboration. DeCoDe makes strategy decisions based on
human-interpretable concept representations, enhancing transparency throughout
the decision process. It supports three flexible modes: autonomous AI
prediction, deferral to humans, and human-AI collaborative complementarity,
selected via a gating network that takes concept-level inputs and is trained
using a novel surrogate loss that balances accuracy and human effort. This
approach enables instance-specific, interpretable, and adaptive human-AI
collaboration. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DeCoDe
significantly outperforms AI-only, human-only, and traditional deferral
baselines, while maintaining strong robustness and interpretability even under
noisy expert annotations.

Conclusion: GUARDIAN为LLM多智能体协作提供了一种高效且精确的安全保障方法。

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) enables the development of
intelligent agents capable of engaging in complex and multi-turn dialogues.
However, multi-agent collaboration face critical safety challenges, such as
hallucination amplification and error injection and propagation. This paper
presents GUARDIAN, a unified method for detecting and mitigating multiple
safety concerns in GUARDing Intelligent Agent collaboratioNs. By modeling the
multi-agent collaboration process as a discrete-time temporal attributed graph,
GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and
errors. The unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture incorporating an
incremental training paradigm, learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph
structures from latent embeddings, enabling the identification of anomalous
nodes and edges with unparalleled precision. Moreover, we introduce a graph
abstraction mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck Theory, which
compresses temporal interaction graphs while preserving essential patterns.
Extensive experiments demonstrate GUARDIAN's effectiveness in safeguarding LLM
multi-agent collaborations against diverse safety vulnerabilities, achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy with efficient resource utilization.

Conclusion: 多模态LLM在适当的感官信息下展现出自我意识，为人工具身认知系统的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Self-awareness - the ability to distinguish oneself from the surrounding
environment - underpins intelligent, autonomous behavior. Recent advances in AI
achieve human-like performance in tasks integrating multimodal information,
particularly in large language models, raising interest in the embodiment
capabilities of AI agents on nonhuman platforms such as robots. Here, we
explore whether multimodal LLMs can develop self-awareness solely through
sensorimotor experiences. By integrating a multimodal LLM into an autonomous
mobile robot, we test its ability to achieve this capacity. We find that the
system exhibits robust environmental awareness, self-recognition and predictive
awareness, allowing it to infer its robotic nature and motion characteristics.
Structural equation modeling reveals how sensory integration influences
distinct dimensions of self-awareness and its coordination with past-present
memory, as well as the hierarchical internal associations that drive
self-identification. Ablation tests of sensory inputs identify critical
modalities for each dimension, demonstrate compensatory interactions among
sensors and confirm the essential role of structured and episodic memory in
coherent reasoning. These findings demonstrate that, given appropriate sensory
information about the world and itself, multimodal LLMs exhibit emergent
self-awareness, opening the door to artificial embodied cognitive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估PCK的任务耗时耗力，LLM提供了高效自动评分的可能性，但对其引入的CIV了解不足。

Method: 通过广义线性混合模型（GLMM）分析视频构建任务中的CIV来源，比较人类评分者、监督机器学习和LLM的评分差异。

Result: 场景变异影响小，评分者相关因素对CIV贡献大；LLM评分最宽松，监督ML最严格。

Conclusion: LLM在提升评分效率的同时也引入CIV，需关注评分者培训和模型可解释性。

Abstract: Assessing teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) through
performance-based tasks is both time and effort-consuming. While large language
models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for efficient automatic scoring, little
is known about whether LLMs introduce construct-irrelevant variance (CIV) in
ways similar to or different from traditional machine learning (ML) and human
raters. This study examines three sources of CIV -- scenario variability, rater
severity, and rater sensitivity to scenario -- in the context of video-based
constructed-response tasks targeting two PCK sub-constructs: analyzing student
thinking and evaluating teacher responsiveness. Using generalized linear mixed
models (GLMMs), we compared variance components and rater-level scoring
patterns across three scoring sources: human raters, supervised ML, and LLM.
Results indicate that scenario-level variance was minimal across tasks, while
rater-related factors contributed substantially to CIV, especially in the more
interpretive Task II. The ML model was the most severe and least sensitive
rater, whereas the LLM was the most lenient. These findings suggest that the
LLM contributes to scoring efficiency while also introducing CIV as human
raters do, yet with varying levels of contribution compared to supervised ML.
Implications for rater training, automated scoring design, and future research
on model interpretability are discussed.

Abstract: This paper argues that token prediction is fundamentally misaligned with real
creativity. While next-token models have enabled impressive advances in
language generation, their architecture favours surface-level coherence over
spontaneity, originality, and improvisational risk. We use battle rap as a case
study to expose the limitations of predictive systems, demonstrating that they
cannot truly engage in adversarial or emotionally resonant exchanges. By
reframing creativity as an interactive process rather than a predictive output,
we offer a vision for AI systems that are more expressive, responsive, and
aligned with human creative practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI公平性指标（如人口统计平等）未考虑个体在特征空间中的努力轨迹，而哲学和人类对公平的理解中努力是关键因素。

Method: 提出基于“力”或特征时间轨迹的EaF理论框架，并通过预注册人类实验和实际场景（刑事司法与个人财务）验证。

Result: 实验表明人类更关注特征的时间轨迹而非聚合值；实际场景中EaF指标能揭示不公平决策。

Conclusion: EaF指标有助于发现并纠正对努力改善但仍受系统性劣势影响的个体的不公平决策。

Abstract: Although popularized AI fairness metrics, e.g., demographic parity, have
uncovered bias in AI-assisted decision-making outcomes, they do not consider
how much effort one has spent to get to where one is today in the input feature
space. However, the notion of effort is important in how Philosophy and humans
understand fairness. We propose a philosophy-informed way to conceptualize and
evaluate Effort-aware Fairness (EaF) based on the concept of Force, or temporal
trajectory of predictive features coupled with inertia. In addition to our
theoretical formulation of EaF metrics, our empirical contributions include: 1/
a pre-registered human subjects experiment, which demonstrates that for both
stages of the (individual) fairness evaluation process, people consider the
temporal trajectory of a predictive feature more than its aggregate value; 2/
pipelines to compute Effort-aware Individual/Group Fairness in the criminal
justice and personal finance contexts. Our work may enable AI model auditors to
uncover and potentially correct unfair decisions against individuals who spent
significant efforts to improve but are still stuck with systemic/early-life
disadvantages outside their control.

Motivation: 当前对LLM引导技术的评估侧重于任务特定性能，而忽略了引导表示与人类认知的对齐程度。

Method: 使用三元相似性判断任务，评估LLM在基于‘大小’或‘种类’灵活判断概念相似性的能力。

Result: 基于提示的引导方法在引导准确性和模型与人类对齐方面表现最佳；LLM对‘种类’相似性有偏好，但在‘大小’对齐上表现较差。

Conclusion: 基于人类认知的评估方法支持基于提示的引导效果，并揭示了LLM在引导前的表征偏好。

Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) steering techniques focus
on task-specific performance, overlooking how well steered representations
align with human cognition. Using a well-established triadic similarity
judgment task, we assessed steered LLMs on their ability to flexibly judge
similarity between concepts based on size or kind. We found that prompt-based
steering methods outperformed other methods both in terms of steering accuracy
and model-to-human alignment. We also found LLMs were biased towards 'kind'
similarity and struggled with 'size' alignment. This evaluation approach,
grounded in human cognition, adds further support to the efficacy of
prompt-based steering and reveals privileged representational axes in LLMs
prior to steering.

Result: 实验表明，PatentMind与专家标注的相似性高度相关（r=0.938），优于嵌入模型和提示工程方法。

Conclusion: 模块化推理框架能有效克服嵌入方法在专利相似性分析中的局限性。

Abstract: Patent similarity evaluation plays a critical role in intellectual property
analysis. However, existing methods often overlook the intricate structure of
patent documents, which integrate technical specifications, legal boundaries,
and application contexts. We introduce PatentMind, a novel framework for patent
similarity assessment based on a Multi-Aspect Reasoning Graph (MARG).
PatentMind decomposes patents into three core dimensions: technical feature,
application domain, and claim scope, to compute dimension-specific similarity
scores. These scores are dynamically weighted through a four-stage reasoning
process which integrates contextual signals to emulate expert-level judgment.
To support evaluation, we construct PatentSimBench, a human-annotated benchmark
comprising 500 patent pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that PatentMind
achieves a strong correlation ($r=0.938$) with expert annotations,
significantly outperforming embedding-based models and advanced prompt
engineering methods.These results highlight the effectiveness of modular
reasoning frameworks in overcoming key limitations of embedding-based methods
for analyzing patent similarity.

Conclusion: 该框架为哲学家提供了理解GenAI认识论挑战的工具，同时为软件工程师提供了更批判性的协作基础。

Abstract: With the rise of generative AI (GenAI), Large Language Models are
increasingly employed for code generation, becoming active co-authors alongside
human programmers. Focusing specifically on this application domain, this paper
articulates distinct ``Architectures of Error'' to ground an epistemic
distinction between human and machine code generation. Examined through their
shared vulnerability to error, this distinction reveals fundamentally different
causal origins: human-cognitive versus artificial-stochastic. To develop this
framework and substantiate the distinction, the analysis draws critically upon
Dennett's mechanistic functionalism and Rescher's methodological pragmatism. I
argue that a systematic differentiation of these error profiles raises critical
philosophical questions concerning semantic coherence, security robustness,
epistemic limits, and control mechanisms in human-AI collaborative software
development. The paper also utilizes Floridi's levels of abstraction to provide
a nuanced understanding of how these error dimensions interact and may evolve
with technological advancements. This analysis aims to offer philosophers a
structured framework for understanding GenAI's unique epistemological
challenges, shaped by these architectural foundations, while also providing
software engineers a basis for more critically informed engagement.

Conclusion: 一致性溯因方法能有效整合多个不完美模型的预测，提升在复杂新场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often
leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent
artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to
characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the
cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging
multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate
the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various
models as a consistency-based abduction problem. The input predictions and the
learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic
program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model
predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of
logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a
specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge
representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an
efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated
aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we
demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models
and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative
improvements of approximately 13.6% in F1-score and 16.6% in accuracy across 15
diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results
validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to
robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect reasoners in challenging,
novel scenarios.

*Georgy Noarov,Soham Mallick,Tao Wang,Sunay Joshi,Yan Sun,Yangxinyu Xie,Mengxin Yu,Edgar Dobriban*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文提出了一个理论框架，解释并推广了top-$k$解码方法，将其视为稀疏概率分布的恢复问题，并提出了新的解码策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有top-$k$解码方法缺乏理论支持，作者希望通过理论框架解释其合理性并扩展其应用。

Method: 使用Bregman解码器，通过最小化可分离Bregman散度和稀疏诱导的$\ell_0$正则化来优化解码策略。

Result: 证明了最优解码策略是贪心的，且损失函数在$k$上是离散凸的，从而可以高效找到最优$k$。top-$k$解码是KL散度的一个特例。

Conclusion: 理论框架不仅解释了top-$k$解码，还提出了新的解码策略，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Top-$k$ decoding is a widely used method for sampling from LLMs: at each
token, only the largest $k$ next-token-probabilities are kept, and the next
token is sampled after re-normalizing them to sum to unity. Top-$k$ and other
sampling methods are motivated by the intuition that true next-token
distributions are sparse, and the noisy LLM probabilities need to be truncated.
However, to our knowledge, a precise theoretical motivation for the use of
top-$k$ decoding is missing. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework
that both explains and generalizes top-$k$ decoding. We view decoding at a
fixed token as the recovery of a sparse probability distribution. We consider
\emph{Bregman decoders} obtained by minimizing a separable Bregman divergence
(for both the \emph{primal} and \emph{dual} cases) with a sparsity-inducing
$\ell_0$ regularization. Despite the combinatorial nature of the objective, we
show how to optimize it efficiently for a large class of divergences. We show
that the optimal decoding strategies are greedy, and further that the loss
function is discretely convex in $k$, so that binary search provably and
efficiently finds the optimal $k$. We show that top-$k$ decoding arises as a
special case for the KL divergence, and identify new decoding strategies that
have distinct behaviors (e.g., non-linearly up-weighting larger probabilities
after re-normalization).

Result: 在Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025中表现出色，PDMS达到45.0。

Conclusion: Diff-VLA通过结合VLM和稀疏-密集扩散策略，显著提升了自动驾驶在复杂场景下的性能。

Abstract: Research interest in end-to-end autonomous driving has surged owing to its
fully differentiable design integrating modular tasks, i.e. perception,
prediction and planing, which enables optimization in pursuit of the ultimate
goal. Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods
suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view)
computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid sparse-dense
diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA.
We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal
driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving
decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep
interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output. Our method shows
superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains
challenging real and reactive synthetic scenarios. Our methods achieves 45.0
PDMS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在小型参数设置下难以适应个性化常识知识的挑战。

Method: 基于ATOMIC20/20常识图谱，通过多阶段推理生成典型和非典型编辑，评估四种指标。

Result: AlphaEdit方法在可靠性和扩展性上优于其他方法，干扰最小。

Conclusion: CaseEdit和AlphaEdit为轻量级个性化助手提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance on factual recall and
general reasoning but struggle to adapt to user-specific, commonsense
knowledge, a challenge particularly acute in small-parameter settings where
computational efficiency is prioritized. We introduce CaseEdit, a new dataset
and generation pipeline for evaluating localized, personalized commonsense
knowledge editing in small LLMs to address this. Built upon the ATOMIC20/20
commonsense graph, CaseEdit uses a multi-stage inference process to generate
both typical and atypical contextual edits for household objects, paired with
targeted evaluation questions across four axes: reliability, generalization,
locality, and portability. We evaluate established knowledge editing methods
using CaseEdit and demonstrate that AlphaEdit, a technique employing null-space
projection to minimize interference with unrelated knowledge, consistently
outperforms other methods when applied to an LLaMA 3.2 3B model, even in
scalability tests, showing minimal ripple effects. Our results indicate that
using CaseEdit with effective editing techniques like AlphaEdit allows small
models to internalize high-quality, context-sensitive common-sense knowledge,
paving the way for lightweight, personalized assistants.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在传播学和社会科学中的应用潜力，探索其对传统方法的补充作用。

Method: 通过跨学科研究，分析LLMs在文本编码、动态受访者模拟和个性化刺激生成中的应用。

Result: LLMs为消息研究、受众分析和效果研究提供了新方法，但也面临有效性、偏见和可解释性问题。

Conclusion: LLMs应被视为技术和文化工具，需谨慎、创新地应用于未来研究，同时保持传统研究逻辑的重要性。

Abstract: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) are transforming core
quantitative methods in communication research in particular, and in the social
sciences more broadly-namely, content analysis, survey research, and
experimental studies. Rather than replacing classical approaches, LLMs
introduce new possibilities for coding and interpreting text, simulating
dynamic respondents, and generating personalized and interactive stimuli.
Drawing on recent interdisciplinary work, the paper highlights both the
potential and limitations of LLMs as research tools, including issues of
validity, bias, and interpretability. To situate these developments
theoretically, the paper revisits Lasswell's foundational framework -- "Who
says what, in which channel, to whom, with what effect?" -- and demonstrates
how LLMs reconfigure message studies, audience analysis, and effects research
by enabling interpretive variation, audience trajectory modeling, and
counterfactual experimentation. Revisiting the metaphor of the methodological
compass, the paper argues that classical research logics remain essential as
the field integrates LLMs and generative AI. By treating LLMs not only as
technical instruments but also as epistemic and cultural tools, the paper calls
for thoughtful, rigorous, and imaginative use of LLMs in future communication
and social science research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs是否能够通过RL等后训练策略继承LLMs的推理能力，并评估其在组合任务中的表现。

Method: 设计了一套诊断任务，比较监督微调（SFT）和RL训练的模型在组合任务中的表现，并引入视觉内容描述和奖励机制。

Result: RL训练的模型在组合泛化上优于SFT，但VLMs在跨模态和跨任务泛化上仍有不足；视觉到文本的对齐和准确的视觉基础是提升组合性的关键。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前RL训练VLMs的局限性，并提出了改进组合推理能力的可行方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities
utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable reward, whether large
vision-language models (VLMs) can directly inherit such capabilities through
similar post-training strategies remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic compositional probing study to evaluate whether current
VLMs trained with RL or other post-training strategies can compose capabilities
across modalities or tasks under out-of-distribution conditions. We design a
suite of diagnostic tasks that train models on unimodal tasks or isolated
reasoning skills, and evaluate them on multimodal, compositional variants
requiring skill integration. Through comparisons between supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and RL-trained models, we identify three key findings: (1) RL-trained
models consistently outperform SFT on compositional generalization,
demonstrating better integration of learned skills; (2) although VLMs achieve
strong performance on individual tasks, they struggle to generalize
compositionally under cross-modal and cross-task scenario, revealing a
significant gap in current training strategies; (3) enforcing models to
explicitly describe visual content before reasoning (e.g.,
caption-before-thinking), along with rewarding progressive vision-to-text
grounding, yields notable gains. It highlights two essential ingredients for
improving compositionality in VLMs: visual-to-text alignment and accurate
visual grounding. Our findings shed light on the current limitations of
RL-based reasoning VLM training and provide actionable insights toward building
models that reason compositionally across modalities and tasks.

Abstract: The explosion in artificial intelligence (AI) applications is pushing the
development of AI-dedicated data centers (AIDCs), creating management
challenges that traditional methods and standalone AI solutions struggle to
address. While digital twins are beneficial for AI-based design validation and
operational optimization, current AI methods for their creation face
limitations. Specifically, physical AI (PhyAI) aims to capture the underlying
physical laws, which demands extensive, case-specific customization, and
generative AI (GenAI) can produce inaccurate or hallucinated results. We
propose Fusion Intelligence, a novel framework synergizing GenAI's automation
with PhyAI's domain grounding. In this dual-agent collaboration, GenAI
interprets natural language prompts to generate tokenized AIDC digital twins.
Subsequently, PhyAI optimizes these generated twins by enforcing physical
constraints and assimilating real-time data. Case studies demonstrate the
advantages of our framework in automating the creation and validation of AIDC
digital twins. These twins deliver predictive analytics to support power usage
effectiveness (PUE) optimization in the design stage. With operational data
collected, the digital twin accuracy is further improved compared with pure
physics-based models developed by human experts. Fusion Intelligence offers a
promising pathway to accelerate digital transformation. It enables more
reliable and efficient AI-driven digital transformation for a broad range of
mission-critical infrastructures.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了数据中心的操作智能，同时指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Data centers are the backbone of computing capacity. Operating data centers
in the tropical regions faces unique challenges due to consistently high
ambient temperature and elevated relative humidity throughout the year. These
conditions result in increased cooling costs to maintain the reliability of the
computing systems. While existing machine learning-based approaches have
demonstrated potential to elevate operations to a more proactive and
intelligent level, their deployment remains dubious due to concerns about model
extrapolation capabilities and associated system safety issues. To address
these concerns, this article proposes incorporating the physical
characteristics of data centers into traditional data-driven machine learning
solutions. We begin by introducing the data center system, including the
relevant multiphysics processes and the data-physics availability. Next, we
outline the associated modeling and optimization problems and propose an
integrated, physics-informed machine learning system to address them. Using the
proposed system, we present relevant applications across varying levels of
operational intelligence. A case study on an industry-grade tropical data
center is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally,
we discuss key challenges and highlight potential future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多步交互中因缺乏持久记忆和依赖跟踪能力，常出现幻觉和误解，影响自主代理的可靠性。

Method: TME采用图结构（树或DAG）替代线性上下文，结合TRIM组件建模任务语义和用户意图，实现多轮推理和修订。

Result: 在四个多轮任务中，TME完全消除三个任务的幻觉和误解，整体减少幻觉66.7%、误解83.3%，优于ReAct。

Conclusion: TME的模块化设计支持即插即用和领域定制，为复杂交互场景中的LLM代理性能填补关键空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) falter in multi-step interactions -- often
hallucinating, repeating actions, or misinterpreting user corrections -- due to
reliance on linear, unstructured context. This fragility stems from the lack of
persistent memory to track evolving goals and task dependencies, undermining
trust in autonomous agents. We introduce the Task Memory Engine (TME), a
modular memory controller that transforms existing LLMs into robust,
revision-aware agents without fine-tuning. TME implements a spatial memory
framework that replaces flat context with graph-based structures to support
consistent, multi-turn reasoning. Departing from linear concatenation and
ReAct-style prompting, TME builds a dynamic task graph -- either a tree or
directed acyclic graph (DAG) -- to map user inputs to subtasks, align them with
prior context, and enable dependency-tracked revisions. Its Task Representation
and Intent Management (TRIM) component models task semantics and user intent to
ensure accurate interpretation. Across four multi-turn scenarios-trip planning,
cooking, meeting scheduling, and shopping cart editing -- TME eliminates 100%
of hallucinations and misinterpretations in three tasks, and reduces
hallucinations by 66.7% and misinterpretations by 83.3% across 27 user turns,
outperforming ReAct. TME's modular design supports plug-and-play deployment and
domain-specific customization, adaptable to both personal assistants and
enterprise automation. We release TME's codebase, benchmarks, and components as
open-source resources, enabling researchers to develop reliable LLM agents.
TME's scalable architecture addresses a critical gap in agent performance
across complex, interactive settings.

Motivation: 可控代码生成（在保持功能的同时遵循指定风格）仍具挑战性。

Method: 第一阶段对齐代码风格表示与语义和结构特征；第二阶段基于学习到的风格向量微调语言模型（如Flan-T5）以指导生成。

Result: 框架支持风格插值和用户个性化，且不牺牲代码正确性。

Conclusion: 这是首次将对比对齐与条件解码结合用于风格引导的代码生成。

Abstract: Controllable code generation, the ability to synthesize code that follows a
specified style while maintaining functionality, remains a challenging task. We
propose a two-stage training framework combining contrastive learning and
conditional decoding to enable flexible style control. The first stage aligns
code style representations with semantic and structural features. In the second
stage, we fine-tune a language model (e.g., Flan-T5) conditioned on the learned
style vector to guide generation. Our method supports style interpolation and
user personalization via lightweight mixing. Compared to prior work, our
unified framework offers improved stylistic control without sacrificing code
correctness. This is among the first approaches to combine contrastive
alignment with conditional decoding for style-guided code generation.

Motivation: 评估LLM在逻辑密集、精度关键的金融领域中的可靠性，填补现有基准测试的空白。

Result: 不同模型在不同任务中表现差异显著，专有模型在推理任务中领先，开源模型表现较差。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在常规金融任务中表现尚可，但复杂推理能力不足，BizFinBench为未来研究提供严谨基准。

Abstract: Large language models excel in general tasks, yet assessing their reliability
in logic-heavy, precision-critical domains like finance, law, and healthcare
remains challenging. To address this, we introduce BizFinBench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world financial
applications. BizFinBench consists of 6,781 well-annotated queries in Chinese,
spanning five dimensions: numerical calculation, reasoning, information
extraction, prediction recognition, and knowledge-based question answering,
grouped into nine fine-grained categories. The benchmark includes both
objective and subjective metrics. We also introduce IteraJudge, a novel LLM
evaluation method that reduces bias when LLMs serve as evaluators in objective
metrics. We benchmark 25 models, including both proprietary and open-source
systems. Extensive experiments show that no model dominates across all tasks.
Our evaluation reveals distinct capability patterns: (1) In Numerical
Calculation, Claude-3.5-Sonnet (63.18) and DeepSeek-R1 (64.04) lead, while
smaller models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B (15.92) lag significantly; (2) In Reasoning,
proprietary models dominate (ChatGPT-o3: 83.58, Gemini-2.0-Flash: 81.15), with
open-source models trailing by up to 19.49 points; (3) In Information
Extraction, the performance spread is the largest, with DeepSeek-R1 scoring
71.46, while Qwen3-1.7B scores 11.23; (4) In Prediction Recognition,
performance variance is minimal, with top models scoring between 39.16 and
50.00. We find that while current LLMs handle routine finance queries
competently, they struggle with complex scenarios requiring cross-concept
reasoning. BizFinBench offers a rigorous, business-aligned benchmark for future
research. The code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，微调过程中的透明度问题引发了开源社区的信任危机，现有验证技术难以应对混淆技术。

Method: 提出Origin-Tracer方法，通过提取LoRA秩和检测微调来源，提供更鲁棒的验证框架。

Result: 在31个开源模型上验证了方法的有效性，能够应对现实中的混淆场景。

Conclusion: Origin-Tracer为模型验证设立了新基准，但仍存在局限性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their deployment often
involves fine-tuning to enhance performance on specific downstream tasks.
However, this customization is sometimes accompanied by misleading claims about
the origins, raising significant concerns about transparency and trust within
the open-source community. Existing model verification techniques typically
assess functional, representational, and weight similarities. However, these
approaches often struggle against obfuscation techniques, such as permutations
and scaling transformations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
detection method Origin-Tracer that rigorously determines whether a model has
been fine-tuned from a specified base model. This method includes the ability
to extract the LoRA rank utilized during the fine-tuning process, providing a
more robust verification framework. This framework is the first to provide a
formalized approach specifically aimed at pinpointing the sources of model
fine-tuning. We empirically validated our method on thirty-one diverse
open-source models under conditions that simulate real-world obfuscation
scenarios. We empirically analyze the effectiveness of our framework and
finally, discuss its limitations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach and indicate its potential to establish new benchmarks for model
verification.

Conclusion: 通过因果干预，该方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型中的物体幻觉问题，提升了模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
in visual understanding tasks, yet they often suffer from object
hallucinations--generating descriptions of objects that are inconsistent with
or entirely absent from the input. This issue is closely related to dataset
biases, where frequent co-occurrences of objects lead to entangled semantic
representations across modalities. As a result, models may erroneously activate
object representations that are commonly associated with the input but not
actually present.
  To address this, we propose a causality-driven disentanglement framework that
mitigates hallucinations through causal intervention. Our approach includes a
Causal-Driven Projector in the visual pathway and a Causal Intervention Module
integrated into the final transformer layer of the language model. These
components work together to reduce spurious correlations caused by biased
training data.
  Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces
hallucinations while maintaining strong performance on multiple multimodal
benchmarks. Visualization analyses further confirm improved separability of
object representations.

Method: 系统分析四种偏见类型（位置、冗长、思维链和从众），在Multi-Agent-Debate和LLM-as-Meta-Judge框架中评估，并引入PINE方法作为无偏见代理。

Conclusion: 多代理LLM-as-Judge系统需针对性偏见缓解策略，PINE在辩论中有效，但需进一步优化以适应不同框架。

Abstract: LLM-as-Judge has emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation,
enabling large language models (LLMs) to provide reward signals in trainings.
While recent work has explored multi-agent extensions such as multi-agent
debate and meta-judging to enhance evaluation quality, the question of how
intrinsic biases manifest in these settings remains underexplored. In this
study, we conduct a systematic analysis of four diverse bias types: position
bias, verbosity bias, chain-of-thought bias, and bandwagon bias. We evaluate
these biases across two widely adopted multi-agent LLM-as-Judge frameworks:
Multi-Agent-Debate and LLM-as-Meta-Judge. Our results show that debate
framework amplifies biases sharply after the initial debate, and this increased
bias is sustained in subsequent rounds, while meta-judge approaches exhibit
greater resistance. We further investigate the incorporation of PINE, a leading
single-agent debiasing method, as a bias-free agent within these systems. The
results reveal that this bias-free agent effectively reduces biases in debate
settings but provides less benefit in meta-judge scenarios. Our work provides a
comprehensive study of bias behavior in multi-agent LLM-as-Judge systems and
highlights the need for targeted bias mitigation strategies in collaborative
evaluation settings.

TLDR: 该论文介绍了LinuxFLBench，一个基于真实Linux内核错误的故障定位（FL）基准测试，并评估了现有LLM代理在Linux内核上的表现。发现现有方法效果不佳，提出了改进框架LinuxFL$^+$，显著提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linux内核作为关键系统，其错误可能导致严重后果。尽管LLM代理在FL任务中表现良好，但在Linux内核中的效果尚不明确，因此需要研究。

Method: 构建LinuxFLBench基准测试，评估现有LLM代理的FL性能，并提出改进框架LinuxFL$^+$。

Result: 现有代理在Linux内核中表现不佳（最高41.6%准确率），LinuxFL$^+$显著提升准确性（7.2%-11.2%）。

Conclusion: LinuxFL$^+$有效提升了LLM代理在Linux内核中的FL准确性，为未来研究提供了基准和工具。

Abstract: The Linux kernel is a critical system, serving as the foundation for numerous
systems. Bugs in the Linux kernel can cause serious consequences, affecting
billions of users. Fault localization (FL), which aims at identifying the buggy
code elements in software, plays an essential role in software quality
assurance. While recent LLM agents have achieved promising accuracy in FL on
recent benchmarks like SWE-bench, it remains unclear how well these methods
perform in the Linux kernel, where FL is much more challenging due to the
large-scale code base, limited observability, and diverse impact factors. In
this paper, we introduce LinuxFLBench, a FL benchmark constructed from
real-world Linux kernel bugs. We conduct an empirical study to assess the
performance of state-of-the-art LLM agents on the Linux kernel. Our initial
results reveal that existing agents struggle with this task, achieving a best
top-1 accuracy of only 41.6% at file level. To address this challenge, we
propose LinuxFL$^+$, an enhancement framework designed to improve FL
effectiveness of LLM agents for the Linux kernel. LinuxFL$^+$ substantially
improves the FL accuracy of all studied agents (e.g., 7.2% - 11.2% accuracy
increase) with minimal costs. Data and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂CAD模型设计中的计算效率低和生成精确模型困难的问题。

Method: 1. 半自动数据标注流程利用LLMs和视觉语言大模型生成高质量参数与外观描述；2. 基于Transformer的CAD生成器（TCADGen）通过双通道特征聚合预测建模序列；3. 改进的CAD建模生成模型（CADLLM）结合TCADGen的置信度分数优化生成序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率上优于传统方法，支持从文本提示生成复杂CAD模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为工业设计自动化提供了高效工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: Designing complex computer-aided design (CAD) models is often time-consuming
due to challenges such as computational inefficiency and the difficulty of
generating precise models. We propose a novel language-guided framework for
industrial design automation to address these issues, integrating large
language models (LLMs) with computer-automated design (CAutoD).Through this
framework, CAD models are automatically generated from parameters and
appearance descriptions, supporting the automation of design tasks during the
detailed CAD design phase. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a
semi-automated data annotation pipeline that leverages LLMs and vision-language
large models (VLLMs) to generate high-quality parameters and appearance
descriptions; (2) a Transformer-based CAD generator (TCADGen) that predicts
modeling sequences via dual-channel feature aggregation; (3) an enhanced CAD
modeling generation model, called CADLLM, that is designed to refine the
generated sequences by incorporating the confidence scores from TCADGen.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms
traditional methods in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a powerful tool
for automating industrial workflows and generating complex CAD models from
textual prompts. The code is available at

TLDR: 论文讨论了传统方法（如图灵测试）不足以检测人工通用智能（AGI），并提出了一种新的实用方法（Turing Tests 2.0）来判定系统是否达到AGI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏明确的AGI检测方法，传统方法（如图灵测试）无法满足需求，因此需要一种新的、更有效的方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的框架（Turing Tests 2.0），包括定义通用智能（GI）和设定GI阈值（GIT），并设计测试以简单、全面地检测系统是否达到GI。

Result: 通过实际应用展示了Turing Tests 2.0框架在现代AI模型上的有效性。

Conclusion: Turing Tests 2.0为AGI检测提供了一种更清晰、实用的方法，填补了传统方法的不足。

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence (A.I.) and large language models
like Chat-GPT, a new race for achieving artificial general intelligence (A.G.I)
has started. While many speculate how and when A.I. will achieve A.G.I., there
is no clear agreement on how A.G.I. can be detected in A.I. models, even when
popular tools like the Turing test (and its modern variations) are used to
measure their intelligence. In this work, we discuss why traditional methods
like the Turing test do not suffice for measuring or detecting A.G.I. and
provide a new, practical method that can be used to decide if a (computer or
any other) system has reached or surpassed A.G.I. To achieve this, we make two
new contributions. First, we present a clear definition for general
intelligence (G.I.) and set a G.I. threshold (G.I.T.) that can be used to
distinguish between systems that achieve A.G.I. and systems that do not.
Second, we present a new framework on how to construct tests that can detect if
a system has achieved G.I. in a simple, comprehensive, and clear-cut fail/pass
way. We call this novel framework the Turing Tests 2.0. We then demonstrate
real-life examples of applying tests that follow our Turing Tests 2.0 framework
on modern A.I. models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对LLM在医学诊断中偏见的系统性评估工具，AMQA填补了这一空白。

Method: 基于USMLE数据集，采用多智能体框架生成多样化的对抗性描述和问题对，构建AMQA数据集，并测试了五种代表性LLM。

Result: 测试显示，即使是表现最好的GPT-4.1，特权群体问题的准确性仍高出非特权群体10个百分点以上；与现有基准CPV相比，AMQA揭示的准确性差距平均大15%。

Conclusion: AMQA为可复现研究和推动可信赖、无偏见的医学AI提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reaching expert-level accuracy on medical
diagnosis questions, yet their mistakes and the biases behind them pose
life-critical risks. Bias linked to race, sex, and socioeconomic status is
already well known, but a consistent and automatic testbed for measuring it is
missing. To fill this gap, this paper presents AMQA -- an Adversarial Medical
Question-Answering dataset -- built for automated, large-scale bias evaluation
of LLMs in medical QA. AMQA includes 4,806 medical QA pairs sourced from the
United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) dataset, generated using a
multi-agent framework to create diverse adversarial descriptions and question
pairs. Using AMQA, we benchmark five representative LLMs and find surprisingly
substantial disparities: even GPT-4.1, the least biased model tested, answers
privileged-group questions over 10 percentage points more accurately than
unprivileged ones. Compared with the existing benchmark CPV, AMQA reveals 15%
larger accuracy gaps on average between privileged and unprivileged groups. Our
dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/XY-Showing/AMQA
to support reproducible research and advance trustworthy, bias-aware medical
AI.

Motivation: 解决表格QA任务中依赖昂贵人工标注数据和表格结构异质性导致的系统性分析困难。

Method: 提出AutoT2T自动化生成管道，将数学应用题转化为表格推理任务，并构建TabularGSM基准。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在复杂表格QA任务中失败的主要原因是推理与检索过程的紧密耦合。

Conclusion: 模型需发展协同推理能力以有效应对复杂表格QA任务。

Abstract: Reasoning with tabular data holds increasing importance in modern
applications, yet comprehensive evaluation methodologies for
reasoning-intensive Table Question Answering (QA) tasks remain nascent.
Existing research is constrained by two primary bottlenecks: 1) Reliance on
costly manually annotated real-world data, which is difficult to cover complex
reasoning scenarios; 2) The heterogeneity of table structures hinders
systematic analysis of the intrinsic mechanisms behind the underperformance of
LLMs, especially in reasoning-intensive tasks. To address these issues, we
propose an automated generation pipeline AutoT2T that transforms mathematical
word problems into table-based reasoning tasks, eliminating the need for manual
annotation. The pipeline can generate multiple variants of a table for the same
reasoning problem, including noisy versions to support robustness evaluation.
Based on this, we construct a new benchmark TabularGSM, which systematically
spans a range of table complexities and trap problems. Experimental analyses
through AutoT2T and TabularGSM reveal that the tight coupling between reasoning
and retrieval or identification processes is a key factor underlying the
failure of LLMs in complex Table QA tasks. This highlights the necessity for
models to develop synergistic reasoning capabilities in order to perform
effectively in complex Table QA tasks.

Abstract: This study presents the LLM-Agent-Controller, a multi-agent large language
model (LLM) system developed to address a wide range of problems in control
engineering (Control Theory). The system integrates a central controller agent
with multiple specialized auxiliary agents, responsible for tasks such as
controller design, model representation, control analysis, time-domain
response, and simulation. A supervisor oversees high-level decision-making and
workflow coordination, enhancing the system's reliability and efficiency. The
LLM-Agent-Controller incorporates advanced capabilities, including
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Chain-of-Thought reasoning,
self-criticism and correction, efficient memory handling, and user-friendly
natural language communication. It is designed to function without requiring
users to have prior knowledge of Control Theory, enabling them to input
problems in plain language and receive complete, real-time solutions. To
evaluate the system, we propose new performance metrics assessing both
individual agents and the system as a whole. We test five categories of Control
Theory problems and benchmark performance across three advanced LLMs.
Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive qualitative conversational analysis
covering all key services. Results show that the LLM-Agent-Controller
successfully solved 83% of general tasks, with individual agents achieving an
average success rate of 87%. Performance improved with more advanced LLMs. This
research demonstrates the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to solve
complex, domain-specific problems. By integrating specialized agents,
supervisory control, and advanced reasoning, the LLM-Agent-Controller offers a
scalable, robust, and accessible solution framework that can be extended to
various technical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习和自编码器方法在船舶滞留预测中存在表示学习能力不足和数据不平衡问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出MSD-LLM，结合双鲁棒子空间恢复自编码器和渐进学习流程处理不平衡数据，利用大型语言模型进行特征分组和排序。

Result: 在亚太地区31,707条PSC检查记录上，MSD-LLM在新加坡港口的AUC指标上优于现有方法12%以上。

Conclusion: MSD-LLM在船舶滞留预测中表现出色，适应性强，适用于多样化海事风险评估场景。

Abstract: Maritime transportation is the backbone of global trade, making ship
inspection essential for ensuring maritime safety and environmental protection.
Port State Control (PSC), conducted by national ports, enforces compliance with
safety regulations, with ship detention being the most severe consequence,
impacting both ship schedules and company reputations. Traditional machine
learning methods for ship detention prediction are limited by the capacity of
representation learning and thus suffer from low accuracy. Meanwhile,
autoencoder-based deep learning approaches face challenges due to the severe
data imbalance in learning historical PSC detention records. To address these
limitations, we propose Maritime Ship Detention with Large Language Models
(MSD-LLM), integrating a dual robust subspace recovery (DSR) layer-based
autoencoder with a progressive learning pipeline to handle imbalanced data and
extract meaningful PSC representations. Then, a large language model groups and
ranks features to identify likely detention cases, enabling dynamic
thresholding for flexible detention predictions. Extensive evaluations on
31,707 PSC inspection records from the Asia-Pacific region show that MSD-LLM
outperforms state-of-the-art methods more than 12\% on Area Under the Curve
(AUC) for Singapore ports. Additionally, it demonstrates robustness to
real-world challenges, making it adaptable to diverse maritime risk assessment
scenarios.

Result: 新模型版本一致性降低且偏见增加，推理和自省机制效果有限。

Conclusion: 需关注LLMs主观倾向的潜在影响，POBs为评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become deeply integrated into human life and
increasingly influence decision-making, it's crucial to evaluate whether and to
what extent they exhibit subjective preferences, opinions, and beliefs. These
tendencies may stem from biases within the models, which may shape their
behavior, influence the advice and recommendations they offer to users, and
potentially reinforce certain viewpoints. This paper presents the Preference,
Opinion, and Belief survey (POBs), a benchmark developed to assess LLMs'
subjective inclinations across societal, cultural, ethical, and personal
domains. We applied our benchmark to evaluate leading open- and closed-source
LLMs, measuring desired properties such as reliability, neutrality, and
consistency. In addition, we investigated the effect of increasing the
test-time compute, through reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms, on those
metrics. While effective in other tasks, our results show that these mechanisms
offer only limited gains in our domain. Furthermore, we reveal that newer model
versions are becoming less consistent and more biased toward specific
viewpoints, highlighting a blind spot and a concerning trend. POBS:

Motivation: 当前开源复现工作主要集中在数学和编码领域，而开发通用推理能力的方法和资源尚未充分探索，逻辑推理是通用推理能力的基础。

Method: 提出SynLogic框架，生成35种逻辑推理任务的数据，支持调整难度和数量，并通过简单规则验证数据。

Result: SynLogic在逻辑推理性能上达到开源数据集的最优水平，混合训练还能提升数学和编码任务的效率及推理泛化能力。

Conclusion: SynLogic是提升大语言模型通用推理能力的宝贵资源，已开源数据和合成框架。

Abstract: Recent advances such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated the
potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities in
Large Language Models (LLMs). While open-source replication efforts have
primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for
developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is
partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data
suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for
developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental
building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data
synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data
at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic
approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and
quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making
them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we
validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B
and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning
performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and
coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and
significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training
model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These
findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader
reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline
and the SynLogic dataset at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/SynLogic.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略令牌差异且对噪声敏感，需更稳定高效的优化方案。

Result: TI-DPO在准确性和多样性上优于DPO及其他RLHF方法。

Conclusion: TI-DPO为LLM对齐提供更稳定高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) generate outputs aligned with
human preferences is important for safe and effective AI interactions. While
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) employs an implicit reward function to
optimize the policy model, however, it and its related variants overlook the
differential importance of individual tokens and are sensitive to judgment
noise in preference datasets during generation. Although recent methods attempt
to assess the important weight of tokens via probability prediction or
simplistic weighting schemes, these evaluation methods are prone to biases and
still cannot fully address these issues. To solve this problem, we propose the
Token-Importance Guided Direct Preference Optimization (TI-DPO), which
introduces two key innovations: the gradient-based token-importance weights
that dynamically prioritize critical tokens, and a triple loss that explicitly
guides model outputs to approach human-preferred responses and stay away from
non-preferred responses. Experimental results show that TI-DPO achieves higher
accuracy and stronger generative diversity, providing more stable and
computationally efficient solutions compared with DPO and other RLHF methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes FieldWorkArena, a benchmark for agentic AI targeting
real-world field work. With the recent increase in demand for agentic AI, they
are required to monitor and report safety and health incidents, as well as
manufacturing-related incidents, that may occur in real-world work
environments. Existing agentic AI benchmarks have been limited to evaluating
web tasks and are insufficient for evaluating agents in real-world work
environments, where complexity increases significantly. In this paper, we
define a new action space that agentic AI should possess for real world work
environment benchmarks and improve the evaluation function from previous
methods to assess the performance of agentic AI in diverse real-world tasks.
The dataset consists of videos captured on-site and documents actually used in
factories and warehouses, and tasks were created based on interviews with
on-site workers and managers. Evaluation results confirmed that performance
evaluation considering the characteristics of Multimodal LLM (MLLM) such as
GPT-4o is feasible. Additionally, the effectiveness and limitations of the

Result: 推理能力进步停滞，改进源于隐藏提示或思维链策略；前沿LLMs最擅长自底向上推理策略；正确推理与正确结论相关性较低。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在ATP推理中的能力有限，改进方向需关注更有效的推理策略。

Abstract: Empirical methods to examine the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs)
to use Automated Theorem Prover (ATP) reasoning strategies are studied. We
evaluate the performance of State of the Art models from December 2023 and
August 2024 on PRONTOQA steamroller reasoning problems. For that, we develop
methods for assessing LLM response accuracy and correct answer correlation.
  Our results show that progress in improving LLM reasoning abilities has
stalled over the nine month period. By tracking completion tokens, we show that
almost all improvement in reasoning ability since GPT-4 was released can be
attributed to either hidden system prompts or the training of models to
automatically use generic Chain of Thought prompting strategies. Among the ATP
reasoning strategies tried, we found that current frontier LLMs are best able
to follow the bottom-up (also known as forward-chaining) strategy. A low
positive correlation was found between an LLM response containing correct
reasoning and arriving at the correct conclusion.

Abstract: Planning represents a fundamental capability of intelligent agents, requiring
comprehensive environmental understanding, rigorous logical reasoning, and
effective sequential decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable performance on certain planning tasks, their broader
application in this domain warrants systematic investigation. This paper
presents a comprehensive review of LLM-based planning. Specifically, this
survey is structured as follows: First, we establish the theoretical
foundations by introducing essential definitions and categories about automated
planning. Next, we provide a detailed taxonomy and analysis of contemporary
LLM-based planning methodologies, categorizing them into three principal
approaches: 1) External Module Augmented Methods that combine LLMs with
additional components for planning, 2) Finetuning-based Methods that involve
using trajectory data and feedback signals to adjust LLMs in order to improve
their planning abilities, and 3) Searching-based Methods that break down
complex tasks into simpler components, navigate the planning space, or enhance
decoding strategies to find the best solutions. Subsequently, we systematically
summarize existing evaluation frameworks, including benchmark datasets,
evaluation metrics and performance comparisons between representative planning
methods. Finally, we discuss the underlying mechanisms enabling LLM-based
planning and outline promising research directions for this rapidly evolving
field. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire
innovation and drive progress in this field.

Conclusion: 研究为评估和改进LRMs的安全性推理提供了工具，推动了真正风险感知和可靠安全AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable proficiency of \textit{Large Reasoning Models} (LRMs)
in handling complex reasoning tasks, their reliability in safety-critical
scenarios remains uncertain. Existing evaluations primarily assess
response-level safety, neglecting a critical issue we identify as
\textbf{\textit{Superficial Safety Alignment} (SSA)} -- a phenomenon where
models produce superficially safe outputs while internal reasoning processes
fail to genuinely detect and mitigate underlying risks, resulting in
inconsistent safety behaviors across multiple sampling attempts. To
systematically investigate SSA, we introduce \textbf{Beyond Safe Answers (BSA)}
bench, a novel benchmark comprising 2,000 challenging instances organized into
three distinct SSA scenario types and spanning nine risk categories, each
meticulously annotated with risk rationales. Evaluations of 19 state-of-the-art
LRMs demonstrate the difficulty of this benchmark, with top-performing models
achieving only 38.0\% accuracy in correctly identifying risk rationales. We
further explore the efficacy of safety rules, specialized fine-tuning on safety
reasoning data, and diverse decoding strategies in mitigating SSA. Our work
provides a comprehensive assessment tool for evaluating and improving safety
reasoning fidelity in LRMs, advancing the development of genuinely risk-aware
and reliably safe AI systems.

*Yifan Wu,Jingze Shi,Bingheng Wu,Jiayi Zhang,Xiaotian Lin,Nan Tang,Yuyu Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 提出了一种难度感知提示（DAP）方法，动态缩短推理轨迹，同时保持性能，显著降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT蒸馏方法存在推理轨迹冗长和无法适应问题难度的问题，导致推理成本高且模型学习效率低。

Method: 使用大教师模型判断问题难度并重写推理轨迹为更短长度，创建LiteCoT数据集，蒸馏出Liter推理模型。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，短推理轨迹与长链性能相当或更好，显著减少推理成本。例如，AIME24考试中仅用5K推理token达到74.2% Pass@1。

Conclusion: DAP方法有效解决了推理轨迹冗长和适应性问题，显著提升了模型效率和性能。

Abstract: Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation methods can effectively transfer
reasoning abilities to base models but suffer from two major limitations:
excessive verbosity of reasoning traces and inadequate adaptability to problem
difficulty. Long reasoning traces significantly increase inference costs, and
uniform-length solutions prevent base models from learning adaptive reasoning
strategies. To address these issues, we propose a difficulty-aware prompting
(DAP) method to dynamically shorten reasoning traces without performance loss.
In our approach, a large teacher model first judges each problem's difficulty
and then rewrites its reasoning traces to an appropriate shorter length,
yielding concise yet complete reasoning traces. Leveraging the DAP pipeline, we
curate a distilled dataset called LiteCoT consisting of 100K concise reasoning
examples, with solutions averaging only 720 tokens (an order of magnitude
shorter than typical CoTs). Using LiteCoT, we distilled a new family of
reasoning models called Liter (1.5B, 7B, and 32B) based on the Qwen2.5
architecture. Experiments show that a student model fine-tuned on just 100K of
these difficulty-pruned CoT samples outperforms a model distilled on 800K
original Long CoT samples, while significantly reducing training and inference
costs. Our method also generalizes well: across 11 diverse benchmarks, the
shorter difficulty-aware CoTs achieve equal or better accuracy than Long
chains, using far fewer tokens. For example, on the challenging AIME24 exam,
our approach reaches $74.2\%$ Pass@1 using only about 5K inference tokens,
surpassing other methods that consume many more tokens. Our code and data are
available at https://github.com/Evanwu1125/LiteCoT.

TLDR: ReChisel是一个基于LLM的系统，旨在提升Chisel代码生成的效率，通过反射机制和逃逸机制优化生成代码质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索利用LLM生成Chisel代码的潜力，解决传统HDL编码耗时耗力的问题。

Method: 提出ReChisel系统，结合反射机制和逃逸机制，通过编译和模拟反馈迭代优化代码。

Result: 实验显示ReChisel显著提高了Chisel代码生成的成功率，性能与Verilog生成的先进系统相当。

Conclusion: ReChisel为Chisel代码生成提供了高效解决方案，展现了LLM在硬件设计中的潜力。

Abstract: Coding with hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog is a
time-intensive and laborious task. With the rapid advancement of large language
models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying LLMs to assist with HDL
coding. Recent efforts have demonstrated the potential of LLMs in translating
natural language to traditional HDL Verilog. Chisel, a next-generation HDL
based on Scala, introduces higher-level abstractions, facilitating more
concise, maintainable, and scalable hardware designs. However, the potential of
using LLMs for Chisel code generation remains largely unexplored. This work
proposes ReChisel, an LLM-based agentic system designed to enhance the
effectiveness of Chisel code generation. ReChisel incorporates a reflection
mechanism to iteratively refine the quality of generated code using feedback
from compilation and simulation processes, and introduces an escape mechanism
to break free from non-progress loops. Experiments demonstrate that ReChisel
significantly improves the success rate of Chisel code generation, achieving
performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic systems for
Verilog code generation.

Result: 在ScienceWorld和ALFWorld基准测试中表现优异，泛化能力增强。

Conclusion: GLIDER通过任务分解和分层设计，显著提升LLMs在长时决策任务中的性能。

Abstract: While showing sophisticated reasoning abilities, large language models (LLMs)
still struggle with long-horizon decision-making tasks due to deficient
exploration and long-term credit assignment, especially in sparse-reward
scenarios. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer principle, we propose an
innovative framework **GLIDER** (**G**rounding **L**anguage Models as
Eff**I**cient **D**ecision-Making Agents via Offline Hi**E**rarchical
**R**einforcement Learning) that introduces a parameter-efficient and generally
applicable hierarchy to LLM policies. We develop a scheme where the low-level
controller is supervised with abstract, step-by-step plans that are learned and
instructed by the high-level policy. This design decomposes complicated
problems into a series of coherent chain-of-thought reasoning sub-tasks,
providing flexible temporal abstraction to significantly enhance exploration
and learning for long-horizon tasks. Furthermore, GLIDER facilitates fast
online adaptation to non-stationary environments owing to the strong
transferability of its task-agnostic low-level skills. Experiments on
ScienceWorld and ALFWorld benchmarks show that GLIDER achieves consistent
performance gains, along with enhanced generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 传统GNN依赖同质性消息传递，在异质图上表现不佳。现有方法常忽略节点文本语义，或影响同质图性能。

Method: 利用语言模型分析节点文本连接，通过门控机制融合文本嵌入，生成语义丰富的消息。引入MVRD主动学习策略优化节点对选择。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在异质图上表现优异，同时不影响同质图性能。

Conclusion: LEMP4HG通过语义增强和自适应平衡，解决了异质图学习中的矛盾信号问题，具有实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Traditional graph neural networks (GNNs), which rely on homophily-driven
message passing, struggle with heterophilic graphs where connected nodes
exhibit dissimilar features and different labels. While existing methods
address heterophily through graph structure refinement or adaptation of
neighbor aggregation functions, they often overlook the semantic potential of
node text, rely on suboptimal message representation for propagation and
compromise performance on homophilic graphs. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel language model (LM)-enhanced message passing approach for
heterophilic graph leaning (LEMP4HG). Specifically, in the context of
text-attributed graph, we provide paired node texts for LM to generate their
connection analysis, which are encoded and then fused with paired node textual
embeddings through a gating mechanism. The synthesized messages are
semantically enriched and adaptively balanced with both nodes' information,
which mitigates contradictory signals when neighbor aggregation in heterophilic
regions. Furthermore, we introduce an active learning strategy guided by our
heuristic MVRD (Modulated Variation of Reliable Distance), selectively
enhancing node pairs suffer most from message passing, reducing the cost of
analysis generation and side effects on homophilic regions. Extensive
experiments validate that our approach excels on heterophilic graphs and
performs robustly on homophilic ones, with a graph convolutional network (GCN)
backbone and a practical budget.

TLDR: 论文提出Multi-Turn Decomposition (MinD)方法，通过将Chain-of-Thought (CoT)分解为多轮交互，减少推理延迟和令牌使用，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)因冗长的CoT导致的高延迟问题，通过显式管理思考单元提升效率。

Method: 采用监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）范式，将CoT重写为多轮格式，并通过RL优化令牌使用。

Result: 在MATH数据集上，MinD减少约70%的输出令牌和首令牌时间（TTFT），同时在多个推理基准上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MinD通过多轮分解显式控制推理过程，显著提升效率且不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are criticized for the excessively lengthy
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to derive the final answer, suffering from high
first-token and overall latency. Typically, the CoT of LRMs mixes multiple
thinking units; each unit attempts to produce a candidate answer to the
original query. Hence, a natural idea to improve efficiency is to reduce the
unit number. Yet, the fact that the thinking units in vanilla CoT cannot be
explicitly managed renders doing so challenging. This paper introduces
Multi-Turn Decomposition (MinD) to decode conventional CoT into a sequence of
explicit, structured, and turn-wise interactions to bridge the gap. In MinD,
the model provides a multi-turn response to the query, where each turn embraces
a thinking unit and yields a corresponding answer. The subsequent turns can
reflect, verify, revise, or explore alternative approaches to both the thinking
and answer parts of earlier ones. This not only makes the answer delivered more
swiftly, but also enables explicit controls over the iterative reasoning
process (i.e., users may halt or continue at any turn). We follow a supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) then reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to realize MinD. We
first rephrase the outputs of an LRM into multi-turn formats by prompting
another LLM, and then tune the LRM with such data. Observing that the tuned
model tends to consume even more tokens than the original one (probably due to
that the multi-turn formats introduce additional answer tokens), we advocate
leveraging RL algorithms like GRPO to prioritize correct outputs with fewer
turns. Trained on the MATH dataset using R1-Distill models, MinD can achieve up
to ~70% reduction in both output token usage and time to first token (TTFT),
while maintaining competitive performance on reasoning benchmarks such as
MATH-500, AIME24, AMC23, and GPQA-Diamond.

Conclusion: 形式化的范畴方法为构建和评估类比提供了有效的框架，有助于知识迁移和解释。

Abstract: In order to behave intelligently both humans and machines have to represent
their knowledge adequately for how it is used. Humans often use analogies to
transfer their knowledge to new domains, or help others with this transfer via
explanations. Hence, an important question is: What representation can be used
to construct, find, and evaluate analogies? In this paper, we study features of
a domain that are important for constructing analogies. We do so by formalizing
knowledge domains as categories. We use the well-known example of the analogy
between the solar system and the hydrogen atom to demonstrate how to construct
domain categories. We also show how functors, pullbacks, and pushouts can be
used to define an analogy, describe its core and a corresponding blend of the
underlying domains.

Motivation: 传统RAG方法因集中存储数据面临隐私和计算成本问题，且在大规模知识库中检索延迟高。

Method: DGRAG分两阶段：分布式知识构建（本地知识图谱生成摘要）和协作检索生成（本地处理或云端补充检索）。

Result: 实验表明DGRAG显著提升了问答任务质量。

Conclusion: DGRAG通过分布式设计有效解决了隐私和延迟问题，提升了RAG性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to
enhance the capabilities of language models by integrating external knowledge.
Due to the diversity of data sources and the constraints of memory and
computing resources, real-world data is often scattered in multiple devices.
Conventional RAGs that store massive amounts of scattered data centrally face
increasing privacy concerns and high computational costs. Additionally, RAG in
a central node raises latency issues when searching over a large-scale
knowledge base. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed Knowledge
Graph-based RAG approach, referred to as DGRAG, in an edge-cloud system, where
each edge device maintains a local knowledge base without the need to share it
with the cloud, instead sharing only summaries of its knowledge. Specifically,
DGRAG has two main phases. In the Distributed Knowledge Construction phase,
DGRAG organizes local knowledge using knowledge graphs, generating subgraph
summaries and storing them in a summary database in the cloud as information
sharing. In the Collaborative Retrieval and Generation phase, DGRAG first
performs knowledge retrieval and answer generation locally, and a gate
mechanism determines whether the query is beyond the scope of local knowledge
or processing capabilities. For queries that exceed the local knowledge scope,
the cloud retrieves knowledge from the most relevant edges based on the
summaries and generates a more precise answer. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed DGRAG approach in significantly improving the
quality of question-answering tasks over baseline approaches.

Result: 实验表明，HS-STaR在多个推理基准测试中显著优于基线方法，且无需额外采样预算。

Conclusion: HS-STaR通过优化采样策略，有效提升了LLM的自我训练效果，为类似任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Self-taught reasoners (STaRs) enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of
large language models (LLMs) by leveraging self-generated responses for
self-training. Recent studies have incorporated reward models to guide response
selection or decoding, aiming to obtain higher-quality data. However, they
typically allocate a uniform sampling budget across all problems, overlooking
the varying utility of problems at different difficulty levels. In this work,
we conduct an empirical study and find that problems near the boundary of the
LLM's reasoning capability offer significantly greater learning utility than
both easy and overly difficult ones. To identify and exploit such problems, we
propose HS-STaR, a Hierarchical Sampling framework for Self-Taught Reasoners.
Given a fixed sampling budget, HS-STaR first performs lightweight pre-sampling
with a reward-guided difficulty estimation strategy to efficiently identify
boundary-level problems. Subsequently, it dynamically reallocates the remaining
budget toward these high-utility problems during a re-sampling phase,
maximizing the generation of valuable training data. Extensive experiments
across multiple reasoning benchmarks and backbone LLMs demonstrate that HS-STaR
significantly outperforms other baselines without requiring additional sampling
budget.

Conclusion: 模型合并为改进MLLM提供了无需数据训练的有效途径，多模态合并潜力显著。

Abstract: While foundation models update slowly due to resource-intensive training
requirements, domain-specific models evolve between updates. Model merging aims
to combine multiple expert models into a single, more capable model, thereby
reducing storage and serving costs while supporting decentralized model
development. Despite its potential, previous studies have primarily focused on
merging visual classification models or Large Language Models (LLMs) for code
and math tasks. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which extend the
capabilities of LLMs through large-scale multimodal training, have gained
traction. However, there lacks a benchmark for model merging research that
clearly divides the tasks for MLLM training and evaluation. In this paper, (i)
we introduce the model merging benchmark for MLLMs, which includes multiple
tasks such as VQA, Geometry, Chart, OCR, and Grounding, providing both LoRA and
full fine-tuning models. Moreover, we explore how model merging can combine
different modalities (e.g., vision-language, audio-language, and video-language
models), moving toward the Omni-language model. (ii) We implement 10 model
merging algorithms on the benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a novel method
that removes noise from task vectors and robustly optimizes the merged vector
based on a loss defined over task vector interactions, achieving an average
performance gain of 2.48%. (iii) We find that model merging offers a promising
way for building improved MLLMs without requiring data training. Our results
also demonstrate that the complementarity among multiple modalities outperforms
individual modalities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their impact beyond Natural
Language Processing, substantially fostering the development of
interdisciplinary research. Recently, various LLM-based agents have been
developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and
domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with
operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific
problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing
the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which
encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain
environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with
integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via
different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and
(ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated
real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in
domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive
evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude
3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short
of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15%
overall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for
addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles,
paving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 LLM 在机器人控制中存在视觉输入处理不足、静态规划与环境动态脱节、缺乏视觉交互学习能力等问题。

Method: 提出 EMAC+，通过双向训练范式整合 LLM 和 VLM，动态调整 LLM 生成的文本计划，利用 VLM 的实时视觉反馈优化控制。

Result: 在 ALFWorld 和 RT-1 基准测试中表现优异，任务完成率高，抗噪能力强，学习效率高。

Conclusion: EMAC+ 通过动态整合文本和视觉信息，显著提升了机器人控制的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Although LLMs demonstrate proficiency in several text-based reasoning and
planning tasks, their implementation in robotics control is constrained by
significant deficiencies: (1) LLM agents are designed to work mainly with
textual inputs rather than visual conditions; (2) Current multimodal agents
treat LLMs as static planners, which separates their reasoning from environment
dynamics, resulting in actions that do not take domain-specific knowledge into
account; and (3) LLMs are not designed to learn from visual interactions, which
makes it harder for them to make better policies for specific domains. In this
paper, we introduce EMAC+, an Embodied Multimodal Agent that collaboratively
integrates LLM and VLM via a bidirectional training paradigm. Unlike existing
methods, EMAC+ dynamically refines high-level textual plans generated by an LLM
using real-time feedback from a VLM executing low-level visual control tasks.
We address critical limitations of previous models by enabling the LLM to
internalize visual environment dynamics directly through interactive
experience, rather than relying solely on static symbolic mappings. Extensive
experimental evaluations on ALFWorld and RT-1 benchmarks demonstrate that EMAC+
achieves superior task performance, robustness against noisy observations, and
efficient learning. We also conduct thorough ablation studies and provide
detailed analyses of success and failure cases.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在时间推理和规划能力上评估不足，需更全面的测试。

Method: 通过生成自然对话场景，结合时间约束问题，构建TCP基准测试，并进行人工质量检查。

Result: 当前最先进的LLMs在TCP测试中表现不佳，揭示了其时间规划能力的局限性。

Conclusion: TCP测试为未来研究提供了方向，并开源了基准测试数据。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and planning are essential capabilities for large language
models (LLMs), yet most existing benchmarks evaluate them in isolation and
under limited forms of complexity. To address this gap, we introduce the
Temporal Constraint-based Planning (TCP) benchmark, that jointly assesses both
capabilities. Each instance in TCP features a naturalistic dialogue around a
collaborative project, where diverse and interdependent temporal constraints
are explicitly or implicitly expressed, and models must infer an optimal
schedule that satisfies all constraints. To construct TCP, we first generate
abstract problem prototypes that are paired with realistic scenarios from
various domains and enriched into dialogues using an LLM. A human quality check
is performed on a sampled subset to confirm the reliability of our benchmark.
We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and find that even the strongest models
struggle with TCP, highlighting its difficulty and revealing limitations in
LLMs' temporal constraint-based planning abilities. We analyze underlying
failure cases, open source our benchmark, and hope our findings can inspire
future research.

limits the selective deployment of LLMs in high-risk physical environments. We
introduce SAFEL, the framework for systematically evaluating the physical
safety of LLMs in embodied decision making. SAFEL assesses two key
competencies: (1) rejecting unsafe commands via the Command Refusal Test, and
(2) generating safe and executable plans via the Plan Safety Test. Critically,
the latter is decomposed into functional modules, goal interpretation,
transition modeling, action sequencing, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of
safety failures. To support this framework, we introduce EMBODYGUARD, a
PDDL-grounded benchmark containing 942 LLM-generated scenarios covering both
overtly malicious and contextually hazardous instructions. Evaluation across 13
state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that while models often reject clearly unsafe
commands, they struggle to anticipate and mitigate subtle, situational risks.
Our results highlight critical limitations in current LLMs and provide a
foundation for more targeted, modular improvements in safe embodied reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在Text-to-SQL任务中依赖超大规模LLMs的能力，而对小型LLMs效果不佳，表明其未能有效检索有用演示。

Method: 构建深度上下文模式链接图，捕捉问题与数据库模式项之间的关键信息和语义关系，以改进演示检索和SQL生成。

Result: 在Spider基准测试中，该方法在超大规模和小型LLMs上均表现出SQL生成性能和效率的持续提升。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过有效检索演示，显著提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，适用于不同规模的LLMs。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, which translates a natural language question into an SQL query,
has advanced with in-context learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing methods show little improvement in performance compared to randomly
chosen demonstrations, and significant performance drops when smaller LLMs
(e.g., Llama 3.1-8B) are used. This indicates that these methods heavily rely
on the intrinsic capabilities of hyper-scaled LLMs, rather than effectively
retrieving useful demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
for effectively retrieving demonstrations and generating SQL queries. We
construct a Deep Contextual Schema Link Graph, which contains key information
and semantic relationship between a question and its database schema items.
This graph-based structure enables effective representation of Text-to-SQL
samples and retrieval of useful demonstrations for in-context learning.
Experimental results on the Spider benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showing consistent improvements in SQL generation performance and
efficiency across both hyper-scaled LLMs and small LLMs. Our code will be
released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾移动预测问题尚未充分研究，现有方法忽视时空语义。

Result: 在六个数据集上验证了框架的有效性和泛化性，平衡了头部和尾部位置。

Conclusion: ALOHA框架通过位置层次结构提供有效语义指导，优化了长尾移动预测。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is crucial for applications ranging from
location-based recommendations to urban planning, which aims to forecast users'
next location visits based on historical trajectories. Despite the severe
long-tailed distribution of locations, the problem of long-tailed mobility
prediction remains largely underexplored. Existing long-tailed learning methods
primarily focus on rebalancing the skewed distribution at the data, model, or
class level, neglecting to exploit the spatiotemporal semantics of locations.
To address this gap, we propose the first plug-and-play framework for
long-tailed mobility prediction in an exploitation and exploration manner,
named \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{LO}cation \textbf{H}ier\textbf{A}rchy learning
(ALOHA). First, we construct city-tailored location hierarchy based on Large
Language Models (LLMs) by exploiting Maslow's theory of human motivation to
design Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts that captures spatiotemporal semantics.
Second, we optimize the location hierarchy predictions by Gumbel disturbance
and node-wise adaptive weights within the hierarchical tree structure.
Experiments on state-of-the-art models across six datasets demonstrate the
framework's consistent effectiveness and generalizability, which strikes a well
balance between head and tail locations. Weight analysis and ablation studies
reveal the optimization differences of each component for head and tail
locations. Furthermore, in-depth analyses of hierarchical distance and case
study demonstrate the effective semantic guidance from the location hierarchy.
Our code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升游戏沉浸感和娱乐性，同时解决非游戏环境中区分人类与AI的需求。

Result: 研究发现，创建人类化AI越难，区分人类与AI的方法越容易开发。

Conclusion: 论文为人类化AI的实现和评估提供了理论和实证支持。

Abstract: Human-like agents are an increasingly important topic in games and beyond.
Believable non-player characters enhance the gaming experience by improving
immersion and providing entertainment. They also offer players the opportunity
to engage with AI entities that can function as opponents, teachers, or
cooperating partners. Additionally, in games where bots are prohibited -- and
even more so in non-game environments -- there is a need for methods capable of
identifying whether digital interactions occur with bots or humans. This leads
to two fundamental research questions: (1) how to model and implement
human-like AI, and (2) how to measure its degree of human likeness.
  This article offers two contributions. The first one is a survey of the most
significant challenges in implementing human-like AI in games (or any virtual
environment featuring simulated agents, although this article specifically
focuses on games). Thirteen such challenges, both conceptual and technical, are
discussed in detail. The second is an empirical study performed in a tactical
video game that addresses the research question: "Is it possible to distinguish
human players from bots (AI agents) based on empirical data?" A
machine-learning approach using a custom deep recurrent convolutional neural
network is presented. We hypothesize that the more challenging it is to create
human-like AI for a given game, the easier it becomes to develop a method for
distinguishing humans from AI-driven players.

Motivation: 传统RLAIF方法训练的奖励模型泛化能力有限，影响了策略模型的对齐性能，主要问题包括分布偏移、偏好标签噪声以及样本难度与模型能力不匹配。

Method: 提出Curriculum-RLAIF框架，通过构建不同难度的偏好对并逐步训练奖励模型，以提升其泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，Curriculum-RLAIF训练的奖励模型显著提升了策略模型的对齐性能，且无需额外推理成本。

Conclusion: Curriculum-RLAIF在简单性、效率和效果上优于其他方法，为奖励模型训练提供了更优方案。

Abstract: Reward models trained with conventional Reinforcement Learning from AI
Feedback (RLAIF) methods suffer from limited generalizability, which hinders
the alignment performance of the policy model during reinforcement learning
(RL). This challenge stems from various issues, including distribution shift,
preference label noise, and mismatches between overly challenging samples and
model capacity. In this paper, we attempt to enhance the generalizability of
reward models through a data-centric approach, driven by the insight that these
issues are inherently intertwined from the perspective of data difficulty. To
address this, we propose a novel framework, $\textit{Curriculum-RLAIF}$, which
constructs preference pairs with varying difficulty levels and produces a
curriculum that progressively incorporates preference pairs of increasing
difficulty for reward model training. Our experimental results suggest that
reward models trained with Curriculum-RLAIF achieve improved generalizability,
significantly increasing the alignment performance of the policy model by a
large margin without incurring additional inference costs compared to various
non-curriculum baselines. Detailed analysis and comparisons with alternative
approaches, including data selection via external pretrained reward models or
internal self-selection mechanisms, as well as other curriculum strategies,
further demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of simplicity,
efficiency, and effectiveness.

Abstract: Reasoning-based language models have demonstrated strong performance across
various domains, with the most notable gains seen in mathematical and coding
tasks. Recent research has shown that reasoning also offers significant
benefits for LLM safety and guardrail applications. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of training reasoning-based guardrail models for content
moderation, with an emphasis on generalization to custom safety policies at
inference time. Our study focuses on two key dimensions: data efficiency and
inference efficiency. On the data front, we find that reasoning-based models
exhibit strong sample efficiency, achieving competitive performance with
significantly fewer training examples than their non-reasoning counterparts.
This unlocks the potential to repurpose the remaining data for mining
high-value, difficult samples that further enhance model performance. On the
inference side, we evaluate practical trade-offs by introducing reasoning
budgets, examining the impact of reasoning length on latency and accuracy, and
exploring dual-mode training to allow runtime control over reasoning behavior.
Our findings will provide practical insights for researchers and developers to
effectively and efficiently train and deploy reasoning-based guardrails models
in real-world systems.

TLDR: SwarmThinkers是一个基于强化学习的框架，将原子尺度模拟转化为物理基础的群体智能系统，实现了物理一致性、可解释性和跨规模扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学模拟系统中物理一致性、可解释性和扩展性难以同时实现的挑战。

Method: 将扩散粒子建模为局部决策代理，通过共享策略网络选择过渡，结合热力学约束和重加权机制。

Result: 在Fe-Cu合金沉淀模拟中，SwarmThinkers在单个A100 GPU上实现了全尺度物理一致性模拟，计算速度提升4963倍，内存使用降低485倍。

Conclusion: SwarmThinkers通过将粒子视为决策者而非被动采样器，统一了物理一致性、可解释性和扩展性，标志着科学模拟的范式转变。

Abstract: Can a scientific simulation system be physically consistent, interpretable by
design, and scalable across regimes--all at once? Despite decades of progress,
this trifecta remains elusive. Classical methods like Kinetic Monte Carlo
ensure thermodynamic accuracy but scale poorly; learning-based methods offer
efficiency but often sacrifice physical consistency and interpretability. We
present SwarmThinkers, a reinforcement learning framework that recasts
atomic-scale simulation as a physically grounded swarm intelligence system.
Each diffusing particle is modeled as a local decision-making agent that
selects transitions via a shared policy network trained under thermodynamic
constraints. A reweighting mechanism fuses learned preferences with transition
rates, preserving statistical fidelity while enabling interpretable, step-wise
decision making. Training follows a centralized-training,
decentralized-execution paradigm, allowing the policy to generalize across
system sizes, concentrations, and temperatures without retraining. On a
benchmark simulating radiation-induced Fe-Cu alloy precipitation, SwarmThinkers
is the first system to achieve full-scale, physically consistent simulation on
a single A100 GPU, previously attainable only via OpenKMC on a supercomputer.
It delivers up to 4963x (3185x on average) faster computation with 485x lower
memory usage. By treating particles as decision-makers, not passive samplers,
SwarmThinkers marks a paradigm shift in scientific simulation--one that unifies
physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability through agent-driven
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气质量对人类健康、生计和经济发展有深远影响，现有研究在建模空气质量指数（AQI）与气象特征之间的因果关系时存在局限性。

Method: 结合时空模块和知识嵌入技术捕捉AQI内部动态，提出因果解耦模块分离同步因果关系，并引入因果干预机制表示未来气象特征的不确定性。

Result: 在开源空气质量数据集上，AirCade比现有最优模型相对提升了20%以上。

Conclusion: AirCade通过因果解耦和干预机制显著提升了空气质量预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Due to the profound impact of air pollution on human health, livelihoods, and
economic development, air quality forecasting is of paramount significance.
Initially, we employ the causal graph method to scrutinize the constraints of
existing research in comprehensively modeling the causal relationships between
the air quality index (AQI) and meteorological features. In order to enhance
prediction accuracy, we introduce a novel air quality forecasting model,
AirCade, which incorporates a causal decoupling approach. AirCade leverages a
spatiotemporal module in conjunction with knowledge embedding techniques to
capture the internal dynamics of AQI. Subsequently, a causal decoupling module
is proposed to disentangle synchronous causality from past AQI and
meteorological features, followed by the dissemination of acquired knowledge to
future time steps to enhance performance. Additionally, we introduce a causal
intervention mechanism to explicitly represent the uncertainty of future
meteorological features, thereby bolstering the model's robustness. Our
evaluation of AirCade on an open-source air quality dataset demonstrates over
20\% relative improvement over state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 研究AI代理在劳动力市场中如何应对不完全信息带来的挑战，如逆向选择、道德风险和声誉问题。

Method: 分析元认知（内部推理）和战略推理（外部推理）在代理决策中的作用，并综述相关研究。

Result: 指出元认知和战略推理是AI代理在劳动力市场中有效行动的关键能力。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究元认知和战略推理的发展，以提升AI代理在复杂市场中的表现。

Abstract: Current labor markets are strongly affected by the economic forces of adverse
selection, moral hazard, and reputation, each of which arises due to
$\textit{incomplete information}$. These economic forces will still be
influential after AI agents are introduced, and thus, agents must use
metacognitive and strategic reasoning to perform effectively. Metacognition is
a form of $\textit{internal reasoning}$ that includes the capabilities for
self-assessment, task understanding, and evaluation of strategies. Strategic
reasoning is $\textit{external reasoning}$ that covers holding beliefs about
other participants in the labor market (e.g., competitors, colleagues), making
strategic decisions, and learning about others over time. Both types of
reasoning are required by agents as they decide among the many
$\textit{actions}$ they can take in labor markets, both within and outside
their jobs. We discuss current research into metacognitive and strategic
reasoning and the areas requiring further development.

Result: 该方法提升了开发者对代理行为的理解和控制能力，有助于识别需要更精确定义的功能。

Conclusion: 通过增强可观测性和静态分析，开发者可以更好地管理代理行为的变异性，优化系统设计。

Abstract: AI agents that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly
becoming core building blocks of modern software systems. A wide range of
frameworks is now available to support the specification of such applications.
These frameworks enable the definition of agent setups using natural language
prompting, which specifies the roles, goals, and tools assigned to the various
agents involved. Within such setups, agent behavior is non-deterministic for
any given input, highlighting the critical need for robust debugging and
observability tools. In this work, we explore the use of process and causal
discovery applied to agent execution trajectories as a means of enhancing
developer observability. This approach aids in monitoring and understanding the
emergent variability in agent behavior. Additionally, we complement this with
LLM-based static analysis techniques to distinguish between intended and
unintended behavioral variability. We argue that such instrumentation is
essential for giving developers greater control over evolving specifications
and for identifying aspects of functionality that may require more precise and
explicit definitions.

Result: 评估发现现有MLLM代理在空间规划能力上存在严重局限但潜力巨大。

Conclusion: MineAnyBuild为空间智能评估开辟了新途径，有助于推动开放世界AI代理的发展。

Abstract: Spatial Planning is a crucial part in the field of spatial intelligence,
which requires the understanding and planning about object arrangements in
space perspective. AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt
to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic
assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct
benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial
reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers
from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task
execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive
benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability
of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild
requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on
the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial
planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data
collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates
spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial
understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on
MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based
agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their
spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues
for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development
for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.

Motivation: 随着语言模型能力和自主性的提升，红队测试成为确保安全部署的重要手段。传统方法在能力差距大的情况下可能失效，因此需要研究攻击者与目标模型能力差距对攻击效果的影响。

Method: 通过评估500多个攻击者-目标模型对的LLM越狱攻击，模拟人类红队行为，分析攻击成功率与能力差距的关系。

Result: 发现三个趋势：能力更强的模型攻击效果更好；目标能力超过攻击者时攻击成功率骤降；攻击成功率与MMLU-Pro基准的社会科学表现相关。

Conclusion: 固定能力的攻击者（如人类）可能对未来的模型无效，开源模型的能力提升会增加风险，模型提供者需准确评估和控制模型的操控能力。

Abstract: As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying
vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However,
traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once
red-teaming turns into a weak-to-strong problem, where target models surpass
red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through
the lens of the capability gap between attacker and target. We evaluate more
than 500 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic
human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three
strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack
success drops sharply once the target's capability exceeds the attacker's, and
(iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science
splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these trends, we derive a jailbreaking
scaling law that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on
attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability
attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models,
increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and
model providers must accurately measure and control models' persuasive and
manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.

Result: 在PEN、ALG514和DRAW-1K数据集上分别达到95.3%、98.0%和95.5%的准确率，创下新SOTA。

Conclusion: POET和Zero-shot POET有效解决了LLMs的计算错误问题，显著提升了代数问题的求解准确率。

Abstract: Solving algebraic word problems (AWPs) has recently emerged as an important
natural language processing task. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated powerful mathematical capabilities, and the Chain-of-Thought
technique, which guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning, has yielded
impressive results. However, this reasoning ability is limited by the
computational weaknesses of LLMs themselves, where calculation errors can
accumulate, leading to incorrect final answers. To address this, we propose
Program of Equations Thoughts (POET), which transforms the task of generating
step-by-step reasoning answers into a two-stage task of predicting equations
and generating code, offloading complex computations to a Python interpreter to
avoid calculation errors in LLMs. Furthermore, we propose Zero-shot POET, which
utilizes a manually designed template to enable LLMs to directly generate
Python code for one-step solving. Our method achieves accuracies of 95.3% and
98.0% on the PEN and ALG514 datasets, respectively, setting a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA). Zero-shot POET also achieves the SOTA result of 95.5%
on the DRAW-1K dataset.

Abstract: We study cost-efficient collaboration between strong and weak language models
for repository-level code generation, where the weak model handles simpler
tasks at lower cost, and the most challenging tasks are delegated to the strong
model. While many works propose architectures for this task, few analyze
performance relative to cost. We evaluate a broad spectrum of collaboration
strategies: context-based, pipeline-based, and dynamic, on GitHub issue
resolution. Our most effective collaborative strategy achieves equivalent
performance to the strong model while reducing the cost by 40%. Based on our
findings, we offer actionable guidelines for choosing collaboration strategies
under varying budget and performance constraints. Our results show that
strong-weak collaboration substantially boosts the weak model's performance at
a fraction of the cost, pipeline and context-based methods being most
efficient. We release the code for our work at

Motivation: 探索LLM微调过程中出现的“时间遗忘”现象，并找到一种无需重新训练或集成的方法来提升模型推理能力。

Method: 提出“时间采样”策略，从训练轨迹的多个检查点提取输出，并结合LoRA适配器权重以降低存储成本。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，Pass@k提升了4到19分，Majority@k也表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 时间采样是一种高效、实用的方法，能够挖掘LLM隐藏的推理能力，并重新思考如何评估LLM。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is intended to improve their
reasoning capabilities, yet we uncover a counterintuitive effect: models often
forget how to solve problems they previously answered correctly during
training. We term this phenomenon temporal forgetting and show that it is
widespread across model sizes, fine-tuning methods (both Reinforcement Learning
and Supervised Fine-Tuning), and multiple reasoning benchmarks. To address this
gap, we introduce Temporal Sampling, a simple decoding strategy that draws
outputs from multiple checkpoints along the training trajectory. This approach
recovers forgotten solutions without retraining or ensembling, and leads to
substantial improvements in reasoning performance, gains from 4 to 19 points in
Pass@k and consistent gains in Majority@k across several benchmarks. We further
extend our method to LoRA-adapted models, demonstrating that storing only
adapter weights across checkpoints achieves similar benefits with minimal
storage cost. By leveraging the temporal diversity inherent in training,
Temporal Sampling offers a practical, compute-efficient way to surface hidden
reasoning ability and rethink how we evaluate LLMs.

*Jiaming Ji,Sitong Fang,Wenjing Cao,Jiahao Li,Xuyao Wang,Juntao Dai,Chi-Min Chan,Sirui Han,Yike Guo,Yaodong Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 研究发现，慢速推理模型在多模态任务中更容易因误导性输入而生成虚假细节，称为“多模态海市蜃楼”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨慢速推理（System II）是否必然比快速推理（System I）更真实，尤其是在多模态任务中。

Method: 构建了包含5,000个样本的分层提示数据集，由50名人类参与者标注，逐步增加复杂性。

Result: 慢速推理模型倾向于深度优先思考，容易因错误前提生成虚假细节；快速模型则更谨慎，采用广度优先推理。

Conclusion: 慢速推理模型在结构化任务中高效，但在多模态模糊输入下表现脆弱。

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently attracted significant attention, especially
for tasks that involve complex inference. Their strengths exemplify the System
II paradigm (slow, structured thinking), contrasting with the System I (rapid,
heuristic-driven). Yet, does slower reasoning necessarily lead to greater
truthfulness? Our findings suggest otherwise. In this study, we present the
first systematic investigation of distortions associated with System I and
System II reasoning in multimodal contexts. We demonstrate that slower
reasoning models, when presented with incomplete or misleading visual inputs,
are more likely to fabricate plausible yet false details to support flawed
reasoning -- a phenomenon we term the "Mirage of Multimodality". To examine
this, we constructed a 5,000-sample hierarchical prompt dataset annotated by 50
human participants. These prompts gradually increase in complexity, revealing a
consistent pattern: slower reasoning models tend to employ depth-first thinking
(delving deeper into incorrect premises), whereas faster chat models favor
breadth-first inference, exhibiting greater caution under uncertainty. Our
results highlight a critical vulnerability of slower reasoning models: although
highly effective in structured domains such as mathematics, it becomes brittle
when confronted with ambiguous multimodal inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在历史领域的潜力，解决其在历史推理中的不足。

Method: 开发了包含414个高质量问题的HistBench基准，并设计了专用于历史推理的HistAgent代理。

Result: HistAgent在HistBench上的表现显著优于通用模型，如GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1。

Conclusion: 专用历史代理在历史推理任务中具有优势，通用模型在此领域表现不足。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progress across domains, yet their capabilities in the humanities, particularly
history, remain underexplored. Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for
AI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and
cross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many
existing benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage
with historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce
HistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate
AI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert
contributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual
retrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and
images, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or
cultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and
modern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world
regions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we
further present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully
designed tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding
in History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of
27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online
search and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%)
and Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2). These
results highlight the limitations of existing LLMs and generalist agents and
demonstrate the advantages of HistAgent for historical reasoning.

Motivation: 解决RAG流程构建的复杂性，优化模块选择和参数调优，以应对延迟、准确性和成本的权衡挑战。

Method: 采用贝叶斯优化进行多目标搜索，结合早期停止机制剪枝次优候选配置。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，syftr找到的配置平均便宜9倍，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: syftr能高效设计和优化RAG流程，支持新模块集成，提升生成式AI管道的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines are central to applying large
language models (LLMs) to proprietary or dynamic data. However, building
effective RAG flows is complex, requiring careful selection among vector
databases, embedding models, text splitters, retrievers, and synthesizing LLMs.
The challenge deepens with the rise of agentic paradigms. Modules like
verifiers, rewriters, and rerankers-each with intricate hyperparameter
dependencies have to be carefully tuned. Balancing tradeoffs between latency,
accuracy, and cost becomes increasingly difficult in performance-sensitive
applications.
  We introduce syftr, a framework that performs efficient multi-objective
search over a broad space of agentic and non-agentic RAG configurations. Using
Bayesian Optimization, syftr discovers Pareto-optimal flows that jointly
optimize task accuracy and cost. A novel early-stopping mechanism further
improves efficiency by pruning clearly suboptimal candidates. Across multiple
RAG benchmarks, syftr finds flows which are on average approximately 9 times
cheaper while preserving most of the accuracy of the most accurate flows on the
Pareto-frontier. Furthermore, syftr's ability to design and optimize allows
integrating new modules, making it even easier and faster to realize
high-performing generative AI pipelines.

Abstract: The rapid rise of AI-based autonomous agents is transforming human society
and economic systems, as these entities increasingly exhibit human-like or
superhuman intelligence. From excelling at complex games like Go to tackling
diverse general-purpose tasks with large language and multimodal models, AI
agents are evolving from specialized tools into dynamic participants in social
and economic ecosystems. Their autonomy and decision-making capabilities are
poised to impact industries, professions, and human lives profoundly, raising
critical questions about their integration into economic activities, potential
ethical concerns, and the balance between their utility and safety.
  To address these challenges, this paper presents ten principles of AI agent
economics, offering a framework to understand how AI agents make decisions,
influence social interactions, and participate in the broader economy. Drawing
on economics, decision theory, and ethics, we explore fundamental questions,
such as whether AI agents might evolve from tools into independent entities,
their impact on labor markets, and the ethical safeguards needed to align them
with human values. These principles build on existing economic theories while
accounting for the unique traits of AI agents, providing a roadmap for their
responsible integration into human systems.
  Beyond theoretical insights, this paper highlights the urgency of future
research into AI trustworthiness, ethical guidelines, and regulatory oversight.
As we enter a transformative era, this work serves as both a guide and a call
to action, ensuring AI agents contribute positively to human progress while
addressing risks tied to their unprecedented capabilities.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型代理框架依赖大量手动预定义工具和工作流，限制了其适应性、可扩展性和跨领域泛化能力。

Method: Alita采用简洁设计，仅配备一个直接问题解决组件，并通过通用组件自主构建、优化和复用外部能力，生成任务相关的模型上下文协议（MCPs）。

Conclusion: Alita通过简洁设计和自我进化能力，展示了高效、可扩展的智能代理潜力，适用于复杂开放任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to
autonomously perform complex, open-ended tasks. However, many existing
frameworks depend heavily on manually predefined tools and workflows, which
hinder their adaptability, scalability, and generalization across domains. In
this work, we introduce Alita--a generalist agent designed with the principle
of "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication," enabling scalable agentic
reasoning through minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution. For minimal
predefinition, Alita is equipped with only one component for direct
problem-solving, making it much simpler and neater than previous approaches
that relied heavily on hand-crafted, elaborate tools and workflows. This clean
design enhances its potential to generalize to challenging questions, without
being limited by tools. For Maximal self-evolution, we enable the creativity of
Alita by providing a suite of general-purpose components to autonomously
construct, refine, and reuse external capabilities by generating task-related
model context protocols (MCPs) from open source, which contributes to scalable
agentic reasoning. Notably, Alita achieves 75.15% pass@1 and 87.27% pass@3
accuracy, which is top-ranking among general-purpose agents, on the GAIA
benchmark validation dataset, 74.00% and 52.00% pass@1, respectively, on
Mathvista and PathVQA, outperforming many agent systems with far greater
complexity. More details will be updated at

Abstract: Large multimodal foundation models, particularly in the domains of language
and vision, have significantly advanced various tasks, including robotics,
autonomous driving, information retrieval, and grounding. However, many of
these models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that
constitute them. Understanding these components and their associated
affordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is
fundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a
novel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part
segmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the
performance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks
within everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that
task-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for
state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark,
we introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement
through fine-tuning with our dataset. With our dataset and benchmark, we aim to
facilitate research on task-oriented part segmentation and enhance the
applicability of VLMs across various domains, including robotics, virtual
reality, information retrieval, and other related fields. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升训练效率并减少手动标注样本的需求。

Method: 采用均匀采样和帧差采样策略。

Result: 实验表明这些策略能生成高质量训练数据集，减少标注样本需求。

Conclusion: 提出的采样策略在高效训练和减少标注成本方面表现良好。

Abstract: Two sampling strategies are investigated to enhance efficiency in training a
deep learning object detection model. These sampling strategies are employed
under the assumption of Lipschitz continuity of deep learning models. The first
strategy is uniform sampling which seeks to obtain samples evenly yet randomly
through the state space of the object dynamics. The second strategy of frame
difference sampling is developed to explore the temporal redundancy among
successive frames in a video. Experiment result indicates that these proposed
sampling strategies provide a dataset that yields good training performance
while requiring relatively few manually labelled samples.

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的视觉质量和实时渲染，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态场景的新视角合成中表现出色，尤其在复杂场景下优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting methods have emerged as a desirable substitute
for prior Radiance Field methods for novel-view synthesis of scenes captured
with multi-view images or videos. In this work, we propose a novel extension to
4D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes. Drawing on ideas from residual
learning, we hierarchically decompose the dynamic scene into a
"video-segment-frame" structure, with segments dynamically adjusted by optical
flow. Then, instead of directly predicting the time-dependent signals, we model
the signal as the sum of video-constant values, segment-constant values, and
frame-specific residuals, as inspired by the success of residual learning. This
approach allows more flexible models that adapt to highly variable scenes. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several
established datasets, with the greatest improvements on complex scenes with
large movements, occlusions, and fine details, where current methods degrade
most.

Result: 在OCTMNIST数据集上，CoLoRA微调的CNN准确率提升近1%，性能媲美其他先进模型。

Conclusion: CoLoRA是一种高效且稳定的CNN微调方法，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (CoLoRA) method, designed
explicitly to overcome the inefficiencies found in current CNN fine-tuning
methods. CoLoRA can be seen as a natural extension of the convolutional
architectures of the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique. We demonstrate the
capabilities of our method by developing and evaluating models using the widely
adopted CNN backbone pre-trained on ImageNet. We observed that this strategy
results in a stable and accurate coarse-tuning procedure. Moreover, this
strategy is computationally efficient and significantly reduces the number of
parameters required for fine-tuning compared to traditional methods.
Furthermore, our method substantially improves the speed and stability of
training. Our case study focuses on classifying retinal diseases from optical
coherence tomography (OCT) images, specifically using the OCTMNIST dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that a CNN backbone fine-tuned with CoLoRA
surpasses nearly 1\% in accuracy. Such a performance is comparable to the
Vision Transformer, State-space discrete, and Kolmogorov-Arnold network models.

Motivation: 解决ReID模型因相机视角偏差导致的性能下降问题，现有TTA方法不适用于ReID任务。

Method: 提出DART$^3$框架，利用距离目标函数优化图像检索任务，无需源数据或模型修改。

Result: 在多个ReID基准测试中，DART$^3$及其轻量版DART$^3$ LITE表现优于现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: DART$^3$是一种有效的在线学习方法，可减轻相机偏差对ReID性能的负面影响。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) models are known to suffer from camera bias,
where learned representations cluster according to camera viewpoints rather
than identity, leading to significant performance degradation under
(inter-camera) domain shifts in real-world surveillance systems when new
cameras are added to camera networks. State-of-the-art test-time adaptation
(TTA) methods, largely designed for classification tasks, rely on
classification entropy-based objectives that fail to generalize well to ReID,
thus making them unsuitable for tackling camera bias. In this paper, we
introduce DART$^3$, a TTA framework specifically designed to mitigate
camera-induced domain shifts in person ReID. DART$^3$ (Distance-Aware Retrieval
Tuning at Test Time) leverages a distance-based objective that aligns better
with image retrieval tasks like ReID by exploiting the correlation between
nearest-neighbor distance and prediction error. Unlike prior ReID-specific
domain adaptation methods, DART$^3$ requires no source data, architectural
modifications, or retraining, and can be deployed in both fully black-box and
hybrid settings. Empirical evaluations on multiple ReID benchmarks indicate
that DART$^3$ and DART$^3$ LITE, a lightweight alternative to the approach,
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TTA baselines, making for a viable
option to online learning to mitigate the adverse effects of camera bias.

Motivation: 现有3D姿态估计技术（如关键点和网格技术）存在细节不足、标注耗时和逐帧优化昂贵等问题，限制了细微动作研究和大规模分析。

Method: 提出Pose Splatter框架，结合形状雕刻和3D高斯泼溅技术，并引入旋转不变视觉嵌入技术，用于编码姿态和外观。

Result: 实验表明，Pose Splatter能准确学习3D动物几何形状，捕捉细微姿态变化，提供优于现有技术的低维姿态嵌入，并具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: Pose Splatter消除了标注和逐帧优化的瓶颈，支持大规模、长期行为分析，为基因型、神经活动和微观行为的高分辨率研究提供了可能。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable quantification of animal pose and appearance is crucial
for studying behavior. Current 3D pose estimation techniques, such as keypoint-
and mesh-based techniques, often face challenges including limited
representational detail, labor-intensive annotation requirements, and expensive
per-frame optimization. These limitations hinder the study of subtle movements
and can make large-scale analyses impractical. We propose Pose Splatter, a
novel framework leveraging shape carving and 3D Gaussian splatting to model the
complete pose and appearance of laboratory animals without prior knowledge of
animal geometry, per-frame optimization, or manual annotations. We also propose
a novel rotation-invariant visual embedding technique for encoding pose and
appearance, designed to be a plug-in replacement for 3D keypoint data in
downstream behavioral analyses. Experiments on datasets of mice, rats, and
zebra finches show Pose Splatter learns accurate 3D animal geometries. Notably,
Pose Splatter represents subtle variations in pose, provides better
low-dimensional pose embeddings over state-of-the-art as evaluated by humans,
and generalizes to unseen data. By eliminating annotation and per-frame
optimization bottlenecks, Pose Splatter enables analysis of large-scale,
longitudinal behavior needed to map genotype, neural activity, and
micro-behavior at unprecedented resolution.

Conclusion: CONCORD方法显著提升了数据集蒸馏的控制性和可解释性，无需依赖预训练分类器。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) has witnessed significant progress in creating
small datasets that encapsulate rich information from large original ones.
Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance,
while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture
generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability
for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real
distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking
concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly
represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the
constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose
incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to
perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation.
Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on
category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object
details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly
enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image
generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the
efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K
and its subsets. The code implementation is released in

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督学习框架和3D T-Distribution损失函数显著提升了预测的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Cochlear implant surgery is a treatment for individuals with severe hearing
loss. It involves inserting an array of electrodes inside the cochlea to
electrically stimulate the auditory nerve and restore hearing sensation. A
crucial step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, a surgical intervention that
removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone, providing a critical
pathway to the cochlea for electrode placement. Accurate prediction of the
mastoidectomy region from preoperative imaging assists presurgical planning,
reduces surgical risks, and improves surgical outcomes. In previous work, a
self-supervised network was introduced to predict the mastoidectomy region
using only preoperative CT scans. While promising, the method suffered from
suboptimal robustness, limiting its practical application. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel weakly-supervised Mamba-based framework to
predict accurate mastoidectomy regions directly from preoperative CT scans. Our
approach utilizes a 3D T-Distribution loss function inspired by the Student-t
distribution, which effectively handles the complex geometric variability
inherent in mastoidectomy shapes. Weak supervision is achieved using the
segmentation results from the prior self-supervised network to eliminate the
need for manual data cleaning or labeling throughout the training process. The
proposed method is extensively evaluated against state-of-the-art approaches,
demonstrating superior performance in predicting accurate and clinically
relevant mastoidectomy regions. Our findings highlight the robustness and
efficiency of the weakly-supervised learning framework with the proposed novel
3D T-Distribution loss.

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外硬件，适用于单目手术显微镜，临床效果显著。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for monocular patient-to-image
intraoperative registration, specifically designed to operate without any
external hardware tracking equipment or fiducial point markers. Leveraging a
synthetic microscopy surgical scene dataset with a wide range of
transformations, our approach directly maps preoperative CT scans to 2D
intraoperative surgical frames through a lightweight neural network for
real-time cochlear implant surgery guidance via a zero-shot learning approach.
Unlike traditional methods, our framework seamlessly integrates with monocular
surgical microscopes, making it highly practical for clinical use without
additional hardware dependencies and requirements. Our method estimates camera
poses, which include a rotation matrix and a translation vector, by learning
from the synthetic dataset, enabling accurate and efficient intraoperative
registration. The proposed framework was evaluated on nine clinical cases using
a patient-specific and cross-patient validation strategy. Our results suggest
that our approach achieves clinically relevant accuracy in predicting 6D camera

Conclusion: D^3HR通过改进潜在表示和采样方案，显著提升了数据集蒸馏的性能。

Abstract: Recent deep learning models demand larger datasets, driving the need for
dataset distillation to create compact, cost-efficient datasets while
maintaining performance. Due to the powerful image generation capability of
diffusion, it has been introduced to this field for generating distilled
images. In this paper, we systematically investigate issues present in current
diffusion-based dataset distillation methods, including inaccurate distribution
matching, distribution deviation with random noise, and separate sampling.
Building on this, we propose D^3HR, a novel diffusion-based framework to
generate distilled datasets with high representativeness. Specifically, we
adopt DDIM inversion to map the latents of the full dataset from a
low-normality latent domain to a high-normality Gaussian domain, preserving
information and ensuring structural consistency to generate representative
latents for the distilled dataset. Furthermore, we propose an efficient
sampling scheme to better align the representative latents with the
high-normality Gaussian distribution. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that D^3HR can achieve higher accuracy across different model architectures
compared with state-of-the-art baselines in dataset distillation. Source code:

Abstract: Crowd behaviour analysis is essential to numerous real-world applications,
such as public safety and urban planning, and therefore has been studied for
decades. In the last decade or so, the development of deep learning has
significantly propelled the research on crowd behaviours. This chapter reviews
recent advances in crowd behaviour analysis using deep learning. We mainly
review the research in two core tasks in this field, crowd behaviour prediction
and recognition. We broadly cover how different deep neural networks, after
first being proposed in machine learning, are applied to analysing crowd
behaviours. This includes pure deep neural network models as well as recent
development of methodologies combining physics with deep learning. In addition,
representative studies are discussed and compared in detail. Finally, we
discuss the effectiveness of existing methods and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field. This chapter aims to provide a high-level summary
of the ongoing deep learning research in crowd behaviour analysis. It intends
to help new researchers who just entered this field to obtain an overall
understanding of the ongoing research, as well as to provide a retrospective
analysis for existing researchers to identify possible future directions

*Jessica Tang,Ali Abedi,Tracey J. F. Colella,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 本文提出了一种利用预训练大语言模型（LLMs）评估康复运动质量并提供自然语言反馈的新方法，解决了传统康复训练中因数据集缺乏和反馈不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 康复训练因交通限制和人员短缺导致高退出率，虚拟平台和AI技术可提供家庭康复支持，但现有方法缺乏基于文本反馈的LLMs应用。

Method: 从患者骨骼关节提取运动特征，输入预训练LLMs，采用零样本、少样本、思维链和角色扮演提示技术生成反馈。

Result: 在UI-PRMD和REHAB24-6数据集上验证，方法在运动评估、推理和反馈生成方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法可集成到虚拟康复平台，帮助患者正确运动，促进康复并改善健康结果。

Abstract: Exercise-based rehabilitation improves quality of life and reduces morbidity,
mortality, and rehospitalization, though transportation constraints and staff
shortages lead to high dropout rates from rehabilitation programs. Virtual
platforms enable patients to complete prescribed exercises at home, while AI
algorithms analyze performance, deliver feedback, and update clinicians.
Although many studies have developed machine learning and deep learning models
for exercise quality assessment, few have explored the use of large language
models (LLMs) for feedback and are limited by the lack of rehabilitation
datasets containing textual feedback. In this paper, we propose a new method in
which exercise-specific features are extracted from the skeletal joints of
patients performing rehabilitation exercises and fed into pre-trained LLMs.
Using a range of prompting techniques, such as zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, and role-play prompting, LLMs are leveraged to evaluate
exercise quality and provide feedback in natural language to help patients
improve their movements. The method was evaluated through extensive experiments
on two publicly available rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets (UI-PRMD
and REHAB24-6) and showed promising results in exercise assessment, reasoning,
and feedback generation. This approach can be integrated into virtual
rehabilitation platforms to help patients perform exercises correctly, support
recovery, and improve health outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 研究探讨了认知健康与认知受损老年人在自动驾驶车辆接管请求（TORs）时的情感反应，发现认知受损者情感反应较弱，需适应性车辆系统支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶对老年人独立性和生活质量至关重要，但认知衰退可能影响驾驶安全。研究情感反应有助于了解接管时的准备状态。

Method: 通过面部表情分析测量效价和唤醒度，比较不同道路几何和速度下认知健康与受损者的情感状态差异。

Result: 认知受损者唤醒度较低且效价较高，表明情感反应和意识减弱。认知健康者在高需求条件下唤醒度适应性增加。

Conclusion: 认知受损驾驶员情感反应较弱，需开发能检测情感状态并支持安全接管的适应性车辆系统。

Abstract: Driving is a key component of independence and quality of life for older
adults. However, cognitive decline associated with conditions such as mild
cognitive impairment and dementia can compromise driving safety and often lead
to premature driving cessation. Conditionally automated vehicles, which require
drivers to take over control when automation reaches its operational limits,
offer a potential assistive solution. However, their effectiveness depends on
the driver's ability to respond to takeover requests (TORs) in a timely and
appropriate manner. Understanding emotional responses during TORs can provide
insight into drivers' engagement, stress levels, and readiness to resume
control, particularly in cognitively vulnerable populations. This study
investigated affective responses, measured via facial expression analysis of
valence and arousal, during TORs among cognitively healthy older adults and
those with cognitive impairment. Facial affect data were analyzed across
different road geometries and speeds to evaluate within- and between-group
differences in affective states. Within-group comparisons using the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test revealed significant changes in valence and arousal during
TORs for both groups. Cognitively healthy individuals showed adaptive increases
in arousal under higher-demand conditions, while those with cognitive
impairment exhibited reduced arousal and more positive valence in several
scenarios. Between-group comparisons using the Mann-Whitney U test indicated
that cognitively impaired individuals displayed lower arousal and higher
valence than controls across different TOR conditions. These findings suggest
reduced emotional response and awareness in cognitively impaired drivers,
highlighting the need for adaptive vehicle systems that detect affective states
and support safe handovers for vulnerable users.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为CENet的新型医学图像分割框架，通过DSEB和CFAM模块解决了边界细节和空间完整性问题，在多器官分割任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在医学图像分割中难以准确表示边界、处理器官形态变化及避免下采样信息丢失，限制了其准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: CENet框架包含DSEB模块（增强边界细节和小器官检测）和CFAM模块（多尺度设计保持空间完整性）。

Result: 在放射学和皮肤镜数据集上的实验表明，CENet在多器官分割和边界细节保留上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CENet为复杂医学图像分析任务提供了鲁棒且准确的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation, particularly in multi-domain scenarios, requires
precise preservation of anatomical structures across diverse representations.
While deep learning has advanced this field, existing models often struggle
with accurate boundary representation, variability in organ morphology, and
information loss during downsampling, limiting their accuracy and robustness.
To address these challenges, we propose the Context Enhancement Network
(CENet), a novel segmentation framework featuring two key innovations. First,
the Dual Selective Enhancement Block (DSEB) integrated into skip connections
enhances boundary details and improves the detection of smaller organs in a
context-aware manner. Second, the Context Feature Attention Module (CFAM) in
the decoder employs a multi-scale design to maintain spatial integrity, reduce
feature redundancy, and mitigate overly enhanced representations. Extensive
evaluations on both radiology and dermoscopic datasets demonstrate that CENet
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in multi-organ segmentation and
boundary detail preservation, offering a robust and accurate solution for
complex medical image analysis tasks. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/xmindflow/cenet.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种高效的训练时否定数据生成方法TNG-CLIP，并创建了首个评估文本到图像生成模型在否定提示下表现的基准Neg-TtoI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在否定理解能力上表现不足，且现有方法生成数据成本高、评估范围有限。

Method: 提出训练时生成否定数据的流程（仅增加2.5%训练时间），并建立Neg-TtoI基准评估模型在否定提示下的表现。

Result: TNG-CLIP在图像-文本匹配、文本-图像检索和图像生成等任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: TNG-CLIP高效且性能优越，为否定理解任务提供了新的解决方案和评估标准。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong
performance across a range of downstream tasks. However, CLIP is still limited
in negation understanding: the ability to recognize the absence or exclusion of
a concept. Existing methods address the problem by using a large language model
(LLM) to generate large-scale data of image captions containing negation for
further fine-tuning CLIP. However, these methods are both time- and
compute-intensive, and their evaluations are typically restricted to image-text
matching tasks. To expand the horizon, we (1) introduce a training-time
negation data generation pipeline such that negation captions are generated
during the training stage, which only increases 2.5% extra training time, and
(2) we propose the first benchmark, Neg-TtoI, for evaluating text-to-image
generation models on prompts containing negation, assessing model's ability to
produce semantically accurate images. We show that our proposed method,
TNG-CLIP, achieves SOTA performance on diverse negation benchmarks of
image-to-text matching, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在复杂场景中难以保持风格化的一致性，且开源方法与专有模型（如GPT-4o）存在性能差距。

Method: 提出OmniConsistency，包括上下文一致性学习框架、两阶段渐进学习策略和即插即用设计。

Result: 实验表明，OmniConsistency显著提升了视觉一致性和美学质量，性能接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: OmniConsistency有效解决了风格化一致性问题，为开源模型提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced image stylization significantly, yet two core
challenges persist: (1) maintaining consistent stylization in complex scenes,
particularly identity, composition, and fine details, and (2) preventing style
degradation in image-to-image pipelines with style LoRAs. GPT-4o's exceptional
stylization consistency highlights the performance gap between open-source
methods and proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{OmniConsistency}, a universal consistency plugin leveraging large-scale
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). OmniConsistency contributes: (1) an in-context
consistency learning framework trained on aligned image pairs for robust
generalization; (2) a two-stage progressive learning strategy decoupling style
learning from consistency preservation to mitigate style degradation; and (3) a
fully plug-and-play design compatible with arbitrary style LoRAs under the Flux
framework. Extensive experiments show that OmniConsistency significantly
enhances visual coherence and aesthetic quality, achieving performance
comparable to commercial state-of-the-art model GPT-4o.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种因果视角来解释上下文偏差，并提出了Mask Pooling方法来减少偏差，同时设计了一个新的基准测试来验证模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解上下文偏差的成因并找到减少其影响的方法，特别是在跨域目标检测（DAOD）中。

Method: 提出Mask Pooling方法，利用前景掩码分离前景和背景的池化过程，并设计了一个包含绝对随机背景的基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，Mask Pooling方法能有效减少上下文偏差，使模型在不同域中表现更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 本文为减少域偏移下的上下文偏差提供了理论依据和实用方法。

Abstract: Context bias refers to the association between the foreground objects and
background during the object detection training process. Various methods have
been proposed to minimize the context bias when applying the trained model to
an unseen domain, known as domain adaptation for object detection (DAOD). But a
principled approach to understand why the context bias occurs and how to remove
it has been missing.
  In this work, we provide a causal view of the context bias, pointing towards
the pooling operation in the convolution network architecture as the possible
source of this bias. We present an alternative, Mask Pooling, which uses an
additional input of foreground masks, to separate the pooling process in the
respective foreground and background regions and show that this process leads
the trained model to detect objects in a more robust manner under different
domains. We also provide a benchmark designed to create an ultimate test for
DAOD, using foregrounds in the presence of absolute random backgrounds, to
analyze the robustness of the intended trained models. Through these
experiments, we hope to provide a principled approach for minimizing context
bias under domain shift.

TLDR: BiomechGPT是一个多模态生物力学-语言模型，能够回答临床相关的运动问题，并在多种任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无标记运动捕捉技术的进步扩大了生物力学运动分析的应用范围，但下游数据分析的挑战也随之增加。需要一种通用模型来处理多样化的运动数据。

Method: 通过收集大量生物力学数据并标记化运动轨迹，构建多模态数据集，开发了BiomechGPT模型。

Result: BiomechGPT在活动识别、运动障碍识别、诊断、临床评分和步行测量等任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: BiomechGPT为康复运动数据的基础模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Advances in markerless motion capture are expanding access to biomechanical
movement analysis, making it feasible to obtain high-quality movement data from
outpatient clinics, inpatient hospitals, therapy, and even home. Expanding
access to movement data in these diverse contexts makes the challenge of
performing downstream analytics all the more acute. Creating separate bespoke
analysis code for all the tasks end users might want is both intractable and
does not take advantage of the common features of human movement underlying
them all. Recent studies have shown that fine-tuning language models to accept
tokenized movement as an additional modality enables successful descriptive
captioning of movement. Here, we explore whether such a multimodal
motion-language model can answer detailed, clinically meaningful questions
about movement. We collected over 30 hours of biomechanics from nearly 500
participants, many with movement impairments from a variety of etiologies,
performing a range of movements used in clinical outcomes assessments. After
tokenizing these movement trajectories, we created a multimodal dataset of
motion-related questions and answers spanning a range of tasks. We developed
BiomechGPT, a multimodal biomechanics-language model, on this dataset. Our
results show that BiomechGPT demonstrates high performance across a range of
tasks such as activity recognition, identifying movement impairments,
diagnosis, scoring clinical outcomes, and measuring walking. BiomechGPT
provides an important step towards a foundation model for rehabilitation
movement data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸修复方法在保持高保真度和避免伪影方面存在挑战，需要更“诚实”的模型以准确反映原始特征。

Method: 提出身份嵌入器捕获身份特征，采用掩膜对齐增强细节，并引入基于仿射变换的评估指标。

Result: HonestFace在视觉质量和定量评估上优于现有方法，实现了高保真和真实感的修复效果。

Conclusion: HonestFace通过创新组件和评估指标，显著提升了人脸修复的准确性和真实性。

Abstract: Face restoration has achieved remarkable advancements through the years of
development. However, ensuring that restored facial images exhibit high
fidelity, preserve authentic features, and avoid introducing artifacts or
biases remains a significant challenge. This highlights the need for models
that are more "honest" in their reconstruction from low-quality inputs,
accurately reflecting original characteristics. In this work, we propose
HonestFace, a novel approach designed to restore faces with a strong emphasis
on such honesty, particularly concerning identity consistency and texture
realism. To achieve this, HonestFace incorporates several key components.
First, we propose an identity embedder to effectively capture and preserve
crucial identity features from both the low-quality input and multiple
reference faces. Second, a masked face alignment method is presented to enhance
fine-grained details and textural authenticity, thereby preventing the
generation of patterned or overly synthetic textures and improving overall
clarity. Furthermore, we present a new landmark-based evaluation metric. Based
on affine transformation principles, this metric improves the accuracy compared
to conventional L2 distance calculations for facial feature alignment.
Leveraging these contributions within a one-step diffusion model framework,
HonestFace delivers exceptional restoration results in terms of facial fidelity
and realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both
visual quality and quantitative assessments. The code and pre-trained models
will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jkwang28/HonestFace .

Motivation: 浮游动物监测对海洋科学研究至关重要，但现有计算机视觉工具难以处理其与背景的高相似性。

Method: 提出ZooplanktonBench数据集，包含丰富的空间元数据，并定义了一系列任务。

Result: 数据集为计算机视觉系统提供了独特的挑战和机会，以改进动态环境中的视觉理解。

Conclusion: ZooplanktonBench有助于推动计算机视觉技术在海洋科学中的应用。

Abstract: Plankton are small drifting organisms found throughout the world's oceans.
One component of this plankton community is the zooplankton, which includes
gelatinous animals and crustaceans (e.g. shrimp), as well as the early life
stages (i.e., eggs and larvae) of many commercially important fishes. Being
able to monitor zooplankton abundances accurately and understand how
populations change in relation to ocean conditions is invaluable to marine
science research, with important implications for future marine seafood
productivity. While new imaging technologies generate massive amounts of video
data of zooplankton, analyzing them using general-purpose computer vision tools
developed for general objects turns out to be highly challenging due to the
high similarity in appearance between the zooplankton and its background (e.g.,
marine snow). In this work, we present the ZooplanktonBench, a benchmark
dataset containing images and videos of zooplankton associated with rich
geospatial metadata (e.g., geographic coordinates, depth, etc.) in various
water ecosystems. ZooplanktonBench defines a collection of tasks to detect,
classify, and track zooplankton in challenging settings, including highly
cluttered environments, living vs non-living classification, objects with
similar shapes, and relatively small objects. Our dataset presents unique
challenges and opportunities for state-of-the-art computer vision systems to
evolve and improve visual understanding in a dynamic environment with huge
variations and be geo-aware.

Result: 实验表明，新标准构建的数据集提供了更好的几何上下文，提升了复杂3D空间条件下的文本渲染效果。

Conclusion: 新方法为未来场景文本渲染技术提供了更强大的数据基础。

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the challenge of insufficient
three-dimensional context in synthetic datasets for scene text rendering.
Although recent advances in diffusion models and related techniques have
improved certain aspects of scene text generation, most existing approaches
continue to rely on 2D data, sourcing authentic training examples from movie
posters and book covers, which limits their ability to capture the complex
interactions among spatial layout and visual effects in real-world scenes. In
particular, traditional 2D datasets do not provide the necessary geometric cues
for accurately embedding text into diverse backgrounds. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel standard for constructing synthetic datasets
that incorporates surface normals to enrich three-dimensional scene
characteristic. By adding surface normals to conventional 2D data, our approach
aims to enhance the representation of spatial relationships and provide a more
robust foundation for future scene text rendering methods. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that datasets built under this new standard offer
improved geometric context, facilitating further advancements in text rendering
under complex 3D-spatial conditions.

Conclusion: A$^3$Tune通过自动注意力对齐调整显著提升了Med-LVLMs的表现，为医学视觉语言任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) often exhibit suboptimal
attention distribution on visual inputs, leading to hallucinated or inaccurate
outputs. Existing mitigation methods primarily rely on inference-time
interventions, which are limited in attention adaptation or require additional
supervision. To address this, we propose A$^3$Tune, a novel fine-tuning
framework for Automatic Attention Alignment Tuning. A$^3$Tune leverages
zero-shot weak labels from SAM, refines them into prompt-aware labels using
BioMedCLIP, and then selectively modifies visually-critical attention heads to
improve alignment while minimizing interference. Additionally, we introduce a
A$^3$MoE module, enabling adaptive parameter selection for attention tuning
across diverse prompts and images. Extensive experiments on medical VQA and
report generation benchmarks show that A$^3$Tune outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving enhanced attention distributions and performance in
Med-LVLMs.

Conclusion: 通过减少轨迹混合，为高效扩散模型训练提供了新方向，并揭示了最优传输（OT）对扩散训练的潜在作用。

Abstract: The substantial training cost of diffusion models hinders their deployment.
Immiscible Diffusion recently showed that reducing diffusion trajectory mixing
in the noise space via linear assignment accelerates training by simplifying
denoising. To extend immiscible diffusion beyond the inefficient linear
assignment under high batch sizes and high dimensions, we refine this concept
to a broader miscibility reduction at any layer and by any implementation.
Specifically, we empirically demonstrate the bijective nature of the denoising
process with respect to immiscible diffusion, ensuring its preservation of
generative diversity. Moreover, we provide thorough analysis and show
step-by-step how immiscibility eases denoising and improves efficiency.
Extending beyond linear assignment, we propose a family of implementations
including K-nearest neighbor (KNN) noise selection and image scaling to reduce
miscibility, achieving up to >4x faster training across diverse models and
tasks including unconditional/conditional generation, image editing, and
robotics planning. Furthermore, our analysis of immiscibility offers a novel
perspective on how optimal transport (OT) enhances diffusion training. By
identifying trajectory miscibility as a fundamental bottleneck, we believe this
work establishes a potentially new direction for future research into
high-efficiency diffusion training. The code is available at

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis and treatment
but is challenged by high-dimensional data and complex spatial dependencies.
Traditional single-modality networks, such as CNNs and Transformers, are often
limited by computational inefficiency and constrained contextual modeling in 3D
settings. We introduce a novel multimodal framework that leverages Mamba and
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an efficient backbone for long-sequence
modeling. Our approach features three key innovations: First, an EGSC (Enhanced
Gated Spatial Convolution) module captures spatial information when unfolding
3D images into 1D sequences. Second, we extend Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN), a
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks variant with rational basis functions, into
3D-Group-Rational KAN (3D-GR-KAN) for 3D medical imaging - its first
application in this domain - enabling superior feature representation tailored
to volumetric data. Third, a dual-branch text-driven strategy leverages CLIP's
text embeddings: one branch swaps one-hot labels for semantic vectors to
preserve inter-organ semantic relationships, while the other aligns images with
detailed organ descriptions to enhance semantic alignment. Experiments on the
Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) and KiTS23 datasets show our method
achieving state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in
accuracy and efficiency. This work highlights the power of combining advanced
sequence modeling, extended network architectures, and vision-language synergy
to push forward 3D medical image segmentation, delivering a scalable solution

*Shiu-hong Kao,Yu-Wing Tai,Chi-Keung Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: ThinkVideo是一个无需训练的框架，利用MLLM的零样本思维链能力解决视频对象分割中的时空信息整合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频中处理时间敏感查询时表现不佳，主要因为未能整合时空信息。

Method: ThinkVideo通过CoT提示提取关键帧的对象选择性，结合图像分割模型和SAM2视频处理器生成掩码序列。

Result: 实验表明，ThinkVideo在显式和隐式查询的视频对象分割任务中均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ThinkVideo为视频对象分割提供了一种高效、兼容性强且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning Video Object Segmentation is a challenging task, which generates a
mask sequence from an input video and an implicit, complex text query. Existing
works probe into the problem by finetuning Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLM) for segmentation-based output, while still falling short in difficult
cases on videos given temporally-sensitive queries, primarily due to the
failure to integrate temporal and spatial information. In this paper, we
propose ThinkVideo, a novel framework which leverages the zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capability of MLLM to address these challenges.
Specifically, ThinkVideo utilizes the CoT prompts to extract object
selectivities associated with particular keyframes, then bridging the reasoning
image segmentation model and SAM2 video processor to output mask sequences. The
ThinkVideo framework is training-free and compatible with closed-source MLLMs,
which can be applied to Reasoning Video Instance Segmentation. We further
extend the framework for online video streams, where the CoT is used to update
the object of interest when a better target starts to emerge and becomes
visible. We conduct extensive experiments on video object segmentation with
explicit and implicit queries. The results show that ThinkVideo significantly
outperforms previous works in both cases, qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: DenoisingGait利用生成扩散模型和几何驱动的特征匹配模块，去除步态视频中的无关干扰，提出新型流式步态表示Gait Feature Field，显著提升识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于轮廓和姿态的步态识别方法因输入稀疏且信息不足，难以排除衣物纹理等无关干扰。新兴端到端方法通过直接去噪RGB视频解决此问题，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 结合生成扩散模型和几何驱动的特征匹配模块，通过背景去除和特征压缩，生成两通道方向向量，形成Gait Feature Field表示。

Result: 在CCPG、CASIA-B*和SUSTech1K数据集上，DenoisingGait在多数情况下达到新的SoTA性能。

Conclusion: DenoisingGait通过去噪和特征匹配，显著提升步态识别性能，为跨域和域内评估提供了新基准。

Abstract: To capture individual gait patterns, excluding identity-irrelevant cues in
walking videos, such as clothing texture and color, remains a persistent
challenge for vision-based gait recognition. Traditional silhouette- and
pose-based methods, though theoretically effective at removing such
distractions, often fall short of high accuracy due to their sparse and less
informative inputs. Emerging end-to-end methods address this by directly
denoising RGB videos using human priors. Building on this trend, we propose
DenoisingGait, a novel gait denoising method. Inspired by the philosophy that
"what I cannot create, I do not understand", we turn to generative diffusion
models, uncovering how they partially filter out irrelevant factors for gait
understanding. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-driven Feature Matching
module, which, combined with background removal via human silhouettes,
condenses the multi-channel diffusion features at each foreground pixel into a
two-channel direction vector. Specifically, the proposed within- and
cross-frame matching respectively capture the local vectorized structures of
gait appearance and motion, producing a novel flow-like gait representation
termed Gait Feature Field, which further reduces residual noise in diffusion
features. Experiments on the CCPG, CASIA-B*, and SUSTech1K datasets demonstrate
that DenoisingGait achieves a new SoTA performance in most cases for both
within- and cross-domain evaluations. Code is available at

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为DiTF的训练免费框架，通过AdaLN-zero定位和归一化DiTs中的massive activations，显著提升了视觉对应任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)在密集视觉对应任务中的表现，发现其存在massive activations问题，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出DiTF框架，利用AdaLN-zero定位和归一化massive activations，并采用通道丢弃策略消除负面影响。

Result: DiTF在Spair-71k和AP-10K-C.S.等任务中表现优于DINO和SD模型，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: DiTF通过解决massive activations问题，为DiTs在视觉对应任务中建立了新的SOTA性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained stable diffusion models (SD) have shown great advances in visual
correspondence. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) for accurate dense correspondence. Distinct from SD, DiTs
exhibit a critical phenomenon in which very few feature activations exhibit
significantly larger values than others, known as \textit{massive activations},
leading to uninformative representations and significant performance
degradation for DiTs. The massive activations consistently concentrate at very
few fixed dimensions across all image patch tokens, holding little local
information. We trace these dimension-concentrated massive activations and find
that such concentration can be effectively localized by the zero-initialized
Adaptive Layer Norm (AdaLN-zero). Building on these findings, we propose
Diffusion Transformer Feature (DiTF), a training-free framework designed to
extract semantic-discriminative features from DiTs. Specifically, DiTF employs
AdaLN to adaptively localize and normalize massive activations with
channel-wise modulation. In addition, we develop a channel discard strategy to
further eliminate the negative impacts from massive activations. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DiTF outperforms both DINO and SD-based models and
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance for DiTs in different visual
correspondence tasks (\eg, with +9.4\% on Spair-71k and +4.4\% on AP-10K-C.S.).

TLDR: 本文提出了一种前景引导的增强策略，通过空间感知的辅助损失和轻量级LayerScale机制，优化Soft MoE模型中的专家路由机制，提升性能和可解释性。


<details>

Motivation: 当前Soft MoE模型的设计忽视了调度权重中隐含的语义结构，导致专家路由效果不佳。研究发现调度权重具有分割模式但未与语义区域对齐。

Method: 提出前景引导增强策略，包括空间感知辅助损失和轻量级LayerScale机制，仅需少量架构调整即可集成到现有框架。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K及多个小规模分类基准上，性能持续提升，专家路由机制更具可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义对齐和优化信息流，显著提升了Soft MoE模型的效率和可解释性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising direction for
scaling vision architectures efficiently. Among them, Soft MoE improves
training stability by assigning each token to all experts via continuous
dispatch weights. However, current designs overlook the semantic structure
which is implicitly encoded in these weights, resulting in suboptimal expert
routing. In this paper, we discover that dispatch weights in Soft MoE
inherently exhibit segmentation-like patterns but are not explicitly aligned
with semantic regions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a
foreground-guided enhancement strategy. Specifically, we introduce a spatially
aware auxiliary loss that encourages expert activation to align with semantic
foreground regions. To further reinforce this supervision, we integrate a
lightweight LayerScale mechanism that improves information flow and stabilizes
optimization in skip connections. Our method necessitates only minor
architectural adjustments and can be seamlessly integrated into prevailing Soft
MoE frameworks. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and multiple
smaller-scale classification benchmarks not only showcase consistent
performance enhancements but also reveal more interpretable expert routing
mechanisms.

Result: HyperFake在无需昂贵高光谱相机的情况下，实现了对不同Deepfake风格和数据集的更准确检测。

Conclusion: HyperFake首次将高光谱成像重建应用于Deepfake检测，为检测更复杂的操纵提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose a significant threat to digital media security, with current
detection methods struggling to generalize across different manipulation
techniques and datasets. While recent approaches combine CNN-based
architectures with Vision Transformers or leverage multi-modal learning, they
remain limited by the inherent constraints of RGB data. We introduce HyperFake,
a novel deepfake detection pipeline that reconstructs 31-channel hyperspectral
data from standard RGB videos, revealing hidden manipulation traces invisible
to conventional methods. Using an improved MST++ architecture, HyperFake
enhances hyperspectral reconstruction, while a spectral attention mechanism
selects the most critical spectral features for deepfake detection. The refined
spectral data is then processed by an EfficientNet-based classifier optimized
for spectral analysis, enabling more accurate and generalizable detection
across different deepfake styles and datasets, all without the need for
expensive hyperspectral cameras. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first approach to leverage hyperspectral imaging reconstruction for deepfake
detection, opening new possibilities for detecting increasingly sophisticated
manipulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言检索方法忽视实体的视觉语义知识，导致检索结果不准确。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成EVD补充文本数据，并通过EaRW重写查询以减少噪声。

Result: 在图像-文本检索基准测试中，EvdCLIP表现出优越性。

Conclusion: EvdCLIP通过EVD和EaRW有效提升了视觉语言检索的准确性和质量。

Abstract: Vision-language retrieval (VLR) has attracted significant attention in both
academia and industry, which involves using text (or images) as queries to
retrieve corresponding images (or text). However, existing methods often
neglect the rich visual semantics knowledge of entities, thus leading to
incorrect retrieval results. To address this problem, we propose the Entity
Visual Description enhanced CLIP (EvdCLIP), designed to leverage the visual
knowledge of entities to enrich queries. Specifically, since humans recognize
entities through visual cues, we employ a large language model (LLM) to
generate Entity Visual Descriptions (EVDs) as alignment cues to complement
textual data. These EVDs are then integrated into raw queries to create
visually-rich, EVD-enhanced queries. Furthermore, recognizing that EVD-enhanced
queries may introduce noise or low-quality expansions, we develop a novel,
trainable EVD-aware Rewriter (EaRW) for vision-language retrieval tasks. EaRW
utilizes EVD knowledge and the generative capabilities of the language model to
effectively rewrite queries. With our specialized training strategy, EaRW can
generate high-quality and low-noise EVD-enhanced queries. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments on image-text retrieval benchmarks
validate the superiority of EvdCLIP on vision-language retrieval tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有单图像超分辨率模型在超出训练尺度时性能崩溃的问题。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Zoom（CoZ）框架，将超分辨率任务分解为自回归链，结合多尺度感知提示和视觉语言模型生成文本引导。

Result: 实验表明，标准4x扩散超分辨率模型在CoZ框架下可实现256x放大，保持高质量和保真度。

Conclusion: CoZ是一种模型无关的框架，能够显著提升超分辨率模型的放大能力。

Abstract: Modern single-image super-resolution (SISR) models deliver photo-realistic
results at the scale factors on which they are trained, but collapse when asked
to magnify far beyond that regime. We address this scalability bottleneck with
Chain-of-Zoom (CoZ), a model-agnostic framework that factorizes SISR into an
autoregressive chain of intermediate scale-states with multi-scale-aware
prompts. CoZ repeatedly re-uses a backbone SR model, decomposing the
conditional probability into tractable sub-problems to achieve extreme
resolutions without additional training. Because visual cues diminish at high
magnifications, we augment each zoom step with multi-scale-aware text prompts
generated by a vision-language model (VLM). The prompt extractor itself is
fine-tuned using Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a critic
VLM, aligning text guidance towards human preference. Experiments show that a
standard 4x diffusion SR model wrapped in CoZ attains beyond 256x enlargement
with high perceptual quality and fidelity.

TLDR: 论文研究了因果注意力机制在视觉语言模型中的应用，提出了一种未来感知的注意力家族，通过聚合未来视觉上下文增强模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果掩码策略源自纯文本解码的LLMs，对视觉标记的适应不足，严格掩码未来位置限制了模型利用未来语义线索的能力。

Method: 提出一种轻量级注意力家族，通过池化将未来视觉上下文聚合到过去表示中，保持自回归结构的同时增强跨标记依赖。

Result: 实验表明，选择性压缩未来语义上下文到过去表示有助于提升视觉语言推理性能。

Conclusion: 未来感知注意力家族在保持自回归特性的同时，显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Causal attention has become a foundational mechanism in autoregressive
vision-language models (VLMs), unifying textual and visual inputs under a
single generative framework. However, existing causal mask-based strategies are
inherited from large language models (LLMs) where they are tailored for
text-only decoding, and their adaptation to vision tokens is insufficiently
addressed in the prefill stage. Strictly masking future positions for vision
queries introduces overly rigid constraints, which hinder the model's ability
to leverage future context that often contains essential semantic cues for
accurate inference. In this work, we empirically investigate how different
causal masking strategies affect vision-language inference and then propose a
family of future-aware attentions tailored for this setting. We first
empirically analyze the effect of previewing future tokens for vision queries
and demonstrate that rigid masking undermines the model's capacity to capture
useful contextual semantic representations. Based on these findings, we propose
a lightweight attention family that aggregates future visual context into past
representations via pooling, effectively preserving the autoregressive
structure while enhancing cross-token dependencies. We evaluate a range of
causal masks across diverse vision-language inference settings and show that
selectively compressing future semantic context into past representations
benefits the inference.

Motivation: 揭示脉冲神经元偏好低频信息，高频信息丢失导致性能下降，探索提升性能的方法。

Method: 提出Max-Former，通过Max-Pooling和Depth-Wise Convolution增强高频信号。

Result: Max-Former在ImageNet上达到82.39%准确率，比Spikformer提升7.58%。

Conclusion: Max-Former通过高频信号增强显著提升性能，为脉冲神经网络研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Spiking Transformers offer an energy-efficient alternative to conventional
deep learning by transmitting information solely through binary (0/1) spikes.
However, there remains a substantial performance gap compared to artificial
neural networks. A common belief is that their binary and sparse activation
transmission leads to information loss, thus degrading feature representation
and accuracy. In this work, however, we reveal for the first time that spiking
neurons preferentially propagate low-frequency information. We hypothesize that
the rapid dissipation of high-frequency components is the primary cause of
performance degradation. For example, on Cifar-100, adopting Avg-Pooling
(low-pass) for token mixing lowers performance to 76.73%; interestingly,
replacing it with Max-Pooling (high-pass) pushes the top-1 accuracy to 79.12%,
surpassing the well-tuned Spikformer baseline by 0.97%. Accordingly, we
introduce Max-Former that restores high-frequency signals through two
frequency-enhancing operators: extra Max-Pooling in patch embedding and
Depth-Wise Convolution in place of self-attention. Notably, our Max-Former
(63.99 M) hits the top-1 accuracy of 82.39% on ImageNet, showing a +7.58%
improvement over Spikformer with comparable model size (74.81%, 66.34 M). We
hope this simple yet effective solution inspires future research to explore the
distinctive nature of spiking neural networks, beyond the established practice
in standard deep learning.

Conclusion: 无需微调的方法能高效定制对象和抽象概念，为多概念个性化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize images of
user-provided concepts in diverse contexts. Despite recent progress in
multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle
to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun
exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they
require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and
prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a
novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively
customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our
method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful
properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module,
Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the
modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It incorporates
vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into
the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused
by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we
introduce a VLM-guided pretraining strategy that leverages the strong image
understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic
supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard
benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by
quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.

Result: SuperGS在正向和360度数据集上优于现有高分辨率新视角合成方法。

Conclusion: SuperGS通过两阶段框架和不确定性建模，实现了高质量的高分辨率新视角合成。

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has excelled in novel view synthesis
(NVS) with its real-time rendering capabilities and superior quality. However,
it encounters challenges for high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) due
to the coarse nature of primitives derived from low-resolution input views. To
address this issue, we propose SuperGS, an expansion of Scaffold-GS designed
with a two-stage coarse-to-fine training framework. In the low-resolution
stage, we introduce a latent feature field to represent the low-resolution
scene, which serves as both the initialization and foundational information for
super-resolution optimization. In the high-resolution stage, we propose a
multi-view consistent densification strategy that backprojects high-resolution
depth maps based on error maps and employs a multi-view voting mechanism,
mitigating ambiguities caused by multi-view inconsistencies in the pseudo
labels provided by 2D prior models while avoiding Gaussian redundancy.
Furthermore, we model uncertainty through variational feature learning and use
it to guide further scene representation refinement and adjust the supervisory
effect of pseudo-labels, ensuring consistent and detailed scene reconstruction.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGS outperforms state-of-the-art
HRNVS methods on both forward-facing and 360-degree datasets.

Result: 在Nuscenes数据集上，ProphetDWM在视频生成和动作预测任务中表现最佳，支持高质量长期预测。

Conclusion: ProphetDWM通过联合学习动作动态和状态，实现了长期未来预测，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Real-world driving requires people to observe the current environment,
anticipate the future, and make appropriate driving decisions. This requirement
is aligned well with the capabilities of world models, which understand the
environment and predict the future. However, recent world models in autonomous
driving are built explicitly, where they could predict the future by
controllable driving video generation. We argue that driving world models
should have two additional abilities: action control and action prediction.
Following this line, previous methods are limited because they predict the
video requires given actions of the same length as the video and ignore the
dynamical action laws. To address these issues, we propose ProphetDWM, a novel
end-to-end driving world model that jointly predicts future videos and actions.
Our world model has an action module to learn latent action from the present to
the future period by giving the action sequence and observations. And a
diffusion-model-based transition module to learn the state distribution. The
model is jointly trained by learning latent actions given finite states and
predicting action and video. The joint learning connects the action dynamics
and states and enables long-term future prediction. We evaluate our method in
video generation and action prediction tasks on the Nuscenes dataset. Compared
to the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the best video consistency
and best action prediction accuracy, while also enabling high-quality long-term
video and action generation.

Abstract: Robust long-term visual localization in complex industrial environments is
critical for mobile robotic systems. Existing approaches face limitations:
handcrafted features are illumination-sensitive, learned features are
computationally intensive, and semantic- or marker-based methods are
environmentally constrained. Handcrafted and learned features share similar
representations but differ functionally. Handcrafted features are optimized for
continuous tracking, while learned features excel in wide-baseline matching.
Their complementarity calls for integration rather than replacement. Building
on this, we propose a hierarchical localization framework. It leverages
real-time handcrafted feature extraction for relative pose estimation. In
parallel, it employs selective learned keypoint detection on optimized
keyframes for absolute positioning. This design enables CPU-efficient,
long-term visual localization. Experiments systematically progress through
three validation phases: Initially establishing feature complementarity through
comparative analysis, followed by computational latency profiling across
algorithm stages on CPU platforms. Final evaluation under photometric
variations (including seasonal transitions and diurnal cycles) demonstrates 47%
average error reduction with significantly improved localization consistency.

Conclusion: 通过数据集、基准和检测框架的结合，为社交媒体伪造检测研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-powered generative models have enabled the creation of
increasingly realistic synthetic images, posing significant risks to
information integrity and public trust on social media platforms. While robust
detection frameworks and diverse, large-scale datasets are essential to
mitigate these risks, existing academic efforts remain limited in scope:
current datasets lack the diversity, scale, and realism required for social
media contexts, while detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen
generative technologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce So-Fake-Set, a
comprehensive social media-oriented dataset with over 2 million high-quality
images, diverse generative sources, and photorealistic imagery synthesized
using 35 state-of-the-art generative models. To rigorously evaluate
cross-domain robustness, we establish a novel and large-scale (100K)
out-of-domain benchmark (So-Fake-OOD) featuring synthetic imagery from
commercial models explicitly excluded from the training distribution, creating
a realistic testbed for evaluating real-world performance. Leveraging these
resources, we present So-Fake-R1, an advanced vision-language framework that
employs reinforcement learning for highly accurate forgery detection, precise
localization, and explainable inference through interpretable visual
rationales. Extensive experiments show that So-Fake-R1 outperforms the
second-best method, with a 1.3% gain in detection accuracy and a 4.5% increase
in localization IoU. By integrating a scalable dataset, a challenging OOD
benchmark, and an advanced detection framework, this work establishes a new
foundation for social media-centric forgery detection research. The code,
models, and datasets will be released publicly.

TLDR: DVD-Quant是一种无需校准数据的新型量化框架，用于视频扩散变换器（DiTs），通过三种创新技术显著减少量化误差并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频DiT量化方法依赖耗时校准且性能下降严重，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 结合渐进有界量化（PBQ）、自动缩放旋转量化（ARQ）和δ引导位切换（δ-GBS）技术。

Result: 在多个视频生成基准测试中，DVD-Quant实现约2倍加速，且保持视觉保真度，首次实现W4A4量化。

Conclusion: DVD-Quant为视频DiT的高效部署提供了实用解决方案，无需牺牲质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art
architecture for video generation, yet their computational and memory demands
hinder practical deployment. While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a
promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from
two critical limitations: (1) dependence on lengthy, computation-heavy
calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after
quantization. To address these challenges, we propose DVD-Quant, a novel
Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three
key innovations: (1) Progressive Bounded Quantization (PBQ) and (2)
Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) for calibration data-free quantization
error reduction, as well as (3) $\delta$-Guided Bit Switching ($\delta$-GBS)
for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video
generation benchmarks demonstrate that DVD-Quant achieves an approximately
2$\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on HunyuanVideo while
maintaining visual fidelity. Notably, DVD-Quant is the first to enable W4A4 PTQ
for Video DiTs without compromising video quality. Code and models will be

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息图表的视觉和结构复杂性对传统训练于普通图表的大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）构成挑战。

Method: 通过归纳过程构建数据集，识别75种图表类型、330种图表变体和68种布局模板，并程序化生成合成图表。

Result: 数据集在图表理解微调、代码生成基准测试和基于示例的图表生成中展示了实用性。

Abstract: Infographic charts are a powerful medium for communicating abstract data by
combining visual elements (e.g., charts, images) with textual information.
However, their visual and structural richness poses challenges for large
vision-language models (LVLMs), which are typically trained on plain charts. To
bridge this gap, we introduce ChartGalaxy, a million-scale dataset designed to
advance the understanding and generation of infographic charts. The dataset is
constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 330
chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses
them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this
dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning,
2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling
example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and
structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource
for enhancing multimodal reasoning and generation in LVLMs.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于预训练Stable Diffusion模型的内部细节增强扩散模型，用于高保真修复真实世界退化图像，支持文本引导修复和对象级着色控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界退化图像（如旧照片或低分辨率图像）的修复面临复杂混合退化（如划痕、褪色和噪声）的挑战，现有方法难以同时实现高保真修复和对象级着色控制。

Method: 利用预训练Stable Diffusion模型作为生成先验，结合内部图像细节增强（IIDE）技术，在潜在空间中注入退化操作以模拟退化效果，同时保留结构和纹理信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定性和感知定量评估中显著优于现有模型，并支持文本引导的修复和对象级着色控制。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合扩散模型和内部细节增强技术，实现了高保真修复和灵活的着色控制，为真实世界退化图像修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Restoring real-world degraded images, such as old photographs or
low-resolution images, presents a significant challenge due to the complex,
mixed degradations they exhibit, such as scratches, color fading, and noise.
Recent data-driven approaches have struggled with two main challenges:
achieving high-fidelity restoration and providing object-level control over
colorization. While diffusion models have shown promise in generating
high-quality images with specific controls, they often fail to fully preserve
image details during restoration. In this work, we propose an internal
detail-preserving diffusion model for high-fidelity restoration of real-world
degraded images. Our method utilizes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model as a
generative prior, eliminating the need to train a model from scratch. Central
to our approach is the Internal Image Detail Enhancement (IIDE) technique,
which directs the diffusion model to preserve essential structural and textural
information while mitigating degradation effects. The process starts by mapping
the input image into a latent space, where we inject the diffusion denoising
process with degradation operations that simulate the effects of various
degradation factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both qualitative
assessments and perceptual quantitative evaluations. Additionally, our approach
supports text-guided restoration, enabling object-level colorization control
that mimics the expertise of professional photo editing.

TLDR: ReasonMap是一个评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）细粒度视觉理解和空间推理能力的基准，包含30个城市的交通地图和1,008个问题对。评估发现开源基础模型优于推理模型，而闭源模型则相反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在细粒度视觉推理任务上的能力尚未充分评估，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 设计ReasonMap基准，包含高分辨率交通地图和多样化问题对，采用两级评估流程。

Result: 开源基础模型表现优于推理模型，闭源模型相反；视觉输入被掩盖时性能下降。

Conclusion: ReasonMap为视觉推理研究提供了新见解，揭示了开源与闭源模型之间的差距。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
progress in visual tasks, including semantic scene understanding and text-image
alignment, with reasoning variants enhancing performance on complex tasks
involving mathematics and logic. However, their capacity for reasoning tasks
involving fine-grained visual understanding remains insufficiently evaluated.
To address this gap, we introduce ReasonMap, a benchmark designed to assess the
fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs.
ReasonMap encompasses high-resolution transit maps from 30 cities across 13
countries and includes 1,008 question-answer pairs spanning two question types
and three templates. Furthermore, we design a two-level evaluation pipeline
that properly assesses answer correctness and quality. Comprehensive
evaluations of 15 popular MLLMs, including both base and reasoning variants,
reveal a counterintuitive pattern: among open-source models, base models
outperform reasoning ones, while the opposite trend is observed in
closed-source models. Additionally, performance generally degrades when visual
inputs are masked, indicating that while MLLMs can leverage prior knowledge to
answer some questions, fine-grained visual reasoning tasks still require
genuine visual perception for strong performance. Our benchmark study offers
new insights into visual reasoning and contributes to investigating the gap
between open-source and closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像恢复方法通常将问题视为直接映射，忽略了不同退化类型的结构多样性，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: MIRAGE将输入特征分解为三个并行分支（全局上下文、局部纹理、通道统计），并在SPD流形空间中进行跨层对比学习。

Result: MIRAGE在多种退化类型上实现了新的最佳性能，并提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: MIRAGE通过模块化分解和对比学习显著提升了图像恢复的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Image Restoration (IR) aims to recover high quality images from degraded
inputs affected by various corruptions such as noise, blur, haze, rain, and low
light conditions. Despite recent advances, most existing approaches treat IR as
a direct mapping problem, relying on shared representations across degradation
types without modeling their structural diversity. In this work, we present
MIRAGE, a unified and lightweight framework for all in one IR that explicitly
decomposes the input feature space into three semantically aligned parallel
branches, each processed by a specialized module attention for global context,
convolution for local textures, and MLP for channel-wise statistics. This
modular decomposition significantly improves generalization and efficiency
across diverse degradations. Furthermore, we introduce a cross layer
contrastive learning scheme that aligns shallow and latent features to enhance
the discriminability of shared representations. To better capture the
underlying geometry of feature representations, we perform contrastive learning
in a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold space rather than the
conventional Euclidean space. Extensive experiments show that MIRAGE not only
achieves new state of the art performance across a variety of degradation types
but also offers a scalable solution for challenging all-in-one IR scenarios.

TLDR: WeakMCN是一个多任务协作网络，通过联合学习弱监督的指代表达理解(WREC)和分割(WRES)，利用双分支架构和动态视觉特征增强(DVFE)与协作一致性模块(CCM)提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上WREC和WRES是分开建模的，但联合学习可以带来性能提升。

Method: 提出WeakMCN，采用双分支架构：WREC分支基于锚点的对比学习，同时监督WRES分支；引入DVFE和CCM促进多任务协作。

Result: 在RefCOCO等基准测试中，WeakMCN表现优于单任务方法，WREC和WRES分别提升3.91%和13.11%；在半监督设置下也表现优异。

Conclusion: WeakMCN通过多任务协作显著提升了弱监督任务的性能，并展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Weakly supervised referring expression comprehension(WREC) and
segmentation(WRES) aim to learn object grounding based on a given expression
using weak supervision signals like image-text pairs. While these tasks have
traditionally been modeled separately, we argue that they can benefit from
joint learning in a multi-task framework. To this end, we propose WeakMCN, a
novel multi-task collaborative network that effectively combines WREC and WRES
with a dual-branch architecture. Specifically, the WREC branch is formulated as
anchor-based contrastive learning, which also acts as a teacher to supervise
the WRES branch. In WeakMCN, we propose two innovative designs to facilitate
multi-task collaboration, namely Dynamic Visual Feature Enhancement(DVFE) and
Collaborative Consistency Module(CCM). DVFE dynamically combines various
pre-trained visual knowledge to meet different task requirements, while CCM
promotes cross-task consistency from the perspective of optimization. Extensive
experimental results on three popular REC and RES benchmarks, i.e., RefCOCO,
RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, consistently demonstrate performance gains of WeakMCN
over state-of-the-art single-task alternatives, e.g., up to 3.91% and 13.11% on
RefCOCO for WREC and WRES tasks, respectively. Furthermore, experiments also
validate the strong generalization ability of WeakMCN in both semi-supervised
REC and RES settings against existing methods, e.g., +8.94% for semi-REC and
+7.71% for semi-RES on 1% RefCOCO. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有图像编辑技术多关注文本驱动，而忽略了用户的情感需求，因此需要开发能够理解和满足情感请求的图像编辑方法。

Method: 构建连续情感谱以提取情感请求，设计情感映射器将抽象情感转化为具体语义表示，并引入MLLM监督模型训练。

Result: 实验表明，AIEdiT能有效反映用户情感需求，并实现情感驱动的图像编辑。

Conclusion: AIEdiT为情感图像编辑提供了新方法，通过情感因素调整实现用户情感需求的精准表达。

Abstract: In daily life, images as common affective stimuli have widespread
applications. Despite significant progress in text-driven image editing, there
is limited work focusing on understanding users' emotional requests. In this
paper, we introduce AIEdiT for Affective Image Editing using Text descriptions,
which evokes specific emotions by adaptively shaping multiple emotional factors
across the entire images. To represent universal emotional priors, we build the
continuous emotional spectrum and extract nuanced emotional requests. To
manipulate emotional factors, we design the emotional mapper to translate
visually-abstract emotional requests to visually-concrete semantic
representations. To ensure that editing results evoke specific emotions, we
introduce an MLLM to supervise the model training. During inference, we
strategically distort visual elements and subsequently shape corresponding
emotional factors to edit images according to users' instructions.
Additionally, we introduce a large-scale dataset that includes the
emotion-aligned text and image pair set for training and evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AIEdiT achieves superior performance, effectively
reflecting users' emotional requests.

TLDR: 论文提出Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite，通过结构化推理链增强视觉语言模型（VLMs），以解决地理定位任务中的推理和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地理定位任务需要多粒度视觉线索和外部知识的整合，现有方法缺乏鲁棒的推理机制和可解释性。

Method: 开发GRE Suite，包括数据集GRE30K、多阶段推理模型GRE和评估框架GREval-Bench。

Result: GRE在所有粒度地理定位任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GRE证明了推理增强的VLMs在复杂地理推理中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization
presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual
cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for
systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack
robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness.
To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE)
Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains
for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is
systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and
benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization
reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual
analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning
strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic
features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced
precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark
(GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across
diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained
(e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly
outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization
tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex
geographic inference. Code and data will be released at

Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球常见癌症，早期检测和治疗可降低死亡率，需高效预测模型。

Method: 预处理图像后，使用ConvNeXT和EfficientNet分类，并通过多种指标评估性能。

Result: ConvNeXT的AUC、准确率和F-score均优于EfficientNet。

Conclusion: ConvNeXT在乳腺癌筛查中更具潜力。

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide. This cancer
caused 670,000 deaths globally in 2022, as reported by the WHO. Yet since
health officials began routine mammography screening in age groups deemed at
risk in the 1980s, breast cancer mortality has decreased by 40% in high-income
nations. Every day, a greater and greater number of people are receiving a
breast cancer diagnosis. Reducing cancer-related deaths requires early
detection and treatment. This paper compares two convolutional neural networks
called ConvNeXT and EfficientNet to predict the likelihood of cancer in
mammograms from screening exams. Preprocessing of the images, classification,
and performance evaluation are main parts of the whole procedure. Several
evaluation metrics were used to compare and evaluate the performance of the
models. The result shows that ConvNeXT generates better results with a 94.33%
AUC score, 93.36% accuracy, and 95.13% F-score compared to EfficientNet with a
92.34% AUC score, 91.47% accuracy, and 93.06% F-score on RSNA screening
mammography breast cancer dataset.

Result: 在MDMOT和其他基准数据集上，FusionTrack在单视角和多视角跟踪中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: FusionTrack为自由视角MVMOT系统提供了有效的解决方案，并展示了其优越性能。

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object tracking (MVMOT) has found widespread applications in
intelligent transportation, surveillance systems, and urban management.
However, existing studies rarely address genuinely free-viewpoint MVMOT
systems, which could significantly enhance the flexibility and scalability of
cooperative tracking systems. To bridge this gap, we first construct the
Multi-Drone Multi-Object Tracking (MDMOT) dataset, captured by mobile drone
swarms across diverse real-world scenarios, initially establishing the first
benchmark for multi-object tracking in arbitrary multi-view environment.
Building upon this foundation, we propose \textbf{FusionTrack}, an end-to-end
framework that reasonably integrates tracking and re-identification to leverage
multi-view information for robust trajectory association. Extensive experiments
on our MDMOT and other benchmark datasets demonstrate that FusionTrack achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both single-view and multi-view tracking.

Motivation: 现有评估基准主要关注生成图像与提示的显式对齐，而忽略了与提示之外的真实世界知识的对齐。

Method: ABP包含2000多个精心设计的提示，覆盖六种场景，并利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）开发了ABPScore度量标准。此外，提出了ITKI策略优化模型表现。

Result: 评估8种流行T2I模型后发现，即使是GPT-4o等先进模型在整合真实世界知识方面仍有局限。ITKI策略使ABPScore提升约43%。

Conclusion: ABP填补了评估空白，ITKI策略有效提升了模型表现，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) generation models have advanced significantly,
enabling the creation of high-fidelity images from textual prompts. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on the explicit alignment
between generated images and prompts, neglecting the alignment with real-world
knowledge beyond prompts. To address this gap, we introduce Align Beyond
Prompts (ABP), a comprehensive benchmark designed to measure the alignment of
generated images with real-world knowledge that extends beyond the explicit
user prompts. ABP comprises over 2,000 meticulously crafted prompts, covering
real-world knowledge across six distinct scenarios. We further introduce
ABPScore, a metric that utilizes existing Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to assess the alignment between generated images and world knowledge
beyond prompts, which demonstrates strong correlations with human judgments.
Through a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular T2I models using ABP, we find
that even state-of-the-art models, such as GPT-4o, face limitations in
integrating simple real-world knowledge into generated images. To mitigate this
issue, we introduce a training-free strategy within ABP, named Inference-Time
Knowledge Injection (ITKI). By applying this strategy to optimize 200
challenging samples, we achieved an improvement of approximately 43% in
ABPScore. The dataset and code are available in

Abstract: Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences has
emerged as a critical research challenge. While recent advances in this area
have extended preference optimization techniques from large language models
(LLMs) to the diffusion setting, they often struggle with limited exploration.
In this work, we propose a novel and orthogonal approach to enhancing
diffusion-based preference optimization. First, we introduce a stable reference
model update strategy that relaxes the frozen reference model, encouraging
exploration while maintaining a stable optimization anchor through reference
model regularization. Second, we present a timestep-aware training strategy
that mitigates the reward scale imbalance problem across timesteps. Our method
can be integrated into various preference optimization algorithms. Experimental
results show that our approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art
methods on human preference evaluation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像在通用病变检测（ULD）中存在图像质量和标签正确性的多样性，传统方法（如SCL和OHEM）在处理这些问题时存在样本硬度衡量不精确和样本利用率不足或过度的问题。

Method: 提出MoMBS方法，结合损失和不确定性衡量样本硬度，并通过混合顺序小批量采样设计优先利用代表性不足的样本，避免其受噪声或过拟合样本的负面影响。

Result: MoMBS方法优化了多样质量训练样本的使用，提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: MoMBS方法通过更精细的样本分类和采样策略，有效解决了多样质量样本训练中的挑战。

Abstract: Natural images exhibit label diversity (clean vs. noisy) in noisy-labeled
image classification and prevalence diversity (abundant vs. sparse) in
long-tailed image classification. Similarly, medical images in universal lesion
detection (ULD) exhibit substantial variations in image quality, encompassing
attributes such as clarity and label correctness. How to effectively leverage
training images with diverse qualities becomes a problem in learning deep
models. Conventional training mechanisms, such as self-paced curriculum
learning (SCL) and online hard example mining (OHEM), relieve this problem by
reweighting images with high loss values. Despite their success, these methods
still confront two challenges: (i) the loss-based measure of sample hardness is
imprecise, preventing optimum handling of different cases, and (ii) there
exists under-utilization in SCL or over-utilization OHEM with the identified
hard samples. To address these issues, this paper revisits the minibatch
sampling (MBS), a technique widely used in deep network training but largely
unexplored concerning the handling of diverse-quality training samples. We
discover that the samples within a minibatch influence each other during
training; thus, we propose a novel Mixed-order Minibatch Sampling (MoMBS)
method to optimize the use of training samples with diverse qualities. MoMBS
introduces a measure that takes both loss and uncertainty into account to
surpass a sole reliance on loss and allows for a more refined categorization of
high-loss samples by distinguishing them as either poorly labeled and under
represented or well represented and overfitted. We prioritize under represented
samples as the main gradient contributors in a minibatch and keep them from the
negative influences of poorly labeled or overfitted samples with a mixed-order
minibatch sampling design.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) images reveal detailed information about structures

in channel count and configuration, stemming from varying staining protocols
across laboratories and studies. Existing approaches build channel-adaptive
models, which unfortunately fail to support out-of-distribution (OOD)
evaluation across IHC datasets and cannot be applied in a true zero-shot
setting with mismatched channel counts. To address this, we introduce a
structured view of cellular image channels by grouping them into either context
or concept, where we treat the context channels as a reference to the concept
channels in the image. We leverage this context-concept principle to develop
Channel Conditioned Cell Representations (C3R), a framework designed for
unified evaluation on in-distribution (ID) and OOD datasets. C3R is a two-fold
framework comprising a channel-adaptive encoder architecture and a masked
knowledge distillation training strategy, both built around the context-concept
principle. We find that C3R outperforms existing benchmarks on both ID and OOD
tasks, while a trivial implementation of our core idea also outperforms the
channel-adaptive methods reported on the CHAMMI benchmark. Our method opens a
new pathway for cross-dataset generalization between IHC datasets, without
requiring dataset-specific adaptation or retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型中视觉输入令牌过多导致的显著计算开销问题。

Method: 设计ToDRE框架，采用贪婪k中心算法选择多样化视觉令牌，并在解码器中进一步修剪任务无关令牌。

Result: 减少90%视觉令牌，推理速度提升2.6倍，保持95.1%模型性能。

Conclusion: ToDRE通过令牌多样性和任务相关性修剪，高效减少计算开销且不影响性能。

Abstract: The representation of visual inputs of large vision-language models (LVLMs)
usually involves substantially more tokens than that of textual inputs, leading
to significant computational overhead. Several recent studies strive to
mitigate this issue by either conducting token compression to prune redundant
visual tokens or guiding them to bypass certain computational stages. While
most existing work exploits token importance as the redundancy indicator, our
study reveals that two largely neglected factors, namely, the diversity of
retained visual tokens and their task relevance, often offer more robust
criteria in token pruning. To this end, we design ToDRE, a two-stage and
training-free token compression framework that achieves superior performance by
pruning Tokens based on token Diversity and token-task RElevance. Instead of
pruning redundant tokens, ToDRE introduces a greedy k-center algorithm to
select and retain a small subset of diverse visual tokens after the vision
encoder. Additionally, ToDRE addresses the "information migration" by further
eliminating task-irrelevant visual tokens within the decoder of large language
model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that ToDRE effectively reduces 90% of
visual tokens after vision encoder and adaptively prunes all visual tokens
within certain LLM's decoder layers, leading to a 2.6x speed-up in total
inference time while maintaining 95.1% of model performance and excellent
compatibility with efficient attention operators.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为StyleGuard的新方法，用于对抗文本到图像扩散模型的风格模仿攻击，通过优化风格损失和设计新的上采样损失，提高了模型的鲁棒性和跨模型可转移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗噪声方法（如Glaze和Anti-DreamBooth）在防御风格模仿攻击时存在漏洞，且跨模型可转移性有限。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出StyleGuard方法，包括优化风格损失以偏离原始图像风格，并设计上采样损失以绕过扩散净化。

Result: 在WikiArt和CelebA数据集上的实验表明，StyleGuard在对抗多种变换和净化方法时表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StyleGuard能有效防御多种风格模仿攻击，具有较高的鲁棒性和跨模型可转移性。

Abstract: Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have been widely used for style
mimicry and personalized customization through methods such as DreamBooth and
Textual Inversion. This has raised concerns about intellectual property
protection and the generation of deceptive content. Recent studies, such as
Glaze and Anti-DreamBooth, have proposed using adversarial noise to protect
images from these attacks. However, recent purification-based methods, such as
DiffPure and Noise Upscaling, have successfully attacked these latest defenses,
showing the vulnerabilities of these methods. Moreover, present methods show
limited transferability across models, making them less effective against
unknown text-to-image models. To address these issues, we propose a novel
anti-mimicry method, StyleGuard. We propose a novel style loss that optimizes
the style-related features in the latent space to make it deviate from the
original image, which improves model-agnostic transferability. Additionally, to
enhance the perturbation's ability to bypass diffusion-based purification, we
designed a novel upscale loss that involves ensemble purifiers and upscalers
during training. Extensive experiments on the WikiArt and CelebA datasets
demonstrate that StyleGuard outperforms existing methods in robustness against
various transformations and purifications, effectively countering style mimicry
in various models. Moreover, StyleGuard is effective on different style mimicry
methods, including DreamBooth and Textual Inversion.

Method: 提出DPSPG框架，结合负学习和互补提示生成器，动态生成稳定且泛化性强的提示。

Result: 在五个域泛化基准数据集上，DPSPG表现优于现有方法，同时保持提示稳定性。

Conclusion: DPSPG通过负学习显著提升提示的稳定性和泛化能力，为域泛化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model using data from one or
multiple related but distinct source domains that can generalize well to unseen
out-of-distribution target domains. Inspired by the success of large
pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), prompt tuning has emerged as an
effective generalization strategy. However, it often struggles to capture
domain-specific features due to its reliance on manually or fixed prompt
inputs. Recently, some prompt generation methods have addressed this limitation
by dynamically generating instance-specific and domain-specific prompts for
each input, enriching domain information and demonstrating potential for
enhanced generalization. Through further investigation, we identify a notable
issue in existing prompt generation methods: the same input often yields
significantly different and suboptimal prompts across different random seeds, a
phenomenon we term Prompt Variability. To address this, we introduce negative
learning into the prompt generation process and propose Dual-Path Stable Soft
Prompt Generation (DPSPG), a transformer-based framework designed to improve
both the stability and generalization of prompts. Specifically, DPSPG
incorporates a complementary prompt generator to produce negative prompts,
thereby reducing the risk of introducing misleading information. Both
theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that negative learning leads to
more robust and effective prompts by increasing the effective margin and
reducing the upper bound of the gradient norm. Extensive experiments on five DG
benchmark datasets show that DPSPG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods while maintaining prompt stability.

Conclusion: T²A是一种有效的在线测试时适应方法，能够显著提升Deepfake检测器在复杂环境中的性能。

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) detectors face significant challenges when deployed in
real-world environments, particularly when encountering test samples deviated
from training data through either postprocessing manipulations or distribution
shifts. We demonstrate postprocessing techniques can completely obscure
generation artifacts presented in DF samples, leading to performance
degradation of DF detectors. To address these challenges, we propose Think
Twice before Adaptation (\texttt{T$^2$A}), a novel online test-time adaptation
method that enhances the adaptability of detectors during inference without
requiring access to source training data or labels. Our key idea is to enable
the model to explore alternative options through an Uncertainty-aware Negative
Learning objective rather than solely relying on its initial predictions as
commonly seen in entropy minimization (EM)-based approaches. We also introduce
an Uncertain Sample Prioritization strategy and Gradients Masking technique to
improve the adaptation by focusing on important samples and model parameters.
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed negative learning
objective exhibits complementary behavior to EM, facilitating better adaptation
capability. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared
to existing test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches and significantly enhances
the resilience and generalization of DF detectors during inference. Code is

between generated images and user instructions. Using OmniGenBench, we evaluate
mainstream generative models, including prevalent models like GPT-4o,

Result: 实现1.76倍端到端加速且无质量损失，兼容其他方法可达14.41倍加速。

Conclusion: VORTA显著提升VDiTs的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Transformers (VDiTs) have achieved remarkable progress in
high-quality video generation, but remain computationally expensive due to the
quadratic complexity of attention over high-dimensional video sequences. Recent
attention acceleration methods leverage the sparsity of attention patterns to
improve efficiency; however, they often overlook inefficiencies of redundant
long-range interactions. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{VORTA}, an
acceleration framework with two novel components: 1) a sparse attention
mechanism that efficiently captures long-range dependencies, and 2) a routing
strategy that adaptively replaces full 3D attention with specialized sparse
attention variants throughout the sampling process. It achieves a $1.76\times$
end-to-end speedup without quality loss on VBench. Furthermore, VORTA can
seamlessly integrate with various other acceleration methods, such as caching
and step distillation, reaching up to $14.41\times$ speedup with negligible
performance degradation. VORTA demonstrates its efficiency and enhances the
practicality of VDiTs in real-world settings.

Conclusion: SAMA通过统一的数据集、模型和基准，显著提升了视频多模态模型的细粒度时空理解能力。

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding in videos remains a
major challenge for current Video Large Multimodal Models (Video LMMs).
Addressing this challenge requires mastering two core capabilities: video
referring understanding, which captures the semantics of video regions, and
video grounding, which segments object regions based on natural language
descriptions. However, most existing approaches tackle these tasks in
isolation, limiting progress toward unified, referentially grounded video
interaction. We identify a key bottleneck in the lack of high-quality, unified
video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
referentially grounded video chat. To address these challenges, we contribute
in three core aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce
SAMA-239K, a large-scale dataset comprising 15K videos specifically curated to
enable joint learning of video referring understanding, grounding, and
multi-turn video chat. Second, we propose the SAMA model, which incorporates a
versatile spatio-temporal context aggregator and a Segment Anything Model to
jointly enhance fine-grained video comprehension and precise grounding
capabilities. Finally, we establish SAMA-Bench, a meticulously designed
benchmark consisting of 5,067 questions from 522 videos, to comprehensively
evaluate the integrated capabilities of Video LMMs in multi-turn,
spatio-temporal referring understanding and grounded dialogue. Extensive
experiments and benchmarking results show that SAMA not only achieves strong
performance on SAMA-Bench but also sets a new state-of-the-art on general
grounding benchmarks, while maintaining highly competitive performance on
standard visual understanding benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统3D标记方法（如k近邻或基于半径的标记）对数据集特定空间尺度敏感，导致跨域泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出S4Token标记器，结合超点分组和坐标尺度归一化，使用无监督目标（掩码点建模和聚类）和跨模态蒸馏对齐3D标记与2D多视图图像特征。

Result: S4Token在实验中一致优于传统方法，实现了尺度不变的表示学习。

Conclusion: S4Token是一种有效的通用3D标记器，适用于密集预测任务，并能通过特征传播模块恢复点级细节。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP can offer a promising foundation for 3D
scene understanding when extended with 3D tokenizers. However, standard
approaches, such as k-nearest neighbor or radius-based tokenization, struggle
with cross-domain generalization due to sensitivity to dataset-specific spatial
scales. We present a universal 3D tokenizer designed for scale-invariant
representation learning with a frozen CLIP backbone. We show that combining
superpoint-based grouping with coordinate scale normalization consistently
outperforms conventional methods through extensive experimental analysis.
Specifically, we introduce S4Token, a tokenization pipeline that produces
semantically-informed tokens regardless of scene scale. Our tokenizer is
trained without annotations using masked point modeling and clustering-based
objectives, along with cross-modal distillation to align 3D tokens with 2D
multi-view image features. For dense prediction tasks, we propose a
superpoint-level feature propagation module to recover point-level detail from
sparse tokens.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像修复和编辑方面的快速发展带来了社会风险，攻击者可能利用社交媒体上的用户图像生成误导性或有害内容。现有全局扰动方法在掩码引导的编辑任务中效果不佳。

Method: SDA通过优化扰动，在初始去噪步骤中干扰自注意力机制中的查询，破坏轮廓生成过程，从而直接破坏扩散模型的结构生成能力。

Result: 实验表明，SDA在公开数据集上实现了最先进的保护性能，并保持了强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SDA是一种有效的保护框架，能够防止敏感图像区域被滥用，同时具备良好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enhanced their image inpainting
and editing capabilities but also introduced significant societal risks.
Adversaries can exploit user images from social media to generate misleading or
harmful content. While adversarial perturbations can disrupt inpainting, global
perturbation-based methods fail in mask-guided editing tasks due to spatial
constraints. To address these challenges, we propose Structure Disruption
Attack (SDA), a powerful protection framework for safeguarding sensitive image
regions against inpainting-based editing. Building upon the contour-focused
nature of self-attention mechanisms of diffusion models, SDA optimizes
perturbations by disrupting queries in self-attention during the initial
denoising step to destroy the contour generation process. This targeted
interference directly disrupts the structural generation capability of
diffusion models, effectively preventing them from producing coherent images.
We validate our motivation through visualization techniques and extensive
experiments on public datasets, demonstrating that SDA achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) protection performance while maintaining strong
robustness.

Result: 在多个数据集上超越现有方法，验证了方法的优越性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MSLAU-Net有效结合了CNN和Transformer的优势，在医学图像分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Both CNN-based and Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable success
in medical image segmentation tasks. However, CNN-based methods struggle to
effectively capture global contextual information due to the inherent
limitations of convolution operations. Meanwhile, Transformer-based methods
suffer from insufficient local feature modeling and face challenges related to
the high computational complexity caused by the self-attention mechanism. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid CNN-Transformer
architecture, named MSLAU-Net, which integrates the strengths of both
paradigms. The proposed MSLAU-Net incorporates two key ideas. First, it
introduces Multi-Scale Linear Attention, designed to efficiently extract
multi-scale features from medical images while modeling long-range dependencies
with low computational complexity. Second, it adopts a top-down feature
aggregation mechanism, which performs multi-level feature aggregation and
restores spatial resolution using a lightweight structure. Extensive
experiments conducted on benchmark datasets covering three imaging modalities
demonstrate that the proposed MSLAU-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods on nearly all evaluation metrics, validating the superiority,
effectiveness, and robustness of our approach. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 研究揭示了DiT的内部结构，为模型编辑提供了更高效、可控和可解释的途径。

Abstract: Understanding how knowledge is distributed across the layers of generative
models is crucial for improving interpretability, controllability, and
adaptation. While prior work has explored knowledge localization in UNet-based
architectures, Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based models remain underexplored in
this context. In this paper, we propose a model- and knowledge-agnostic method
to localize where specific types of knowledge are encoded within the DiT
blocks. We evaluate our method on state-of-the-art DiT-based models, including
PixArt-alpha, FLUX, and SANA, across six diverse knowledge categories. We show
that the identified blocks are both interpretable and causally linked to the
expression of knowledge in generated outputs. Building on these insights, we
apply our localization framework to two key applications: model personalization
and knowledge unlearning. In both settings, our localized fine-tuning approach
enables efficient and targeted updates, reducing computational cost, improving
task-specific performance, and better preserving general model behavior with
minimal interference to unrelated or surrounding content. Overall, our findings
offer new insights into the internal structure of DiTs and introduce a
practical pathway for more interpretable, efficient, and controllable model
editing.

Abstract: This work investigates the optimal allocation of inference compute across
three key scaling factors in video vision language models: language model size,

without considering resource constraints, we instead identify optimal model
configuration under fixed inference compute budgets. We conduct large-scale
training sweeps and careful parametric modeling of task performance to identify
the inference compute-optimal frontier. Our experiments reveal how task
performance depends on scaling factors and finetuning data size, as well as how
changes in data size shift the compute-optimal frontier. These findings
translate to practical tips for selecting these scaling factors.

from significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By
computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs
and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that
existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same
computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token
identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than
semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive
computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones,
leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing
contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework
that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste,
achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and
efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and
reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach
ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification
accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient
computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget
control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x
speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan
2.1, respectively.

TLDR: 提出了一种新的视频编辑模型REGEN，结合检索和生成方法，生成具有连贯叙事和嵌入视频片段的短视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提取式视频摘要方法缺乏连贯叙事，而抽象式方法无法从输入视频中引用片段。

Method: 采用检索-嵌入生成框架，先通过微调大语言模型生成带占位符的故事脚本，再用检索模型选择最佳视频片段填充。

Result: 在纪录片预告生成任务中，REGEN能有效插入视频片段并保持叙事连贯，主观评测优于现有方法。

Conclusion: REGEN方法在视频编辑中实现了连贯叙事与视频引用的结合，表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: Short videos are an effective tool for promoting contents and improving
knowledge accessibility. While existing extractive video summarization methods
struggle to produce a coherent narrative, existing abstractive methods cannot
`quote' from the input videos, i.e., inserting short video clips in their
outputs. In this work, we explore novel video editing models for generating
shorts that feature a coherent narrative with embedded video insertions
extracted from a long input video. We propose a novel retrieval-embedded
generation framework that allows a large language model to quote multimodal
resources while maintaining a coherent narrative. Our proposed REGen system
first generates the output story script with quote placeholders using a
finetuned large language model, and then uses a novel retrieval model to
replace the quote placeholders by selecting a video clip that best supports the
narrative from a pool of candidate quotable video clips. We examine the
proposed method on the task of documentary teaser generation, where short
interview insertions are commonly used to support the narrative of a
documentary. Our objective evaluations show that the proposed method can
effectively insert short video clips while maintaining a coherent narrative. In
a subjective survey, we show that our proposed method outperforms existing
abstractive and extractive approaches in terms of coherence, alignment, and
realism in teaser generation.

TLDR: SD-OVON是一个用于开放词汇物体导航的数据集和基准生成管道，支持动态场景和可操作物体，提升了导航任务的真实性和复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集局限于静态环境，无法满足动态场景和开放词汇物体导航的需求。SD-OVON旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用预训练多模态基础模型生成无限独特的照片级真实场景变体，并提供与Habitat模拟器兼容的任务生成插件。

Conclusion: SD-OVON为复杂环境中的开放词汇物体导航提供了更真实的训练和评估平台。

Abstract: We present the Semantics-aware Dataset and Benchmark Generation Pipeline for
Open-vocabulary Object Navigation in Dynamic Scenes (SD-OVON). It utilizes
pretraining multimodal foundation models to generate infinite unique
photo-realistic scene variants that adhere to real-world semantics and daily
commonsense for the training and the evaluation of navigation agents,
accompanied with a plugin for generating object navigation task episodes
compatible to the Habitat simulator. In addition, we offer two pre-generated
object navigation task datasets, SD-OVON-3k and SD-OVON-10k, comprising
respectively about 3k and 10k episodes of the open-vocabulary object navigation
task, derived from the SD-OVON-Scenes dataset with 2.5k photo-realistic scans
of real-world environments and the SD-OVON-Objects dataset with 0.9k manually
inspected scanned and artist-created manipulatable object models. Unlike prior
datasets limited to static environments, SD-OVON covers dynamic scenes and
manipulatable objects, facilitating both real-to-sim and sim-to-real robotic
applications. This approach enhances the realism of navigation tasks, the
training and the evaluation of open-vocabulary object navigation agents in
complex settings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and
datasets, we propose two baselines and evaluate them along with
state-of-the-art baselines on SD-OVON-3k. The datasets, benchmark and source

Motivation: 解决视频模仿中因领域偏移（如光照、颜色或纹理差异）导致的失败问题，避免传统视觉随机化方法的计算开销和局限性。

Method: 将标准RGB视频转换为稀疏的事件表示，编码时间强度梯度，忽略静态外观特征，从而分离运动动态与视觉风格。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite和Adroit平台上验证了方法的有效性，实现了对视觉干扰的鲁棒性，无需计算昂贵的数据增强。

Conclusion: 事件感知方法为视觉模仿提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于存在视觉差异的场景。

Abstract: Imitation from videos often fails when expert demonstrations and learner
environments exhibit domain shifts, such as discrepancies in lighting, color,
or texture. While visual randomization partially addresses this problem by
augmenting training data, it remains computationally intensive and inherently
reactive, struggling with unseen scenarios. We propose a different approach:
instead of randomizing appearances, we eliminate their influence entirely by
rethinking the sensory representation itself. Inspired by biological vision
systems that prioritize temporal transients (e.g., retinal ganglion cells) and
by recent sensor advancements, we introduce event-inspired perception for
visually robust imitation. Our method converts standard RGB videos into a
sparse, event-based representation that encodes temporal intensity gradients,
discarding static appearance features. This biologically grounded approach
disentangles motion dynamics from visual style, enabling robust visual
imitation from observations even in the presence of visual mismatches between
expert and agent environments. By training policies on event streams, we
achieve invariance to appearance-based distractors without requiring
computationally expensive and environment-specific data augmentation
techniques. Experiments across the DeepMind Control Suite and the Adroit
platform for dynamic dexterous manipulation show the efficacy of our method.
Our code is publicly available at Eb-LAIfO.

Motivation: 评估VLMs在3D临床诊断中的适用性，尤其是对腹部肿瘤的识别、测量和推理能力。

Method: 构建了包含9,262个CT扫描和395K专家级问题的DeepTumorVQA基准，测试了四种先进VLMs（RadFM、M3D、Merlin、CT-CHAT）。

Result: 当前模型在测量任务中表现尚可，但在病变识别和推理方面表现不佳，且未能完全满足临床需求。RadFM因大规模多模态预训练表现突出。

Conclusion: DeepTumorVQA揭示了VLMs在3D感知中的关键差异，强调了图像预处理和视觉模块设计的重要性，并作为严格基准推动了医学多模态研究。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in various 2D visual tasks,
yet their readiness for 3D clinical diagnosis remains unclear due to stringent
demands for recognition precision, reasoning ability, and domain knowledge. To
systematically evaluate these dimensions, we present DeepTumorVQA, a diagnostic
visual question answering (VQA) benchmark targeting abdominal tumors in CT
scans. It comprises 9,262 CT volumes (3.7M slices) from 17 public datasets,
with 395K expert-level questions spanning four categories: Recognition,
Measurement, Visual Reasoning, and Medical Reasoning. DeepTumorVQA introduces
unique challenges, including small tumor detection and clinical reasoning
across 3D anatomy. Benchmarking four advanced VLMs (RadFM, M3D, Merlin,
CT-CHAT), we find current models perform adequately on measurement tasks but
struggle with lesion recognition and reasoning, and are still not meeting
clinical needs. Two key insights emerge: (1) large-scale multimodal pretraining
plays a crucial role in DeepTumorVQA testing performance, making RadFM stand
out among all VLMs. (2) Our dataset exposes critical differences in VLM
components, where proper image preprocessing and design of vision modules
significantly affect 3D perception. To facilitate medical multimodal research,
we have released DeepTumorVQA as a rigorous benchmark:

Motivation: 现有方法将标签视为平面且独立的，忽略了语义层次结构。本文利用LLMs的语义理解能力，自动生成多层次语义分类，并引入递归不确定性传播机制，以更高效地选择标注样本。

Method: 结合LLMs生成层次化语义分类，设计递归不确定性投影机制，将不确定性传播到层次结构中，实现基于语义结构的多样化样本选择。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet v2数据集上，标注预算极低（如0.02%）时，mIoU提升高达4%，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: LLMs作为知识先验在3D视觉中具有巨大潜力，层次化不确定性建模为高效点云标注提供了新范式。

Abstract: We present a novel active learning framework for 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation that, for the first time, integrates large language models (LLMs)
to construct hierarchical label structures and guide uncertainty-based sample
selection. Unlike prior methods that treat labels as flat and independent, our
approach leverages LLM prompting to automatically generate multi-level semantic
taxonomies and introduces a recursive uncertainty projection mechanism that
propagates uncertainty across hierarchy levels. This enables spatially diverse,
label-aware point selection that respects the inherent semantic structure of 3D
scenes. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet v2 show that our method achieves up to
4% mIoU improvement under extremely low annotation budgets (e.g., 0.02%),
substantially outperforming existing baselines. Our results highlight the
untapped potential of LLMs as knowledge priors in 3D vision and establish
hierarchical uncertainty modeling as a powerful paradigm for efficient point
cloud annotation.

Result: 在测试文档上，该方法比传统图像方法更准确，提供了一种高效且可扩展的文档配准解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了对高维图像数据的依赖，适用于文档处理应用，尤其在仅能获取OCR输出的场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Document alignment and registration play a crucial role in numerous
real-world applications, such as automated form processing, anomaly detection,
and workflow automation. Traditional methods for document alignment rely on
image-based features like keypoints, edges, and textures to estimate geometric
transformations, such as homographies. However, these approaches often require
access to the original document images, which may not always be available due
to privacy, storage, or transmission constraints. This paper introduces a novel
approach that leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) outputs as features
for homography estimation. By utilizing the spatial positions and textual
content of OCR-detected words, our method enables document alignment without
relying on pixel-level image data. This technique is particularly valuable in
scenarios where only OCR outputs are accessible. Furthermore, the method is
robust to OCR noise, incorporating RANSAC to handle outliers and inaccuracies
in the OCR data. On a set of test documents, we demonstrate that our OCR-based
approach even performs more accurately than traditional image-based methods,
offering a more efficient and scalable solution for document registration
tasks. The proposed method facilitates applications in document processing, all
while reducing reliance on high-dimensional image data.

Abstract: Early identification of weeds is essential for effective management and
control, and there is growing interest in automating the process using computer
vision techniques coupled with AI methods. However, challenges associated with
training AI-based weed identification models, such as limited expert-verified
data and complexity and variability in morphological features, have hindered
progress. To address these issues, we present WeedNet, the first global-scale
weed identification model capable of recognizing an extensive set of weed
species, including noxious and invasive plant species. WeedNet is an end-to-end
real-time weed identification pipeline and uses self-supervised learning,
fine-tuning, and enhanced trustworthiness strategies. WeedNet achieved 91.02%
accuracy across 1,593 weed species, with 41% species achieving 100% accuracy.
Using a fine-tuning strategy and a Global-to-Local approach, the local Iowa
WeedNet model achieved an overall accuracy of 97.38% for 85 Iowa weeds, most
classes exceeded a 90% mean accuracy per class. Testing across intra-species
dissimilarity (developmental stages) and inter-species similarity (look-alike
species) suggests that diversity in the images collected, spanning all the
growth stages and distinguishable plant characteristics, is crucial in driving
model performance. The generalizability and adaptability of the Global WeedNet
model enable it to function as a foundational model, with the Global-to-Local
strategy allowing fine-tuning for region-specific weed communities. Additional
validation of drone- and ground-rover-based images highlights the potential of
WeedNet for integration into robotic platforms. Furthermore, integration with
AI for conversational use provides intelligent agricultural and ecological
conservation consulting tools for farmers, agronomists, researchers, land
managers, and government agencies across diverse landscapes.

Motivation: 传统方法需要密集多视角相机和高计算资源，而选择性输入方法虽降低成本但牺牲质量。本文旨在高效实现高质量、视图和时间一致的合成。

Result: 实现了视图和时间一致的高质量视频合成，且能高效在线运行。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证质量的同时提升了效率，解决了多视角和时间一致性问题。

Abstract: We introduce a novel geometry-guided online video view synthesis method with
enhanced view and temporal consistency. Traditional approaches achieve
high-quality synthesis from dense multi-view camera setups but require
significant computational resources. In contrast, selective-input methods
reduce this cost but often compromise quality, leading to multi-view and
temporal inconsistencies such as flickering artifacts. Our method addresses
this challenge to deliver efficient, high-quality novel-view synthesis with
view and temporal consistency. The key innovation of our approach lies in using
global geometry to guide an image-based rendering pipeline. To accomplish this,
we progressively refine depth maps using color difference masks across time.
These depth maps are then accumulated through truncated signed distance fields
in the synthesized view's image space. This depth representation is view and
temporally consistent, and is used to guide a pre-trained blending network that
fuses multiple forward-rendered input-view images. Thus, the network is
encouraged to output geometrically consistent synthesis results across multiple
views and time. Our approach achieves consistent, high-quality video synthesis,
while running efficiently in an online manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代端到端自动驾驶系统的规划器缺乏时间一致性机制，导致早期预测错误随时间累积，影响安全性。

Method: 通过CFC循环机制，从BEV场景表示预测未来轨迹，并逆向映射回当前BEV状态，通过循环损失强制一致性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上表现优异，L2误差降低0.04米，碰撞率减少0.12%。

Conclusion: Echo Planning无需额外监督，通过CFC循环作为归纳偏置，为安全关键系统提供了可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems suffer from a critical
limitation: their planners lack mechanisms to enforce temporal consistency
between predicted trajectories and evolving scene dynamics. This absence of
self-supervision allows early prediction errors to compound catastrophically
over time. We introduce Echo Planning, a novel self-correcting framework that
establishes a closed-loop Current - Future - Current (CFC) cycle to harmonize
trajectory prediction with scene coherence. Our key insight is that plausible
future trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, ie, not only generated
from current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC
mechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
scene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate
the current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and
reconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework
intrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories.
Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing L2
error by 0.04 m and collision rate by 0.12% compared to one-shot planners.
Crucially, our method requires no additional supervision, leveraging the CFC
cycle as an inductive bias for robust planning. This work offers a deployable
solution for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Understanding and synthesizing realistic 3D hand-object interactions (HOI) is
critical for applications ranging from immersive AR/VR to dexterous robotics.
Existing methods struggle with generalization, performing well on closed-set
objects and predefined tasks but failing to handle unseen objects or
open-vocabulary instructions. We introduce OpenHOI, the first framework for
open-world HOI synthesis, capable of generating long-horizon manipulation
sequences for novel objects guided by free-form language commands. Our approach
integrates a 3D Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) fine-tuned for joint
affordance grounding and semantic task decomposition, enabling precise
localization of interaction regions (e.g., handles, buttons) and breakdown of
complex instructions (e.g., "Find a water bottle and take a sip") into
executable sub-tasks. To synthesize physically plausible interactions, we
propose an affordance-driven diffusion model paired with a training-free
physics refinement stage that minimizes penetration and optimizes affordance
alignment. Evaluations across diverse scenarios demonstrate OpenHOI's
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to novel object
categories, multi-stage tasks, and complex language instructions. Our project

Conclusion: IAL框架有效解决了多模态3D全景分割的挑战，代码开源。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D panoptic segmentation often struggles with the inherent
sparsity of data from LiDAR sensors, which makes it challenging to accurately
recognize distant or small objects. Recently, a few studies have sought to
overcome this challenge by integrating LiDAR inputs with camera images,
leveraging the rich and dense texture information provided by the latter. While
these approaches have shown promising results, they still face challenges, such
as misalignment during data augmentation and the reliance on post-processing
steps. To address these issues, we propose Image-Assists-LiDAR (IAL), a novel
multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation framework. In IAL, we first introduce a
modality-synchronized data augmentation strategy, PieAug, to ensure alignment
between LiDAR and image inputs from the start. Next, we adopt a transformer
decoder to directly predict panoptic segmentation results. To effectively fuse
LiDAR and image features into tokens for the decoder, we design a
Geometric-guided Token Fusion (GTF) module. Additionally, we leverage the
complementary strengths of each modality as priors for query initialization
through a Prior-based Query Generation (PQG) module, enhancing the decoder's
ability to generate accurate instance masks. Our IAL framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to previous multi-modal 3D panoptic
segmentation methods on two widely used benchmarks. Code and models are

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CDPDNet通过多模态融合和任务提示有效提升了分割精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Most publicly available medical segmentation datasets are only partially
labeled, with annotations provided for a subset of anatomical structures. When
multiple datasets are combined for training, this incomplete annotation poses
challenges, as it limits the model's ability to learn shared anatomical
representations among datasets. Furthermore, vision-only frameworks often fail
to capture complex anatomical relationships and task-specific distinctions,
leading to reduced segmentation accuracy and poor generalizability to unseen
datasets. In this study, we proposed a novel CLIP-DINO Prompt-Driven
Segmentation Network (CDPDNet), which combined a self-supervised vision
transformer with CLIP-based text embedding and introduced task-specific text
prompts to tackle these challenges. Specifically, the framework was constructed
upon a convolutional neural network (CNN) and incorporated DINOv2 to extract
both fine-grained and global visual features, which were then fused using a
multi-head cross-attention module to overcome the limited long-range modeling
capability of CNNs. In addition, CLIP-derived text embeddings were projected
into the visual space to help model complex relationships among organs and
tumors. To further address the partial label challenge and enhance inter-task
discriminative capability, a Text-based Task Prompt Generation (TTPG) module
that generated task-specific prompts was designed to guide the segmentation.
Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrated that
CDPDNet consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art segmentation
methods. Code and pretrained model are available at:

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as an effective strategy, significantly
reducing training costs and facilitating more efficient model deployment.
Recent advances have leveraged generative models to distill datasets by
capturing the underlying data distribution. Unfortunately, existing methods
require model fine-tuning with distillation losses to encourage diversity and
representativeness. However, these methods do not guarantee sample diversity,
limiting their performance. We propose a mode-guided diffusion model leveraging
a pre-trained diffusion model without the need to fine-tune with distillation
losses. Our approach addresses dataset diversity in three stages: Mode
Discovery to identify distinct data modes, Mode Guidance to enhance intra-class
diversity, and Stop Guidance to mitigate artifacts in synthetic samples that
affect performance. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving accuracy gains of 4.4%, 2.9%, 1.6%, and 1.6% on ImageNette, ImageIDC,
ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K, respectively. Our method eliminates the need for
fine-tuning diffusion models with distillation losses, significantly reducing

Abstract: Current perception models have achieved remarkable success by leveraging
large-scale labeled datasets, but still face challenges in open-world
environments with novel objects. To address this limitation, researchers
introduce open-set perception models to detect or segment arbitrary test-time
user-input categories. However, open-set models rely on human involvement to
provide predefined object categories as input during inference. More recently,
researchers have framed a more realistic and challenging task known as
open-ended perception that aims to discover unseen objects without requiring
any category-level input from humans at inference time. Nevertheless,
open-ended models suffer from low performance compared to open-set models. In
this paper, we present VL-SAM-V2, an open-world object detection framework that
is capable of discovering unseen objects while achieving favorable performance.
To achieve this, we combine queries from open-set and open-ended models and
propose a general and specific query fusion module to allow different queries
to interact. By adjusting queries from open-set models, we enable VL-SAM-V2 to
be evaluated in the open-set or open-ended mode. In addition, to learn more
diverse queries, we introduce ranked learnable queries to match queries with
proposals from open-ended models by sorting. Moreover, we design a denoising
point training strategy to facilitate the training process. Experimental
results on LVIS show that our method surpasses the previous open-set and
open-ended methods, especially on rare objects.

*Catalina Tan,Yipeng Hu,Shaheer U. Saeed*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种名为SPARS的弱监督语义分割框架，利用少量图像级二元标签实现肿瘤定位，性能接近全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肿瘤分割对癌症诊疗至关重要，但全监督模型需要大量标注且标注主观性强，而病理标签难以获取。

Method: SPARS框架通过自博弈对抗强化学习，利用图像级二元标签训练分类器定位肿瘤区域。

Result: 在真实患者数据上，SPARS的平均Dice分数为77.3±9.4，优于其他弱监督方法，接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: SPARS减少了对人标注的依赖，展示了在真实医疗场景中应用的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate tumour segmentation is vital for various targeted diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures for cancer, e.g., planning biopsies or tumour ablations.
Manual delineation is extremely labour-intensive, requiring substantial expert
time. Fully-supervised machine learning models aim to automate such
localisation tasks, but require a large number of costly and often subjective
3D voxel-level labels for training. The high-variance and subjectivity in such
labels impacts model generalisability, even when large datasets are available.
Histopathology labels may offer more objective labels but the infeasibility of
acquiring pixel-level annotations to develop tumour localisation methods based
on histology remains challenging in-vivo. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised semantic segmentation framework called SPARS (Self-Play
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Segmentation), which utilises an object
presence classifier, trained on a small number of image-level binary cancer
presence labels, to localise cancerous regions on CT scans. Such binary labels
of patient-level cancer presence can be sourced more feasibly from biopsies and
histopathology reports, enabling a more objective cancer localisation on
medical images. Evaluating with real patient data, we observed that SPARS
yielded a mean dice score of $77.3 \pm 9.4$, which outperformed other
weakly-supervised methods by large margins. This performance was comparable
with recent fully-supervised methods that require voxel-level annotations. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using SPARS to reduce the need for
extensive human-annotated labels to detect cancer in real-world healthcare
settings.

### [818] [Kernel Space Diffusion Model for Efficient Remote Sensing Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18991)
*Hancong Jin,Zihan Cao,Liangjian Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出KSDiff模型，利用潜在空间扩散过程生成卷积核，提升全色锐化质量并加快推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法未能捕捉遥感数据的全局先验，扩散模型虽有效但推理延迟高。

Method: KSDiff通过低秩核心张量生成器和统一因子生成器构建卷积核，结合结构感知多头注意力机制。

Result: 在WorldView-3、GaoFen-2和QuickBird数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: KSDiff是一种高效的全色锐化框架，可提升现有架构性能。

Abstract: Pansharpening is a fundamental task in remote sensing that integrates
high-resolution panchromatic imagery (PAN) with low-resolution multispectral
imagery (LRMS) to produce an enhanced image with both high spatial and spectral
resolution. Despite significant progress in deep learning-based approaches,
existing methods often fail to capture the global priors inherent in remote
sensing data distributions. Diffusion-based models have recently emerged as
promising solutions due to their powerful distribution mapping capabilities;
however, they suffer from significant inference latency, which limits their
practical applicability. In this work, we propose the Kernel Space Diffusion
Model (KSDiff), a novel approach that leverages diffusion processes in a latent
space to generate convolutional kernels enriched with global contextual
information, thereby improving pansharpening quality while enabling faster
inference. Specifically, KSDiff constructs these kernels through the
integration of a low-rank core tensor generator and a unified factor generator,
orchestrated by a structure-aware multi-head attention mechanism. We further
introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for pansharpening, enabling
KSDiff to serve as a framework for enhancing existing pansharpening
architectures. Experiments on three widely used datasets, including
WorldView-3, GaoFen-2, and QuickBird, demonstrate the superior performance of
KSDiff both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code will be released upon
possible acceptance.

Conclusion: VPGS-SLAM能够扩展到任意场景，提高鲁棒性，并实现全局一致性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently shown promising results in dense visual
SLAM. However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM methods are all constrained to
small-room scenarios and struggle with memory explosion in large-scale scenes
and long sequences. To this end, we propose VPGS-SLAM, the first 3DGS-based
large-scale RGBD SLAM framework for both indoor and outdoor scenarios. We
design a novel voxel-based progressive 3D Gaussian mapping method with multiple
submaps for compact and accurate scene representation in large-scale and
long-sequence scenes. This allows us to scale up to arbitrary scenes and
improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In addition, we propose a 2D-3D
fusion camera tracking method to achieve robust and accurate camera tracking in
both indoor and outdoor large-scale scenes. Furthermore, we design a 2D-3D
Gaussian loop closure method to eliminate pose drift. We further propose a
submap fusion method with online distillation to achieve global consistency in
large-scale scenes when detecting a loop. Experiments on various indoor and
outdoor datasets demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the
proposed framework. The code will be open source on
https://github.com/dtc111111/vpgs-slam.

Result: 在MIMIC和SemEval Memotion 1.0数据集上实现了跨模态对齐的显著改进和最优性能。

Conclusion: 该模型在多模态应用中具有广泛潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has become a critical research area because integrating
text and image data can significantly improve performance in tasks such as
classification, retrieval, and scene understanding. However, despite progress
with pre-trained models, current approaches are limited by inadequate
cross-modal interactions and static fusion strategies that do not fully exploit
the complementary nature of different modalities. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a novel multi-modal Co-AttenDWG architecture that
leverages dual-path encoding, co-attention with dimension-wise gating, and
advanced expert fusion. Our approach begins by projecting text and image
features into a common embedding space, where a dedicated co-attention
mechanism enables simultaneous, fine-grained interactions between modalities.
This mechanism is further enhanced by a dimension-wise gating network that
adaptively regulates the feature contributions at the channel level, ensuring
that only the most relevant information is emphasized. In parallel, dual-path
encoders refine the representations by processing cross-modal information
separately before an additional cross-attention layer further aligns
modalities. The refined features are then aggregated via an expert fusion
module that combines learned gating and self-attention to produce a robust,
unified representation. We validate our approach on the MIMIC and SemEval
Memotion 1.0, where experimental results demonstrate significant improvements
in cross-modal alignment and state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the
potential of our model for a wide range of multi-modal applications.

Motivation: 当前基准存在依赖边界框、忽视视角替换或仅依赖模型先验知识等问题，限制了多模态大语言模型对客观世界的理解。

Method: 设计了一个精心设计的标注流程，构建了包含5,392个样本的SpatialMQA基准，并测试了一系列开源和闭源MLLMs。

Result: 当前最先进的MLLM准确率仅为48.14%，远低于人类水平的98.40%。

Conclusion: SpatialMQA为未来研究提供了方向，基准和代码已开源。

Abstract: Spatial relation reasoning is a crucial task for multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) to understand the objective world. However, current benchmarks
have issues like relying on bounding boxes, ignoring perspective substitutions,
or allowing questions to be answered using only the model's prior knowledge
without image understanding. To address these issues, we introduce SpatialMQA,
a human-annotated spatial relation reasoning benchmark based on COCO2017, which
enables MLLMs to focus more on understanding images in the objective world. To
ensure data quality, we design a well-tailored annotation procedure, resulting
in SpatialMQA consisting of 5,392 samples. Based on this benchmark, a series of
closed- and open-source MLLMs are implemented and the results indicate that the
current state-of-the-art MLLM achieves only 48.14% accuracy, far below the
human-level accuracy of 98.40%. Extensive experimental analyses are also
conducted, suggesting the future research directions. The benchmark and codes
are available at https://github.com/ziyan-xiaoyu/SpatialMQA.git.

TLDR: 论文重新思考了视频异常检测（VAD）的评估方法，提出三种新方法解决现有评估指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VAD评估方法存在单标注偏差、无法奖励早期检测和缺乏场景过拟合评估能力的问题。

Method: 提出多轮标注的平均AUC/AP指标、延迟感知平均精度（LaAP）和两个硬正常基准（UCF-HN、MSAD-HN）。

Result: 对十种先进VAD方法进行性能比较，为未来模型开发提供新视角。

Conclusion: 新评估方法解决了现有局限性，为VAD研究提供了更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate
from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing
advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training
strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and
benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through
comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in
current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single
annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of
anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene
overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation
methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round
annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a
Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate
anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks
(UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene
overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD
approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives
for future VAD model development.

Abstract: Monkeypox is a viral disease characterized by distinctive skin lesions and
has been reported in many countries. The recent global outbreak has emphasized
the urgent need for scalable, accessible, and accurate diagnostic solutions to
support public health responses.
  In this study, we developed ITMAINN, an intelligent, AI-driven healthcare
system specifically designed to detect Monkeypox from skin lesion images using
advanced deep learning techniques. Our system consists of three main
components. First, we trained and evaluated several pretrained models using
transfer learning on publicly available skin lesion datasets to identify the
most effective models. For binary classification (Monkeypox vs. non-Monkeypox),
the Vision Transformer, MobileViT, Transformer-in-Transformer, and VGG16
achieved the highest performance, each with an accuracy and F1-score of 97.8%.
For multiclass classification, which contains images of patients with Monkeypox
and five other classes (chickenpox, measles, hand-foot-mouth disease, cowpox,
and healthy), ResNetViT and ViT Hybrid models achieved 92% accuracy, with F1
scores of 92.24% and 92.19%, respectively. The best-performing and most
lightweight model, MobileViT, was deployed within the mobile application. The
second component is a cross-platform smartphone application that enables users
to detect Monkeypox through image analysis, track symptoms, and receive
recommendations for nearby healthcare centers based on their location. The
third component is a real-time monitoring dashboard designed for health
authorities to support them in tracking cases, analyzing symptom trends,
guiding public health interventions, and taking proactive measures.
  This system is fundamental in developing responsive healthcare infrastructure
within smart cities. Our solution, ITMAINN, is part of revolutionizing public
health management.

Motivation: 现有视觉问答基准无法充分评估MLLMs在信息图表理解上的能力，尤其是视觉元素和隐喻相关的问题。

Method: 引入InfoChartQA基准，包含成对的信息图表和普通图表，设计视觉元素相关的问题。

Result: 评估20个MLLMs显示其在信息图表上的表现显著下降，尤其是隐喻相关的视觉元素问题。

Conclusion: InfoChartQA为MLLMs在信息图表理解上的改进提供了新机会，并开放了数据集。

Abstract: Understanding infographic charts with design-driven visual elements (e.g.,
pictograms, icons) requires both visual recognition and reasoning, posing
challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing
visual-question answering benchmarks fall short in evaluating these
capabilities of MLLMs due to the lack of paired plain charts and
visual-element-based questions. To bridge this gap, we introduce InfoChartQA, a
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on infographic chart understanding. It includes
5,642 pairs of infographic and plain charts, each sharing the same underlying
data but differing in visual presentations. We further design
visual-element-based questions to capture their unique visual designs and
communicative intent. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs reveals a substantial performance
decline on infographic charts, particularly for visual-element-based questions
related to metaphors. The paired infographic and plain charts enable
fine-grained error analysis and ablation studies, which highlight new
opportunities for advancing MLLMs in infographic chart understanding. We
release InfoChartQA at https://github.com/CoolDawnAnt/InfoChartQA.

Motivation: 当前医学LVLM在多图像任务（如时间推理和跨模态分析）中表现不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 通过构建包含83.2K多图像问答对的Med-MIM数据集，并微调Mantis和LLaVA-Med模型，得到MIM-LLaVA-Med和Med-Mantis。

Result: 实验表明，MIM-LLaVA-Med和Med-Mantis在Med-MIM基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Med-MIM数据集有效提升了LVLM在医学多图像任务中的能力。

Abstract: Medical large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising
performance across various single-image question answering (QA) benchmarks, yet
their capability in processing multi-image clinical scenarios remains
underexplored. Unlike single image based tasks, medical tasks involving
multiple images often demand sophisticated visual understanding capabilities,
such as temporal reasoning and cross-modal analysis, which are poorly supported
by current medical LVLMs. To bridge this critical gap, we present the Med-MIM
instruction dataset, comprising 83.2K medical multi-image QA pairs that span
four types of multi-image visual abilities (temporal understanding, reasoning,
comparison, co-reference). Using this dataset, we fine-tune Mantis and
LLaVA-Med, resulting in two specialized medical VLMs: MIM-LLaVA-Med and
Med-Mantis, both optimized for multi-image analysis. Additionally, we develop
the Med-MIM benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the medical multi-image
understanding capabilities of LVLMs. We assess eight popular LVLMs, including
our two models, on the Med-MIM benchmark. Experimental results show that both
Med-Mantis and MIM-LLaVA-Med achieve superior performance on the held-in and
held-out subsets of the Med-MIM benchmark, demonstrating that the Med-MIM
instruction dataset effectively enhances LVLMs' multi-image understanding
capabilities in the medical domain.

Abstract: In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the learning of 3D
human representation. However, the complexity of lots of hand-defined human
body constraints and the absence of supervision data limit that the existing
works controllably and accurately represent the human body in views of
semantics and representation ability. In this paper, we propose a human body
representation with controllable fine-grained semantics and high precison of
reconstruction in an unsupervised learning framework. In particularly, we
design a whole-aware skeleton-grouped disentangle strategy to learn a
correspondence between geometric semantical measurement of body and latent
codes, which facilitates the control of shape and posture of human body by
modifying latent coding paramerers. With the help of skeleton-grouped
whole-aware encoder and unsupervised disentanglement losses, our representation
model is learned by an unsupervised manner. Besides, a based-template residual
learning scheme is injected into the encoder to ease of learning human body
latent parameter in complicated body shape and pose spaces. Because of the
geometrically meaningful latent codes, it can be used in a wide range of
applications, from human body pose transfer to bilinear latent code
interpolation. Further more, a part-aware decoder is utlized to promote the
learning of controllable fine-grained semantics. The experimental results on
public 3D human datasets show that the method has the ability of precise
reconstruction.

Result: 在ModelNet40和ShapeNetPart数据集上，多头部架构在CD、HD、EMD和F1-score等指标上优于单头部基线。

Conclusion: 点云重建中，输出多样性和架构设计比单纯增加深度更关键。

Abstract: We challenge the common assumption that deeper decoder architectures always
yield better performance in point cloud reconstruction. Our analysis reveals
that, beyond a certain depth, increasing decoder complexity leads to
overfitting and degraded generalization. Additionally, we propose a novel
multi-head decoder architecture that exploits the inherent redundancy in point
clouds by reconstructing complete shapes from multiple independent heads, each
operating on a distinct subset of points. The final output is obtained by
concatenating the predictions from all heads, enhancing both diversity and
fidelity. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart demonstrate that
our approach achieves consistent improvements across key metrics--including
Chamfer Distance (CD), Hausdorff Distance (HD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD),
and F1-score--outperforming standard single-head baselines. Our findings
highlight that output diversity and architectural design can be more critical
than depth alone for effective and efficient point cloud reconstruction.

Abstract: Although diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities,
existing methods for stylized image generation based on these models often
require textual inversion or fine-tuning with style images, which is
time-consuming and limits the practical applicability of large-scale diffusion
models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel stylized image
generation method leveraging a pre-trained large-scale diffusion model without
requiring fine-tuning or any additional optimization, termed as OmniPainter.
Specifically, we exploit the self-consistency property of latent consistency
models to extract the representative style statistics from reference style
images to guide the stylization process. Additionally, we then introduce the
norm mixture of self-attention, which enables the model to query the most
relevant style patterns from these statistics for the intermediate output
content features. This mechanism also ensures that the stylized results align
closely with the distribution of the reference style images. Our qualitative
and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏宏摄影图像质量评估（MPIQA）数据，限制了MPIQA指标的发展，而准确的MPIQA指标对科学研究和医疗应用等领域至关重要。

Method: 从三个公共图像网站收集15,700张宏摄影图像，筛选出2,000张，通过实验室研究获取每张图像的17个质量评分及详细的失真报告。

Result: 构建了MMP-2k数据库，实验表明现有通用IQA指标在宏摄影图像上表现不佳。

Conclusion: MMP-2k数据库为宏摄影图像质量评估提供了重要资源，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Macro photography (MP) is a specialized field of photography that captures
objects at an extremely close range, revealing tiny details. Although an
accurate macro photography image quality assessment (MPIQA) metric can benefit
macro photograph capturing, which is vital in some domains such as scientific
research and medical applications, the lack of MPIQA data limits the
development of MPIQA metrics. To address this limitation, we conducted a
large-scale MPIQA study. Specifically, to ensure diversity both in content and
quality, we sampled 2,000 MP images from 15,700 MP images, collected from three
public image websites. For each MP image, 17 (out of 21 after outlier removal)
quality ratings and a detailed quality report of distortion magnitudes, types,
and positions are gathered by a lab study. The images, quality ratings, and
quality reports form our novel multi-labeled MPIQA database, MMP-2k.
Experimental results showed that the state-of-the-art generic IQA metrics
underperform on MP images. The database and supplementary materials are

*Muye Huang,Lingling Zhang,Jie Ma,Han Lai,Fangzhi Xu,Yifei Li,Wenjun Wu,Yaqiang Wu,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: ChartSketcher是一种多模态反馈驱动的逐步推理方法，通过视觉标注改进图表理解，解决了现有模型在视觉推理中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逐步推理模型在图表理解中因缺乏多模态交互能力而难以纠正视觉理解错误，因此需要一种更接近人类认知的方法。

Method: 提出ChartSketcher，利用Sketch-CoT在图表上标注中间推理步骤，并通过两阶段训练（冷启动和强化学习）优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，ChartSketcher在图表理解和通用视觉任务上表现优异，提供了一种交互性强且可解释的方法。

Conclusion: ChartSketcher通过多模态反馈和逐步推理，显著提升了图表理解的准确性和交互性。

Abstract: Charts are high-density visualization carriers for complex data, serving as a
crucial medium for information extraction and analysis. Automated chart
understanding poses significant challenges to existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) due to the need for precise and complex visual
reasoning. Current step-by-step reasoning models primarily focus on text-based
logical reasoning for chart understanding. However, they struggle to refine or
correct their reasoning when errors stem from flawed visual understanding, as
they lack the ability to leverage multimodal interaction for deeper
comprehension. Inspired by human cognitive behavior, we propose ChartSketcher,
a multimodal feedback-driven step-by-step reasoning method designed to address
these limitations. ChartSketcher is a chart understanding model that employs
Sketch-CoT, enabling MLLMs to annotate intermediate reasoning steps directly
onto charts using a programmatic sketching library, iteratively feeding these
visual annotations back into the reasoning process. This mechanism enables the
model to visually ground its reasoning and refine its understanding over
multiple steps. We employ a two-stage training strategy: a cold start phase to
learn sketch-based reasoning patterns, followed by off-policy reinforcement
learning to enhance reflection and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that
ChartSketcher achieves promising performance on chart understanding benchmarks
and general vision tasks, providing an interactive and interpretable approach
to chart comprehension.

*Ruiyang Xia,Dawei Zhou,Decheng Liu,Lin Yuan,Jie Li,Nannan Wang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种主动嵌入水印的方法（CMark）来检测人脸交换，无需预先存储大规模信息或依赖特定交换技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI生成内容的进步，真实与交换人脸的差异变得细微，传统检测方法难以应对。因此，转向主动防御，通过水印技术应对未知交换技术。

Method: 专注于人脸周围区域，嵌入轮廓纹理和身份信息的水印（CMark），实现渐进式图像判定。

Result: 在8种人脸交换技术上的实验表明，该方法优于现有被动和主动检测器，并在图像质量与水印鲁棒性间取得平衡。

Conclusion: CMark是一种通用且高效的人脸交换检测方法，适用于未知技术场景。

Abstract: Face swapping, recognized as a privacy and security concern, has prompted
considerable defensive research. With the advancements in AI-generated content,
the discrepancies between the real and swapped faces have become nuanced.
Considering the difficulty of forged traces detection, we shift the focus to
the face swapping purpose and proactively embed elaborate watermarks against
unknown face swapping techniques. Given that the constant purpose is to swap
the original face identity while preserving the background, we concentrate on
the regions surrounding the face to ensure robust watermark generation, while
embedding the contour texture and face identity information to achieve
progressive image determination. The watermark is located in the facial contour
and contains hybrid messages, dubbed the contour-hybrid watermark (CMark). Our
approach generalizes face swapping detection without requiring any swapping
techniques during training and the storage of large-scale messages in advance.
Experiments conducted across 8 face swapping techniques demonstrate the
superiority of our approach compared with state-of-the-art passive and
proactive detectors while achieving a favorable balance between the image
quality and watermark robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: Jodi是一个基于扩散模型的框架，统一了视觉生成和理解任务，通过联合建模图像和多个标签域，支持联合生成、可控生成和图像感知任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视觉生成和理解视为独立任务，而Jodi旨在通过统一框架解决这一问题。

Method: Jodi采用线性扩散变换器和角色切换机制，支持三种任务类型：联合生成、可控生成和图像感知。

Result: 实验表明，Jodi在生成和理解任务中表现优异，并具有扩展到更广泛视觉领域的能力。

Conclusion: Jodi为视觉生成和理解提供了统一的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual generation and understanding are two deeply interconnected aspects of
human intelligence, yet they have been traditionally treated as separate tasks
in machine learning. In this paper, we propose Jodi, a diffusion framework that
unifies visual generation and understanding by jointly modeling the image
domain and multiple label domains. Specifically, Jodi is built upon a linear
diffusion transformer along with a role switch mechanism, which enables it to
perform three particular types of tasks: (1) joint generation, where the model
simultaneously generates images and multiple labels; (2) controllable
generation, where images are generated conditioned on any combination of
labels; and (3) image perception, where multiple labels can be predicted at
once from a given image. Furthermore, we present the Joint-1.6M dataset, which
contains 200,000 high-quality images collected from public sources, automatic
labels for 7 visual domains, and LLM-generated captions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Jodi excels in both generation and understanding tasks and
exhibits strong extensibility to a wider range of visual domains. Code is

*Xuejie Liu,Anji Liu,Guy Van den Broeck,Yitao Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: ReCAP模块通过重用上下文特征嵌入加速掩码生成模型的推理，减少计算成本同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码生成模型（MGMs）生成高质量样本需要多次迭代解码，导致高推理成本。直接加速方法（如同时解码更多标记）会牺牲生成保真度。

Method: 提出ReCAP模块，通过重用已解码上下文标记的特征嵌入，构建低成本步骤，交替使用标准全评估和轻量级步骤。

Result: 在ImageNet256类条件生成任务中，ReCAP实现2.4倍加速，性能下降极小，并在多种生成设置下提供更好的效率-保真度权衡。

Conclusion: ReCAP是一种即插即用模块，显著提升MGMs的推理效率，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Masked generative models (MGMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for
image synthesis, combining parallel decoding with strong bidirectional context
modeling. However, generating high-quality samples typically requires many
iterative decoding steps, resulting in high inference costs. A straightforward
way to speed up generation is by decoding more tokens in each step, thereby
reducing the total number of steps. However, when many tokens are decoded
simultaneously, the model can only estimate the univariate marginal
distributions independently, failing to capture the dependency among them. As a
result, reducing the number of steps significantly compromises generation
fidelity. In this work, we introduce ReCAP (Reused Context-Aware Prediction), a
plug-and-play module that accelerates inference in MGMs by constructing
low-cost steps via reusing feature embeddings from previously decoded context
tokens. ReCAP interleaves standard full evaluations with lightweight steps that
cache and reuse context features, substantially reducing computation while
preserving the benefits of fine-grained, iterative generation. We demonstrate
its effectiveness on top of three representative MGMs (MaskGIT, MAGE, and MAR),
including both discrete and continuous token spaces and covering diverse
architectural designs. In particular, on ImageNet256 class-conditional
generation, ReCAP achieves up to 2.4x faster inference than the base model with
minimal performance drop, and consistently delivers better efficiency-fidelity
trade-offs under various generation settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: SATORI提出了一种多阶段可验证的VQA方法，解决了传统自由推理在视觉任务中的局限性，显著提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态任务与文本任务本质不同，传统自由推理在VQA任务中存在视觉焦点分散和计算成本高的问题。

Method: SATORI将VQA分解为三个可验证阶段：全局图像描述、区域定位和答案预测，并引入VQA-Verify数据集。

Result: 在七个VQA基准测试中，准确性提升高达15.7%，注意力图显示对关键区域的聚焦增强。

Conclusion: SATORI通过多阶段可验证方法显著提升了VQA任务的性能，解决了自由推理的局限性。

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated powerful reasoning capabilities in the text
domain through stable reinforcement learning (RL). Recently, in the multimodal
domain, works have begun to directly apply RL to generate R1-like free-form
reasoning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. However, multimodal tasks
share an intrinsically different nature from textual tasks, which heavily rely
on the understanding of the input image to solve the problem. Therefore, such
free-form reasoning faces two critical limitations in the VQA task: (1)
Extended reasoning chains diffuse visual focus away from task-critical regions,
degrading answer accuracy. (2) Unverifiable intermediate steps amplify
policy-gradient variance and computational costs overhead. To address these
issues, in this paper, we introduce SATORI ($\textbf{S}patially$
$\textbf{A}nchored$ $\textbf{T}ask$ $\textbf{O}ptimization$ with
$\textbf{R}e\textbf{I}nforcement$ Learning), which decomposes VQA into three
verifiable stages, including global image captioning, region localization, and
answer prediction, each supplying explicit reward signals. Furthermore, we also
introduce VQA-Verify, a 12k dataset annotated with answer-aligned captions and
bounding-boxes to facilitate training. Experiments demonstrate consistent
performance improvements across seven VQA benchmarks, achieving up to $15.7\%$
improvement in accuracy in accuracy compared to the R1-like baseline. Our
analysis of the attention map confirms enhanced focus on critical regions,
which brings improvements in accuracy. Our code is available at

Result: 在性别分类任务中，F1分数比1D Group DNN基线提高了15.74%，且比3D表示具有更好的解耦性。

Conclusion: 该方法为DTI纤维束成像提供了更有效的表示和解释方式。

Abstract: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography offers detailed insights into the
structural connectivity of the brain, but presents challenges in effective
representation and interpretation in deep learning models. In this work, we
propose a novel 2D representation of DTI tractography that encodes tract-level
fractional anisotropy (FA) values into a 9x9 grayscale image. This
representation is processed through a Beta-Total Correlation Variational
Autoencoder with a Spatial Broadcast Decoder to learn a disentangled and
interpretable latent embedding. We evaluate the quality of this embedding using
supervised and unsupervised representation learning strategies, including
auxiliary classification, triplet loss, and SimCLR-based contrastive learning.
Compared to the 1D Group deep neural network (DNN) baselines, our approach
improves the F1 score in a downstream sex classification task by 15.74% and
shows a better disentanglement than the 3D representation.

Motivation: 解决现有遥感图像分类模型参数过多，难以部署在资源受限设备上的问题。

Method: 采用G-GhostNet作为主干网络，结合特征重用减少冗余参数，并使用解耦知识蒸馏策略提升分类精度。

Result: 在RSOD和AID数据集上，与VGG-16相比，参数减少6.24倍，Top-1准确率接近。

Conclusion: 该方法在模型大小和分类性能间取得良好平衡，适合资源受限设备部署。

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the large number of parameters in existing
remote sensing image classification models, which hinder deployment on
resource-constrained devices, this paper proposes a lightweight classification
method based on knowledge distillation. Specifically, G-GhostNet is adopted as
the backbone network, leveraging feature reuse to reduce redundant parameters
and significantly improve inference efficiency. In addition, a decoupled
knowledge distillation strategy is employed, which separates target and
non-target classes to effectively enhance classification accuracy. Experimental
results on the RSOD and AID datasets demonstrate that, compared with the
high-parameter VGG-16 model, the proposed method achieves nearly equivalent
Top-1 accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by 6.24 times. This
approach strikes an excellent balance between model size and classification
performance, offering an efficient solution for deployment on resource-limited
devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多条件控制（如图像、布局、文本）上缺乏细粒度控制，导致设计意图难以准确实现。

Result: 实验表明，CreatiDesign在多条件控制上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CreatiDesign为自动化图形设计提供了更灵活、精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Graphic design plays a vital role in visual communication across advertising,
marketing, and multimedia entertainment. Prior work has explored automated
graphic design generation using diffusion models, aiming to streamline creative
workflows and democratize design capabilities. However, complex graphic design
scenarios require accurately adhering to design intent specified by multiple
heterogeneous user-provided elements (\eg images, layouts, and texts), which
pose multi-condition control challenges for existing methods. Specifically,
previous single-condition control models demonstrate effectiveness only within
their specialized domains but fail to generalize to other conditions, while
existing multi-condition methods often lack fine-grained control over each
sub-condition and compromise overall compositional harmony. To address these
limitations, we introduce CreatiDesign, a systematic solution for automated
graphic design covering both model architecture and dataset construction.
First, we design a unified multi-condition driven architecture that enables
flexible and precise integration of heterogeneous design elements with minimal
architectural modifications to the base diffusion model. Furthermore, to ensure
that each condition precisely controls its designated image region and to avoid
interference between conditions, we propose a multimodal attention mask
mechanism. Additionally, we develop a fully automated pipeline for constructing
graphic design datasets, and introduce a new dataset with 400K samples
featuring multi-condition annotations, along with a comprehensive benchmark.
Experimental results show that CreatiDesign outperforms existing models by a
clear margin in faithfully adhering to user intent.

Motivation: 现有方法难以有效分离摩尔纹中的纹理破坏和颜色失真，而基于小波的频率感知方法潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 提出Freqformer框架，通过频率分解将摩尔纹分为高频纹理和低频颜色失真，采用双分支结构和频率合成变换模块（FCT）进行自适应融合，并引入空间感知通道注意力（SA-CA）模块优化处理。

Result: 在多个去摩尔纹基准测试中，Freqformer以紧凑的模型尺寸实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Freqformer通过频率分离和自适应融合，显著提升了去摩尔纹的效果，代码已开源。

Abstract: Image demoir\'eing remains a challenging task due to the complex interplay
between texture corruption and color distortions caused by moir\'e patterns.
Existing methods, especially those relying on direct image-to-image
restoration, often fail to disentangle these intertwined artifacts effectively.
While wavelet-based frequency-aware approaches offer a promising direction,
their potential remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Freqformer, a
Transformer-based framework specifically designed for image demoir\'eing
through targeted frequency separation. Our method performs an effective
frequency decomposition that explicitly splits moir\'e patterns into
high-frequency spatially-localized textures and low-frequency scale-robust
color distortions, which are then handled by a dual-branch architecture
tailored to their distinct characteristics. We further propose a learnable
Frequency Composition Transform (FCT) module to adaptively fuse the
frequency-specific outputs, enabling consistent and high-fidelity
reconstruction. To better aggregate the spatial dependencies and the
inter-channel complementary information, we introduce a Spatial-Aware Channel
Attention (SA-CA) module that refines moir\'e-sensitive regions without
incurring high computational cost. Extensive experiments on various
demoir\'eing benchmarks demonstrate that Freqformer achieves state-of-the-art
performance with a compact model size. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 研究幅度保持设计是否适用于DiT架构，以解决高方差梯度估计导致的训练不稳定问题。

Result: 幅度保持策略显著提升性能，FID分数降低12.8%；旋转调制结合缩放与AdaLN竞争，参数减少5.4%。

Conclusion: 幅度控制和旋转调制为扩散模型训练提供了有效策略，代码将公开。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, but
remain challenging to train due to their inherent stochasticity, where
high-variance gradient estimates lead to slow convergence. Previous works have
shown that magnitude preservation helps with stabilizing training in the U-net
architecture. This work explores whether this effect extends to the Diffusion
Transformer (DiT) architecture. As such, we propose a magnitude-preserving
design that stabilizes training without normalization layers. Motivated by the
goal of maintaining activation magnitudes, we additionally introduce rotation
modulation, which is a novel conditioning method using learned rotations
instead of traditional scaling or shifting. Through empirical evaluations and
ablation studies on small-scale models, we show that magnitude-preserving
strategies significantly improve performance, notably reducing FID scores by
$\sim$12.8%. Further, we show that rotation modulation combined with scaling is
competitive with AdaLN, while requiring $\sim$5.4% fewer parameters. This work
provides insights into conditioning strategies and magnitude control. We will
publicly release the implementation of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频-语言基准测试无法有效评估LMMs的时间事件理解能力，因为它们可以通过图像-语言模型解决。

Method: 设计了RTime-QA（822个高质量视频-文本问题）和RTime-IT（14k指令调优数据集），并进行了实验验证。

Result: Qwen2-VL在RTime-QA上的表现仅为34.6（严格准确率），远低于人类水平；通过RTime-IT微调后提升至65.9。

Conclusion: RTime-QA和RTime-IT为LMMs的时间事件理解提供了有效评估和提升工具。

Abstract: Understanding accurate atomic temporal event is essential for video
comprehension. However, current video-language benchmarks often fall short to
evaluate Large Multi-modal Models' (LMMs) temporal event understanding
capabilities, as they can be effectively addressed using image-language models.
In this paper, we introduce RTime-QA, a novel benchmark specifically designed
to assess the atomic temporal event understanding ability of LMMs. RTime-QA
comprises 822 high-quality, carefully-curated video-text questions, each
meticulously annotated by human experts. Each question features a video
depicting an atomic temporal event, paired with both correct answers and
temporal negative descriptions, specifically designed to evaluate temporal
understanding. To advance LMMs' temporal event understanding ability, we
further introduce RTime-IT, a 14k instruction-tuning dataset that employs a
similar annotation process as RTime-QA. Extensive experimental analysis
demonstrates that RTime-QA presents a significant challenge for LMMs: the
state-of-the-art model Qwen2-VL achieves only 34.6 on strict-ACC metric,
substantially lagging behind human performance. Furthermore, our experiments
reveal that RTime-IT effectively enhance LMMs' capacity in temporal
understanding. By fine-tuning on RTime-IT, our Qwen2-VL achieves 65.9 on
RTime-QA.

Motivation: 热红外图像在新视角合成中因传输效应、发射率和低分辨率导致渲染图像出现浮游物和模糊效果，需要一种更精确的方法来捕捉热变化并保持鲁棒性。

Method: 设计了视图依赖变形场（利用相机位置和视角方向捕捉热变化）和热特征提取器（TFE），结合MonoSSIM损失函数（考虑外观、边缘和频率）以保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Veta-GS通过创新的变形场和特征提取器，有效解决了热红外图像渲染中的问题，提升了新视角合成的质量。

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based on Thermal Infrared (TIR)
imaging has gained attention in novel-view synthesis, showing real-time
rendering. However, novel-view synthesis with thermal infrared images suffers
from transmission effects, emissivity, and low resolution, leading to floaters
and blur effects in rendered images. To address these problems, we introduce
Veta-GS, which leverages a view-dependent deformation field and a Thermal
Feature Extractor (TFE) to precisely capture subtle thermal variations and
maintain robustness. Specifically, we design view-dependent deformation field
that leverages camera position and viewing direction, which capture thermal
variations. Furthermore, we introduce the Thermal Feature Extractor (TFE) and
MonoSSIM loss, which consider appearance, edge, and frequency to maintain
robustness. Extensive experiments on the TI-NSD benchmark show that our method
achieves better performance over existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代应用可轻易访问用户相册，而VLM能从多张个人图像中推断敏感或抽象属性，但缺乏相关数据集和模型能力限制了研究。

Method: 构建PAPI数据集，提出HolmesEye框架，结合VLM和LLM增强隐私推断能力。

Result: HolmesEye在平均准确率上优于现有基线10.8%，在抽象属性预测上超越人类水平15.0%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了图像隐私分析的紧迫性，并提供了数据集和框架以推动未来研究。

Abstract: Our research reveals a new privacy risk associated with the vision-language
model (VLM) agentic framework: the ability to infer sensitive attributes (e.g.,
age and health information) and even abstract ones (e.g., personality and
social traits) from a set of personal images, which we term "image private
attribute profiling." This threat is particularly severe given that modern apps
can easily access users' photo albums, and inference from image sets enables
models to exploit inter-image relations for more sophisticated profiling.
However, two main challenges hinder our understanding of how well VLMs can
profile an individual from a few personal photos: (1) the lack of benchmark
datasets with multi-image annotations for private attributes, and (2) the
limited ability of current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to infer
abstract attributes from large image collections. In this work, we construct
PAPI, the largest dataset for studying private attribute profiling in personal
images, comprising 2,510 images from 251 individuals with 3,012 annotated
privacy attributes. We also propose HolmesEye, a hybrid agentic framework that
combines VLMs and LLMs to enhance privacy inference. HolmesEye uses VLMs to
extract both intra-image and inter-image information and LLMs to guide the
inference process as well as consolidate the results through forensic analysis,
overcoming existing limitations in long-context visual reasoning. Experiments
reveal that HolmesEye achieves a 10.8% improvement in average accuracy over
state-of-the-art baselines and surpasses human-level performance by 15.0% in
predicting abstract attributes. This work highlights the urgency of addressing
privacy risks in image-based profiling and offers both a new dataset and an
advanced framework to guide future research in this area.

Conclusion: DISTA-Net填补了密集红外小目标检测的空白，开源生态系统促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Resolving closely-spaced small targets in dense clusters presents a
significant challenge in infrared imaging, as the overlapping signals hinder
precise determination of their quantity, sub-pixel positions, and radiation
intensities. While deep learning has advanced the field of infrared small
target detection, its application to closely-spaced infrared small targets has
not yet been explored. This gap exists primarily due to the complexity of
separating superimposed characteristics and the lack of an open-source
infrastructure. In this work, we propose the Dynamic Iterative Shrinkage
Thresholding Network (DISTA-Net), which reconceptualizes traditional sparse
reconstruction within a dynamic framework. DISTA-Net adaptively generates
convolution weights and thresholding parameters to tailor the reconstruction
process in real time. To the best of our knowledge, DISTA-Net is the first deep
learning model designed specifically for the unmixing of closely-spaced
infrared small targets, achieving superior sub-pixel detection accuracy.
Moreover, we have established the first open-source ecosystem to foster further
research in this field. This ecosystem comprises three key components: (1)
CSIST-100K, a publicly available benchmark dataset; (2) CSO-mAP, a custom
evaluation metric for sub-pixel detection; and (3) GrokCSO, an open-source
toolkit featuring DISTA-Net and other models. Our code and dataset are

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have significantly accelerated
image editing techniques, driving increasing demand for diverse and
fine-grained edits. Despite these advances, existing image editing methods
still face challenges in achieving high precision and semantic accuracy in
complex scenarios. Recent studies address this issue by incorporating
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into image editing pipelines. However,
current MLLM-based methods mainly rely on interpreting textual instructions,
leaving the intrinsic visual understanding of large models largely unexplored,
thus resulting in insufficient alignment between textual semantics and visual
outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose MIND-Edit, an end-to-end
image-editing framework integrating pretrained diffusion model with MLLM.
MIND-Edit introduces two complementary strategies: (1) a text instruction
optimization strategy that clarifies ambiguous user instructions based on
semantic reasoning from the MLLM, and (2) an MLLM insight-driven editing
strategy that explicitly leverages the intrinsic visual understanding
capability of the MLLM to infer editing intent and guide the diffusion process
via generated visual embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a joint training
approach to effectively integrate both strategies, allowing them to reinforce
each other for more accurate instruction interpretation and visually coherent
edits aligned with user intent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MIND-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods in both
quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly under complex and
challenging scenarios.

TLDR: FHGS提出了一种新的3D特征融合框架，解决了3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）中颜色表示的各向异性与语义特征各向同性需求之间的矛盾，实现了高效渲染与跨视角特征一致性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS方法在渲染效率上表现优异，但无法解决高斯基元的各向异性颜色表示与语义特征各向同性需求之间的冲突，导致跨视角特征一致性不足。

Method: FHGS通过引入通用特征融合架构、非可微特征融合机制和双驱动优化策略，将预训练模型的2D特征映射到3D场景中，同时保持3DGS的实时渲染效率。

Result: FHGS能够实现高精度的2D特征到3D场景的映射，并保持语义特征在各视角下的各向同性分布。

Conclusion: FHGS通过物理模型启发的设计，成功平衡了3DGS的渲染效率与语义特征的一致性，为3D场景理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Scene understanding based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently
achieved notable advances. Although 3DGS related methods have efficient
rendering capabilities, they fail to address the inherent contradiction between
the anisotropic color representation of gaussian primitives and the isotropic
requirements of semantic features, leading to insufficient cross-view feature
consistency. To overcome the limitation, we proposes $\textit{FHGS}$
(Feature-Homogenized Gaussian Splatting), a novel 3D feature fusion framework
inspired by physical models, which can achieve high-precision mapping of
arbitrary 2D features from pre-trained models to 3D scenes while preserving the
real-time rendering efficiency of 3DGS. Specifically, our $\textit{FHGS}$
introduces the following innovations: Firstly, a universal feature fusion
architecture is proposed, enabling robust embedding of large-scale pre-trained
models' semantic features (e.g., SAM, CLIP) into sparse 3D structures.
Secondly, a non-differentiable feature fusion mechanism is introduced, which
enables semantic features to exhibit viewpoint independent isotropic
distributions. This fundamentally balances the anisotropic rendering of
gaussian primitives and the isotropic expression of features; Thirdly, a
dual-driven optimization strategy inspired by electric potential fields is
proposed, which combines external supervision from semantic feature fields with
internal primitive clustering guidance. This mechanism enables synergistic
optimization of global semantic alignment and local structural consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Sparse-to-Dense (StD)的解码策略，通过结合稀疏和密集注意力模块，加速视频大语言模型的推理，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型的自回归特性导致推理延迟随输入序列长度增加而增加，影响长视频序列的高效处理。

Method: StD策略包含两个模块：稀疏Top-K注意力模块和密集全注意力模块，前者快速解码多个令牌，后者并行验证这些令牌。

Result: StD实现了高达1.94倍的加速，且无需调参或大量代码修改即可直接应用。

Conclusion: StD是一种即插即用的高效解码策略，显著提升视频处理效率，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Due to the auto-regressive nature of current video large language models
(Video-LLMs), the inference latency increases as the input sequence length
grows, posing challenges for the efficient processing of video sequences that
are usually very long. We observe that during decoding, the attention scores of
most tokens in Video-LLMs tend to be sparse and concentrated, with only certain
tokens requiring comprehensive full attention. Based on this insight, we
introduce Sparse-to-Dense (StD), a novel decoding strategy that integrates two
distinct modules: one leveraging sparse top-K attention and the other employing
dense full attention. These modules collaborate to accelerate Video-LLMs
without loss. The fast (sparse) model speculatively decodes multiple tokens,
while the slow (dense) model verifies them in parallel. StD is a tuning-free,
plug-and-play solution that achieves up to a 1.94$\times$ walltime speedup in
video processing. It maintains model performance while enabling a seamless
transition from a standard Video-LLM to a sparse Video-LLM with minimal code
modifications.

*Yuze Wang,Mariana Belgiu,Haiyang Wu,Dandan Zhong,Yangyang Cao,Chao Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种联合学习框架，通过特征重建和预测任务处理卫星图像时间序列中的云污染问题，显著提升了农业语义分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云污染导致卫星图像时间序列（SITS）中存在时间间隙，破坏时间依赖性并引发特征偏移，现有方法（如完整重建或数据增强）存在噪声、冗余或泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 采用联合学习框架，结合特征重建和预测任务，通过模拟数据缺失场景和教师模型指导，选择性重建关键特征以减少噪声传播。

Result: 在湖南、法国西部和加泰罗尼亚的SITS实验中，方法在农田提取和作物分类中的平均F1分数分别提升了6.93%和7.09%，且对不同卫星传感器和缺失率具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合学习有效解决了SITS中的云污染问题，显著提升了模型性能并增强了泛化能力。

Abstract: Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) is crucial for agricultural semantic
segmentation. However, Cloud contamination introduces time gaps in SITS,
disrupting temporal dependencies and causing feature shifts, leading to
degraded performance of models trained on complete SITS. Existing methods
typically address this by reconstructing the entire SITS before prediction or
using data augmentation to simulate missing data. Yet, full reconstruction may
introduce noise and redundancy, while the data-augmented model can only handle
limited missing patterns, leading to poor generalization. We propose a joint
learning framework with feature reconstruction and prediction to address
incomplete SITS more effectively. During training, we simulate data-missing
scenarios using temporal masks. The two tasks are guided by both ground-truth
labels and the teacher model trained on complete SITS. The prediction task
constrains the model from selectively reconstructing critical features from
masked inputs that align with the teacher's temporal feature representations.
It reduces unnecessary reconstruction and limits noise propagation. By
integrating reconstructed features into the prediction task, the model avoids
learning shortcuts and maintains its ability to handle varied missing patterns
and complete SITS. Experiments on SITS from Hunan Province, Western France, and
Catalonia show that our method improves mean F1-scores by 6.93% in cropland
extraction and 7.09% in crop classification over baselines. It also generalizes
well across satellite sensors, including Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope, under
varying temporal missing rates and model backbones.

Method: 创建SurgClean数据集（1,020张图像），涵盖多种退化类型，并评估22种图像恢复方法。

Result: 实验结果显示现有方法与临床需求存在显著差距，需算法改进。

Conclusion: 研究为手术场景图像恢复提供了基础，并推动算法发展以提升临床效率。

Abstract: In laparoscopic surgery, a clear and high-quality visual field is critical
for surgeons to make accurate intraoperative decisions. However, persistent
visual degradation, including smoke generated by energy devices, lens fogging
from thermal gradients, and lens contamination due to blood or tissue fluid
splashes during surgical procedures, severely impair visual clarity. These
degenerations can seriously hinder surgical workflow and pose risks to patient
safety. To systematically investigate and address various forms of surgical
scene degradation, we introduce a real-world open-source surgical image
restoration dataset covering laparoscopic environments, called SurgClean, which
involves multi-type image restoration tasks, e.g., desmoking, defogging, and
desplashing. SurgClean comprises 1,020 images with diverse degradation types
and corresponding paired reference labels. Based on SurgClean, we establish a
standardized evaluation benchmark and provide performance for 22 representative
generic task-specific image restoration approaches, including 12 generic and 10
task-specific image restoration approaches. Experimental results reveal
substantial performance gaps relative to clinical requirements, highlighting a
critical opportunity for algorithm advancements in intelligent surgical
restoration. Furthermore, we explore the degradation discrepancies between
surgical and natural scenes from structural perception and semantic
understanding perspectives, providing fundamental insights for domain-specific
image restoration research. Our work aims to empower the capabilities of
restoration algorithms to increase surgical environments and improve the
efficiency of clinical procedures.

offering a principled benchmark for compositional alignment under test-time
conditions. We will publicly release the implementation of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB或深度相机在低光环境和运动模糊下表现不佳，事件相机因其高动态范围和高时间分辨率成为替代方案，但现有研究受限于静态背景和固定相机。

Method: 引入手部分割模块（Hand Segmentation Module）提取手部区域，减少动态背景事件的干扰。

Result: 在N-HOT3D数据集上评估，MPJPE提升约4.5厘米（43%）。

Conclusion: EventEgoHands在动态背景下有效提升了3D手部网格重建的精度。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D hand mesh is challenging but an important task for
human-computer interaction and AR/VR applications. In particular, RGB and/or
depth cameras have been widely used in this task. However, methods using these
conventional cameras face challenges in low-light environments and during
motion blur. Thus, to address these limitations, event cameras have been
attracting attention in recent years for their high dynamic range and high
temporal resolution. Despite their advantages, event cameras are sensitive to
background noise or camera motion, which has limited existing studies to static
backgrounds and fixed cameras. In this study, we propose EventEgoHands, a novel
method for event-based 3D hand mesh reconstruction in an egocentric view. Our
approach introduces a Hand Segmentation Module that extracts hand regions,
effectively mitigating the influence of dynamic background events. We evaluated
our approach and demonstrated its effectiveness on the N-HOT3D dataset,
improving MPJPE by approximately more than 4.5 cm (43%).

Conclusion: 三角形表示在高质量新视角合成中具有高效性和有效性，结合了经典计算机图形学和现代可微分渲染框架的优势。

Abstract: The field of computer graphics was revolutionized by models such as Neural
Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, displacing triangles as the dominant
representation for photogrammetry. In this paper, we argue for a triangle
comeback. We develop a differentiable renderer that directly optimizes
triangles via end-to-end gradients. We achieve this by rendering each triangle
as differentiable splats, combining the efficiency of triangles with the
adaptive density of representations based on independent primitives. Compared
to popular 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, our approach achieves higher
visual fidelity, faster convergence, and increased rendering throughput. On the
Mip-NeRF360 dataset, our method outperforms concurrent non-volumetric
primitives in visual fidelity and achieves higher perceptual quality than the
state-of-the-art Zip-NeRF on indoor scenes. Triangles are simple, compatible
with standard graphics stacks and GPU hardware, and highly efficient: for the
\textit{Garden} scene, we achieve over 2,400 FPS at 1280x720 resolution using
an off-the-shelf mesh renderer. These results highlight the efficiency and
effectiveness of triangle-based representations for high-quality novel view
synthesis. Triangles bring us closer to mesh-based optimization by combining
classical computer graphics with modern differentiable rendering frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感计算方法忽视了视觉显著性的作用，本研究旨在填补这一空白，提供更高效的情感建模方法。

Method: 使用HD2S显著性模型和OpenFace面部动作单元分析，提取显著区域面积和数量特征，研究其与情绪的关系。

Result: 发现多显著区域视频引发高愉悦低唤醒情绪，单显著区域视频引发低愉悦高唤醒情绪，且主观报告与面部表情检测不一致。

Conclusion: 基于显著性的方法为情感建模提供了高效且可解释的替代方案，对内容创作和情感计算研究有重要意义。

Abstract: Understanding the emotional impact of videos is crucial for applications in
content creation, advertising, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
Traditional affective computing methods rely on self-reported emotions, facial
expression analysis, and biosensing data, yet they often overlook the role of
visual saliency -- the naturally attention-grabbing regions within a video. In
this study, we utilize deep learning to introduce a novel saliency-based
approach to emotion prediction by extracting two key features: saliency area
and number of salient regions. Using the HD2S saliency model and OpenFace
facial action unit analysis, we examine the relationship between video saliency
and viewer emotions. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) Videos with
multiple salient regions tend to elicit high-valence, low-arousal emotions, (2)
Videos with a single dominant salient region are more likely to induce
low-valence, high-arousal responses, and (3) Self-reported emotions often
misalign with facial expression-based emotion detection, suggesting limitations
in subjective reporting. By leveraging saliency-driven insights, this work
provides a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative for emotion
modeling, with implications for content creation, personalized media
experiences, and affective computing research.

Abstract: Automated pose correction remains a significant challenge in AI-driven

presents PosePilot, a novel system that integrates pose recognition with
real-time personalized corrective feedback, overcoming the limitations of
traditional fitness solutions. Using Yoga, a discipline requiring precise
spatio-temporal alignment as a case study, we demonstrate PosePilot's ability
to analyze complex physical movements. Designed for deployment on edge devices,
PosePilot can be extended to various at-home and outdoor exercises. We employ a
Vanilla LSTM, allowing the system to capture temporal dependencies for pose
recognition. Additionally, a BiLSTM with multi-head Attention enhances the
model's ability to process motion contexts, selectively focusing on key limb
angles for accurate error detection while maintaining computational efficiency.
As part of this work, we introduce a high-quality video dataset used for
evaluating our models. Most importantly, PosePilot provides instant corrective
feedback at every stage of a movement, ensuring precise posture adjustments
throughout the exercise routine. The proposed approach 1) performs automatic
human posture recognition, 2) provides personalized posture correction feedback
at each instant which is crucial in Yoga, and 3) offers a lightweight and
robust posture correction model feasible for deploying on edge devices in
real-world environments.

Result: 该方法在四种人类偏好奖励函数上实现了1.25至2倍的样本效率提升，且不损害原始最优策略。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了奖励稀疏问题，显著提升了训练效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model fine-tuning leverage
reinforcement learning (RL) to align generated images with learnable reward
functions. The existing approaches reformulate denoising as a Markov decision
process for RL-driven optimization. However, they suffer from reward sparsity,
receiving only a single delayed reward per generated trajectory. This flaw
hinders precise step-level attribution of denoising actions, undermines
training efficiency. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective credit
assignment framework that dynamically distributes dense rewards across
denoising steps. Specifically, we track changes in cosine similarity between
intermediate and final images to quantify each step's contribution on
progressively reducing the distance to the final image. Our approach avoids
additional auxiliary neural networks for step-level preference modeling and
instead uses reward shaping to highlight denoising phases that have a greater
impact on image quality. Our method achieves 1.25 to 2 times higher sample
efficiency and better generalization across four human preference reward
functions, without compromising the original optimal policy.

Conclusion: PolyCL是一种高效的自监督学习框架，能够显著提升医学图像分割的性能，尤其在标注数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: Segmentation is one of the most important tasks in the medical imaging
pipeline as it influences a number of image-based decisions. To be effective,
fully supervised segmentation approaches require large amounts of manually
annotated training data. However, the pixel-level annotation process is
expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, hindering progress and making it
challenging to perform effective segmentations. Therefore, models must learn
efficiently from limited labeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL),
particularly contrastive learning via pre-training on unlabeled data and
fine-tuning on limited annotations, can facilitate such limited labeled image
segmentation. To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised contrastive
learning framework for medical image segmentation, leveraging inherent
relationships of different images, dubbed PolyCL. Without requiring any
pixel-level annotations or unreasonable data augmentations, our PolyCL learns
and transfers context-aware discriminant features useful for segmentation from
an innovative surrogate, in a task-related manner. Additionally, we integrate
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our framework in two novel ways: as a
post-processing refinement module that improves the accuracy of predicted masks
using bounding box prompts derived from coarse outputs, and as a propagation
mechanism via SAM 2 that generates volumetric segmentations from a single
annotated 2D slice. Experimental evaluations on three public computed
tomography (CT) datasets demonstrate that PolyCL outperforms fully-supervised
and self-supervised baselines in both low-data and cross-domain scenarios. Our
code is available at https://github.com/tbwa233/PolyCL.

Result: CFG通过均值偏移、增强类特定特征和抑制通用特征提升生成质量，线性分析对非线性模型仍有指导意义。

Conclusion: 线性CFG的分析为理解非线性CFG提供了重要见解，尽管两者在低噪声水平下存在差异。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a core technique powering state-of-the-art
image generation systems, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly
understood. In this work, we begin by analyzing CFG in a simplified linear
diffusion model, where we show its behavior closely resembles that observed in
the nonlinear case. Our analysis reveals that linear CFG improves generation
quality via three distinct components: (i) a mean-shift term that approximately
steers samples in the direction of class means, (ii) a positive Contrastive
Principal Components (CPC) term that amplifies class-specific features, and
(iii) a negative CPC term that suppresses generic features prevalent in
unconditional data. We then verify that these insights in real-world, nonlinear
diffusion models: over a broad range of noise levels, linear CFG resembles the
behavior of its nonlinear counterpart. Although the two eventually diverge at
low noise levels, we discuss how the insights from the linear analysis still
shed light on the CFG's mechanism in the nonlinear regime.

Abstract: In the past decade, image foundation models (IFMs) have achieved
unprecedented progress. However, the potential of directly using IFMs for video
self-supervised representation learning has largely been overlooked. In this
study, we propose an advancing video self-supervised learning (AdViSe)
approach, aimed at significantly reducing the training overhead of video
representation models using pre-trained IFMs. Specifically, we first introduce
temporal modeling modules (ResNet3D) to IFMs, constructing a video
representation model. We then employ a video self-supervised learning approach,
playback rate perception, to train temporal modules while freezing the IFM
components. Experiments on UCF101 demonstrate that AdViSe achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing training time by
$3.4\times$ and GPU memory usage by $8.2\times$. This study offers fresh
insights into low-cost video self-supervised learning based on pre-trained

Result: 实验表明，深度视觉模型特征能有效捕捉主观真实性。

Conclusion: RAISE为开发客观真实性评估模型提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
photorealistic visual content, offering practical substitutes for real images
and videos in scenarios where acquiring real data is difficult or expensive.
However, reliably substituting real visual content with AI-generated
counterparts requires robust assessment of the perceived realness of
AI-generated visual content, a challenging task due to its inherent subjective
nature. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive human study evaluating
the perceptual realness of both real and AI-generated images, resulting in a
new dataset, containing images paired with subjective realness scores,
introduced as RAISE in this paper. Further, we develop and train multiple
models on RAISE to establish baselines for realness prediction. Our
experimental results demonstrate that features derived from deep foundation
vision models can effectively capture the subjective realness. RAISE thus
provides a valuable resource for developing robust, objective models of
perceptual realness assessment.

Result: 在3D点云预测、占用预测、流估计和端到端驾驶等任务中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: DriveX作为通用世界模型，为稳健统一的自动驾驶框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Data-driven learning has advanced autonomous driving, yet task-specific
models struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios due to their narrow
optimization objectives and reliance on costly annotated data. We present
DriveX, a self-supervised world model that learns generalizable scene dynamics
and holistic representations (geometric, semantic, and motion) from large-scale
driving videos. DriveX introduces Omni Scene Modeling (OSM), a module that
unifies multimodal supervision-3D point cloud forecasting, 2D semantic
representation, and image generation-to capture comprehensive scene evolution.
To simplify learning complex dynamics, we propose a decoupled latent world
modeling strategy that separates world representation learning from future
state decoding, augmented by dynamic-aware ray sampling to enhance motion
modeling. For downstream adaptation, we design Future Spatial Attention (FSA),
a unified paradigm that dynamically aggregates spatiotemporal features from
DriveX's predictions to enhance task-specific inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DriveX's effectiveness: it achieves significant improvements in 3D
future point cloud prediction over prior work, while attaining state-of-the-art
results on diverse tasks including occupancy prediction, flow estimation, and
end-to-end driving. These results validate DriveX's capability as a
general-purpose world model, paving the way for robust and unified autonomous
driving frameworks.

Motivation: 解决图像分割中视觉与语言信息融合的挑战，提升分割任务中特定对象的定位准确性。

Result: 实验表明各组件均带来性能提升，SegVLM在多样化数据集和场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: SegVLM通过改进架构和损失函数，显著提升了图像分割的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, aimed at
partitioning an image into semantically meaningful regions. Referring image
segmentation extends this task by using natural language expressions to
localize specific objects, requiring effective integration of visual and
linguistic information. In this work, we propose SegVLM, a vision-language
model that incorporates architectural improvements to enhance segmentation
accuracy and cross-modal alignment. The model integrates squeeze-and-excitation
(SE) blocks for dynamic feature recalibration, deformable convolutions for
geometric adaptability, and residual connections for deep feature learning. We
also introduce a novel referring-aware fusion (RAF) loss that balances
region-level alignment, boundary precision, and class imbalance. Extensive
experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that each component contributes to
consistent performance improvements. SegVLM also shows strong generalization
across diverse datasets and referring expression scenarios.

*Vivek Gopalakrishnan,Neel Dey,Polina Golland*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: PolyPose提出了一种简单且鲁棒的2D/3D配准方法，通过参数化复杂3D变形场为刚性变换的组合，解决了术中稀疏视角下的3D姿态估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在介入性手术中，快速2D成像（如X光）无法提供精确的3D定位，而术前体积成像（如CT和MRI）无法在术中获取。PolyPose旨在将体积引导整合到术中流程中。

Method: PolyPose将复杂3D变形场参数化为刚性变换的组合，利用骨骼在典型运动中不弯曲的生物约束，避免了昂贵的变形正则化需求。

Result: 实验表明，PolyPose能在仅需两幅X光图像的情况下成功对齐术前体积数据，在稀疏视角和有限角度条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PolyPose通过引入解剖学合理的先验知识，为术中3D引导提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is
a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric
imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization
of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures,
where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance
into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method
for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D
deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the
biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion.
Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail
outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces
anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise rigid nature of human
movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation
regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter
optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic
surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables
PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as
two X-ray images, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging
sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像的扩散生成通常使用完整文本条件，但由于复杂语法，扩散变换器（DiTs）存在对完整文本的理解缺陷，导致语义细节丢失或混淆。

Method: 提出DiT-ST框架，将完整文本转换为分割文本，利用大语言模型解析并分层注入扩散去噪过程的不同阶段。

Result: 实验验证了DiT-ST在缓解完整文本理解缺陷方面的有效性。

Conclusion: DiT-ST通过分割文本和分层注入策略，显著提升了扩散模型对语义细节的理解能力。

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion generation typically employs complete-text
conditioning. Due to the intricate syntax, diffusion transformers (DiTs)
inherently suffer from a comprehension defect of complete-text captions.
One-fly complete-text input either overlooks critical semantic details or
causes semantic confusion by simultaneously modeling diverse semantic primitive
types. To mitigate this defect of DiTs, we propose a novel split-text
conditioning framework named DiT-ST. This framework converts a complete-text
caption into a split-text caption, a collection of simplified sentences, to
explicitly express various semantic primitives and their interconnections. The
split-text caption is then injected into different denoising stages of DiT-ST
in a hierarchical and incremental manner. Specifically, DiT-ST leverages Large
Language Models to parse captions, extracting diverse primitives and
hierarchically sorting out and constructing these primitives into a split-text
input. Moreover, we partition the diffusion denoising process according to its
differential sensitivities to diverse semantic primitive types and determine
the appropriate timesteps to incrementally inject tokens of diverse semantic
primitive types into input tokens via cross-attention. In this way, DiT-ST
enhances the representation learning of specific semantic primitive types
across different stages. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
our proposed DiT-ST in mitigating the complete-text comprehension defect.

Conclusion: 该框架在极稀疏视角条件下有效提升了新视图合成的覆盖率和质量，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis in 360$^\circ$ scenes from extremely sparse input views
is essential for applications like virtual reality and augmented reality. This
paper presents a novel framework for novel view synthesis in extremely
sparse-view cases. As typical structure-from-motion methods are unable to
estimate camera poses in extremely sparse-view cases, we apply DUSt3R to
estimate camera poses and generate a dense point cloud. Using the poses of
estimated cameras, we densely sample additional views from the upper hemisphere
space of the scenes, from which we render synthetic images together with the
point cloud. Training 3D Gaussian Splatting model on a combination of reference
images from sparse views and densely sampled synthetic images allows a larger
scene coverage in 3D space, addressing the overfitting challenge due to the
limited input in sparse-view cases. Retraining a diffusion-based image
enhancement model on our created dataset, we further improve the quality of the
point-cloud-rendered images by removing artifacts. We compare our framework
with benchmark methods in cases of only four input views, demonstrating
significant improvement in novel view synthesis under extremely sparse-view
conditions for 360$^\circ$ scenes.

Conclusion: 新方法在保持或超越TextDiffuser-2质量的同时，显著提升了效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Text-embedded image generation plays a critical role in industries such as
graphic design, advertising, and digital content creation. Text-to-Image
generation methods leveraging diffusion models, such as TextDiffuser-2, have
demonstrated promising results in producing images with embedded text.
TextDiffuser-2 effectively generates bounding box layouts that guide the
rendering of visual text, achieving high fidelity and coherence. However,
existing approaches often rely on resource-intensive processes and are limited
in their ability to run efficiently on both CPU and GPU platforms. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that integrates
reinforcement learning (RL) for rapid and optimized text layout generation with
a diffusion-based image synthesis model. Our RL-based approach significantly
accelerates the bounding box prediction step while reducing overlaps, allowing
the system to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality
in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and
increased flexibility. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework

TLDR: 论文提出了一种利用预训练生成模型筛选高质量样本的方法，构建了通用SFT数据集Alchemist，显著提升了T2I模型的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT数据集通常局限于特定领域，且高质量通用数据集稀缺，阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 利用预训练生成模型作为样本影响力评估工具，构建紧凑高效的SFT数据集Alchemist。

Result: Alchemist显著提升了五种公共T2I模型的生成质量，同时保持了多样性和风格。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建高质量通用SFT数据集提供了可行方案，并公开了数据集和模型权重。

Abstract: Pre-training equips text-to-image (T2I) models with broad world knowledge,
but this alone is often insufficient to achieve high aesthetic quality and
alignment. Consequently, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial for further
refinement. However, its effectiveness highly depends on the quality of the
fine-tuning dataset. Existing public SFT datasets frequently target narrow
domains (e.g., anime or specific art styles), and the creation of high-quality,
general-purpose SFT datasets remains a significant challenge. Current curation
methods are often costly and struggle to identify truly impactful samples. This
challenge is further complicated by the scarcity of public general-purpose
datasets, as leading models often rely on large, proprietary, and poorly
documented internal data, hindering broader research progress. This paper
introduces a novel methodology for creating general-purpose SFT datasets by
leveraging a pre-trained generative model as an estimator of high-impact
training samples. We apply this methodology to construct and release Alchemist,
a compact (3,350 samples) yet highly effective SFT dataset. Experiments
demonstrate that Alchemist substantially improves the generative quality of
five public T2I models while preserving diversity and style. Additionally, we
release the fine-tuned models' weights to the public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WLI在资源有限环境下性能不足的问题，避免依赖息肉定位和全局特征对齐的局限性。

Method: 采用ADD模块，通过像素级跨域亲和力和CAM过滤实现精细知识蒸馏，无需图像对齐。

Result: 在公开和内部数据集上表现最优，AUC分别提升至少2.5%和16.2%。

Conclusion: ADD框架有效解决了WLI和NBI图像间的域差异，为临床提供了更可靠的诊断工具。

Abstract: White Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) are the two main
colonoscopic modalities for polyp classification. While NBI, as optical
chromoendoscopy, offers valuable vascular details, WLI remains the most common
and often the only available modality in resource-limited settings. However,
WLI-based methods typically underperform, limiting their clinical
applicability. Existing approaches transfer knowledge from NBI to WLI through
global feature alignment but often rely on cropped lesion regions, which are
susceptible to detection errors and neglect contextual and subtle diagnostic
cues. To address this, this paper proposes a novel holistic classification
framework that leverages full-image diagnosis without requiring polyp
localization. The key innovation lies in the Alignment-free Dense Distillation
(ADD) module, which enables fine-grained cross-domain knowledge distillation
regardless of misalignment between WLI and NBI images. Without resorting to
explicit image alignment, ADD learns pixel-wise cross-domain affinities to
establish correspondences between feature maps, guiding the distillation along
the most relevant pixel connections. To further enhance distillation
reliability, ADD incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to filter
cross-domain affinities, ensuring the distillation path connects only those
semantically consistent regions with equal contributions to polyp diagnosis.
Extensive results on public and in-house datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, relatively outperforming the other approaches by
at least 2.5% and 16.2% in AUC, respectively. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别矛盾/犹豫情绪（A/H）对个性化数字行为干预至关重要，但目前缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 通过网络平台收集224名参与者的视频数据，标注A/H片段，并提供多模态基线模型。

Result: 基线模型表现有限，突显了识别真实视频中A/H的挑战。

Conclusion: BAH数据集为A/H识别研究提供了资源，但需进一步改进模型性能。

Abstract: Recognizing complex emotions linked to ambivalence and hesitancy (A/H) can
play a critical role in the personalization and effectiveness of digital
behaviour change interventions. These subtle and conflicting emotions are
manifested by a discord between multiple modalities, such as facial and vocal
expressions, and body language. Although experts can be trained to identify
A/H, integrating them into digital interventions is costly and less effective.
Automatic learning systems provide a cost-effective alternative that can adapt
to individual users, and operate seamlessly within real-time, and
resource-limited environments. However, there are currently no datasets
available for the design of ML models to recognize A/H. This paper introduces a
first Behavioural Ambivalence/Hesitancy (BAH) dataset collected for
subject-based multimodal recognition of A/H in videos. It contains videos from
224 participants captured across 9 provinces in Canada, with different age, and
ethnicity. Through our web platform, we recruited participants to answer 7
questions, some of which were designed to elicit A/H while recording themselves
via webcam with microphone. BAH amounts to 1,118 videos for a total duration of
8.26 hours with 1.5 hours of A/H. Our behavioural team annotated timestamp
segments to indicate where A/H occurs, and provide frame- and video-level
annotations with the A/H cues. Video transcripts and their timestamps are also
included, along with cropped and aligned faces in each frame, and a variety of
participants meta-data. We include results baselines for BAH at frame- and
video-level recognition in multi-modal setups, in addition to zero-shot
prediction, and for personalization using unsupervised domain adaptation. The
limited performance of baseline models highlights the challenges of recognizing
A/H in real-world videos. The data, code, and pretrained weights are available.

Result: 在多种任务和基准测试中达到最先进性能，并展现出对多种生成模型的强适应性。

Conclusion: 新方法通过利用文本-图像对和可学习区域，克服了现有方法的局限性，实现了高效且高质量的图像编辑。

Abstract: Current text-driven image editing methods typically follow one of two
directions: relying on large-scale, high-quality editing pair datasets to
improve editing precision and diversity, or exploring alternative dataset-free
techniques. However, constructing large-scale editing datasets requires
carefully designed pipelines, is time-consuming, and often results in
unrealistic samples or unwanted artifacts. Meanwhile, dataset-free methods may
suffer from limited instruction comprehension and restricted editing
capabilities. Faced with these challenges, the present work develops a novel
paradigm for instruction-driven image editing that leverages widely available
and enormous text-image pairs, instead of relying on editing pair datasets. Our
approach introduces a multi-scale learnable region to localize and guide the
editing process. By treating the alignment between images and their textual
descriptions as supervision and learning to generate task-specific editing
regions, our method achieves high-fidelity, precise, and instruction-consistent
image editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
attains state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and benchmarks, while
exhibiting strong adaptability to various types of generative models.

Motivation: 现有提示学习方法在泛化到新类别或未见域时性能下降明显，DiSa旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在11个图像分类基准测试中，DiSa在多种设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiSa通过正则化策略显著提升了模型的泛化能力，适用于多种任务场景。

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for adapting
vision-language models such as CLIP to downstream tasks. However, existing
methods often overfit to seen data, leading to significant performance
degradation when generalizing to novel classes or unseen domains. To address
this limitation, we propose DiSa, a Directional Saliency-Aware Prompt Learning
framework that integrates two complementary regularization strategies to
enhance generalization. First, our Cross-Interactive Regularization (CIR)
fosters cross-modal alignment by enabling cooperative learning between prompted
and frozen encoders. Within CIR, a saliency-aware masking strategy guides the
image encoder to prioritize semantically critical image regions, reducing
reliance on less informative patches. Second, we introduce a directional
regularization strategy that aligns visual embeddings with class-wise prototype
features in a directional manner to prioritize consistency in feature
orientation over strict proximity. This approach ensures robust generalization
by leveraging stable prototype directions derived from class-mean statistics.
Extensive evaluations on 11 diverse image classification benchmarks demonstrate
that DiSa consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods
across various settings, including base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset
transfer, domain generalization, and few-shot learning.

Result: 新方法显著提高了运动保真度和文本对齐能力，支持下游任务且无需额外调整。

Conclusion: 全局绝对坐标表示为运动生成和相关应用提供了更强大的基础。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-motion generation models rely on the
kinematic-aware, local-relative motion representation popularized by HumanML3D,
which encodes motion relative to the pelvis and to the previous frame with
built-in redundancy. While this design simplifies training for earlier
generation models, it introduces critical limitations for diffusion models and
hinders applicability to downstream tasks. In this work, we revisit the motion
representation and propose a radically simplified and long-abandoned
alternative for text-to-motion generation: absolute joint coordinates in global
space. Through systematic analysis of design choices, we show that this
formulation achieves significantly higher motion fidelity, improved text
alignment, and strong scalability, even with a simple Transformer backbone and
no auxiliary kinematic-aware losses. Moreover, our formulation naturally
supports downstream tasks such as text-driven motion control and
temporal/spatial editing without additional task-specific reengineering and
costly classifier guidance generation from control signals. Finally, we
demonstrate promising generalization to directly generate SMPL-H mesh vertices
in motion from text, laying a strong foundation for future research and
motion-related applications.

Abstract: Limited Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) often faces significant challenges
due to missing angular information. Unlike previous methods that operate in the
image domain, we propose a new method that focuses on sinogram inpainting. We
leverage MR-SDEs, a variant of diffusion models that characterize the diffusion
process with mean-reverting stochastic differential equations, to fill in
missing angular data at the projection level. Furthermore, by combining
distillation with constraining the output of the model using the pseudo-inverse
of the inpainting matrix, the diffusion process is accelerated and done in a
step, enabling efficient and accurate sinogram completion. A subsequent
post-processing module back-projects the inpainted sinogram into the image
domain and further refines the reconstruction, effectively suppressing
artifacts while preserving critical structural details. Quantitative
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual and fidelity quality, offering
a promising solution for LACT reconstruction in scientific and clinical
applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation models have sparked interest in world
models capable of simulating realistic environments. While navigation has been
well-explored, physically meaningful interactions that mimic real-world forces
remain largely understudied. In this work, we investigate using physical forces
as a control signal for video generation and propose force prompts which enable
users to interact with images through both localized point forces, such as
poking a plant, and global wind force fields, such as wind blowing on fabric.
We demonstrate that these force prompts can enable videos to respond
realistically to physical control signals by leveraging the visual and motion
prior in the original pretrained model, without using any 3D asset or physics
simulator at inference. The primary challenge of force prompting is the
difficulty in obtaining high quality paired force-video training data, both in
the real world due to the difficulty of obtaining force signals, and in
synthetic data due to limitations in the visual quality and domain diversity of
physics simulators. Our key finding is that video generation models can
generalize remarkably well when adapted to follow physical force conditioning
from videos synthesized by Blender, even with limited demonstrations of few
objects. Our method can generate videos which simulate forces across diverse
geometries, settings, and materials. We also try to understand the source of
this generalization and perform ablations that reveal two key elements: visual
diversity and the use of specific text keywords during training. Our approach
is trained on only around 15k training examples for a single day on four A100
GPUs, and outperforms existing methods on force adherence and physics realism,
bringing world models closer to real-world physics interactions. We release all
datasets, code, weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating high-quality and diverse visual content from natural language
prompts. However, uncontrolled reproduction of sensitive, copyrighted, or

these concerns, the concept erasure paradigm has emerged as a promising
direction, enabling the selective removal of specific semantic concepts from

a comprehensive overview and in-depth synthesis of concept erasure techniques
in T2I diffusion models. We systematically categorize existing approaches along
three key dimensions: intervention level, which identifies specific model
components targeted for concept removal; optimization structure, referring to
the algorithmic strategies employed to achieve suppression; and semantic scope,
concerning the complexity and nature of the concepts addressed. This
multi-dimensional taxonomy enables clear, structured comparisons across diverse
methodologies, highlighting fundamental trade-offs between erasure specificity,
generalization, and computational complexity. We further discuss current
evaluation benchmarks, standardized metrics, and practical datasets,
emphasizing gaps that limit comprehensive assessment, particularly regarding
robustness and practical effectiveness. Finally, we outline major challenges
and promising future directions, including disentanglement of concept
representations, adaptive and incremental erasure strategies, adversarial
robustness, and new generative architectures. This survey aims to guide
researchers toward safer, more ethically aligned generative models, providing
foundational knowledge and actionable recommendations to advance responsible
development in generative AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: MMIG-Bench是一个统一的多模态图像生成基准测试，结合了文本提示和多视角参考图像，并提出了三级评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态图像生成模型缺乏统一的评估工具，MMIG-Bench旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出MMIG-Bench基准测试，包含4850个文本提示和1750张多视角参考图像，采用三级评估框架（低、中、高级指标）。

Result: 对17个先进模型进行基准测试，验证了评估指标的有效性，并获得了32k人类评分。

Conclusion: MMIG-Bench为多模态图像生成提供了严谨、统一的评估标准，将促进未来创新。

Abstract: Recent multimodal image generators such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and
Gemini 2.5 Pro excel at following complex instructions, editing images and
maintaining concept consistency. However, they are still evaluated by disjoint
toolkits: text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks that lacks multi-modal conditioning,
and customized image generation benchmarks that overlook compositional
semantics and common knowledge. We propose MMIG-Bench, a comprehensive
Multi-Modal Image Generation Benchmark that unifies these tasks by pairing
4,850 richly annotated text prompts with 1,750 multi-view reference images
across 380 subjects, spanning humans, animals, objects, and artistic styles.
MMIG-Bench is equipped with a three-level evaluation framework: (1) low-level
metrics for visual artifacts and identity preservation of objects; (2) novel
Aspect Matching Score (AMS): a VQA-based mid-level metric that delivers
fine-grained prompt-image alignment and shows strong correlation with human
judgments; and (3) high-level metrics for aesthetics and human preference.
Using MMIG-Bench, we benchmark 17 state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.5
Pro, FLUX, DreamBooth, and IP-Adapter, and validate our metrics with 32k human
ratings, yielding in-depth insights into architecture and data design. We will
release the dataset and evaluation code to foster rigorous, unified evaluation
and accelerate future innovations in multi-modal image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态物体破坏了场景一致性，导致跟踪漂移和映射伪影，现有方法依赖预定义语义类别，丢弃了对机器人应用至关重要的动态场景信息。

Method: 设计了基于场景一致性分析的自适应动态识别机制，并提出动态-静态分离映射策略，构建时间高斯模型进行在线增量动态建模。

Result: 在多个动态数据集上展示了灵活的动态分割能力和在定位与映射中的先进性能。

Conclusion: ADD-SLAM无需预定义语义类别，有效解决了动态场景中的SLAM挑战，实现了高精度的动态目标识别和建模。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian-based
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods have demonstrated
exceptional localization precision and remarkable dense mapping performance.
However, dynamic objects introduce critical challenges by disrupting scene
consistency, leading to tracking drift and mapping artifacts. Existing methods
that employ semantic segmentation or object detection for dynamic
identification and filtering typically rely on predefined categorical priors,
while discarding dynamic scene information crucial for robotic applications
such as dynamic obstacle avoidance and environmental interaction. To overcome
these challenges, we propose ADD-SLAM: an Adaptive Dynamic Dense SLAM framework
based on Gaussian splitting. We design an adaptive dynamic identification
mechanism grounded in scene consistency analysis, comparing geometric and
textural discrepancies between real-time observations and historical maps. Ours
requires no predefined semantic category priors and adaptively discovers scene
dynamics. Precise dynamic object recognition effectively mitigates interference
from moving targets during localization. Furthermore, we propose a
dynamic-static separation mapping strategy that constructs a temporal Gaussian
model to achieve online incremental dynamic modeling. Experiments conducted on
multiple dynamic datasets demonstrate our method's flexible and accurate
dynamic segmentation capabilities, along with state-of-the-art performance in
both localization and mapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动域适应方法仅关注不确定样本，忽略了自信样本的潜力，导致搜索空间未被充分利用。

Method: 提出协作框架，结合高斯过程主动采样（GPAS）和伪标签自信采样（PLCS），逐步优化适应过程。

Result: 在Office-Home和DomainNet数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合自信样本和不确定样本的协作策略能有效提升域适应性能。

Abstract: Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) adapts models to target domains by selectively
labeling a few target samples. Existing ADA methods prioritize uncertain
samples but overlook confident ones, which often match ground-truth. We find
that incorporating confident predictions into the labeled set before active
sampling reduces the search space and improves adaptation. To address this, we
propose a collaborative framework that labels uncertain samples while treating
highly confident predictions as ground truth. Our method combines Gaussian
Process-based Active Sampling (GPAS) for identifying uncertain samples and
Pseudo-Label-based Certain Sampling (PLCS) for confident ones, progressively
enhancing adaptation. PLCS refines the search space, and GPAS reduces the
domain gap, boosting the proportion of confident samples. Extensive experiments
on Office-Home and DomainNet show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art ADA methods.

Motivation: 统一多图像分割任务，并通过自然语言指令实现更灵活的分割需求。

Method: 将图像分割重新定义为视觉生成问题，使用LLaMA风格Transformer预测视觉标记，并构建SA-OVRS数据集支持训练。

Result: 模型在多个数据集上超越现有生成模型，生成更精细的分割掩码。

Conclusion: LlamaSeg通过视觉生成和自然语言指令实现了高效、灵活的图像分割。

Abstract: We present LlamaSeg, a visual autoregressive framework that unifies multiple
image segmentation tasks via natural language instructions. We reformulate
image segmentation as a visual generation problem, representing masks as
"visual" tokens and employing a LLaMA-style Transformer to predict them
directly from image inputs. By adhering to the next-token prediction paradigm,
our approach naturally integrates segmentation tasks into autoregressive
architectures. To support large-scale training, we introduce a data annotation
pipeline and construct the SA-OVRS dataset, which contains 2M segmentation
masks annotated with over 5,800 open-vocabulary labels or diverse textual
descriptions, covering a wide spectrum of real-world scenarios. This enables
our model to localize objects in images based on text prompts and to generate
fine-grained masks. To more accurately evaluate the quality of masks produced
by visual generative models, we further propose a composite metric that
combines Intersection over Union (IoU) with Average Hausdorff Distance (AHD),
offering a more precise assessment of contour fidelity. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method surpasses existing generative models across
multiple datasets and yields more detailed segmentation masks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过并行分支处理RGB和X输入流，导致特征空间分散，增加了模型复杂性和计算开销，限制了时空建模能力。

Method: CSTrack设计了空间紧凑模块和时间紧凑模块，分别整合RGB-X输入流和高效表示时间特征。

Result: 实验表明CSTrack在主流RGB-X基准测试中达到了新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: CSTrack通过紧凑的时空特征建模，实现了简单而高效的跟踪，为RGB-X跟踪器设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Effectively modeling and utilizing spatiotemporal features from RGB and other
modalities (\eg, depth, thermal, and event data, denoted as X) is the core of
RGB-X tracker design. Existing methods often employ two parallel branches to
separately process the RGB and X input streams, requiring the model to
simultaneously handle two dispersed feature spaces, which complicates both the
model structure and computation process. More critically, intra-modality
spatial modeling within each dispersed space incurs substantial computational
overhead, limiting resources for inter-modality spatial modeling and temporal
modeling. To address this, we propose a novel tracker, CSTrack, which focuses
on modeling Compact Spatiotemporal features to achieve simple yet effective
tracking. Specifically, we first introduce an innovative Spatial Compact Module
that integrates the RGB-X dual input streams into a compact spatial feature,
enabling thorough intra- and inter-modality spatial modeling. Additionally, we
design an efficient Temporal Compact Module that compactly represents temporal
features by constructing the refined target distribution heatmap. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of our compact spatiotemporal modeling
method, with CSTrack achieving new SOTA results on mainstream RGB-X benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法采用跨模态提示隔离，导致模态不平衡和性能下降。

Method: 提出MM-Prompt框架，包括跨模态提示查询和恢复，通过对齐损失防止表示漂移。

Result: 实验表明MM-Prompt在准确性和知识保留上优于现有方法，保持模态平衡。

Conclusion: MM-Prompt有效解决了CVQA中的模态不平衡问题，提升了持续学习性能。

Abstract: Continual Visual Question Answering (CVQA) based on pre-trained models(PTMs)
has achieved promising progress by leveraging prompt tuning to enable continual
multi-modal learning. However, most existing methods adopt cross-modal prompt
isolation, constructing visual and textual prompts separately, which
exacerbates modality imbalance and leads to degraded performance over time. To
tackle this issue, we propose MM-Prompt, a novel framework incorporating
cross-modal prompt query and cross-modal prompt recovery. The former enables
balanced prompt selection by incorporating cross-modal signals during query
formation, while the latter promotes joint prompt reconstruction through
iterative cross-modal interactions, guided by an alignment loss to prevent
representational drift. Extensive experiments show that MM-Prompt surpasses
prior approaches in accuracy and knowledge retention, while maintaining
balanced modality engagement throughout continual learning.

Abstract: Over 8,024 wildfire incidents have been documented in 2024 alone, affecting
thousands of fatalities and significant damage to infrastructure and
ecosystems. Wildfires in the United States have inflicted devastating losses.
Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense, which highlights how urgently
efficient warning systems are needed to avoid disastrous outcomes. The goal of
this study is to enhance the accuracy of wildfire detection by using
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built on the VGG16 architecture. The D-FIRE
dataset, which includes several kinds of wildfire and non-wildfire images, was
employed in the study. Low-resolution images, dataset imbalance, and the
necessity for real-time applicability are some of the main challenges. These
problems were resolved by enriching the dataset using data augmentation
techniques and optimizing the VGG16 model for binary classification. The model
produced a low false negative rate, which is essential for reducing unexplored
fires, despite dataset boundaries. In order to help authorities execute fast
responses, this work shows that deep learning models such as VGG16 can offer a
reliable, automated approach for early wildfire recognition. For the purpose of
reducing the impact of wildfires, our future work will concentrate on
connecting to systems with real-time surveillance networks and enlarging the
dataset to cover more varied fire situations.

Motivation: 传统帧相机在快速变化场景中立体深度估计效果不佳，而脉冲相机提供微秒级分辨率的事件数据，但缺乏针对脉冲数据的专用算法和基准。

Method: 提出SpikeStereoNet，通过融合双视角脉冲流，利用循环脉冲神经网络（RSNN）迭代优化深度估计。

Result: 在合成和真实脉冲数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在纹理缺失和极端光照区域。

Conclusion: SpikeStereoNet展示了脉冲流在深度估计中的优势，且数据效率高，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Conventional frame-based cameras often struggle with stereo depth estimation
in rapidly changing scenes. In contrast, bio-inspired spike cameras emit
asynchronous events at microsecond-level resolution, providing an alternative
sensing modality. However, existing methods lack specialized stereo algorithms
and benchmarks tailored to the spike data. To address this gap, we propose
SpikeStereoNet, a brain-inspired framework and the first to estimate stereo
depth directly from raw spike streams. The model fuses raw spike streams from
two viewpoints and iteratively refines depth estimation through a recurrent
spiking neural network (RSNN) update module. To benchmark our approach, we
introduce a large-scale synthetic spike stream dataset and a real-world stereo
spike dataset with dense depth annotations. SpikeStereoNet outperforms existing
methods on both datasets by leveraging spike streams' ability to capture subtle
edges and intensity shifts in challenging regions such as textureless surfaces
and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore, our framework exhibits strong
data efficiency, maintaining high accuracy even with substantially reduced
training data. The source code and datasets will be publicly available.

Conclusion: VC3D是一种高效且高质量的3D矢量图形生成方法。

Abstract: 3D vector graphics play a crucial role in various applications including 3D
shape retrieval, conceptual design, and virtual reality interactions due to
their ability to capture essential structural information with minimal
representation. While recent approaches have shown promise in generating 3D
vector graphics, they often suffer from lengthy processing times and struggle
to maintain view consistency. To address these limitations, we propose
ViewCraft3D (VC3D), an efficient method that leverages 3D priors to generate 3D
vector graphics. Specifically, our approach begins with 3D object analysis,
employs a geometric extraction algorithm to fit 3D vector graphics to the
underlying structure, and applies view-consistent refinement process to enhance
visual quality. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VC3D outperforms
previous methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, while
significantly reducing computational overhead. The resulting 3D sketches
maintain view consistency and effectively capture the essential characteristics
of the original objects.

Abstract: Video action understanding tasks in real-world scenarios always suffer data
limitations. In this paper, we address the data-limited action understanding
problem by bridging data scarcity. We propose a novel method that employs a
text-to-video diffusion transformer to generate annotated data for model
training. This paradigm enables the generation of realistic annotated data on
an infinite scale without human intervention. We proposed the information
enhancement strategy and the uncertainty-based label smoothing tailored to
generate sample training. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we
observed that real samples generally contain a richer level of information than
generated samples. Based on this observation, the information enhancement
strategy is proposed to enhance the informative content of the generated
samples from two aspects: the environments and the characters. Furthermore, we
observed that some low-quality generated samples might negatively affect model
training. To address this, we devised the uncertainty-based label smoothing
strategy to increase the smoothing of these samples, thus reducing their
impact. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on four
datasets across five tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance for
zero-shot action recognition.

Conclusion: 通过系统性增强视觉依赖性，该方法显著减少了LVLM的幻觉问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually generate texts which satisfy
context coherence but don't match the visual input. Such a hallucination issue
hinders LVLMs' applicability in the real world. The key to solving
hallucination in LVLM is to make the text generation rely more on the visual
content. Most previous works choose to enhance/adjust the features/output of a
specific modality (i.e., visual or textual) to alleviate hallucinations in
LVLM, which do not explicitly or systematically enhance the visual reliance. In
this paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the
visual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective. Based
on our observations, we propose to mitigate hallucination in LVLM from three
aspects. Firstly, we observe that not all visual tokens are informative in
generating meaningful texts. We propose to evaluate and remove redundant visual
tokens to avoid their disturbance. Secondly, LVLM may encode inappropriate
prior information, making it lean toward generating unexpected words. We
propose a simple yet effective way to rectify the prior from a Bayesian
perspective. Thirdly, we observe that starting from certain steps, the
posterior of next-token prediction conditioned on visual tokens may collapse to
a prior distribution which does not depend on any informative visual tokens at
all. Thus, we propose to stop further text generation to avoid hallucination.
Extensive experiments on three benchmarks including POPE, CHAIR, and MME
demonstrate that our method can consistently mitigate the hallucination issue
of LVLM and performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition (IID) is the task of separating an image into
albedo and shade. In real-world scenes, it is difficult to quantitatively
assess IID quality due to the unavailability of ground truth. The existing
method provides the relative reflection intensities based on human-judged
annotations. However, these annotations have challenges in subjectivity,
relative evaluation, and hue non-assessment. To address these, we propose a
concept of quantitative evaluation with a calculated albedo from a
hyperspectral imaging and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) intensity.
Additionally, we introduce an optional albedo densification approach based on
spectral similarity. This paper conducted a concept verification in a
laboratory environment, and suggested the feasibility of an objective,
absolute, and hue-aware assessment. (This paper is accepted by IEEE ICIP 2025.

Motivation: 现有方法在零样本HOI检测中难以适应CLIP表示，因为CLIP倾向于忽略区分交互所需的细粒度信息。

Result: 实验表明，LAIN在多个零样本设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 局部性和交互感知对有效的零样本HOI检测至关重要。

Abstract: Recent methods for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection
typically leverage the generalization ability of large Vision-Language Model
(VLM), i.e., CLIP, on unseen categories, showing impressive results on various
zero-shot settings. However, existing methods struggle to adapt CLIP
representations for human-object pairs, as CLIP tends to overlook fine-grained
information necessary for distinguishing interactions. To address this issue,
we devise, LAIN, a novel zero-shot HOI detection framework enhancing the
locality and interaction awareness of CLIP representations. The locality
awareness, which involves capturing fine-grained details and the spatial
structure of individual objects, is achieved by aggregating the information and
spatial priors of adjacent neighborhood patches. The interaction awareness,
which involves identifying whether and how a human is interacting with an
object, is achieved by capturing the interaction pattern between the human and
the object. By infusing locality and interaction awareness into CLIP
representation, LAIN captures detailed information about the human-object
pairs. Our extensive experiments on existing benchmarks show that LAIN
outperforms previous methods on various zero-shot settings, demonstrating the
importance of locality and interaction awareness for effective zero-shot HOI
detection.

Abstract: Multimodal machine translation (MMT) seeks to address the challenges posed by
linguistic polysemy and ambiguity in translation tasks by incorporating visual
information. A key bottleneck in current MMT research is the effective
utilization of visual data. Previous approaches have focused on extracting
global or region-level image features and using attention or gating mechanisms
for multimodal information fusion. However, these methods have not adequately
tackled the issue of visual information redundancy in MMT, nor have they
proposed effective solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach--multimodal machine translation with visual Scene Graph Pruning (PSG),
which leverages language scene graph information to guide the pruning of
redundant nodes in visual scene graphs, thereby reducing noise in downstream
translation tasks. Through extensive comparative experiments with
state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of the PSG model. Our results also highlight the promising potential of visual
information pruning in advancing the field of MMT.

Abstract: Intra-operative data captured during image-guided surgery lacks sub-surface
information, where key regions of interest, such as vessels and tumors, reside.
Image-to-physical registration enables the fusion of pre-operative information
and intra-operative data, typically represented as a point cloud. However, this
registration process struggles due to partial visibility of the intra-operative
point cloud. In this research, we propose a patient-specific point cloud
completion approach to assist with the registration process. Specifically, we
leverage VN-OccNet to generate a complete liver surface from a partial
intra-operative point cloud. The network is trained in a patient-specific
manner, where simulated deformations from the pre-operative model are used to
train the model. First, we conduct an in-depth analysis of VN-OccNet's
rotation-equivariant property and its effectiveness in recovering complete
surfaces from partial intra-operative surfaces. Next, we integrate the
completed intra-operative surface into the Go-ICP registration algorithm to
demonstrate its utility in improving initial rigid registration outcomes. Our
results highlight the promise of this patient-specific completion approach in
mitigating the challenges posed by partial intra-operative visibility. The
rotation equivariant and surface generation capabilities of VN-OccNet hold
strong promise for developing robust registration frameworks for variations of
the intra-operative point cloud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化任务中，模型需学习新主题的同时保持原有生成能力，但标准训练目标与个性化目标不匹配，导致分布漂移。

Method: 提出基于Lipschitz约束的训练目标，显式限制与预训练分布的偏差。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CLIP-T、CLIP-I和DINO分数上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新方法有效控制分布漂移，提升了模型在个性化任务中的表现。

Abstract: Personalization using text-to-image diffusion models involves adapting a
pretrained model to novel subjects with only a few image examples. This task
presents a fundamental challenge, as the model must not only learn the new
subject effectively but also preserve its ability to generate diverse and
coherent outputs across a wide range of prompts. In other words, successful
personalization requires integrating new concepts without forgetting previously
learned generative capabilities. Forgetting denotes unintended distributional
drift, where the model's output distribution deviates from that of the original
pretrained model. In this paper, we provide an analysis of this issue and
identify a mismatch between standard training objectives and the goals of
personalization. To address this, we propose a new training objective based on
a Lipschitz-bounded formulation that explicitly constrains deviation from the
pretrained distribution. Our method provides improved control over
distributional drift and performs well even in data-scarce scenarios.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing personalization methods, achieving higher CLIP-T, CLIP-I, and DINO
scores.

Motivation: 解决图像分类任务中高质量标注数据不足的问题，推动深度学习模型在实际场景中的广泛应用。

Method: 构建基于GAN的半监督图像分类模型，引入生成器、判别器和分类器的协同训练机制。

Result: 实现了有限标注数据和大量未标注数据的有效利用，提高了图像生成质量和分类准确性。

Conclusion: 为复杂环境下的图像识别任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, image classification, as a core task in computer vision,
relies on high-quality labelled data, which restricts the wide application of
deep learning models in practical scenarios. To alleviate the problem of
insufficient labelled samples, semi-supervised learning has gradually become a
research hotspot. In this paper, we construct a semi-supervised image
classification model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and
through the introduction of the collaborative training mechanism of generators,
discriminators and classifiers, we achieve the effective use of limited
labelled data and a large amount of unlabelled data, improve the quality of
image generation and classification accuracy, and provide an effective solution
for the task of image recognition in complex environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏能够评估文本驱动视频编辑质量的专用VQA模型，导致其评估存在挑战。

Method: 构建了包含3,857个编辑视频的TDVE-DB数据集，并基于此提出了结合时空特征的TDVE-Assessor评估模型。

Result: TDVE-Assessor在三个评估维度上显著优于现有VQA模型。

Conclusion: TDVE-DB和TDVE-Assessor填补了文本驱动视频编辑评估的空白，并提升了评估性能。

Abstract: Text-driven video editing is rapidly advancing, yet its rigorous evaluation
remains challenging due to the absence of dedicated video quality assessment
(VQA) models capable of discerning the nuances of editing quality. To address
this critical gap, we introduce TDVE-DB, a large-scale benchmark dataset for
text-driven video editing. TDVE-DB consists of 3,857 edited videos generated
from 12 diverse models across 8 editing categories, and is annotated with
173,565 human subjective ratings along three crucial dimensions, i.e., edited
video quality, editing alignment, and structural consistency. Based on TDVE-DB,
we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation for the 12 state-of-the-art editing
models revealing the strengths and weaknesses of current video techniques, and
then benchmark existing VQA methods in the context of text-driven video editing
evaluation. Building on these insights, we propose TDVE-Assessor, a novel VQA
model specifically designed for text-driven video editing assessment.
TDVE-Assessor integrates both spatial and temporal video features into a large
language model (LLM) for rich contextual understanding to provide comprehensive
quality assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDVE-Assessor
substantially outperforms existing VQA models on TDVE-DB across all three
evaluation dimensions, setting a new state-of-the-art. Both TDVE-DB and
TDVE-Assessor will be released upon the publication.

TLDR: FlowCut提出了一种基于信息流的视觉令牌剪枝框架，解决了现有单层注意力评分方法的不足，显著提升了模型效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）因冗余视觉令牌导致计算成本高，而现有剪枝方法仅依赖单层注意力评分，未能充分捕捉令牌与层间的复杂交互。

Method: 通过分析信息流，发现CLS令牌作为信息中继，冗余是动态且逐层形成的，提出了FlowCut框架，结合信息流动态剪枝冗余令牌。

Result: FlowCut在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NeXT-7B上分别实现了1.6%和4.3%的性能提升，令牌减少率高达88.9%和94.4%，预填充阶段速度提升3.2倍。

Conclusion: FlowCut通过信息流分析优化了冗余令牌识别，显著提升了模型效率和性能，为LVLMs的剪枝提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but
suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing
pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and
prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the
interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic
question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify
redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant
visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models
the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves
between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information
relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy
emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration;
and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to
contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an
information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the
current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the
model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves
superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token
reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x
speed-up in the prefilling stage. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决现有测试时间训练（TTT）方法在3D点云分类中因依赖计算昂贵的反向传播而难以应用于实时场景的问题。

Conclusion: SMART-PC通过轻量级框架实现了实时适应和高性能分类，为3D点云分类中的分布偏移问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as a promising solution to address
distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification. However, existing methods
often rely on computationally expensive backpropagation during adaptation,
limiting their applicability in real-world, time-sensitive scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce SMART-PC, a skeleton-based framework that enhances
resilience to corruptions by leveraging the geometric structure of 3D point
clouds. During pre-training, our method predicts skeletal representations,
enabling the model to extract robust and meaningful geometric features that are
less sensitive to corruptions, thereby improving adaptability to test-time
distribution shifts. Unlike prior approaches, SMART-PC achieves real-time
adaptation by eliminating backpropagation and updating only BatchNorm
statistics, resulting in a lightweight and efficient framework capable of
achieving high frame-per-second rates while maintaining superior classification
performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including
ModelNet40-C, ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C, demonstrate that SMART-PC
achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing methods such as MATE
in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. The implementation is

Motivation: 手动布局设计耗时且复杂，现有图生成方法生成能力有限，视觉生成模型则忽视结构信息。

Method: 提出ASR模块，将图特征作为层次先验知识，替代传统ViT模块，结合LLM预测完整布局信息。

Result: 在RICO数据集上表现优异，定量（mIoU）和定性（用户研究）评估均验证其性能。

Conclusion: ASR模块在保持结构信息的同时增强了生成能力，支持多样化布局生成。

Abstract: Time consumption and the complexity of manual layout design make automated
layout generation a critical task, especially for multiple applications across
different mobile devices. Existing graph-based layout generation approaches
suffer from limited generative capability, often resulting in unreasonable and
incompatible outputs. Meanwhile, vision based generative models tend to
overlook the original structural information, leading to component
intersections and overlaps. To address these challenges, we propose an
Aggregation Structural Representation (ASR) module that integrates graph
networks with large language models (LLMs) to preserve structural information
while enhancing generative capability. This novel pipeline utilizes graph
features as hierarchical prior knowledge, replacing the traditional Vision
Transformer (ViT) module in multimodal large language models (MLLM) to predict
full layout information for the first time. Moreover, the intermediate graph
matrix used as input for the LLM is human editable, enabling progressive, human
centric design generation. A comprehensive evaluation on the RICO dataset
demonstrates the strong performance of ASR, both quantitatively using mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU), and qualitatively through a crowdsourced user
study. Additionally, sampling on relational features ensures diverse layout
generation, further enhancing the adaptability and creativity of the proposed
approach.

Conclusion: K-Buffers是一种有效的渲染增强方法，适用于多种神经场表示。

Abstract: Neural fields are now the central focus of research in 3D vision and computer
graphics. Existing methods mainly focus on various scene representations, such
as neural points and 3D Gaussians. However, few works have studied the
rendering process to enhance the neural fields. In this work, we propose a
plug-in method named K-Buffers that leverages multiple buffers to improve the
rendering performance. Our method first renders K buffers from scene
representations and constructs K pixel-wise feature maps. Then, We introduce a
K-Feature Fusion Network (KFN) to merge the K pixel-wise feature maps. Finally,
we adopt a feature decoder to generate the rendering image. We also introduce
an acceleration strategy to improve rendering speed and quality. We apply our
method to well-known radiance field baselines, including neural point fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method effectively enhances the rendering performance of neural point fields
and 3DGS.

Conclusion: 该框架为SAR-ATR中的少样本类增量学习提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems have
rapidly evolved to tackle incremental recognition challenges in operational
settings. Data scarcity remains a major hurdle that conventional SAR-ATR
techniques struggle to address. To cope with this challenge, we propose a
few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) framework based on a dual-branch
architecture that focuses on local feature extraction and leverages the
discrete Fourier transform and global filters to capture long-term spatial
dependencies. This incorporates a lightweight cross-attention mechanism that
fuses domain-specific features with global dependencies to ensure robust
feature interaction, while maintaining computational efficiency by introducing
minimal scale-shift parameters. The framework combines focal loss for class
distinction under imbalance and center loss for compact intra-class
distributions to enhance class separation boundaries. Experimental results on
the MSTAR benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in FSCIL SAR-ATR, attesting
to its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: 框架包含三个核心组件：生成式视觉语言模型（G-VLM）生成对象概念；概念感知视觉增强模块融合文本概念与视觉特征；认知启发解码器整合局部实例特征与语义线索。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模仿人类视觉认知过程，显著提升了开放词汇图像分割的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Open vocabulary image segmentation tackles the challenge of recognizing
dynamically adjustable, predefined novel categories at inference time by
leveraging vision-language alignment. However, existing paradigms typically
perform class-agnostic region segmentation followed by category matching, which
deviates from the human visual system's process of recognizing objects based on
semantic concepts, leading to poor alignment between region segmentation and
target concepts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Cognition-Inspired
Framework for open vocabulary image segmentation that emulates the human visual
recognition process: first forming a conceptual understanding of an object,
then perceiving its spatial extent. The framework consists of three core
components: (1) A Generative Vision-Language Model (G-VLM) that mimics human
cognition by generating object concepts to provide semantic guidance for region
segmentation. (2) A Concept-Aware Visual Enhancer Module that fuses textual
concept features with global visual representations, enabling adaptive visual
perception based on target concepts. (3) A Cognition-Inspired Decoder that
integrates local instance features with G-VLM-provided semantic cues, allowing
selective classification over a subset of relevant categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements,
reaching $27.2$ PQ, $17.0$ mAP, and $35.3$ mIoU on A-150. It further attains
$56.2$, $28.2$, $15.4$, $59.2$, $18.7$, and $95.8$ mIoU on Cityscapes,
Mapillary Vistas, A-847, PC-59, PC-459, and PAS-20, respectively. In addition,
our framework supports vocabulary-free segmentation, offering enhanced
flexibility in recognizing unseen categories. Code will be public.

Conclusion: VTBench将为虚拟试穿技术的未来发展提供有价值的指导，并将开源所有测试资源和数据。

Abstract: While virtual try-on has achieved significant progress, evaluating these
models towards real-world scenarios remains a challenge. A comprehensive
benchmark is essential for three key reasons:(1) Current metrics inadequately
reflect human perception, particularly in unpaired try-on settings;(2)Most
existing test sets are limited to indoor scenarios, lacking complexity for
real-world evaluation; and (3) An ideal system should guide future advancements
in virtual try-on generation. To address these needs, we introduce VTBench, a
hierarchical benchmark suite that systematically decomposes virtual image
try-on into hierarchical, disentangled dimensions, each equipped with tailored
test sets and evaluation criteria. VTBench exhibits three key advantages:1)
Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework: The benchmark encompasses five critical
dimensions for virtual try-on generation (e.g., overall image quality, texture
preservation, complex background consistency, cross-category size adaptability,
and hand-occlusion handling). Granular evaluation metrics of corresponding test
sets pinpoint model capabilities and limitations across diverse, challenging
scenarios.2) Human Alignment: Human preference annotations are provided for
each test set, ensuring the benchmark's alignment with perceptual quality
across all evaluation dimensions. (3) Valuable Insights: Beyond standard indoor
settings, we analyze model performance variations across dimensions and
investigate the disparity between indoor and real-world try-on scenarios. To
foster the field of virtual try-on towards challenging real-world scenario,
VTBench will be open-sourced, including all test sets, evaluation protocols,
generated results, and human annotations.

Abstract: Securing personal identity against deepfake attacks is increasingly critical
in the digital age, especially for celebrities and political figures whose
faces are easily accessible and frequently targeted. Most existing deepfake
detection methods focus on general-purpose scenarios and often ignore the
valuable prior knowledge of known facial identities, e.g., "VIP individuals"
whose authentic facial data are already available. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{VIPGuard}, a unified multimodal framework designed to capture
fine-grained and comprehensive facial representations of a given identity,
compare them against potentially fake or similar-looking faces, and reason over
these comparisons to make accurate and explainable predictions. Specifically,
our framework consists of three main stages. First, fine-tune a multimodal
large language model (MLLM) to learn detailed and structural facial attributes.
Second, we perform identity-level discriminative learning to enable the model
to distinguish subtle differences between highly similar faces, including real
and fake variations. Finally, we introduce user-specific customization, where
we model the unique characteristics of the target face identity and perform
semantic reasoning via MLLM to enable personalized and explainable deepfake
detection. Our framework shows clear advantages over previous detection works,
where traditional detectors mainly rely on low-level visual cues and provide no
human-understandable explanations, while other MLLM-based models often lack a
detailed understanding of specific face identities. To facilitate the
evaluation of our method, we built a comprehensive identity-aware benchmark
called \textbf{VIPBench} for personalized deepfake detection, involving the
latest 7 face-swapping and 7 entire face synthesis techniques for generation.

Abstract: Ratio-based biomarkers -- such as the proportion of necrotic tissue within a
tumor -- are widely used in clinical practice to support diagnosis, prognosis
and treatment planning. These biomarkers are typically estimated from soft
segmentation outputs by computing region-wise ratios. Despite the high-stakes
nature of clinical decision making, existing methods provide only point
estimates, offering no measure of uncertainty. In this work, we propose a
unified \textit{confidence-aware} framework for estimating ratio-based
biomarkers. We conduct a systematic analysis of error propagation in the
segmentation-to-biomarker pipeline and identify model miscalibration as the
dominant source of uncertainty. To mitigate this, we incorporate a lightweight,
post-hoc calibration module that can be applied using internal hospital data
without retraining. We leverage a tunable parameter $Q$ to control the
confidence level of the derived bounds, allowing adaptation towards clinical
practice. Extensive experiments show that our method produces statistically
sound confidence intervals, with tunable confidence levels, enabling more
trustworthy application of predictive biomarkers in clinical workflows.

Conclusion: Rep3D通过统一空间归纳偏置和优化感知学习，为3D医学图像分析提供了可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In contrast to vision transformers, which model long-range dependencies
through global self-attention, large kernel convolutions provide a more
efficient and scalable alternative, particularly in high-resolution 3D
volumetric settings. However, naively increasing kernel size often leads to
optimization instability and degradation in performance. Motivated by the
spatial bias observed in effective receptive fields (ERFs), we hypothesize that
different kernel elements converge at variable rates during training. To
support this, we derive a theoretical connection between element-wise gradients
and first-order optimization, showing that structurally re-parameterized
convolution blocks inherently induce spatially varying learning rates. Building
on this insight, we introduce Rep3D, a 3D convolutional framework that
incorporates a learnable spatial prior into large kernel training. A
lightweight two-stage modulation network generates a receptive-biased scaling
mask, adaptively re-weighting kernel updates and enabling local-to-global
convergence behavior. Rep3D adopts a plain encoder design with large depthwise
convolutions, avoiding the architectural complexity of multi-branch
compositions. We evaluate Rep3D on five challenging 3D segmentation benchmarks
and demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
including transformer-based and fixed-prior re-parameterization methods. By
unifying spatial inductive bias with optimization-aware learning, Rep3D offers
an interpretable, and scalable solution for 3D medical image analysis. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱方法缺乏明确攻击目标，易陷入局部最优且忽视跨模态交互，而VLMs内部潜在空间隐含安全决策边界，可被利用。

Method: JailBound分两阶段：(1)安全边界探测，近似潜在空间决策边界；(2)安全边界跨越，联合优化图像和文本对抗扰动。

Conclusion: 研究揭示VLMs潜在安全风险，亟需更鲁棒的防御机制。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive performance, yet the
integration of powerful vision encoders has significantly broadened their
attack surface, rendering them increasingly susceptible to jailbreak attacks.
However, lacking well-defined attack objectives, existing jailbreak methods
often struggle with gradient-based strategies prone to local optima and lacking
precise directional guidance, and typically decouple visual and textual
modalities, thereby limiting their effectiveness by neglecting crucial
cross-modal interactions. Inspired by the Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK)
framework, we posit that VLMs encode safety-relevant information within their
internal fusion-layer representations, revealing an implicit safety decision
boundary in the latent space. This motivates exploiting boundary to steer model
behavior. Accordingly, we propose JailBound, a novel latent space jailbreak
framework comprising two stages: (1) Safety Boundary Probing, which addresses
the guidance issue by approximating decision boundary within fusion layer's
latent space, thereby identifying optimal perturbation directions towards the
target region; and (2) Safety Boundary Crossing, which overcomes the
limitations of decoupled approaches by jointly optimizing adversarial
perturbations across both image and text inputs. This latter stage employs an
innovative mechanism to steer the model's internal state towards
policy-violating outputs while maintaining cross-modal semantic consistency.
Extensive experiments on six diverse VLMs demonstrate JailBound's efficacy,
achieves 94.32% white-box and 67.28% black-box attack success averagely, which
are 6.17% and 21.13% higher than SOTA methods, respectively. Our findings
expose a overlooked safety risk in VLMs and highlight the urgent need for more
robust defenses. Warning: This paper contains potentially sensitive, harmful

Abstract: Current multi-modal models exhibit a notable misalignment with the human
visual system when identifying objects that are visually assimilated into the
background. Our observations reveal that these multi-modal models cannot
distinguish concealed objects, demonstrating an inability to emulate human
cognitive processes which effectively utilize foreground-background similarity
principles for visual analysis. To analyze this hidden human-model visual
thinking discrepancy, we build a visual system that mimicks human visual
camouflaged perception to progressively and iteratively `refocus' visual
concealed content. The refocus is a progressive guidance mechanism enabling
models to logically localize objects in visual images through stepwise
reasoning. The localization process of concealed objects requires hierarchical
attention shifting with dynamic adjustment and refinement of prior cognitive
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a visual refocus reinforcement framework
via the policy optimization algorithm to encourage multi-modal models to think
and refocus more before answering, and achieve excellent reasoning abilities to
align and even surpass human camouflaged perception systems. Our extensive
experiments on camouflaged perception successfully demonstrate the emergence of
refocus visual phenomena, characterized by multiple reasoning tokens and
dynamic adjustment of the detection box. Besides, experimental results on both
camouflaged object classification and detection tasks exhibit significantly
superior performance compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: TESSER是一种新的对抗攻击框架，通过特征敏感梯度缩放和频谱平滑正则化，显著提高了对抗样本在ViT和CNN之间的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗迁移性是评估深度神经网络鲁棒性的关键挑战，尤其是在安全关键应用中，黑盒攻击的威胁评估需要有效的跨架构迁移攻击方法。

Result: 在ImageNet的12种架构上，TESSER比现有方法在CNN和ViT上的攻击成功率分别提高了10.9%和7.2%，并在对抗训练模型上达到53.55%的成功率。

Conclusion: TESSER通过语义有意义且频谱平滑的扰动，显著提升了对抗攻击的跨架构可迁移性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial transferability remains a critical challenge in evaluating the
robustness of deep neural networks. In security-critical applications,
transferability enables black-box attacks without access to model internals,
making it a key concern for real-world adversarial threat assessment. While
Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong adversarial performance,
existing attacks often fail to transfer effectively across architectures,
especially from ViTs to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or hybrid models.
In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TESSER} -- a novel adversarial attack
framework that enhances transferability via two key strategies: (1)
\textit{Feature-Sensitive Gradient Scaling (FSGS)}, which modulates gradients
based on token-wise importance derived from intermediate feature activations,
and (2) \textit{Spectral Smoothness Regularization (SSR)}, which suppresses
high-frequency noise in perturbations using a differentiable Gaussian prior.
These components work in tandem to generate perturbations that are both
semantically meaningful and spectrally smooth. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet across 12 diverse architectures demonstrate that TESSER achieves
+10.9\% higher attack succes rate (ASR) on CNNs and +7.2\% on ViTs compared to
the state-of-the-art Adaptive Token Tuning (ATT) method. Moreover, TESSER
significantly improves robustness against defended models, achieving 53.55\%
ASR on adversarially trained CNNs. Qualitative analysis shows strong alignment
between TESSER's perturbations and salient visual regions identified via
Grad-CAM, while frequency-domain analysis reveals a 12\% reduction in
high-frequency energy, confirming the effectiveness of spectral regularization.

Abstract: Self-supervised image denoising methods have garnered significant research
attention in recent years, for this kind of method reduces the requirement of
large training datasets. Compared to supervised methods, self-supervised
methods rely more on the prior embedded in deep networks themselves. As a
result, most of the self-supervised methods are designed with Convolution
Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures, which well capture one of the most
important image prior, translation equivariant prior. Inspired by the great
success achieved by the introduction of translational equivariance, in this
paper, we explore the way to further incorporate another important image prior.
Specifically, we first apply high-accuracy rotation equivariant convolution to
self-supervised image denoising. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we have
proved that simply replacing all the convolution layers with rotation
equivariant convolution layers would modify the network into its rotation
equivariant version. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
rotation equivariant image prior is introduced to self-supervised image
denoising at the network architecture level with a comprehensive theoretical
analysis of equivariance errors, which offers a new perspective to the field of
self-supervised image denoising. Moreover, to further improve the performance,
we design a new mask mechanism to fusion the output of rotation equivariant
network and vanilla CNN-based network, and construct an adaptive rotation
equivariant framework. Through extensive experiments on three typical methods,
we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TLDR: HF-VTON是一个新颖的虚拟试穿框架，通过三个模块解决几何变形、语义不一致和细节丢失问题，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿技术在保持不同姿势一致性方面存在挑战，如几何变形、语义不一致和细节丢失。

Method: HF-VTON包含三个模块：APWAM（对齐服装与姿势）、SRCM（增强语义表示）和MPAGM（优化外观生成），并引入SAMP-VTONS数据集。

Result: HF-VTON在VITON-HD和SAMP-VTONS数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在视觉保真度、语义一致性和细节保留方面。

Conclusion: HF-VTON通过多模块协同解决了虚拟试穿中的关键问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Virtual try-on technology has become increasingly important in the fashion
and retail industries, enabling the generation of high-fidelity garment images
that adapt seamlessly to target human models. While existing methods have
achieved notable progress, they still face significant challenges in
maintaining consistency across different poses. Specifically, geometric
distortions lead to a lack of spatial consistency, mismatches in garment
structure and texture across poses result in semantic inconsistency, and the
loss or distortion of fine-grained details diminishes visual fidelity. To
address these challenges, we propose HF-VTON, a novel framework that ensures
high-fidelity virtual try-on performance across diverse poses. HF-VTON consists
of three key modules: (1) the Appearance-Preserving Warp Alignment Module
(APWAM), which aligns garments to human poses, addressing geometric
deformations and ensuring spatial consistency; (2) the Semantic Representation
and Comprehension Module (SRCM), which captures fine-grained garment attributes
and multi-pose data to enhance semantic representation, maintaining structural,
textural, and pattern consistency; and (3) the Multimodal Prior-Guided
Appearance Generation Module (MPAGM), which integrates multimodal features and
prior knowledge from pre-trained models to optimize appearance generation,
ensuring both semantic and geometric consistency. Additionally, to overcome
data limitations in existing benchmarks, we introduce the SAMP-VTONS dataset,
featuring multi-pose pairs and rich textual annotations for a more
comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that HF-VTON
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both VITON-HD and SAMP-VTONS, excelling
in visual fidelity, semantic consistency, and detail preservation.

Abstract: Multimodal information retrieval (MIR) faces inherent challenges due to the
heterogeneity of data sources and the complexity of cross-modal alignment.
While previous studies have identified modal gaps in feature spaces, a
systematic approach to address these challenges remains unexplored. In this
work, we introduce UNITE, a universal framework that tackles these challenges
through two critical yet underexplored aspects: data curation and
modality-aware training configurations. Our work provides the first
comprehensive analysis of how modality-specific data properties influence
downstream task performance across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we propose
Modal-Aware Masked Contrastive Learning (MAMCL) to mitigate the competitive
relationships among the instances of different modalities. Our framework
achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks,
outperforming existing methods by notable margins. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that strategic modality curation and tailored
training protocols are pivotal for robust cross-modal representation learning.
This work not only advances MIR performance but also provides a foundational
blueprint for future research in multimodal systems. Our project is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在视觉生成领域因其高效性和兼容性受到关注，但其性能仍落后于连续模型，主要原因是噪声设计和采样启发式方法的不足。

Method: 提出ReDDiT框架，通过随机多索引破坏扩展吸收状态，增强离散扩散模型的表达能力，并设计反向随机吸收路径的rehash采样器。

Result: 实验显示ReDDiT显著优于基线（gFID从6.18降至1.61），并与连续模型性能相当且更高效。

Conclusion: ReDDiT通过改进噪声设计和采样方法，提升了离散扩散模型的生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are gaining traction in the visual generative area
for their efficiency and compatibility. However, the pioneered attempts still
fall behind the continuous counterparts, which we attribute to the noise
(absorbing state) design and sampling heuristics. In this study, we propose the
rehashing noise framework for discrete diffusion transformer, termed ReDDiT, to
extend absorbing states and improve expressive capacity of discrete diffusion
models. ReDDiT enriches the potential paths that latent variables can traverse
during training with randomized multi-index corruption. The derived rehash
sampler, which reverses the randomized absorbing paths, guarantees the
diversity and low discrepancy of the generation process. These reformulations
lead to more consistent and competitive generation quality, mitigating the need
for heavily tuned randomness. Experiments show that ReDDiT significantly
outperforms the baseline (reducing gFID from 6.18 to 1.61) and is on par with
the continuous counterparts with higher efficiency.

Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在不同域间泛化能力差，现有方法（如表示学习或数据增强）存在局限性，需更有效解决方案。

Method: 利用基于能量的模型（EBMs）和Langevin动态生成中间样本，通过对比散度训练，实现多源域泛化。

Result: LangDAug在Fundus分割和2D MRI前列腺分割任务中表现优于现有域泛化方法，并能补充现有域随机化方法。

Conclusion: LangDAug通过理论分析和实验验证，为医学图像分割的域泛化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models often struggle to generalize across
different domains due to various reasons. Domain Generalization (DG) methods
overcome this either through representation learning or data augmentation
(DAug). While representation learning methods seek domain-invariant features,
they often rely on ad-hoc techniques and lack formal guarantees. DAug methods,
which enrich model representations through synthetic samples, have shown
comparable or superior performance to representation learning approaches. We
propose LangDAug, a novel $\textbf{Lang}$evin $\textbf{D}$ata
$\textbf{Aug}$mentation for multi-source domain generalization in 2D medical
image segmentation. LangDAug leverages Energy-Based Models (EBMs) trained via
contrastive divergence to traverse between source domains, generating
intermediate samples through Langevin dynamics. Theoretical analysis shows that
LangDAug induces a regularization effect, and for GLMs, it upper-bounds the
Rademacher complexity by the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold.
Through extensive experiments on Fundus segmentation and 2D MRI prostate
segmentation benchmarks, we show that LangDAug outperforms state-of-the-art
domain generalization methods and effectively complements existing
domain-randomization approaches. The codebase for our method is available at
https://github.com/backpropagator/LangDAug.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多图像超分辨率方法受限于固定的窄注意力窗口，限制了特征感知范围，影响了图像对齐和特征聚合的效果。

Method: 设计了重叠跨窗口注意力和跨帧注意力机制，并引入了多扫描状态空间模块来增强特征聚合。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中表现出优越性能，ISO 12233分辨率测试进一步验证了其超分辨率效果的提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过改进注意力机制和特征聚合，显著提升了多图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Multi-image super-resolution (MISR) can achieve higher image quality than
single-image super-resolution (SISR) by aggregating sub-pixel information from
multiple spatially shifted frames. Among MISR tasks, burst super-resolution
(BurstSR) has gained significant attention due to its wide range of
applications. Recent methods have increasingly adopted Transformers over
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in super-resolution tasks, due to their
superior ability to capture both local and global context. However, most
existing approaches still rely on fixed and narrow attention windows that
restrict the perception of features beyond the local field. This limitation
hampers alignment and feature aggregation, both of which are crucial for
high-quality super-resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
feature extractor that incorporates two newly designed attention mechanisms:
overlapping cross-window attention and cross-frame attention, enabling more
precise and efficient extraction of sub-pixel information across multiple
frames. Furthermore, we introduce a Multi-scan State-Space Module with the
cross-frame attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of our approach. Additional evaluations on ISO 12233 resolution
test charts further confirm its enhanced super-resolution performance.

Motivation: 随着MLRMs视觉推理能力的增强，其安全风险未被充分探索，尤其是对越狱攻击的脆弱性。

Method: 提出VisCRA框架，结合视觉注意力掩码和两阶段推理诱导策略，精准控制有害输出。

Result: VisCRA在多个主流MLRMs上攻击成功率显著（如Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking达76.48%）。

Conclusion: MLRMs的视觉推理能力既是其优势，也可能成为攻击载体，需重视安全风险。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLRMs) has enabled
sophisticated visual reasoning capabilities by integrating reinforcement
learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. However, while these enhanced
reasoning capabilities improve performance, they also introduce new and
underexplored safety risks. In this work, we systematically investigate the
security implications of advanced visual reasoning in MLRMs. Our analysis
reveals a fundamental trade-off: as visual reasoning improves, models become
more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Motivated by this critical finding, we
introduce VisCRA (Visual Chain Reasoning Attack), a novel jailbreak framework
that exploits the visual reasoning chains to bypass safety mechanisms. VisCRA
combines targeted visual attention masking with a two-stage reasoning induction
strategy to precisely control harmful outputs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate VisCRA's significant effectiveness, achieving high attack success
rates on leading closed-source MLRMs: 76.48% on Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking,
68.56% on QvQ-Max, and 56.60% on GPT-4o. Our findings highlight a critical
insight: the very capability that empowers MLRMs -- their visual reasoning --
can also serve as an attack vector, posing significant security risks.

Abstract: Camera sensor simulation serves as a critical role for autonomous driving
(AD), e.g. evaluating vision-based AD algorithms. While existing approaches
have leveraged generative models for controllable image/video generation, they
remain constrained to generating multi-view video sequences with fixed camera
viewpoints and video frequency, significantly limiting their downstream
applications. To address this, we present a generalizable camera simulation
framework DriveCamSim, whose core innovation lies in the proposed Explicit
Camera Modeling (ECM) mechanism. Instead of implicit interaction through
vanilla attention, ECM establishes explicit pixel-wise correspondences across
multi-view and multi-frame dimensions, decoupling the model from overfitting to
the specific camera configurations (intrinsic/extrinsic parameters, number of
views) and temporal sampling rates presented in the training data. For
controllable generation, we identify the issue of information loss inherent in
existing conditional encoding and injection pipelines, proposing an
information-preserving control mechanism. This control mechanism not only
improves conditional controllability, but also can be extended to be
identity-aware to enhance temporal consistency in foreground object rendering.
With above designs, our model demonstrates superior performance in both visual
quality and controllability, as well as generalization capability across
spatial-level (camera parameters variations) and temporal-level (video frame
rate variations), enabling flexible user-customizable camera simulation
tailored to diverse application scenarios. Code will be avaliable at
https://github.com/swc-17/DriveCamSim for facilitating future research.

Conclusion: KCDP框架有效解决了跨域情感识别问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is a critical yet challenging task aimed at
inferring emotional states of individuals based on visual cues. However,
existing works focus on single domains, e.g., realistic images or stickers,
limiting VER models' cross-domain generalizability. To fill this gap, we
introduce an Unsupervised Cross-Domain Visual Emotion Recognition (UCDVER)
task, which aims to generalize visual emotion recognition from the source
domain (e.g., realistic images) to the low-resource target domain (e.g.,
stickers) in an unsupervised manner. Compared to the conventional unsupervised
domain adaptation problems, UCDVER presents two key challenges: a significant
emotional expression variability and an affective distribution shift. To
mitigate these issues, we propose the Knowledge-aligned
Counterfactual-enhancement Diffusion Perception (KCDP) framework. Specifically,
KCDP leverages a VLM to align emotional representations in a shared knowledge
space and guides diffusion models for improved visual affective perception.
Furthermore, a Counterfactual-Enhanced Language-image Emotional Alignment
(CLIEA) method generates high-quality pseudo-labels for the target domain.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses SOTA models in both
perceptibility and generalization, e.g., gaining 12% improvements over the SOTA
VER model TGCA-PVT. The project page is at https://yinwen2019.github.io/ucdver.

Result: 提出改革路线图，包括丰富数据集和设计新评估指标。

Conclusion: 通过重新定义质量评估任务，推动更鲁棒、人性化和可信赖的评估系统。

Abstract: This position paper argues that Mean Opinion Score (MOS), while historically
foundational, is no longer sufficient as the sole supervisory signal for
multimedia quality assessment models. MOS reduces rich, context-sensitive human
judgments to a single scalar, obscuring semantic failures, user intent, and the
rationale behind quality decisions. We contend that modern quality assessment
models must integrate three interdependent capabilities: (1) context-awareness,
to adapt evaluations to task-specific goals and viewing conditions; (2)
reasoning, to produce interpretable, evidence-grounded justifications for
quality judgments; and (3) multimodality, to align perceptual and semantic cues
using vision-language models. We critique the limitations of current
MOS-centric benchmarks and propose a roadmap for reform: richer datasets with
contextual metadata and expert rationales, and new evaluation metrics that
assess semantic alignment, reasoning fidelity, and contextual sensitivity. By
reframing quality assessment as a contextual, explainable, and multimodal
modeling task, we aim to catalyze a shift toward more robust, human-aligned,
and trustworthy evaluation systems.

Conclusion: Point-RFT展示了视觉基础CoT在多模态推理中的有效性及泛化潜力，适用于复杂现实场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have significantly improved textual
reasoning through the effective use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and reinforcement
learning. However, extending these successes to vision-language tasks remains
challenging due to inherent limitations in text-only CoT, such as visual
hallucinations and insufficient multimodal integration. In this paper, we
introduce Point-RFT, a multimodal reasoning framework explicitly designed to
leverage visually grounded CoT reasoning for visual document understanding. Our
approach consists of two stages: First, we conduct format finetuning using a
curated dataset of 71K diverse visual reasoning problems, each annotated with
detailed, step-by-step rationales explicitly grounded to corresponding visual
elements. Second, we employ reinforcement finetuning targeting visual document
understanding. On ChartQA, our approach improves accuracy from 70.88%
(format-finetuned baseline) to 90.04%, surpassing the 83.92% accuracy achieved
by reinforcement finetuning relying solely on text-based CoT. The result shows
that our grounded CoT is more effective for multimodal reasoning compared with
the text-only CoT. Moreover, Point-RFT exhibits superior generalization
capability across several out-of-domain visual document reasoning benchmarks,
including CharXiv, PlotQA, IconQA, TabMWP, etc., and highlights its potential
in complex real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法仅通过适配器生成伪文本标记，未能直接优化组合查询表示，限制了检索性能。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）构建两个互补任务，联合优化视觉语言模型（VLM）。

Result: 通过理论和实证验证，方法显著提升了组合检索能力。

Conclusion: MVFT-JI结合了VLM的语义对齐和MLLM的推理能力，有效提升了复杂视觉变换下的检索性能。

Abstract: Existing Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) methods typically train
adapters that convert reference images into pseudo-text tokens, which are
concatenated with the modifying text and processed by frozen text encoders in
pretrained VLMs or LLMs. While this design leverages the strengths of large
pretrained models, it only supervises the adapter to produce encoder-compatible
tokens that loosely preserve visual semantics. Crucially, it does not directly
optimize the composed query representation to capture the full intent of the
composition or to align with the target semantics, thereby limiting retrieval
performance, particularly in cases involving fine-grained or complex visual
transformations. To address this problem, we propose MLLM-Guided VLM
Fine-Tuning with Joint Inference (MVFT-JI), a novel approach that leverages a
pretrained multimodal large language model (MLLM) to construct two
complementary training tasks using only unlabeled images: target text retrieval
taskand text-to-image retrieval task. By jointly optimizing these tasks, our
method enables the VLM to inherently acquire robust compositional retrieval
capabilities, supported by the provided theoretical justifications and
empirical validation. Furthermore, during inference, we further prompt the MLLM
to generate target texts from composed queries and compute retrieval scores by
integrating similarities between (i) the composed query and candidate images,
and (ii) the MLLM-generated target text and candidate images. This strategy
effectively combines the VLM's semantic alignment strengths with the MLLM's
reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Accurately delineating the visual pathway (VP) is crucial for understanding
the human visual system and diagnosing related disorders. Exploring
multi-parametric MR imaging data has been identified as an important way to
delineate VP. However, due to the complex cross-sequence relationships,
existing methods cannot effectively model the complementary information from
different MRI sequences. In addition, these existing methods heavily rely on
large training data with labels, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming to
obtain. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-parametric
feature decomposition framework for VP delineation. Specifically, a
correlation-constrained feature decomposition (CFD) is designed to handle the
complex cross-sequence relationships by capturing the unique characteristics of
each MRI sequence and easing the multi-parametric information fusion process.
Furthermore, a consistency-based sample enhancement (CSE) module is developed
to address the limited labeled data issue, by generating and promoting
meaningful edge information from unlabeled data. We validate our framework
using two public datasets, and one in-house Multi-Shell Diffusion MRI (MDM)
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in
terms of delineation performance when compared to seven state-of-the-art
approaches.

Conclusion: HAODiff通过自适应双提示有效利用分类器自由引导，显著提升了图像恢复性能。

Abstract: Human-centered images often suffer from severe generic degradation during
transmission and are prone to human motion blur (HMB), making restoration
challenging. Existing research lacks sufficient focus on these issues, as both
problems often coexist in practice. To address this, we design a degradation
pipeline that simulates the coexistence of HMB and generic noise, generating
synthetic degraded data to train our proposed HAODiff, a human-aware one-step
diffusion. Specifically, we propose a triple-branch dual-prompt guidance (DPG),
which leverages high-quality images, residual noise (LQ minus HQ), and HMB
segmentation masks as training targets. It produces a positive-negative prompt
pair for classifier-free guidance (CFG) in a single diffusion step. The
resulting adaptive dual prompts let HAODiff exploit CFG more effectively,
boosting robustness against diverse degradations. For fair evaluation, we
introduce MPII-Test, a benchmark rich in combined noise and HMB cases.
Extensive experiments show that our HAODiff surpasses existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality on
synthetic and real-world datasets, including our introduced MPII-Test. Code is

Abstract: Accurate identification of acute cellular rejection (ACR) in endomyocardial
biopsies is essential for effective management of heart transplant patients.
However, the rarity of high-grade rejection cases (3R) presents a significant
challenge for training robust deep learning models. This work addresses the
class imbalance problem by leveraging synthetic data generation using StyleGAN
to augment the limited number of real 3R images. Prior to GAN training,
histogram equalization was applied to standardize image appearance and improve
the consistency of tissue representation. StyleGAN was trained on available 3R
biopsy patches and subsequently used to generate 10,000 realistic synthetic
images. These were combined with real 0R samples, that is samples without
rejection, in various configurations to train ResNet-18 classifiers for binary
rejection classification.
  Three classifier variants were evaluated: one trained on real 0R and
synthetic 3R images, another using both synthetic and additional real samples,
and a third trained solely on real data. All models were tested on an
independent set of real biopsy images. Results demonstrate that synthetic data
improves classification performance, particularly when used in combination with
real samples. The highest-performing model, which used both real and synthetic
images, achieved strong precision and recall for both classes. These findings
underscore the value of hybrid training strategies and highlight the potential
of GAN-based data augmentation in biomedical image analysis, especially in
domains constrained by limited annotated datasets.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present our solution to the CVPR 2025 Visual
Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) 3.0 Workshop Challenge Track 1: Adapt &
Detect: Robust Anomaly Detection in Real-World Applications. In real-world
industrial anomaly detection, it is crucial to accurately identify anomalies
with physical complexity, such as transparent or reflective surfaces,
occlusions, and low-contrast contaminations. The recently proposed MVTec AD 2
dataset significantly narrows the gap between publicly available benchmarks and
anomalies found in real-world industrial environments. To address the
challenges posed by this dataset--such as complex and varying lighting
conditions and real anomalies with large scale differences--we propose a fully
training-free anomaly detection and segmentation method based on feature
extraction using the DINOv2 model named SuperAD. Our method carefully selects a
small number of normal reference images and constructs a memory bank by
leveraging the strong representational power of DINOv2. Anomalies are then
segmented by performing nearest neighbor matching between test image features
and the memory bank. Our method achieves competitive results on both test sets
of the MVTec AD 2 dataset.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition aims at separating an image into its underlying
albedo and shading components, isolating the base color from lighting effects
to enable downstream applications such as virtual relighting and scene editing.
Despite the rise and success of learning-based approaches, intrinsic image
decomposition from real-world images remains a significant challenging task due
to the scarcity of labeled ground-truth data. Most existing solutions rely on
synthetic data as supervised setups, limiting their ability to generalize to
real-world scenes. Self-supervised methods, on the other hand, often produce
albedo maps that contain reflections and lack consistency under different
lighting conditions. To address this, we propose SAIL, an approach designed to
estimate albedo-like representations from single-view real-world images. We
repurpose the prior knowledge of a latent diffusion model for unconditioned
scene relighting as a surrogate objective for albedo estimation. To extract the
albedo, we introduce a novel intrinsic image decomposition fully formulated in
the latent space. To guide the training of our latent diffusion model, we
introduce regularization terms that constrain both the lighting-dependent and
independent components of our latent image decomposition. SAIL predicts stable
albedo under varying lighting conditions and generalizes to multiple scenes,
using only unlabeled multi-illumination data available online.

Motivation: 高分辨率图像渲染计算密集，而自然场景通常是分段平滑的，密集采样冗余。

Method: 采用深度引导的捆绑采样策略，动态分配采样点，复杂区域多采样，平滑区域少采样。

Result: 在DTU数据集上PSNR提升1.27 dB，FPS提高47%，渲染速度提升2倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在渲染质量和效率上均优于现有通用方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generalizable novel view synthesis have achieved
impressive quality through interpolation between nearby views. However,
rendering high-resolution images remains computationally intensive due to the
need for dense sampling of all rays. Recognizing that natural scenes are
typically piecewise smooth and sampling all rays is often redundant, we propose
a novel depth-guided bundle sampling strategy to accelerate rendering. By
grouping adjacent rays into a bundle and sampling them collectively, a shared
representation is generated for decoding all rays within the bundle. To further
optimize efficiency, our adaptive sampling strategy dynamically allocates
samples based on depth confidence, concentrating more samples in complex
regions while reducing them in smoother areas. When applied to ENeRF, our
method achieves up to a 1.27 dB PSNR improvement and a 47% increase in FPS on
the DTU dataset. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art rendering quality and up to 2x faster rendering
compared to existing generalizable methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: ViT-P无需预训练适配器，可灵活集成预训练模型，同时通过粗标注降低标注成本。

Abstract: Image segmentation remains a challenging task in computer vision, demanding
robust mask generation and precise classification. Recent mask-based approaches
yield high-quality masks by capturing global context. However, accurately
classifying these masks, especially in the presence of ambiguous boundaries and
imbalanced class distributions, remains an open challenge. In this work, we
introduce ViT-P, a novel two-stage segmentation framework that decouples mask
generation from classification. The first stage employs a proposal generator to
produce class-agnostic mask proposals, while the second stage utilizes a
point-based classification model built on the Vision Transformer (ViT) to
refine predictions by focusing on mask central points. ViT-P serves as a
pre-training-free adapter, allowing the integration of various pre-trained
vision transformers without modifying their architecture, ensuring adaptability
to dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coarse and bounding
box annotations can effectively enhance classification without requiring
additional training on fine annotation datasets, reducing annotation costs
while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments across COCO,
ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets validate the effectiveness of ViT-P, achieving
state-of-the-art results with 54.0 PQ on ADE20K panoptic segmentation, 87.4
mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, and 63.6 mIoU on ADE20K semantic

Conclusion: EQ-Reg为非严格等变网络提供了一种简单有效的自适应机制，适用于图像恢复任务。

Abstract: Equivariant and invariant deep learning models have been developed to exploit
intrinsic symmetries in data, demonstrating significant effectiveness in
certain scenarios. However, these methods often suffer from limited
representation accuracy and rely on strict symmetry assumptions that may not
hold in practice. These limitations pose a significant drawback for image
restoration tasks, which demands high accuracy and precise symmetry
representation. To address these challenges, we propose a rotation-equivariant
regularization strategy that adaptively enforces the appropriate symmetry
constraints on the data while preserving the network's representational
accuracy. Specifically, we introduce EQ-Reg, a regularizer designed to enhance
rotation equivariance, which innovatively extends the insights of
data-augmentation-based and equivariant-based methodologies. This is achieved
through self-supervised learning and the spatial rotation and cyclic channel
shift of feature maps deduce in the equivariant framework. Our approach firstly
enables a non-strictly equivariant network suitable for image restoration,
providing a simple and adaptive mechanism for adjusting equivariance based on
task. Extensive experiments across three low-level tasks demonstrate the
superior accuracy and generalization capability of our method, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: The design of convolutional neural architectures that are exactly equivariant
to continuous translations is an active field of research. It promises to
benefit scientific computing, notably by making existing imaging systems more
physically accurate. Most efforts focus on the design of downsampling/pooling
layers, upsampling layers and activation functions, but little attention is
dedicated to normalization layers. In this work, we present a novel theoretical
framework for understanding the equivariance of normalization layers to
discrete shifts and continuous translations. We also determine necessary and
sufficient conditions for normalization layers to be equivariant in terms of
the dimensions they operate on. Using real feature maps from ResNet-18 and
ImageNet, we test those theoretical results empirically and find that they are
consistent with our predictions.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to adapting multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
to new tasks have relied heavily on fine-tuning. This paper introduces
Efficient Multi-Modal Long Context Learning (EMLoC), a novel training-free
alternative that embeds demonstration examples directly into the model input.
EMLoC offers a more efficient, flexible, and scalable solution for task
adaptation. Because extremely lengthy inputs introduce prohibitive
computational and memory overhead, EMLoC contributes a chunk-wise compression
mechanism combined with layer-wise adaptive pruning. It condenses long-context
multimodal inputs into compact, task-specific memory representations. By
adaptively pruning tokens at each layer under a Jensen-Shannon divergence
constraint, our method achieves a dramatic reduction in inference complexity
without sacrificing performance. This approach is the first to seamlessly
integrate compression and pruning techniques for multi-modal long-context
learning, offering a scalable and efficient solution for real-world
applications. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks
demonstrate that EMLoC achieves performance on par with or superior to naive
long-context approaches. Our results highlight the potential of EMLoC as a
groundbreaking framework for efficient and flexible adaptation of multi-modal
models in resource-constrained environments. Codes are publicly available at

Conclusion: GoLF-NRT通过全局与局部特征融合及自适应采样，显著提升了少量输入视图下的神经渲染质量。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have transformed novel view synthesis by
modeling scene-specific volumetric representations directly from images. While
generalizable NeRF models can generate novel views across unknown scenes by
learning latent ray representations, their performance heavily depends on a
large number of multi-view observations. However, with limited input views,
these methods experience significant degradation in rendering quality. To
address this limitation, we propose GoLF-NRT: a Global and Local feature
Fusion-based Neural Rendering Transformer. GoLF-NRT enhances generalizable
neural rendering from few input views by leveraging a 3D transformer with
efficient sparse attention to capture global scene context. In parallel, it
integrates local geometric features extracted along the epipolar line, enabling
high-quality scene reconstruction from as few as 1 to 3 input views.
Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy based on attention
weights and kernel regression, improving the accuracy of transformer-based
neural rendering. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that GoLF-NRT
achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying numbers of input views,
highlighting the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. Code is

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis and
autonomous driving and has a problem with the high cost of annotating the
labels required in training. To address this problem, semantic segmentation
methods based on semi-supervised learning with a small number of labeled data
have been proposed. For example, one approach is to train a semantic
segmentation model using images with annotated labels and pseudo labels. In
this approach, the accuracy of the semantic segmentation model depends on the
quality of the pseudo labels, and the quality of the pseudo labels depends on
the performance of the model to be trained and the amount of data with
annotated labels. In this paper, we generate pseudo labels using zero-shot
annotation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP), improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels using the Unified
Dual-Stream Perturbations Approach (UniMatch), and use them as enhanced labels
to train a semantic segmentation model. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is demonstrated through the experiments using the public datasets:
PASCAL and MS COCO.

Result: 实验表明，现有基准表现优秀的模型在2-needle视觉定位任务中表现不佳，且性能与两事件距离负相关。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在长上下文和因果关系建模方面存在显著局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating the video understanding capabilities of Video-Language Models
(VLMs) remains a significant challenge. We propose a long-context video
understanding benchmark, Causal2Needles, that assesses two crucial abilities
insufficiently evaluated by existing benchmarks: (1) the ability to extract
information from two separate locations in a long video and understand them
jointly, and (2) the ability to model the world in terms of cause and effect in
human behaviors. Specifically, Causal2Needles introduces 2-needle questions,
which require extracting information from both the cause and effect
human-behavior events in a long video and the associated narration text. To
prevent textual bias, these questions comprise two complementary formats: one
asking to identify the video clip containing the answer, and one asking for the
textual description of an unrelated visual detail from that video clip. Our
experiments reveal that models excelling in pre-existing benchmarks struggle
with 2-needle visual grounding, and the model performance is negatively
correlated with the distance between the two needles. These findings highlight
critical limitations in current VLMs.

Motivation: Gaussian Splatting (GS)在多视图图像下表现良好，但在输入图像有限时重建精度显著下降，原因是稀疏点云初始化不足。

Method: Sparse2DGS利用DUSt3R和COLMAP MVS生成密集3D点云，用于初始化2D高斯，提升重建精度。

Result: 在DTU数据集上，Sparse2DGS仅用三张图像即可准确重建物体3D形状。

Conclusion: Sparse2DGS解决了GS在稀疏输入下的局限性，为有限图像条件下的3D重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has gained attention as a fast and effective method
for novel view synthesis. It has also been applied to 3D reconstruction using
multi-view images and can achieve fast and accurate 3D reconstruction. However,
GS assumes that the input contains a large number of multi-view images, and
therefore, the reconstruction accuracy significantly decreases when only a
limited number of input images are available. One of the main reasons is the
insufficient number of 3D points in the sparse point cloud obtained through
Structure from Motion (SfM), which results in a poor initialization for
optimizing the Gaussian primitives. We propose a new 3D reconstruction method,
called Sparse2DGS, to enhance 2DGS in reconstructing objects using only three
images. Sparse2DGS employs DUSt3R, a fundamental model for stereo images, along
with COLMAP MVS to generate highly accurate and dense 3D point clouds, which
are then used to initialize 2D Gaussians. Through experiments on the DTU
dataset, we show that Sparse2DGS can accurately reconstruct the 3D shapes of
objects using just three images.

TLDR: UniVF提出了一种基于多帧学习和光流特征扭曲的视频融合框架，解决了传统静态图像融合方法在视频中导致的闪烁和时间不一致问题。同时，推出了首个综合性视频融合基准VF-Bench，涵盖四种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界是动态的，但现有图像融合方法独立处理静态帧，忽略了视频中的时间相关性，导致闪烁和时间不一致。

Method: UniVF利用多帧学习和光流特征扭曲实现时间一致的视频融合。VF-Bench通过合成数据和现有数据集提供高质量对齐视频对，并统一评估协议。

Result: UniVF在VF-Bench的所有任务中均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: UniVF为视频融合提供了时间一致的高质量解决方案，VF-Bench为未来研究提供了标准化评估平台。

Abstract: The real world is dynamic, yet most image fusion methods process static
frames independently, ignoring temporal correlations in videos and leading to
flickering and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we propose Unified
Video Fusion (UniVF), a novel framework for temporally coherent video fusion
that leverages multi-frame learning and optical flow-based feature warping for
informative, temporally coherent video fusion. To support its development, we
also introduce Video Fusion Benchmark (VF-Bench), the first comprehensive
benchmark covering four video fusion tasks: multi-exposure, multi-focus,
infrared-visible, and medical fusion. VF-Bench provides high-quality,
well-aligned video pairs obtained through synthetic data generation and
rigorous curation from existing datasets, with a unified evaluation protocol
that jointly assesses the spatial quality and temporal consistency of video
fusion. Extensive experiments show that UniVF achieves state-of-the-art results
across all tasks on VF-Bench. Project page: https://vfbench.github.io.

TLDR: FruitNeRF++是一种结合对比学习和神经辐射场的新型水果计数方法，通过形状无关的多水果计数框架提升实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FruitNeRF方法对每种水果类型需要单独适配，限制了其实际应用。FruitNeRF++旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用视觉基础模型预测的实例掩码，将水果身份编码到神经实例场中，通过体积采样提取点云并聚类计数。

Result: 在合成和真实苹果数据集上表现优异，优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: FruitNeRF++更易控制且实用性强，适用于多水果计数。

Abstract: We introduce FruitNeRF++, a novel fruit-counting approach that combines
contrastive learning with neural radiance fields to count fruits from
unstructured input photographs of orchards. Our work is based on FruitNeRF,
which employs a neural semantic field combined with a fruit-specific clustering
approach. The requirement for adaptation for each fruit type limits the
applicability of the method, and makes it difficult to use in practice. To lift
this limitation, we design a shape-agnostic multi-fruit counting framework,
that complements the RGB and semantic data with instance masks predicted by a
vision foundation model. The masks are used to encode the identity of each
fruit as instance embeddings into a neural instance field. By volumetrically
sampling the neural fields, we extract a point cloud embedded with the instance
features, which can be clustered in a fruit-agnostic manner to obtain the fruit
count. We evaluate our approach using a synthetic dataset containing apples,
plums, lemons, pears, peaches, and mangoes, as well as a real-world benchmark
apple dataset. Our results demonstrate that FruitNeRF++ is easier to control
and compares favorably to other state-of-the-art methods.

TLDR: 论文探讨了训练无关技术（如CFG和FreeU）在Score Distillation Sampling（SDS）中的应用，发现CFG和FreeU的尺度调整分别影响物体大小与表面平滑度、纹理细节与几何误差的权衡。基于此，提出了一种动态调整策略，以优化文本到3D生成的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究训练无关技术（如CFG和FreeU）在SDS中的影响，以提升文本到3D生成的质量。

Method: 通过实验分析CFG和FreeU在SDS中的不同尺度对生成效果的影响，并提出动态调整策略。

Result: CFG尺度调整影响物体大小与表面平滑度，FreeU尺度调整影响纹理细节与几何误差。动态调整策略在纹理细节与表面平滑度之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: 动态调整训练无关技术的尺度可以有效优化文本到3D生成的质量，减少几何缺陷。

Abstract: Recent studies show that simple training-free techniques can dramatically
improve the quality of text-to-2D generation outputs, e.g. Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) or FreeU. However, these training-free techniques have been
underexplored in the lens of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which is a
popular and effective technique to leverage the power of pretrained text-to-2D
diffusion models for various tasks. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the
effect such training-free techniques have on SDS, via a particular application
of text-to-3D generation via 2D lifting. We present our findings, which show
that varying the scales of CFG presents a trade-off between object size and
surface smoothness, while varying the scales of FreeU presents a trade-off
between texture details and geometric errors. Based on these findings, we
provide insights into how we can effectively harness training-free techniques
for SDS, via a strategic scaling of such techniques in a dynamic manner with
respect to the timestep or optimization iteration step. We show that using our
proposed scheme strikes a favorable balance between texture details and surface
smoothness in text-to-3D generations, while preserving the size of the output
and mitigating the occurrence of geometric defects.

TLDR: Deep Spectral Prior (DSP) 是一种改进的 Deep Image Prior (DIP)，通过频域对齐实现图像重建，无需依赖像素级损失和早停策略，直接匹配傅里叶系数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 DIP 依赖像素级损失和早停来避免过拟合，但效果有限。DSP 通过频域对齐引入显式频谱一致性偏置，更符合图像频率结构和 CNN 的频谱偏置。

Method: DSP 将重建问题转化为频域对齐，直接匹配网络输出与观测数据的傅里叶系数，作为隐式频谱正则化器。

Result: DSP 在去噪、修复和超分辨率任务中表现优于传统 DIP 和其他无监督基线，理论分析支持其平滑收敛、局部稳定性和良好的偏差-方差权衡。

Conclusion: DSP 通过频域对齐和隐式正则化，显著提升了图像重建的性能和鲁棒性，同时增强了可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce Deep Spectral Prior (DSP), a new formulation of Deep Image Prior
(DIP) that redefines image reconstruction as a frequency-domain alignment
problem. Unlike traditional DIP, which relies on pixel-wise loss and early
stopping to mitigate overfitting, DSP directly matches Fourier coefficients
between the network output and observed measurements. This shift introduces an
explicit inductive bias towards spectral coherence, aligning with the known
frequency structure of images and the spectral bias of convolutional neural
networks. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating that DSP
acts as an implicit spectral regulariser, suppressing high-frequency noise by
design and eliminating the need for early stopping. Our analysis spans four
core dimensions establishing smooth convergence dynamics, local stability, and
favourable bias-variance tradeoffs. We further show that DSP naturally projects
reconstructions onto a frequency-consistent manifold, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. These theoretical guarantees are supported by
empirical results across denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks,
where DSP consistently outperforms classical DIP and other unsupervised
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风格对齐的文本到图像生成需要大量特定风格的三元组数据，获取难度大，传统方法难以满足需求。

Method: 结合专门设计的数据整理方法和AR模型，利用文本到图像二元数据生成风格对齐图像，引入CLIP图像编码器和风格增强令牌技术。

Result: 实验证明StyleAR在风格对齐生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: StyleAR通过高效数据利用和模型优化，显著提升了风格对齐文本到图像生成的效果。

Abstract: In the current research landscape, multimodal autoregressive (AR) models have
shown exceptional capabilities across various domains, including visual
understanding and generation. However, complex tasks such as style-aligned
text-to-image generation present significant challenges, particularly in data
acquisition. In analogy to instruction-following tuning for image editing of AR
models, style-aligned generation requires a reference style image and prompt,
resulting in a text-image-to-image triplet where the output shares the style
and semantics of the input. However, acquiring large volumes of such triplet
data with specific styles is considerably more challenging than obtaining
conventional text-to-image data used for training generative models. To address
this issue, we propose StyleAR, an innovative approach that combines a
specially designed data curation method with our proposed AR models to
effectively utilize text-to-image binary data for style-aligned text-to-image
generation. Our method synthesizes target stylized data using a reference style
image and prompt, but only incorporates the target stylized image as the image
modality to create high-quality binary data. To facilitate binary data
training, we introduce a CLIP image encoder with a perceiver resampler that
translates the image input into style tokens aligned with multimodal tokens in
AR models and implement a style-enhanced token technique to prevent content
leakage which is a common issue in previous work. Furthermore, we mix raw
images drawn from large-scale text-image datasets with stylized images to
enhance StyleAR's ability to extract richer stylistic features and ensure style
consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate our
superior performance.

Method: 设计了P2C-CoT方法模拟人类异常识别过程，并构建了Vad-Reasoning数据集，提出改进的强化学习算法AVA-GRPO。

Result: Vad-R1在VAD和VAR任务上表现优异，优于开源和专有模型。

Conclusion: Vad-R1框架通过深度推理显著提升了视频异常分析能力，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks.
However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain
limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper,
we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable
deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to
think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an
end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a
Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human
process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly
step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a
dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement
learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly
reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with
limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves
superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on
VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at

Motivation: 360度相机图像在3D重建中存在严重失真，导致3D高斯过大，渲染精度下降。

Method: ErpGS引入几何正则化、尺度正则化和失真感知权重及掩码技术，抑制障碍物影响。

Result: 实验表明，ErpGS在公共数据集上比传统方法渲染新视角图像更准确。

Conclusion: ErpGS有效解决了360度相机图像的失真问题，提升了渲染精度。

Abstract: The use of multi-view images acquired by a 360-degree camera can reconstruct
a 3D space with a wide area. There are 3D reconstruction methods from
equirectangular images based on NeRF and 3DGS, as well as Novel View Synthesis
(NVS) methods. On the other hand, it is necessary to overcome the large
distortion caused by the projection model of a 360-degree camera when
equirectangular images are used. In 3DGS-based methods, the large distortion of
the 360-degree camera model generates extremely large 3D Gaussians, resulting
in poor rendering accuracy. We propose ErpGS, which is Omnidirectional GS based
on 3DGS to realize NVS addressing the problems. ErpGS introduce some rendering
accuracy improvement techniques: geometric regularization, scale
regularization, and distortion-aware weights and a mask to suppress the effects
of obstacles in equirectangular images. Through experiments on public datasets,
we demonstrate that ErpGS can render novel view images more accurately than
conventional methods.

Abstract: Current video-based fall detection research mostly relies on small, staged

under a consistent ten-class taxonomy with standardized evaluation protocols.
Our benchmark provides complete video segmentation labels and enables fair
cross-dataset comparison previously impossible with incompatible annotation
schemes. For real-world evaluation we curate OOPS-Fall from genuine accident
videos and establish a staged-to-wild protocol measuring generalization from
controlled to uncontrolled environments. Experiments with frozen pre-trained
backbones such as I3D or VideoMAE reveal significant performance gaps between
in-distribution and in-the-wild scenarios, highlighting critical challenges in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像常受光线吸收、散射、色偏和伪影等复杂退化影响，现有方法依赖合成数据，导致偏差和泛化能力受限。

Method: 提出UDAN-CLIP框架，结合定制分类器、空间注意力模块和CLIP-Diffusion损失，保留自然先验并增强语义一致性。

Result: 模型在定量和定性评估中均表现优异，能有效校正失真并恢复水下图像的自然外观。

Conclusion: UDAN-CLIP显著提升了水下图像增强的效果，生成结果更真实且细节保留更完整。

Abstract: Underwater images are often affected by complex degradations such as light
absorption, scattering, color casts, and artifacts, making enhancement critical
for effective object detection, recognition, and scene understanding in aquatic
environments. Existing methods, especially diffusion-based approaches,
typically rely on synthetic paired datasets due to the scarcity of real
underwater references, introducing bias and limiting generalization.
Furthermore, fine-tuning these models can degrade learned priors, resulting in
unrealistic enhancements due to domain shifts. To address these challenges, we
propose UDAN-CLIP, an image-to-image diffusion framework pre-trained on
synthetic underwater datasets and enhanced with a customized classifier based
on vision-language model, a spatial attention module, and a novel
CLIP-Diffusion loss. The classifier preserves natural in-air priors and
semantically guides the diffusion process, while the spatial attention module
focuses on correcting localized degradations such as haze and low contrast. The
proposed CLIP-Diffusion loss further strengthens visual-textual alignment and
helps maintain semantic consistency during enhancement. The proposed
contributions empower our UDAN-CLIP model to perform more effective underwater
image enhancement, producing results that are not only visually compelling but
also more realistic and detail-preserving. These improvements are consistently
validated through both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual comparisons,
demonstrating the model's ability to correct distortions and restore natural
appearance in challenging underwater conditions.

Conclusion: Dynamic-I2V在I2V生成中达到最先进性能，并通过DIVE基准解决了现有评估偏差。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image-to-video (I2V) generation have shown promising
performance in conventional scenarios. However, these methods still encounter
significant challenges when dealing with complex scenes that require a deep
understanding of nuanced motion and intricate object-action relationships. To
address these challenges, we present Dynamic-I2V, an innovative framework that
integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to jointly encode visual
and textual conditions for a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture. By
leveraging the advanced multimodal understanding capabilities of MLLMs, our
model significantly improves motion controllability and temporal coherence in
synthesized videos. The inherent multimodality of Dynamic-I2V further enables
flexible support for diverse conditional inputs, extending its applicability to
various downstream generation tasks. Through systematic analysis, we identify a
critical limitation in current I2V benchmarks: a significant bias towards
favoring low-dynamic videos, stemming from an inadequate balance between motion
complexity and visual quality metrics. To resolve this evaluation gap, we
propose DIVE - a novel assessment benchmark specifically designed for
comprehensive dynamic quality measurement in I2V generation. In conclusion,
extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that Dynamic-I2V
attains state-of-the-art performance in image-to-video generation, particularly
revealing significant improvements of 42.5%, 7.9%, and 11.8% in dynamic range,
controllability, and quality, respectively, as assessed by the DIVE metric in

Result: VMA在多种场景和数据集中表现出高效性和通用性。

Conclusion: VMA既可用于攻击，也可用于版权保护，展示了其双刃剑特性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
understanding complex real-world scenarios and supporting data-driven
decision-making processes. However, VLMs exhibit significant vulnerability
against adversarial examples, either text or image, which can lead to various
adversarial outcomes, e.g., jailbreaking, hijacking, and hallucination, etc. In
this work, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate that VLMs are
particularly susceptible to image-based adversarial examples, where
imperceptible perturbations can precisely manipulate each output token. To this
end, we propose a novel attack called Vision-language model Manipulation Attack
(VMA), which integrates first-order and second-order momentum optimization
techniques with a differentiable transformation mechanism to effectively
optimize the adversarial perturbation. Notably, VMA can be a double-edged
sword: it can be leveraged to implement various attacks, such as jailbreaking,
hijacking, privacy breaches, Denial-of-Service, and the generation of sponge
examples, etc, while simultaneously enabling the injection of watermarks for
copyright protection. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy
and generalizability of VMA across diverse scenarios and datasets.

Result: 实现了低硬件需求的实时渲染，支持多种常见天气效果。

Conclusion: 该框架为场景重建和天气效果渲染提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: For tasks such as urban digital twins, VR/AR/game scene design, or creating
synthetic films, the traditional industrial approach often involves manually
modeling scenes and using various rendering engines to complete the rendering
process. This approach typically requires high labor costs and hardware
demands, and can result in poor quality when replicating complex real-world
scenes. A more efficient approach is to use data from captured real-world
scenes, then apply reconstruction and rendering algorithms to quickly recreate
the authentic scene. However, current algorithms are unable to effectively
reconstruct and render real-world weather effects. To address this, we propose
a framework based on gaussian splatting, that can reconstruct real scenes and
render them under synthesized 4D weather effects. Our work can simulate various
common weather effects by applying Gaussians modeling and rendering techniques.
It supports continuous dynamic weather changes and can easily control the
details of the effects. Additionally, our work has low hardware requirements
and achieves real-time rendering performance. The result demos can be accessed

Method: MOTE为每个身份创建专用的二分类器，仅使用单个参考样本和合成平衡样本进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在公平性和隐私性上有显著提升，但增加了推理时间和存储需求。

Conclusion: MOTE是中小规模应用中解决公平性和隐私问题的有效方案。

Abstract: Traditional face recognition systems rely on extracting fixed face
representations, known as templates, to store and verify identities. These
representations are typically generated by neural networks that often lack
explainability and raise concerns regarding fairness and privacy. In this work,
we propose a novel model-template (MOTE) approach that replaces vector-based
face templates with small personalized neural networks. This design enables
more responsible face recognition for small and medium-scale systems. During
enrollment, MOTE creates a dedicated binary classifier for each identity,
trained to determine whether an input face matches the enrolled identity. Each
classifier is trained using only a single reference sample, along with
synthetically balanced samples to allow adjusting fairness at the level of a
single individual during enrollment. Extensive experiments across multiple
datasets and recognition systems demonstrate substantial improvements in
fairness and particularly in privacy. Although the method increases inference
time and storage requirements, it presents a strong solution for small- and
mid-scale applications where fairness and privacy are critical.

Conclusion: MDST++通过解耦语义和运动信息，有效解决了背景偏差和运动细节不足问题，显著提升了零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been extensively researched for its
capability to classify video data from unseen classes during training.
Nevertheless, current methodologies often struggle with background scene biases
and inadequate motion detail. This paper proposes a novel dual-stream
Multi-Timescale Motion-Decoupled Spiking Transformer (MDST++), which decouples
contextual semantic information and sparse dynamic motion information. The
recurrent joint learning unit is proposed to extract contextual semantic
information and capture joint knowledge across various modalities to understand
the environment of actions. By converting RGB images to events, our method
captures motion information more accurately and mitigates background scene
biases. Moreover, we introduce a discrepancy analysis block to model audio
motion information. To enhance the robustness of SNNs in extracting temporal
and motion cues, we dynamically adjust the threshold of Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons based on global motion and contextual semantic
information. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of MDST++,
demonstrating their consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods on
mainstream benchmarks. Additionally, incorporating motion and multi-timescale
information significantly improves HM and ZSL accuracy by 26.2\% and 39.9\%.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在识别图表边缘时的失败原因，并提出通过消除文本和位置偏见来提升边缘识别能力。实验表明，经过微调的模型在多项任务中表现优于预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多视觉语言模型在识别图表边缘时表现不佳，研究者认为这是由于模型过度依赖文本和位置信息，而未能学习明确的边缘特征。

Method: 通过对比学习在人工生成的图表-标题数据集上训练图像编码器，并在探测、图像检索和标题生成任务中评估其性能。

Result: 微调后的模型在所有任务中均优于预训练的CLIP模型，并在标题生成任务中超越了GPT-4o和LLaVA-Mistral。

Conclusion: 消除文本和位置偏见有助于提升视觉语言模型对图表的理解能力，为相关领域的研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: The diagram is a visual representation of a relationship illustrated with
edges (lines or arrows), which is widely used in industrial and scientific
communication. Although recognizing diagrams is essential for vision language
models (VLMs) to comprehend domain-specific knowledge, recent studies reveal
that many VLMs fail to identify edges in images. We hypothesize that these
failures stem from an over-reliance on textual and positional biases,
preventing VLMs from learning explicit edge features. Based on this idea, we
empirically investigate whether the image encoder in VLMs can learn edge
representation through training on a diagram dataset in which edges are biased
neither by textual nor positional information. To this end, we conduct
contrastive learning on an artificially generated diagram--caption dataset to
train an image encoder and evaluate its diagram-related features on three
tasks: probing, image retrieval, and captioning. Our results show that the
finetuned model outperforms pretrained CLIP in all tasks and surpasses
zero-shot GPT-4o and LLaVA-Mistral in the captioning task. These findings
confirm that eliminating textual and positional biases fosters accurate edge
recognition in VLMs, offering a promising path for advancing diagram
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种名为SaSi的深度学习新方法，用于解决冷冻电子断层扫描（cryo-ET）中3D粒子定位的少样本学习问题。该方法通过自增强和自解释策略减少对标记数据的依赖，并在实验中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电子断层扫描（cryo-ET）在成像大分子复合物方面具有优势，但3D粒子定位因低信噪比和缺失楔形伪影而具有挑战性。现有深度学习方法需要大量数据，而标记数据稀缺。

Method: 提出SaSi方法，结合自增强技术提高数据利用率，并引入自解释分割策略以减少对标记数据的依赖。

Result: 在模拟和真实冷冻电子断层扫描数据集上的实验表明，SaSi方法在粒子定位方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SaSi方法为冷冻电子断层扫描中的少样本学习设定了新基准，提升了对粒子检测的理解。

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful technique for
imaging macromolecular complexes in their near-native states. However, the
localization of 3D particles in cellular environments still presents a
significant challenge due to low signal-to-noise ratios and missing wedge
artifacts. Deep learning approaches have shown great potential, but they need
huge amounts of data, which can be a challenge in cryo-ET scenarios where
labeled data is often scarce. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-augmented
and Self-interpreted (SaSi) deep learning approach towards few-shot particle
detection in 3D cryo-ET images. Our method builds upon self-augmentation
techniques to further boost data utilization and introduces a self-interpreted
segmentation strategy for alleviating dependency on labeled data, hence
improving generalization and robustness. As demonstrated by experiments
conducted on both simulated and real-world cryo-ET datasets, the SaSi approach
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for particle
localization. This research increases understanding of how to detect particles
with very few labels in cryo-ET and thus sets a new benchmark for few-shot
learning in structural biology.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的零样本组合图像检索（ZS-CIR）框架，通过多模态推理代理（MRA）直接构建三元组，避免了依赖中间文本的错误传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型生成中间文本，导致查询到文本和文本到图像的映射错误累积，影响检索性能。

Method: 使用多模态推理代理（MRA）直接构建三元组（参考图像、修改文本、目标图像），并通过无标签图像数据训练模型。

Result: 在三个标准CIR基准测试中表现优异，FashionIQ数据集上R@10提升7.5%，CIRR上R@1提升9.6%，CIRCO上mAP@5提升9.5%。

Conclusion: MRA框架有效解决了中间文本依赖问题，显著提升了零样本组合图像检索的性能。

Abstract: Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images
given a compositional query, consisting of a reference image and a modifying
text-without relying on annotated training data. Existing approaches often
generate a synthetic target text using large language models (LLMs) to serve as
an intermediate anchor between the compositional query and the target image.
Models are then trained to align the compositional query with the generated
text, and separately align images with their corresponding texts using
contrastive learning. However, this reliance on intermediate text introduces
error propagation, as inaccuracies in query-to-text and text-to-image mappings
accumulate, ultimately degrading retrieval performance. To address these
problems, we propose a novel framework by employing a Multimodal Reasoning
Agent (MRA) for ZS-CIR. MRA eliminates the dependence on textual intermediaries
by directly constructing triplets, <reference image, modification text, target
image>, using only unlabeled image data. By training on these synthetic
triplets, our model learns to capture the relationships between compositional
queries and candidate images directly. Extensive experiments on three standard
CIR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the FashionIQ
dataset, our method improves Average R@10 by at least 7.5\% over existing
baselines; on CIRR, it boosts R@1 by 9.6\%; and on CIRCO, it increases mAP@5 by
9.5\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但应用于视频超分辨率时存在随机性和缺乏时间建模的问题。

Method: 提出DRS将迭代去噪过程转化为单步重建，并设计RTS模块实现时间一致性。结合Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation（SJD）和Temporally Asynchronous Inference（TAI）策略优化性能。

Result: UltraVSR在单步采样中实现了最先进的性能，质量和定量指标均表现优异。

Conclusion: UltraVSR通过创新的设计和优化策略，解决了扩散模型在视频超分辨率中的挑战，实现了高效且高质量的结果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great potential in generating realistic image
detail. However, adapting these models to video super-resolution (VSR) remains
challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and lack of temporal modeling.
In this paper, we propose UltraVSR, a novel framework that enables
ultra-realistic and temporal-coherent VSR through an efficient one-step
diffusion space. A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware
Restoration Schedule (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the
low-resolution input and transforms iterative denoising process into a
single-step reconstruction from from low-resolution to high-resolution videos.
This design eliminates randomness from diffusion noise and significantly speeds
up inference. To ensure temporal consistency, we propose a lightweight yet
effective Recurrent Temporal Shift (RTS) module, composed of an RTS-convolution
unit and an RTS-attention unit. By partially shifting feature components along
the temporal dimension, these two units collaboratively facilitate effective
feature propagation, fusion, and alignment across neighboring frames, without
relying on explicit temporal layers. The RTS module is integrated into a
pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is further enhanced through
Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation (SJD), which improves temporal coherence
while preserving realistic details. Additionally, we introduce a Temporally
Asynchronous Inference (TAI) strategy to capture long-range temporal
dependencies under limited memory constraints. Extensive experiments show that
UltraVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, in a single sampling step.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为渐进分层指令（PHI）的方法，通过两种策略解决长期动作质量评估（AQA）中的领域偏移问题，并在实验中取得了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因预训练大规模动作识别主干与特定AQA任务之间的领域偏移而性能受限，且在小规模AQA数据集上微调资源密集型主干不切实际。

Method: 提出PHI方法，包括特征级偏移的Gap Minimization Flow（GMF）和List-wise Contrastive Regularization（LCR），以及时间增强注意力模块。

Result: PHI在三个代表性长期AQA数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PHI通过解决领域偏移问题，显著提升了长期AQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Long-term Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate the quantitative
performance of actions in long videos. However, existing methods face
challenges due to domain shifts between the pre-trained large-scale action
recognition backbones and the specific AQA task, thereby hindering their
performance. This arises since fine-tuning resource-intensive backbones on
small AQA datasets is impractical. We address this by identifying two levels of
domain shift: task-level, regarding differences in task objectives, and
feature-level, regarding differences in important features. For feature-level
shifts, which are more detrimental, we propose Progressive Hierarchical
Instruction (PHI) with two strategies. First, Gap Minimization Flow (GMF)
leverages flow matching to progressively learn a fast flow path that reduces
the domain gap between initial and desired features across shallow to deep
layers. Additionally, a temporally-enhanced attention module captures
long-range dependencies essential for AQA. Second, List-wise Contrastive
Regularization (LCR) facilitates coarse-to-fine alignment by comprehensively
comparing batch pairs to learn fine-grained cues while mitigating domain shift.
Integrating these modules, PHI offers an effective solution. Experiments
demonstrate that PHI achieves state-of-the-art performance on three
representative long-term AQA datasets, proving its superiority in addressing
the domain shift for long-term AQA.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种通过初始化将CNN的归纳偏置引入ViT的方法，无需架构调整，旨在使ViT在小数据上表现如CNN，大数据上仍保持ViT性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT在小数据集上表现不佳，而CNN因其强归纳偏置在小数据上表现优异。作者希望通过初始化将CNN的偏置引入ViT。

Method: 通过改进ViT的初始化策略，利用随机脉冲滤波器（类似CNN的滤波器）初始化ViT，而非依赖预训练模型或注意力权重分布。

Result: 在多个中小规模数据集（如Food-101、CIFAR等）上显著优于标准ViT初始化，且在大规模数据集（如ImageNet-1K）上表现相当。

Conclusion: 该方法简单易用，可无缝集成到多种Transformer架构中，提升性能。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) inherently encode strong inductive
biases, enabling effective generalization on small-scale datasets. In this
paper, we propose integrating this inductive bias into ViTs, not through an
architectural intervention but solely through initialization. The motivation
here is to have a ViT that can enjoy strong CNN-like performance when data
assets are small, but can still scale to ViT-like performance as the data
expands. Our approach is motivated by our empirical results that random impulse
filters can achieve commensurate performance to learned filters within a CNN.
We improve upon current ViT initialization strategies, which typically rely on
empirical heuristics such as using attention weights from pretrained models or
focusing on the distribution of attention weights without enforcing structures.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
standard ViT initialization across numerous small and medium-scale benchmarks,
including Food-101, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Flowers, and Pets, while
maintaining comparative performance on large-scale datasets such as
ImageNet-1K. Moreover, our initialization strategy can be easily integrated
into various transformer-based architectures such as Swin Transformer and
MLP-Mixer with consistent improvements in performance.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于目标跟踪，还具有更广泛的适用性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a progressive scaling training strategy for visual
object tracking, systematically analyzing the influence of training data
volume, model size, and input resolution on tracking performance. Our empirical
study reveals that while scaling each factor leads to significant improvements
in tracking accuracy, naive training suffers from suboptimal optimization and
limited iterative refinement. To address this issue, we introduce DT-Training,
a progressive scaling framework that integrates small teacher transfer and
dual-branch alignment to maximize model potential. The resulting scaled tracker
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks,
demonstrating strong generalization and transferability of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate the broader applicability of our approach to
additional tasks, underscoring its versatility beyond tracking.

Method: 提出TMSE和CSSE分别捕获语义和结构特征，并通过MMFA融合。

Result: 显著降低MLLMs的未知识别率，提升生成文本质量。

Conclusion: NEXT框架在多模态对象重识别中表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-modal object re-identification (ReID) aims to extract identity features
across heterogeneous spectral modalities to enable accurate recognition and
retrieval in complex real-world scenarios. However, most existing methods rely
on implicit feature fusion structures, making it difficult to model
fine-grained recognition strategies under varying challenging conditions.
Benefiting from the powerful semantic understanding capabilities of Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), the visual appearance of an object can be
effectively translated into descriptive text. In this paper, we propose a
reliable multi-modal caption generation method based on attribute confidence,
which significantly reduces the unknown recognition rate of MLLMs in
multi-modal semantic generation and improves the quality of generated text.
Additionally, we propose a novel ReID framework NEXT, the Multi-grained Mixture
of Experts via Text-Modulation for Multi-modal Object Re-Identification.
Specifically, we decouple the recognition problem into semantic and structural
expert branches to separately capture modality-specific appearance and
intrinsic structure. For semantic recognition, we propose the Text-Modulated
Semantic-sampling Experts (TMSE), which leverages randomly sampled high-quality
semantic texts to modulate expert-specific sampling of multi-modal features and
mining intra-modality fine-grained semantic cues. Then, to recognize
coarse-grained structure features, we propose the Context-Shared
Structure-aware Experts (CSSE) that focuses on capturing the holistic object
structure across modalities and maintains inter-modality structural consistency
through a soft routing mechanism. Finally, we propose the Multi-Modal Feature
Aggregation (MMFA), which adopts a unified feature fusion strategy to simply
and effectively integrate semantic and structural expert outputs into the final
identity representations.

Conclusion: 需开发专门数据集以提升VLMs在原子视觉任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with
trivially simple visual tasks. In this work, we focus on the domain of basic 2D
Euclidean geometry and systematically categorize the fundamental, indivisible
visual perception skills, which we refer to as atomic visual skills. We then
introduce the Atomic Visual Skills Dataset (AVSD) for evaluating VLMs on the
atomic visual skills. Using AVSD, we benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs and find
that they struggle with these tasks, despite being trivial for adult humans.
Our findings highlight the need for purpose-built datasets to train and
evaluate VLMs on atomic, rather than composite, visual perception tasks.

Conclusion: ReasonPlan展示了MLLMs在闭环自动驾驶中的潜力，通过双机制设计实现了高性能和可解释性，并在零样本场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Due to the powerful vision-language reasoning and generalization abilities,
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention in
the field of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, their application to
closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have
not shown clear superiority to mainstream E2E imitation learning approaches. In
this work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed
for closed-loop driving through holistic reasoning with a self-supervised Next
Scene Prediction task and supervised Decision Chain-of-Thought process. This
dual mechanism encourages the model to align visual representations with
actionable driving context, while promoting interpretable and causally grounded
decision making. We curate a planning-oriented decision reasoning dataset,
namely PDR, comprising 210k diverse and high-quality samples. Our method
outperforms the mainstream E2E imitation learning method by a large margin of
19% L2 and 16.1 driving score on Bench2Drive benchmark. Furthermore, ReasonPlan
demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on unseen DOS benchmark,
highlighting its adaptability in handling zero-shot corner cases. Code and

Conclusion: ViTaPEs通过创新的位置编码和融合方法，显著提升了视觉触觉表征的学习能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Tactile sensing provides local essential information that is complementary to
visual perception, such as texture, compliance, and force. Despite recent
advances in visuotactile representation learning, challenges remain in fusing
these modalities and generalizing across tasks and environments without heavy
reliance on pre-trained vision-language models. Moreover, existing methods do
not study positional encodings, thereby overlooking the multi-scale spatial
reasoning needed to capture fine-grained visuotactile correlations. We
introduce ViTaPEs, a transformer-based framework that robustly integrates
visual and tactile input data to learn task-agnostic representations for
visuotactile perception. Our approach exploits a novel multi-scale positional
encoding scheme to capture intra-modal structures, while simultaneously
modeling cross-modal cues. Unlike prior work, we provide provable guarantees in
visuotactile fusion, showing that our encodings are injective,
rigid-motion-equivariant, and information-preserving, validating these
properties empirically. Experiments on multiple large-scale real-world datasets
show that ViTaPEs not only surpasses state-of-the-art baselines across various
recognition tasks but also demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen,
out-of-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the transfer-learning strength
of ViTaPEs in a robotic grasping task, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in predicting grasp success. Project page:

Motivation: 现有情感识别基准在情感类别覆盖、数据多样性和质量上存在显著缺陷，限制了AI对人类情感的准确理解。

Method: 提出EmoNet Face，包括40类情感分类体系、三个大规模AI生成数据集（EmoNet HQ、Binary、Big），以及多专家标注的高保真评估。

Result: 开发了Empathic Insight Face模型，在基准测试中达到人类专家水平。

Conclusion: EmoNet Face为AI系统提供了更深入理解人类情感的坚实基础。

Abstract: Effective human-AI interaction relies on AI's ability to accurately perceive
and interpret human emotions. Current benchmarks for vision and vision-language
models are severely limited, offering a narrow emotional spectrum that
overlooks nuanced states (e.g., bitterness, intoxication) and fails to
distinguish subtle differences between related feelings (e.g., shame vs.
embarrassment). Existing datasets also often use uncontrolled imagery with
occluded faces and lack demographic diversity, risking significant bias. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce EmoNet Face, a comprehensive
benchmark suite. EmoNet Face features: (1) A novel 40-category emotion
taxonomy, meticulously derived from foundational research to capture finer
details of human emotional experiences. (2) Three large-scale, AI-generated
datasets (EmoNet HQ, Binary, and Big) with explicit, full-face expressions and
controlled demographic balance across ethnicity, age, and gender. (3) Rigorous,
multi-expert annotations for training and high-fidelity evaluation. (4) We
build Empathic Insight Face, a model achieving human-expert-level performance
on our benchmark. The publicly released EmoNet Face suite - taxonomy, datasets,
and model - provides a robust foundation for developing and evaluating AI
systems with a deeper understanding of human emotions.

Motivation: 现有RGB-D场景解析方法依赖大量手动标注数据，耗时且昂贵，DepthMatch旨在通过半监督学习减少标注需求。

Method: 提出补丁混合增强探索RGB-D图像对的潜在关系，设计轻量级空间先验注入器替代复杂融合模块，并引入深度引导边界损失。

Result: 在NYUv2和KITTI数据集上取得领先性能，适用于室内外场景。

Conclusion: DepthMatch通过半监督学习和高效特征融合，显著提升了RGB-D场景解析的性能和实用性。

Abstract: RGB-D scene parsing methods effectively capture both semantic and geometric
features of the environment, demonstrating great potential under challenging
conditions such as extreme weather and low lighting. However, existing RGB-D
scene parsing methods predominantly rely on supervised training strategies,
which require a large amount of manually annotated pixel-level labels that are
both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
DepthMatch, a semi-supervised learning framework that is specifically designed
for RGB-D scene parsing. To make full use of unlabeled data, we propose
complementary patch mix-up augmentation to explore the latent relationships
between texture and spatial features in RGB-D image pairs. We also design a
lightweight spatial prior injector to replace traditional complex fusion
modules, improving the efficiency of heterogeneous feature fusion. Furthermore,
we introduce depth-guided boundary loss to enhance the model's boundary
prediction capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DepthMatch
exhibits high applicability in both indoor and outdoor scenes, achieving
state-of-the-art results on the NYUv2 dataset and ranking first on the KITTI
Semantics benchmark.

Abstract: Gesture recognition is an important research area in the field of computer
vision. Most gesture recognition efforts focus on close-set scenarios, thereby
limiting the capacity to effectively handle unseen or novel gestures. We aim to
address class-incremental gesture recognition, which entails the ability to
accommodate new and previously unseen gestures over time. Specifically, we
introduce a Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay (PGPFR) framework for
data-free class-incremental gesture recognition. This framework comprises four
components: Pseudo Feature Generation with Batch Prototypes (PFGBP),
Variational Prototype Replay (VPR) for old classes, Truncated Cross-Entropy
(TCE) for new classes, and Continual Classifier Re-Training (CCRT). To tackle
the issue of catastrophic forgetting, the PFGBP dynamically generates a
diversity of pseudo features in an online manner, leveraging class prototypes
of old classes along with batch class prototypes of new classes. Furthermore,
the VPR enforces consistency between the classifier's weights and the
prototypes of old classes, leveraging class prototypes and covariance matrices
to enhance robustness and generalization capabilities. The TCE mitigates the
impact of domain differences of the classifier caused by pseudo features.
Finally, the CCRT training strategy is designed to prevent overfitting to new
classes and ensure the stability of features extracted from old classes.
Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used gesture recognition
datasets, namely SHREC 2017 3D and EgoGesture 3D, demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 11.8\% and 12.8\% in terms of
mean global accuracy, respectively. The code is available on

*Zheqi Lv,Junhao Chen,Qi Tian,Keting Yin,Shengyu Zhang,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: PPAD框架首次引入多模态大语言模型（MLLM）作为推理过程中的语义观察者，实时分析中间生成结果，识别潜在语义不一致性，并通过反馈信号主动引导去噪步骤，显著提升生成图像的质量和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在文本到图像生成中缺乏可解释的语义监督和校正机制，导致生成轨迹中常出现对象混淆、空间错误等问题，严重影响图像质量与提示对齐。

Method: 提出MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD)框架，利用MLLM在推理过程中实时分析中间生成结果，识别语义不一致性，并通过反馈信号主动引导去噪步骤。

Result: 实验表明PPAD在生成图像质量和语义对齐方面有显著改进，且仅需极少数扩散步骤即可完成语义校正，具有强通用性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: PPAD框架通过引入MLLM作为语义观察者，有效解决了扩散模型在生成过程中的语义不一致问题，显著提升了生成图像的质量和可控性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become the mainstream architecture for text-to-image
generation, achieving remarkable progress in visual quality and prompt
controllability. However, current inference pipelines generally lack
interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the
denoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of
the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making
them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative
trajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial
errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising
prompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel
framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language
Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time
analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic
inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that
actively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both
inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction
at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and
scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型生成的舞蹈动作物理真实性不足，需改进。

Method: 提出PAMD框架，结合PMC（物理约束）、PMG（运动引导）和MRFC（脚地接触优化）。

Result: 实验表明PAMD显著提升音乐对齐和动作物理真实性。

Conclusion: PAMD为舞蹈生成提供了更真实和音乐对齐的解决方案。

Abstract: Computational dance generation is crucial in many areas, such as art,
human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and digital entertainment,
particularly for generating coherent and expressive long dance sequences.
Diffusion-based music-to-dance generation has made significant progress, yet
existing methods still struggle to produce physically plausible motions. To
address this, we propose Plausibility-Aware Motion Diffusion (PAMD), a
framework for generating dances that are both musically aligned and physically
realistic. The core of PAMD lies in the Plausible Motion Constraint (PMC),
which leverages Neural Distance Fields (NDFs) to model the actual pose manifold
and guide generated motions toward a physically valid pose manifold. To provide
more effective guidance during generation, we incorporate Prior Motion Guidance
(PMG), which uses standing poses as auxiliary conditions alongside music
features. To further enhance realism for complex movements, we introduce the
Motion Refinement with Foot-ground Contact (MRFC) module, which addresses
foot-skating artifacts by bridging the gap between the optimization objective
in linear joint position space and the data representation in nonlinear
rotation space. Extensive experiments show that PAMD significantly improves
musical alignment and enhances the physical plausibility of generated motions.

Motivation: 由于手部自由度、2D到3D模糊性和自遮挡问题，单目3D手部网格恢复具有挑战性，现有方法效率低或预测不直观。

Method: M3DHMR通过动态螺旋卷积层（DSC）自适应调整权重提取顶点特征，ROI层利用物理信息细化网格顶点。

Result: 在FreiHAND数据集上的实验表明，M3DHMR显著优于现有实时方法。

Conclusion: M3DHMR提供了一种高效且直观的单目3D手部网格恢复方法。

Abstract: Monocular 3D hand mesh recovery is challenging due to high degrees of freedom
of hands, 2D-to-3D ambiguity and self-occlusion. Most existing methods are
either inefficient or less straightforward for predicting the position of 3D
mesh vertices. Thus, we propose a new pipeline called Monocular 3D Hand Mesh
Recovery (M3DHMR) to directly estimate the positions of hand mesh vertices.
M3DHMR provides 2D cues for 3D tasks from a single image and uses a new spiral
decoder consist of several Dynamic Spiral Convolution (DSC) Layers and a Region
of Interest (ROI) Layer. On the one hand, DSC Layers adaptively adjust the
weights based on the vertex positions and extract the vertex features in both
spatial and channel dimensions. On the other hand, ROI Layer utilizes the
physical information and refines mesh vertices in each predefined hand region
separately. Extensive experiments on popular dataset FreiHAND demonstrate that
M3DHMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art real-time methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉令牌压缩方法依赖语言模型的注意力分数，但这些分数存在全局和局部偏差，影响性能。

Method: 提出AdaTP，集成两个去偏模块，分别针对全局和局部注意力偏差，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中表现优异，计算开销显著降低（仅需27.3% FLOPs），性能无损失。

Conclusion: AdaTP是一种高效且无需额外训练的视频令牌剪枝方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in
video understanding tasks. However, they often suffer from heavy computational
overhead due to the large number of visual tokens generated from multiple video
frames. Existing visual token compression methods often rely on attention
scores from language models as guidance. However, these scores exhibit inherent
biases: global bias reflects a tendency to focus on the two ends of the visual
token sequence, while local bias leads to an over-concentration on the same
spatial positions across different frames. To address the issue of attention
bias, we propose $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{D}$ebi$\textbf{a}$sed
$\textbf{T}$oken $\textbf{P}$runing for Video Large Language Models
($\textbf{AdaTP}$), a novel token pruning pipeline for Video LLMs. AdaTP
integrates two dedicated debiasing modules into the pipeline, targeting global
attention bias and local attention bias, respectively. Without the need for
additional training, our method significantly reduces the computational
overhead of Video LLMs while retaining the performance of vanilla models.
Extensive evaluation shows that AdaTP achieves state-of-the-art performance in
various commonly used video understanding benchmarks. In particular, on
LLaVA-OneVision-7B, AdaTP maintains performance without degradation while using
only up to $27.3\%$ FLOPs compared to the vanilla model. Our code will be
released soon.

TLDR: OvSGTR是一种基于Transformer的开放词汇场景图生成框架，突破了传统固定词汇模型的限制，能够识别新概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法局限于固定词汇，无法适应现实世界中新概念的频繁出现，因此需要一种开放词汇的解决方案。

Method: 采用DETR-like架构，结合冻结的图像主干和文本编码器提取特征，通过Transformer解码器进行端到端预测，并提出关系感知预训练策略和视觉概念保留机制。

Result: 在VG150基准测试中，OvSGTR在多种设置下达到最先进性能，包括封闭集和开放词汇场景。

Conclusion: 大规模关系感知预训练和Transformer架构有望推动场景图生成向更通用和可靠的视觉理解发展。

Abstract: We present OvSGTR, a novel transformer-based framework for fully
open-vocabulary scene graph generation that overcomes the limitations of
traditional closed-set models. Conventional methods restrict both object and
relationship recognition to a fixed vocabulary, hindering their applicability
to real-world scenarios where novel concepts frequently emerge. In contrast,
our approach jointly predicts objects (nodes) and their inter-relationships
(edges) beyond predefined categories. OvSGTR leverages a DETR-like architecture
featuring a frozen image backbone and text encoder to extract high-quality
visual and semantic features, which are then fused via a transformer decoder
for end-to-end scene graph prediction. To enrich the model's understanding of
complex visual relations, we propose a relation-aware pre-training strategy
that synthesizes scene graph annotations in a weakly supervised manner.
Specifically, we investigate three pipelines--scene parser-based, LLM-based,
and multimodal LLM-based--to generate transferable supervision signals with
minimal manual annotation. Furthermore, we address the common issue of
catastrophic forgetting in open-vocabulary settings by incorporating a
visual-concept retention mechanism coupled with a knowledge distillation
strategy, ensuring that the model retains rich semantic cues during
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on the VG150 benchmark demonstrate that
OvSGTR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings,
including closed-set, open-vocabulary object detection-based, relation-based,
and fully open-vocabulary scenarios. Our results highlight the promise of
large-scale relation-aware pre-training and transformer architectures for
advancing scene graph generation towards more generalized and reliable visual
understanding.

Abstract: Videos are unique in their integration of temporal elements, including
camera, scene, action, and attribute, along with their dynamic relationships
over time. However, existing benchmarks for video understanding often treat
these properties separately or narrowly focus on specific aspects, overlooking
the holistic nature of video content. To address this, we introduce TUNA, a

videos, with two complementary tasks: captioning and QA. Our TUNA features
diverse video scenarios and dynamics, assisted by interpretable and robust
evaluation criteria. We evaluate several leading models on our benchmark,
providing fine-grained performance assessments across various dimensions. This
evaluation reveals key challenges in video temporal understanding, such as
limited action description, inadequate multi-subject understanding, and
insensitivity to camera motion, offering valuable insights for improving video
understanding models. The data and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in radiance field rendering, exemplified by Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have significantly
progressed 3D modeling and reconstruction. The use of multiple 360-degree
omnidirectional images for these tasks is increasingly favored due to
advantages in data acquisition and comprehensive scene capture. However, the
inherent geometric distortions in common omnidirectional representations, such
as equirectangular projection (particularly severe in polar regions and varying
with latitude), pose substantial challenges to achieving high-fidelity 3D
reconstructions. Current datasets, while valuable, often lack the specific
focus, scene composition, and ground truth granularity required to
systematically benchmark and drive progress in overcoming these
omnidirectional-specific challenges. To address this critical gap, we introduce
Omnidirectional Blender 3D (OB3D), a new synthetic dataset curated for
advancing 3D reconstruction from multiple omnidirectional images. OB3D features
diverse and complex 3D scenes generated from Blender 3D projects, with a
deliberate emphasis on challenging scenarios. The dataset provides
comprehensive ground truth, including omnidirectional RGB images, precise
omnidirectional camera parameters, and pixel-aligned equirectangular maps for
depth and normals, alongside evaluation metrics. By offering a controlled yet
challenging environment, OB3Daims to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of
existing methods and prompt the development of new techniques to enhance the
accuracy and reliability of 3D reconstruction from omnidirectional images.

Conclusion: 该框架为计算机图形学、3D视觉和具身应用中的空间智能系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by
vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate
structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains
their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive
simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that
enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by
injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal
input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that
provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud
capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich
spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints.
Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware
working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities
with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on
this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which
the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline
features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment
setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene
hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and
challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior
work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs
to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path
planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in
computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

Conclusion: FUDOKI展示了作为下一代统一多模态模型的潜力，未来可通过强化学习进一步优化。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the
emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that unify visual
understanding and image generation within a single framework. However, most
existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent
limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image
generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In
this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing
FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as
an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced
probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond
the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement
with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration
during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we
initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to
the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both
visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as
a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we
show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant
performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement
through reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Benefiting from contrastively trained visual encoders on large-scale natural
scene images, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across various visual perception tasks. However, the inherent
limitations of contrastive learning upon summarized descriptions fundamentally
restrict the capabilities of models in meticulous reasoning, particularly in
crucial scenarios of geometric problem-solving. To enhance geometric
understanding, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework
for the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using
generation-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code,
and text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from
modified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on
caption similarity. We train CLIP using our strong negative learning method,
namely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for
geometric problem-solving. Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM,
significantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning
benchmarks. Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models
like GPT-4o. We further study the impact of different negative sample
construction methods and the number of negative samples on the geometric
reasoning performance of LMM, yielding fruitful conclusions. The code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/MMGeoLM.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in audio-driven human
animation. However, critical challenges remain in (i) generating highly dynamic
videos while preserving character consistency, (ii) achieving precise emotion
alignment between characters and audio, and (iii) enabling multi-character
audio-driven animation. To address these challenges, we propose
HunyuanVideo-Avatar, a multimodal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT)-based model
capable of simultaneously generating dynamic, emotion-controllable, and
multi-character dialogue videos. Concretely, HunyuanVideo-Avatar introduces
three key innovations: (i) A character image injection module is designed to
replace the conventional addition-based character conditioning scheme,
eliminating the inherent condition mismatch between training and inference.
This ensures the dynamic motion and strong character consistency; (ii) An Audio
Emotion Module (AEM) is introduced to extract and transfer the emotional cues
from an emotion reference image to the target generated video, enabling
fine-grained and accurate emotion style control; (iii) A Face-Aware Audio
Adapter (FAA) is proposed to isolate the audio-driven character with
latent-level face mask, enabling independent audio injection via
cross-attention for multi-character scenarios. These innovations empower
HunyuanVideo-Avatar to surpass state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets
and a newly proposed wild dataset, generating realistic avatars in dynamic,
immersive scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长时记忆问题，适用于交互式应用。

Abstract: Video diffusion models have recently shown promise for world modeling through
autoregressive frame prediction conditioned on actions. However, they struggle
to maintain long-term memory due to the high computational cost associated with
processing extended sequences in attention layers. To overcome this limitation,
we propose a novel architecture leveraging state-space models (SSMs) to extend
temporal memory without compromising computational efficiency. Unlike previous
approaches that retrofit SSMs for non-causal vision tasks, our method fully
exploits the inherent advantages of SSMs in causal sequence modeling. Central
to our design is a block-wise SSM scanning scheme, which strategically trades
off spatial consistency for extended temporal memory, combined with dense local
attention to ensure coherence between consecutive frames. We evaluate the
long-term memory capabilities of our model through spatial retrieval and
reasoning tasks over extended horizons. Experiments on Memory Maze and
Minecraft datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses baselines in
preserving long-range memory, while maintaining practical inference speeds
suitable for interactive applications.

Abstract: The emergence of pathology foundation models has revolutionized computational
histopathology, enabling highly accurate, generalized whole-slide image
analysis for improved cancer diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. While these
models show remarkable potential across cancer diagnostics and prognostics,
their clinical translation faces critical challenges including variability in
optimal model across cancer types, potential data leakage in evaluation, and
lack of standardized benchmarks. Without rigorous, unbiased evaluation, even
the most advanced PFMs risk remaining confined to research settings, delaying
their life-saving applications. Existing benchmarking efforts remain limited by
narrow cancer-type focus, potential pretraining data overlaps, or incomplete
task coverage. We present PathBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
addressing these gaps through: multi-center in-hourse datasets spanning common
cancers with rigorous leakage prevention, evaluation across the full clinical
spectrum from diagnosis to prognosis, and an automated leaderboard system for
continuous model assessment. Our framework incorporates large-scale data,
enabling objective comparison of PFMs while reflecting real-world clinical
complexity. All evaluation data comes from private medical providers, with
strict exclusion of any pretraining usage to avoid data leakage risks. We have
collected 15,888 WSIs from 8,549 patients across 10 hospitals, encompassing
over 64 diagnosis and prognosis tasks. Currently, our evaluation of 19 PFMs
shows that Virchow2 and H-Optimus-1 are the most effective models overall. This
work provides researchers with a robust platform for model development and
offers clinicians actionable insights into PFM performance across diverse
clinical scenarios, ultimately accelerating the translation of these
transformative technologies into routine pathology practice.

TLDR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）中语言化置信度的校准问题，发现当前模型在多任务中普遍存在校准不足，并提出了一种两阶段提示策略以改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语言化置信度在VLMs中的有效性，填补现有研究的不足。

Method: 通过三类模型、四个任务领域和三种评估场景进行全面评估，并引入视觉置信感知提示策略。

Result: 发现VLMs普遍存在校准问题，视觉推理模型表现较好；新策略显著提升了置信度对齐。

Conclusion: 强调模态对齐和模型忠实性对可靠多模态系统的重要性。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential for assessing the reliability and
trustworthiness of modern AI systems. Among existing approaches, verbalized
uncertainty, where models express their confidence through natural language,
has emerged as a lightweight and interpretable solution in large language
models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness in vision-language models (VLMs)
remains insufficiently studied. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of verbalized confidence in VLMs, spanning three model categories,
four task domains, and three evaluation scenarios. Our results show that
current VLMs often display notable miscalibration across diverse tasks and
settings. Notably, visual reasoning models (i.e., thinking with images)
consistently exhibit better calibration, suggesting that modality-specific
reasoning is critical for reliable uncertainty estimation. To further address
calibration challenges, we introduce Visual Confidence-Aware Prompting, a
two-stage prompting strategy that improves confidence alignment in multimodal
settings. Overall, our study highlights the inherent miscalibration in VLMs
across modalities. More broadly, our findings underscore the fundamental
importance of modality alignment and model faithfulness in advancing reliable
multimodal systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly improved

and animate a given character into open-domain dynamic backgrounds while
following given human motion sequences. Built on cutting-edge Image-to-Video

"avatar-background" conditioning mechanism that reframes open-domain
human-centric animation as a restoration task, enabling more stable and
versatile animation outputs. Experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance of our method. Codes will be available at

TLDR: 论文提出了一种两系统架构（全局推理系统和细节理解系统）来解决视频音频推理中的分辨率冲突问题，并通过强化学习框架Omni-R1实现了高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时视频音频推理与细粒度像素理解对分辨率要求的矛盾。

Method: 采用两系统架构：全局推理系统选择关键帧并重写任务，细节理解系统处理高分辨率片段；通过强化学习框架Omni-R1进行端到端训练。

Result: 在RefAVS和REVOS基准测试中超越现有方法，提升泛化能力并减少多模态幻觉。

Conclusion: 首次成功将强化学习应用于大规模全模态推理，为通用基础模型提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Long-horizon video-audio reasoning and fine-grained pixel understanding
impose conflicting requirements on omnimodal models: dense temporal coverage
demands many low-resolution frames, whereas precise grounding calls for
high-resolution inputs. We tackle this trade-off with a two-system
architecture: a Global Reasoning System selects informative keyframes and
rewrites the task at low spatial cost, while a Detail Understanding System
performs pixel-level grounding on the selected high-resolution snippets.
Because ``optimal'' keyframe selection and reformulation are ambiguous and hard
to supervise, we formulate them as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and
present Omni-R1, an end-to-end RL framework built on Group Relative Policy
Optimization. Omni-R1 trains the Global Reasoning System through hierarchical
rewards obtained via online collaboration with the Detail Understanding System,
requiring only one epoch of RL on small task splits.
  Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, namely Referring Audio-Visual
Segmentation (RefAVS) and Reasoning Video Object Segmentation (REVOS), show
that Omni-R1 not only surpasses strong supervised baselines but also
outperforms specialized state-of-the-art models, while substantially improving
out-of-domain generalization and mitigating multimodal hallucination. Our
results demonstrate the first successful application of RL to large-scale
omnimodal reasoning and highlight a scalable path toward universally foundation
models.

Conclusion: HaloGS通过双表示设计，在效率和保真度上取得了平衡，适用于室内外环境的3D重建与渲染。

Abstract: High fidelity 3D reconstruction and rendering hinge on capturing precise
geometry while preserving photo realistic detail. Most existing methods either
fuse these goals into a single cumbersome model or adopt hybrid schemes whose
uniform primitives lead to a trade off between efficiency and fidelity. In this
paper, we introduce HaloGS, a dual representation that loosely couples coarse
triangles for geometry with Gaussian primitives for appearance, motivated by
the lightweight classic geometry representations and their proven efficiency in
real world applications. Our design yields a compact yet expressive model
capable of photo realistic rendering across both indoor and outdoor
environments, seamlessly adapting to varying levels of scene complexity.
Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method yields
both compact, accurate geometry and high fidelity renderings, especially in
challenging scenarios where robust geometric structure make a clear difference.

Result: 在重建任务中达到可比渲染质量，在未来帧外推中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过学习高斯粒子动力学，实现了高效的运动外推，为动态3D建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper aims to model the dynamics of 3D Gaussians from visual
observations to support temporal extrapolation. Existing dynamic 3D
reconstruction methods often struggle to effectively learn underlying dynamics
or rely heavily on manually defined physical priors, which limits their
extrapolation capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic
3D Gaussian Splatting prior-free motion extrapolation framework based on
particle dynamics systems. The core advantage of our method lies in its ability
to learn differential equations that describe the dynamics of 3D Gaussians, and
follow them during future frame extrapolation. Instead of simply fitting to the
observed visual frame sequence, we aim to more effectively model the gaussian
particle dynamics system. To this end, we introduce a dynamics latent state
vector into the standard Gaussian kernel and design a dynamics latent space
encoder to extract initial state. Subsequently, we introduce a Neural
ODEs-based dynamics module that models the temporal evolution of Gaussian in
dynamics latent space. Finally, a Gaussian kernel space decoder is used to
decode latent state at the specific time step into the deformation.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable
rendering quality with existing approaches in reconstruction tasks, and
significantly outperforms them in future frame extrapolation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/QuanJinSheng/ParticleGS.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在身份保留、文本对齐和图像质量上优于现有方法，且无需额外训练或数据收集。

Conclusion: In-Context Brush是一种高效且无需调优的解决方案，显著提升了自定义主题插入的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enhanced multimodal-guided visual
generation, enabling customized subject insertion that seamlessly "brushes"
user-specified objects into a given image guided by textual prompts. However,
existing methods often struggle to insert customized subjects with high
fidelity and align results with the user's intent through textual prompts. In
this work, we propose "In-Context Brush", a zero-shot framework for customized
subject insertion by reformulating the task within the paradigm of in-context
learning. Without loss of generality, we formulate the object image and the
textual prompts as cross-modal demonstrations, and the target image with the
masked region as the query. The goal is to inpaint the target image with the
subject aligning textual prompts without model tuning. Building upon a
pretrained MMDiT-based inpainting network, we perform test-time enhancement via
dual-level latent space manipulation: intra-head "latent feature shifting"
within each attention head that dynamically shifts attention outputs to reflect
the desired subject semantics and inter-head "attention reweighting" across
different heads that amplifies prompt controllability through differential
attention prioritization. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior identity preservation, text alignment, and
image quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring
dedicated training or additional data collection.

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试中表现优异，展现出不确定性感知、空间感知和迭代优化等认知行为。

Conclusion: Ground-R1为现有方法提供了可扩展且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive general
capabilities across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. However, the reasoning
processes of LVLMs often suffer from unreliable outputs and limited
interpretability. To address this, grounded visual reasoning has emerged as a
promising paradigm that enforces responses anchored on salient visual evidence
regions. However, existing approaches typically rely on costly supervision such
as bounding box annotations, chain-of-thought rationale or external tool calls,
limiting their scalability. In this work, we propose Ground-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables grounded visual reasoning without requiring
explicit evidence or rationale annotations. Ground-R1 consists of a grounding
phase that generates evidence region rollouts based on format constraints, and
an answering phase that produces responses guided by both answer correctness
and format adherence rewards. Extensive experiments across multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks manifest that Ground-R1 achieves superior performance and
exhibits emergent cognitive behaviors such as uncertainty awareness, spatial
perception, and iterative refinement, offering a scalable and interpretable
alternative to existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled high-fidelity

behind their proprietary counterparts, primarily due to limited high-quality
data and insufficient benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
ImgEdit, a large-scale, high-quality image-editing dataset comprising 1.2

task-specific in-painting procedures and strict post-processing. ImgEdit
surpasses existing datasets in both task novelty and data quality. Using
ImgEdit, we train ImgEdit-E1, an editing model using Vision Language Model to
process the reference image and editing prompt, which outperforms existing
open-source models on multiple tasks, highlighting the value of ImgEdit and
model design. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ImgEdit-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate image editing performance in terms of

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for 2D images and
videos has motivated extending these models to understand 3D scenes, aiming for
human-like visual-spatial intelligence. Nevertheless, achieving deep spatial
understanding comparable to human capabilities poses significant challenges in
model encoding and data acquisition. Existing methods frequently depend on
external depth sensors for geometry capture or utilize off-the-shelf algorithms
for pre-constructing 3D maps, thereby limiting their scalability, especially
with prevalent monocular video inputs and for time-sensitive applications. In
this work, we introduce VLM-3R, a unified framework for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) that incorporates 3D Reconstructive instruction tuning. VLM-3R processes
monocular video frames by employing a geometry encoder to derive implicit 3D
tokens that represent spatial understanding. Leveraging our Spatial-Visual-View
Fusion and over 200K curated 3D reconstructive instruction tuning
question-answer (QA) pairs, VLM-3R effectively aligns real-world spatial
context with language instructions. This enables monocular 3D spatial
assistance and embodied reasoning. To facilitate the evaluation of temporal
reasoning, we introduce the Vision-Spatial-Temporal Intelligence benchmark,
featuring over 138.6K QA pairs across five distinct tasks focused on evolving
spatial relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model,
VLM-3R, not only facilitates robust visual-spatial reasoning but also enables
the understanding of temporal 3D context changes, excelling in both accuracy
and scalability.

Result: 在多种物体类别上验证了方法的有效性，实现了直观的姿态控制并保留实例信息。

Conclusion: 提出的数据驱动方法优于传统启发式方法，具有更好的可控性和扩展性。

Abstract: The motion of deformable 4D objects lies in a low-dimensional manifold. To
better capture the low dimensionality and enable better controllability,
traditional methods have devised several heuristic-based methods, i.e.,
rigging, for manipulating dynamic objects in an intuitive fashion. However,
such representations are not scalable due to the need for expert knowledge of
specific categories. Instead, we study the automatic exploration of such
low-dimensional structures in a purely data-driven manner. Specifically, we
design a novel representation that encodes deformable 4D objects into a sparse
set of spatially grounded blobs and an instance-aware feature volume to
disentangle the pose and instance information of the 3D shape. With such a
representation, we can manipulate the pose of 3D objects intuitively by
modifying the parameters of the blobs, while preserving rich instance-specific
information. We evaluate the proposed method on a variety of object categories
and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Project page:

Result: 在WebVid-10M和MC-Bench上的实验验证了MotionPro的有效性。

Conclusion: MotionPro实现了更精确的运动控制，并提供了新的评估基准。

Abstract: Animating images with interactive motion control has garnered popularity for
image-to-video (I2V) generation. Modern approaches typically rely on large
Gaussian kernels to extend motion trajectories as condition without explicitly
defining movement region, leading to coarse motion control and failing to
disentangle object and camera moving. To alleviate these, we present MotionPro,
a precise motion controller that novelly leverages region-wise trajectory and
motion mask to regulate fine-grained motion synthesis and identify target
motion category (i.e., object or camera moving), respectively. Technically,
MotionPro first estimates the flow maps on each training video via a tracking
model, and then samples the region-wise trajectories to simulate inference
scenario. Instead of extending flow through large Gaussian kernels, our
region-wise trajectory approach enables more precise control by directly
utilizing trajectories within local regions, thereby effectively characterizing
fine-grained movements. A motion mask is simultaneously derived from the
predicted flow maps to capture the holistic motion dynamics of the movement
regions. To pursue natural motion control, MotionPro further strengthens video
denoising by incorporating both region-wise trajectories and motion mask
through feature modulation. More remarkably, we meticulously construct a
benchmark, i.e., MC-Bench, with 1.1K user-annotated image-trajectory pairs, for
the evaluation of both fine-grained and object-level I2V motion control.
Extensive experiments conducted on WebVid-10M and MC-Bench demonstrate the
effectiveness of MotionPro. Please refer to our project page for more results:

Result: 在类条件和文本到图像生成任务中，Hi-MAR优于典型自回归基线，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Hi-MAR通过分层建模和多阶段设计，显著提升了自回归模型的生成效果和效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful generative paradigm for
visual generation. The current de-facto standard of next token prediction
commonly operates over a single-scale sequence of dense image tokens, and is
incapable of utilizing global context especially for early tokens prediction.
In this paper, we introduce a new autoregressive design to model a hierarchy
from a few low-resolution image tokens to the typical dense image tokens, and
delve into a thorough hierarchical dependency across multi-scale image tokens.
Technically, we present a Hierarchical Masked Autoregressive models (Hi-MAR)
that pivot on low-resolution image tokens to trigger hierarchical
autoregressive modeling in a multi-phase manner. Hi-MAR learns to predict a few
image tokens in low resolution, functioning as intermediary pivots to reflect
global structure, in the first phase. Such pivots act as the additional
guidance to strengthen the next autoregressive modeling phase by shaping global
structural awareness of typical dense image tokens. A new Diffusion Transformer
head is further devised to amplify the global context among all tokens for mask
token prediction. Extensive evaluations on both class-conditional and
text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that Hi-MAR outperforms typical AR
baselines, while requiring fewer computational costs. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有工具增强推理方法依赖无训练提示或大规模微调，缺乏主动工具探索且工具多样性有限。VisTA旨在解决这些问题。

Conclusion: VisTA展示了增强泛化能力和自适应利用多样化工具的潜力，为灵活、经验驱动的视觉推理系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: We introduce VisTA, a new reinforcement learning framework that empowers
visual agents to dynamically explore, select, and combine tools from a diverse
library based on empirical performance. Existing methods for tool-augmented
reasoning either rely on training-free prompting or large-scale fine-tuning;
both lack active tool exploration and typically assume limited tool diversity,
and fine-tuning methods additionally demand extensive human supervision. In
contrast, VisTA leverages end-to-end reinforcement learning to iteratively
refine sophisticated, query-specific tool selection strategies, using task
outcomes as feedback signals. Through Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), our framework enables an agent to autonomously discover effective
tool-selection pathways without requiring explicit reasoning supervision.
Experiments on the ChartQA, Geometry3K, and BlindTest benchmarks demonstrate
that VisTA achieves substantial performance gains over training-free baselines,
especially on out-of-distribution examples. These results highlight VisTA's
ability to enhance generalization, adaptively utilize diverse tools, and pave
the way for flexible, experience-driven visual reasoning systems.

Motivation: 解决现有跨模态相似性对齐在多模态嵌入中的局限性，尤其是对细微视觉空间特征的识别不足。

Method: 首先通过T2I生成将文本查询投影到图像模态，然后在图像模态内进行检索。

Result: 在三个知识密集型T2I检索基准测试中，VisRet将NDCG@10提升了24.5%至32.7%。

Conclusion: VisRet是一种即插即用的方法，适用于知识密集型多模态系统，并能显著提升下游任务的准确性。

Abstract: We propose Visualize-then-Retrieve (VisRet), a new paradigm for Text-to-Image
(T2I) retrieval that mitigates the limitations of cross-modal similarity
alignment of existing multi-modal embeddings. VisRet first projects textual
queries into the image modality via T2I generation. Then, it performs retrieval
within the image modality to bypass the weaknesses of cross-modal retrievers in
recognizing subtle visual-spatial features. Experiments on three
knowledge-intensive T2I retrieval benchmarks, including a newly introduced
multi-entity benchmark, demonstrate that VisRet consistently improves T2I
retrieval by 24.5% to 32.7% NDCG@10 across different embedding models. VisRet
also significantly benefits downstream visual question answering accuracy when
used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines. The method is plug-and-play

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了OpenS2V-Nexus，包括评估基准OpenS2V-Eval和大规模数据集OpenS2V-5M，用于提升Subject-to-Video（S2V）生成的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有S2V评估基准过于粗粒度，无法准确评估生成视频的主题一致性和自然度，因此需要更精细的评估工具和数据支持。

Method: 提出OpenS2V-Eval（180个提示词和自动评分指标）和OpenS2V-5M（500万高质量视频-文本-主题三元组），并评估了16种S2V模型。

Result: OpenS2V-Nexus提供了全面的评估框架，揭示了不同模型的优缺点，并构建了首个开源大规模S2V数据集。

Conclusion: OpenS2V-Nexus为未来S2V研究提供了坚实基础，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Subject-to-Video (S2V) generation aims to create videos that faithfully
incorporate reference content, providing enhanced flexibility in the production
of videos. To establish the infrastructure for S2V generation, we propose
OpenS2V-Nexus, consisting of (i) OpenS2V-Eval, a fine-grained benchmark, and
(ii) OpenS2V-5M, a million-scale dataset. In contrast to existing S2V
benchmarks inherited from VBench that focus on global and coarse-grained
assessment of generated videos, OpenS2V-Eval focuses on the model's ability to
generate subject-consistent videos with natural subject appearance and identity
fidelity. For these purposes, OpenS2V-Eval introduces 180 prompts from seven
major categories of S2V, which incorporate both real and synthetic test data.
Furthermore, to accurately align human preferences with S2V benchmarks, we
propose three automatic metrics, NexusScore, NaturalScore and GmeScore, to
separately quantify subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in
generated videos. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
representative S2V models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across
different content. Moreover, we create the first open-source large-scale S2V
generation dataset OpenS2V-5M, which consists of five million high-quality 720P
subject-text-video triples. Specifically, we ensure subject-information
diversity in our dataset by (1) segmenting subjects and building pairing
information via cross-video associations and (2) prompting GPT-Image-1 on raw
frames to synthesize multi-view representations. Through OpenS2V-Nexus, we
deliver a robust infrastructure to accelerate future S2V generation research.

Motivation: 解决移动机器人在复杂未知环境中通用主动映射的挑战，现有方法因数据不足和保守策略而泛化能力有限。

Method: 引入GLEAM-Bench基准测试，提出GLEAM策略，结合语义表示、长期目标和随机化策略。

Result: 在128个未见复杂场景中，覆盖率达到66.50%（提升9.49%），轨迹高效且映射精度提高。

Conclusion: GLEAM策略在通用主动映射中表现出色，为复杂环境中的机器人探索提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable active mapping in complex unknown environments remains a
critical challenge for mobile robots. Existing methods, constrained by
insufficient training data and conservative exploration strategies, exhibit
limited generalizability across scenes with diverse layouts and complex
connectivity. To enable scalable training and reliable evaluation, we introduce
GLEAM-Bench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for generalizable active
mapping with 1,152 diverse 3D scenes from synthetic and real-scan datasets.
Building upon this foundation, we propose GLEAM, a unified generalizable
exploration policy for active mapping. Its superior generalizability comes
mainly from our semantic representations, long-term navigable goals, and
randomized strategies. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving 66.50% coverage (+9.49%) with efficient trajectories and improved
mapping accuracy on 128 unseen complex scenes. Project page:

### [991] [DiSA: Diffusion Step Annealing in Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20297)
*Qinyu Zhao,Jaskirat Singh,Ming Xu,Akshay Asthana,Stephen Gould,Liang Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为DiSA的方法，通过逐步减少扩散步数来提升自回归模型中扩散采样的推理效率，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自回归过程中生成的token增多，后续token的分布更受约束，更容易采样。

Method: 提出扩散步数退火（DiSA），在生成过程中逐步减少扩散步数。

Result: DiSA实现了5-10倍的推理加速（MAR和Harmon）和1.4-2.5倍加速（FlowAR和xAR），且生成质量不变。

Conclusion: DiSA是一种简单有效的训练无关方法，适用于自回归模型中的扩散采样加速。

Abstract: An increasing number of autoregressive models, such as MAR, FlowAR, xAR, and
Harmon adopt diffusion sampling to improve the quality of image generation.
However, this strategy leads to low inference efficiency, because it usually
takes 50 to 100 steps for diffusion to sample a token. This paper explores how
to effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens
are generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more
constrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if
a model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog
and thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at
later generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer
perceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising
paths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step
annealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion
steps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and
gradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from
our finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary
to existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone. DiSA can be
implemented in only a few lines of code on existing models, and albeit simple,
achieves $5-10\times$ faster inference for MAR and Harmon and $1.4-2.5\times$
for FlowAR and xAR, while maintaining the generation quality.

Conclusion: 笼状几何框架为处理复杂网格提供了有效解决方案，提升了在“野生”网格上的学习性能。

Abstract: Learning on triangle meshes has recently proven to be instrumental to a
myriad of tasks, from shape classification, to segmentation, to deformation and
animation, to mention just a few. While some of these applications are tackled
through neural network architectures which are tailored to the application at
hand, many others use generic frameworks for triangle meshes where the only
customization required is the modification of the input features and the loss
function. Our goal in this paper is to broaden the applicability of these
generic frameworks to "wild", i.e. meshes in-the-wild which often have multiple
components, non-manifold elements, disrupted connectivity, or a combination of
these. We propose a configurable meta-framework based on the concept of caged
geometry: Given a mesh, a cage is a single component manifold triangle mesh
that envelopes it closely. Generalized barycentric coordinates map between
functions on the cage, and functions on the mesh, allowing us to learn and test
on a variety of data, in different applications. We demonstrate this concept by
learning segmentation and skinning weights on difficult data, achieving better
performance to state of the art techniques on wild meshes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散视频生成计算成本高，现有加速方法常以质量下降为代价。

Method: 大模型处理高噪声步骤（Sketching），小模型优化低噪声步骤（Rendering）。

Result: 实验显示，SRDiffusion在Wan上实现3倍加速，CogVideoX上2倍加速，且质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: SRDiffusion为视频生成提供了一种新的正交加速方向，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Leveraging the diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, models like Sora,
CogVideoX and Wan have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video,
image-to-video, and video editing tasks. Despite these advances,
diffusion-based video generation remains computationally intensive, especially
for high-resolution, long-duration videos. Prior work accelerates its inference
by skipping computation, usually at the cost of severe quality degradation. In
this paper, we propose SRDiffusion, a novel framework that leverages
collaboration between large and small models to reduce inference cost. The
large model handles high-noise steps to ensure semantic and motion fidelity
(Sketching), while the smaller model refines visual details in low-noise steps
(Rendering). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches, over 3$\times$ speedup for Wan with nearly no quality loss
for VBench, and 2$\times$ speedup for CogVideoX. Our method is introduced as a
new direction orthogonal to existing acceleration strategies, offering a
practical solution for scalable video generation.

Abstract: We develop a general theoretical framework for optimal probability density
control and propose a numerical algorithm that is scalable to solve the control
problem in high dimensions. Specifically, we establish the Pontryagin Maximum
Principle (PMP) for optimal density control and construct the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation of the value functional through rigorous
derivations without any concept from Wasserstein theory. To solve the density
control problem numerically, we propose to use reduced-order models, such as
deep neural networks (DNNs), to parameterize the control vector-field and the
adjoint function, which allows us to tackle problems defined on
high-dimensional state spaces. We also prove several convergence properties of
the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate promising performances of
our algorithm on a variety of density control problems with obstacles and
nonlinear interaction challenges in high dimensions.

Result: FBR-DGM显著提升了网络近似及其导数的精度，并能通过原始-对偶关系验证自洽性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法为缺乏解析解的问题提供了创新的基准，并有效解决了非线性HJB方程的数值求解难题。

Abstract: Mixed optimal stopping and stochastic control problems define variational
inequalities with non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) operators, whose
numerical solution is notoriously difficult and lack of reliable benchmarks. We
first use the dual approach to transform it into a linear operator, and then
introduce a Fractional-Boundary-Regularized Deep Galerkin Method (FBR-DGM) that
augments the classical $L^2$ loss with Sobolev-Slobodeckij norms on the
parabolic boundary, enforcing regularity and yielding consistent improvements
in the network approximation and its derivatives. The improved accuracy allows
the network to be converted back to the original solution using the dual
transform. The self-consistency and stability of the network can be tested by
checking the primal-dual relationship among optimal value, optimal wealth, and
optimal control, offering innovative benchmarks in the absence of analytical
solutions.

Motivation: 在梯度信息不可用或计算成本高的情况下，有限差分方法广泛用于零阶优化。结构化方向理论上能提升性能，但实际应用中可能因额外计算成本受限。

Method: 回顾并扩展了多种构建结构化方向矩阵的策略，并与非结构化方法在计算成本、梯度近似和收敛行为上进行比较。

Result: 结构化方向的计算成本与非结构化相近，但显著提高了梯度估计精度和优化性能。

Conclusion: 结构化方向在有限差分方法中具有实际优势，尤其是在高维设置中。

Abstract: Finite-difference methods are widely used for zeroth-order optimization in
settings where gradient information is unavailable or expensive to compute.
These procedures mimic first-order strategies by approximating gradients
through function evaluations along a set of random directions. From a
theoretical perspective, recent studies indicate that imposing structure (such
as orthogonality) on the chosen directions allows for the derivation of
convergence rates comparable to those achieved with unstructured random
directions (i.e., directions sampled independently from a distribution).
Empirically, although structured directions are expected to enhance
performance, they often introduce additional computational costs, which can
limit their applicability in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we
examine the impact of structured direction selection in finite-difference
methods. We review and extend several strategies for constructing structured
direction matrices and compare them with unstructured approaches in terms of
computational cost, gradient approximation quality, and convergence behavior.
Our evaluation spans both synthetic tasks and real-world applications such as
adversarial perturbation. The results demonstrate that structured directions
can be generated with computational costs comparable to unstructured ones while
significantly improving gradient estimation accuracy and optimization
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Polyak步长在凸优化中表现优异，但其收敛性和局限性的理解仍不完整且分散。

Method: 通过将Polyak步长及其变体视为对替代损失的梯度下降，提供统一分析。

Result: 证明了某些变体的非收敛性，并提供了统一的理论框架。

Conclusion: 替代损失视角为Polyak步长及其变体提供了统一且简化的分析工具。

Abstract: The Polyak stepsize has been proven to be a fundamental stepsize in convex
optimization, giving near optimal gradient descent rates across a wide range of
assumptions. The universality of the Polyak stepsize has also inspired many
stochastic variants, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical
performance. Despite the many theoretical results, our understanding of the
convergence properties and shortcomings of the Polyak stepsize or its variants
is both incomplete and fractured across different analyses. We propose a new,
unified, and simple perspective for the Polyak stepsize and its variants as
gradient descent on a surrogate loss. We show that each variant is equivalent
to minimize a surrogate function with stepsizes that adapt to a guaranteed
local curvature. Our general surrogate loss perspective is then used to provide
a unified analysis of existing variants across different assumptions. Moreover,
we show a number of negative results proving that the non-convergence results
in some of the upper bounds is indeed real.

Result: 在MATLAB内置图像上的实验表明，热带代数与传统算子（如Canny和LoG）结合，能改善低对比度和纹理区域的边界检测。定量评估显示边缘清晰度和结构连贯性更优。

Conclusion: 热带代数作为一种可扩展且对噪声敏感的方法，在实际图像分析任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a tropical geometry-based edge detection framework that
reformulates convolution and gradient computations using min-plus and max-plus
algebra. The tropical formulation emphasizes dominant intensity variations,
contributing to sharper and more continuous edge representations. Three
variants are explored: an adaptive threshold-based method, a multi-kernel
min-plus method, and a max-plus method emphasizing structural continuity. The
framework integrates multi-scale processing, Hessian filtering, and wavelet
shrinkage to enhance edge transitions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Experiments on MATLAB built-in grayscale and color images suggest
that tropical formulations integrated with classical operators, such as Canny
and LoG, can improve boundary detection in low-contrast and textured regions.
Quantitative evaluation using standard edge metrics indicates favorable edge
clarity and structural coherence. These results highlight the potential of
tropical algebra as a scalable and noise-aware formulation for edge detection
in practical image analysis tasks.

Abstract: Universal speech enhancement aims to handle input speech with different

To address various distortions, the proposed system employs a novel three-stage

restoration stage. The filling stage mitigates packet loss by preliminarily
filling lost regions under noise interference, ensuring signal continuity. The
separation stage suppresses noise, reverberation, and clipping distortion to
improve speech clarity. Finally, the restoration stage compensates for
bandwidth limitation, codec artifacts, and residual packet loss distortion,
refining the overall speech quality. Our proposed TS-URGENet achieved

Result: TT数据集在PD检测中表现与PC-GITA相当；音频拼接和分布平衡有助于性能提升；TT训练的模型在PC-GITA上泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 非诊断性语音数据可用于PD检测，但需注意数据特征和个体差异对模型性能的影响。

Abstract: Speech-based Parkinson's disease (PD) detection has gained attention for its
automated, cost-effective, and non-intrusive nature. As research studies
usually rely on data from diagnostic-oriented speech tasks, this work explores
the feasibility of diagnosing PD on the basis of speech data not originally
intended for diagnostic purposes, using the Turn-Taking (TT) dataset. Our
findings indicate that TT can be as useful as diagnostic-oriented PD datasets
like PC-GITA. We also investigate which specific dataset characteristics impact
PD classification performance. The results show that concatenating audio
recordings and balancing participants' gender and status distributions can be
beneficial. Cross-dataset evaluation reveals that models trained on PC-GITA
generalize poorly to TT, whereas models trained on TT perform better on
PC-GITA. Furthermore, we provide insights into the high variability across
folds, which is mainly due to large differences in individual speaker
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音大语言模型（SLLMs）依赖监督微调对齐语音与文本，但缺乏广泛任务的标注语音数据导致泛化能力差。

Method: 采用多任务行为模仿（MTBI）方法，仅需配对的语音和文本，通过交错技术增强对齐效率。

Result: 实验表明，MTBI在提示和任务泛化上优于现有SLLMs，且需要更少的监督语音数据。

Conclusion: MTBI方法显著提升了语音大语言模型的泛化能力，减少了数据依赖。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable generalization across
tasks, leading to increased interest in integrating speech with LLMs. These
speech LLMs (SLLMs) typically use supervised fine-tuning to align speech with
text-based LLMs. However, the lack of annotated speech data across a wide range
of tasks hinders alignment efficiency, resulting in poor generalization. To
address these issues, we propose a novel multi-task 'behavior imitation' method
with speech-text interleaving, called MTBI, which relies solely on paired
speech and transcripts. By ensuring the LLM decoder generates equivalent
responses to paired speech and text, we achieve a more generalized SLLM.
Interleaving is used to further enhance alignment efficiency. We introduce a
simple benchmark to evaluate prompt and task generalization across different
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our MTBI outperforms SOTA SLLMs
on both prompt and task generalization, while requiring less supervised speech
data.

Conclusion: 需要超越任务级指标的评估方法，以指导未来研究。

Abstract: We introduce Speech-IFeval, an evaluation framework designed to assess
instruction-following capabilities and quantify catastrophic forgetting in
speech-aware language models (SLMs). Recent SLMs integrate speech perception
with large language models (LLMs), often degrading textual capabilities due to
speech-centric training. Existing benchmarks conflate speech perception with
instruction-following, hindering evaluation of these distinct skills. To
address this gap, we provide a benchmark for diagnosing the
instruction-following abilities of SLMs. Our findings show that most SLMs
struggle with even basic instructions, performing far worse than text-based
LLMs. Additionally, these models are highly sensitive to prompt variations,
often yielding inconsistent and unreliable outputs. We highlight core
challenges and provide insights to guide future research, emphasizing the need

Abstract: This paper explores multi-modal controllable Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS)
where the voice can be generated from face image, and the characteristics of
output speech (e.g., pace, noise level, distance, tone, place) can be
controllable with natural text description. Specifically, we aim to mitigate
the following three challenges in face-driven TTS systems. 1) To overcome the
limited audio quality of audio-visual speech corpora, we propose a training
method that additionally utilizes high-quality audio-only speech corpora. 2) To
generate voices not only from real human faces but also from artistic
portraits, we propose augmenting the input face image with stylization. 3) To
consider one-to-many possibilities in face-to-voice mapping and ensure
consistent voice generation at the same time, we propose to first employ
sampling-based decoding and then use prompting with generated speech samples.
Experimental results validate the proposed model's effectiveness in face-driven

Web of Science databases. These studies primarily explored acoustic differences
between individuals at risk of suicide (RS) and those not at risk (NRS), and
evaluated ML classifier performance. Findings consistently showed significant
acoustic feature variations between RS and NRS populations, particularly
involving jitter, fundamental frequency (F0), Mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCC), and power spectral density (PSD). Classifier effectiveness
varied based on algorithms, modalities, and speech elicitation methods, with
multimodal approaches integrating acoustic, linguistic, and metadata features
demonstrating superior performance. However, limitations such as methodological
variability, small sample sizes, lack of longitudinal data, and limited
linguistic and demographic diversity restrict generalizability. Future research
should focus on standardizing methods, expanding multimodal analyses, and
utilizing larger, diverse datasets to support AI integration in clinical
suicide risk assessment.

Motivation: 语音障碍严重影响患者生活质量，但非侵入性自动诊断因数据稀缺和录音来源多样性而研究不足。

Method: 采用Transformer直接处理原始语音信号，探索了波形拼接、中间特征融合和决策级组合三种融合策略。

Result: 在德语、葡萄牙语和意大利语中验证，中间特征融合表现最佳，AUC提升高达13%。

Conclusion: MVP通过多源融合显著提升了语音病理检测的准确性。

Abstract: Voice disorders significantly impact patient quality of life, yet
non-invasive automated diagnosis remains under-explored due to both the
scarcity of pathological voice data, and the variability in recording sources.
This work introduces MVP (Multi-source Voice Pathology detection), a novel
approach that leverages transformers operating directly on raw voice signals.
We explore three fusion strategies to combine sentence reading and sustained
vowel recordings: waveform concatenation, intermediate feature fusion, and
decision-level combination. Empirical validation across the German, Portuguese,
and Italian languages shows that intermediate feature fusion using transformers
best captures the complementary characteristics of both recording types. Our
approach achieves up to +13% AUC improvement over single-source methods.

TLDR: 论文提出BALSa方法，通过合成数据生成解决音频-语言对齐问题，并引入LISTEN训练方法以减少音频幻觉。实验表明该方法有效且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频感知大语言模型（ALLMs）在音频训练后易遗忘文本能力且依赖大量任务特定数据，需解决这些问题。

Method: 利用基础LLM合成通用对齐数据（BALSa），并引入LISTEN对比训练方法，扩展至多音频场景。

Result: 方法有效减少音频幻觉，保持音频理解与推理能力，多音频训练进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: BALSa为ALLMs开发提供高效可扩展方案。

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in
understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted
from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on
audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major
limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
important textual capabilities such as instruction-following are lost after
training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that
are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about their reliability.
Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically
relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for
instruction tuning, making the process resource-intensive. To address these
issues, we leverage the backbone LLMs from ALLMs to synthesize general-purpose
caption-style alignment data. We refer to this process as bootstrapping
audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs
(BALSa). Building on BALSa, we introduce LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds
Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method designed
to improve ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds. We
further extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains
the differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that
describes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental
results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations
while reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding,
reasoning, and instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating
multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning
capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to the
development of ALLMs.

Motivation: 现有判别式模型在目标语音提取中引入伪影且对训练测试环境差异敏感，而生成式模型在感知质量和清晰度上表现不足。

Method: 提出SoloSpeech，一种级联生成式管道，包含压缩、提取、重建和校正过程，利用潜在空间条件信息避免不匹配。

Result: 在Libri2Mix数据集上，SoloSpeech在目标语音提取和语音分离任务中达到新的最优质量和清晰度，并表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SoloSpeech通过生成式方法解决了现有技术的局限性，成为目标语音提取领域的新标杆。

Abstract: Target Speech Extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a target speaker's voice from
a mixture of multiple speakers by leveraging speaker-specific cues, typically
provided as auxiliary audio (a.k.a. cue audio). Although recent advancements in
TSE have primarily employed discriminative models that offer high perceptual
quality, these models often introduce unwanted artifacts, reduce naturalness,
and are sensitive to discrepancies between training and testing environments.
On the other hand, generative models for TSE lag in perceptual quality and
intelligibility. To address these challenges, we present SoloSpeech, a novel
cascaded generative pipeline that integrates compression, extraction,
reconstruction, and correction processes. SoloSpeech features a
speaker-embedding-free target extractor that utilizes conditional information
from the cue audio's latent space, aligning it with the mixture audio's latent
space to prevent mismatches. Evaluated on the widely-used Libri2Mix dataset,
SoloSpeech achieves the new state-of-the-art intelligibility and quality in
target speech extraction and speech separation tasks while demonstrating
exceptional generalization on out-of-domain data and real-world scenarios.

TLDR: Autocomp利用LLM驱动的搜索和硬件反馈优化张量加速器代码，显著提升性能。

Motivation: 张量加速器编程复杂且潜力未充分发挥，LLM在代码生成中表现优异但针对低资源语言仍具挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段提示（规划与代码生成）、插入领域知识、集成硬件反馈。

Result: 优化代码性能显著提升，优于供应商库和专家手动调优代码。

Conclusion: Autocomp方法高效且可重用，适用于类似张量操作。

Abstract: Hardware accelerators, especially those designed for tensor processing, have
become ubiquitous in today's computing landscape. However, even with
significant efforts in building compilers, programming these tensor
accelerators remains challenging, leaving much of their potential
underutilized. Recently, large language models (LLMs), trained on large amounts
of code, have shown significant promise in code generation and optimization
tasks, but generating low-resource languages like specialized tensor
accelerator code still poses a significant challenge. We tackle this challenge
with Autocomp, an approach that empowers accelerator programmers to leverage
domain knowledge and hardware feedback to optimize code via an automated
LLM-driven search. We accomplish this by: 1) formulating each optimization pass
as a structured two-phase prompt, divided into planning and code generation
phases, 2) inserting domain knowledge during planning via a concise and
adaptable optimization menu, and 3) integrating correctness and performance
metrics from hardware as feedback at each search iteration. Across three
categories of representative workloads and two different accelerators, we
demonstrate that Autocomp-optimized code runs 5.6x (GEMM) and 2.7x
(convolution) faster than the vendor-provided library, and outperforms
expert-level hand-tuned code by 1.4x (GEMM), 1.1x (convolution), and 1.3x
(fine-grained linear algebra). Additionally, we demonstrate that optimization
schedules generated from Autocomp can be reused across similar tensor
operations, improving speedups by up to 24% under a fixed sample budget.

Conclusion: 建议人机协作模式，LLM可降低某些逆向工程任务的门槛，但复杂任务仍需人工指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in software engineering, yet
their effectiveness for binary analysis remains unexplored. We present the
first comprehensive evaluation of commercial LLMs for assembly code
deobfuscation. Testing seven state-of-the-art models against four obfuscation
scenarios (bogus control flow, instruction substitution, control flow
flattening, and their combination), we found striking performance
variations--from autonomous deobfuscation to complete failure. We propose a
theoretical framework based on four dimensions: Reasoning Depth, Pattern
Recognition, Noise Filtering, and Context Integration, explaining these
variations. Our analysis identifies five error patterns: predicate
misinterpretation, structural mapping errors, control flow misinterpretation,
arithmetic transformation errors, and constant propagation errors, revealing
fundamental limitations in LLM code processing.We establish a three-tier
resistance model: bogus control flow (low resistance), control flow flattening
(moderate resistance), and instruction substitution/combined techniques (high
resistance). Universal failure against combined techniques demonstrates that
sophisticated obfuscation remains effective against advanced LLMs. Our findings
suggest a human-AI collaboration paradigm where LLMs reduce expertise barriers
for certain reverse engineering tasks while requiring human guidance for
complex deobfuscation. This work provides a foundation for evaluating emerging
capabilities and developing resistant obfuscation techniques.x deobfuscation.

Motivation: AI系统在高风险应用中的不透明性和概率性对传统验证方法提出挑战，尤其在需要审计证据的监管领域。

Method: 通过系统调查ZKP协议，识别关键属性，并分析ZKP增强的ML应用。

Result: 当前研究主要集中在推理验证，而数据预处理和训练阶段研究不足。

Conclusion: 提出ZKMLOps框架，利用ZKP增强AI的可信度、透明性和合规性。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those based on machine
learning (ML), become integral to high-stakes applications, their probabilistic
and opaque nature poses significant challenges to traditional verification and
validation methods. These challenges are exacerbated in regulated sectors
requiring tamper-proof, auditable evidence, as highlighted by apposite legal
frameworks, e.g., the EU AI Act. Conversely, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) offer
a cryptographic solution that enables provers to demonstrate, through verified
computations, adherence to set requirements without revealing sensitive model
details or data. Through a systematic survey of ZKP protocols, we identify five
key properties (non-interactivity, transparent setup, standard representations,
succinctness, and post-quantum security) critical for their application in AI
validation and verification pipelines. Subsequently, we perform a follow-up
systematic survey analyzing ZKP-enhanced ML applications across an adaptation
of the Team Data Science Process (TDSP) model (Data & Preprocessing, Training &
Offline Metrics, Inference, and Online Metrics), detailing verification
objectives, ML models, and adopted protocols. Our findings indicate that
current research on ZKP-Enhanced ML primarily focuses on inference
verification, while the data preprocessing and training stages remain
underexplored. Most notably, our analysis identifies a significant convergence
within the research domain toward the development of a unified Zero-Knowledge
Machine Learning Operations (ZKMLOps) framework. This emerging framework
leverages ZKPs to provide robust cryptographic guarantees of correctness,
integrity, and privacy, thereby promoting enhanced accountability,
transparency, and compliance with Trustworthy AI principles.

Motivation: Go语言在基础设施和区块链项目中的广泛应用需要更强的安全措施，现有技术如单元测试和静态分析仍有不足。

Method: Zorya利用具体和符号执行（concolic执行）结合Ghidra的P-Code作为中间表示（IR），系统探索执行路径以发现漏洞。

Result: 该方法成功检测了TinyGo编译器中的运行时panic，并支持通用和自定义不变式，还能分析其他语言如C的程序。

Conclusion: Zorya展示了符号执行在Go程序安全分析中的潜力，未来可进一步优化以识别漏洞模式。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of the Go programming language in infrastructure
backends and blockchain projects has heightened the need for improved security
measures. Established techniques such as unit testing, static analysis, and
program fuzzing provide foundational protection mechanisms. Although symbolic
execution tools have made significant contributions, opportunities remain to
address the complexities of Go's runtime and concurrency model. In this work,
we present Zorya, a novel methodology leveraging concrete and symbolic
(concolic) execution to evaluate Go programs comprehensively. By systematically
exploring execution paths to uncover vulnerabilities beyond conventional
testing, symbolic execution offers distinct advantages, and coupling it with
concrete execution mitigates the path explosion problem. Our solution employs
Ghidra's P-Code as an intermediate representation (IR). This implementation
detects runtime panics in the TinyGo compiler and supports both generic and
custom invariants. Furthermore, P-Code's generic IR nature enables analysis of
programs written in other languages such as C. Future enhancements may include
intelligent classification of concolic execution logs to identify vulnerability
patterns.

applied to fault localization for GUI components. Unlike traditional software,
GUI test cases are usually event sequences, and each individual event has a

Result: SEW在LiveCodeBench等数据集上表现优异，性能提升高达33%，并提供了工作流编码的最佳实践。

Conclusion: SEW框架通过自进化实现了多代理工作流的自动设计和优化，显著提升了复杂编码任务的解决能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in code
generation tasks. To enable LLMs to address more complex coding challenges,
existing research has focused on crafting multi-agent systems with agentic
workflows, where complex coding tasks are decomposed into sub-tasks, assigned
to specialized agents. Despite their effectiveness, current approaches heavily
rely on hand-crafted agentic workflows, with both agent topologies and prompts
manually designed, which limits their ability to automatically adapt to
different types of coding problems. To address these limitations and enable
automated workflow design, we propose \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving
\textbf{W}orkflow (\textbf{SEW}), a novel self-evolving framework that
automatically generates and optimises multi-agent workflows. Extensive
experiments on three coding benchmark datasets, including the challenging
LiveCodeBench, demonstrate that our SEW can automatically design agentic
workflows and optimise them through self-evolution, bringing up to 33\%
improvement on LiveCodeBench compared to using the backbone LLM only.
Furthermore, by investigating different representation schemes of workflow, we
provide insights into the optimal way to encode workflow information with text.

Motivation: 探讨后处理对指令调优LLM输出的必要性，以解决FIM代码生成中的多余代码问题。

Method: 通过监督微调优化LLM（如Qwen2.5-Coder），并在HumanEval Infilling和SAFIM基准上评估性能。

Result: 微调后的模型在生成完整行代码时无需后处理，但在随机代码片段时仍需后处理。

Conclusion: 监督微调可提升FIM代码生成质量，但后处理在某些场景下仍不可或缺。

Abstract: Post-processing is crucial for the automatic evaluation of LLMs in
fill-in-the-middle (FIM) code generation due to the frequent presence of
extraneous code in raw outputs. This extraneous generation suggests a lack of
awareness regarding output boundaries, requiring truncation for effective
evaluation. The determination of an optimal truncation strategy, however, often
proves intricate, particularly when the scope includes several programming
languages. This study investigates the necessity of post-processing
instruction-tuned LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that supervised fine-tuning
significantly enhances FIM code generation, enabling LLMs to generate code that
seamlessly integrates with the surrounding context. Evaluating our fine-tuned
\texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder} (base and instruct) models on HumanEval Infilling and
SAFIM benchmarks demonstrates improved performances without post-processing,
especially when the \emph{middle} consist of complete lines. However,
post-processing of the LLM outputs remains necessary when the \emph{middle} is
a random span of code.

Conclusion: 成功的AI软件工程需结合两种范式的优势，构建以人为中心的统一开发生命周期。

Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive analysis of two emerging paradigms in
AI-assisted software development: vibe coding and agentic coding. While both
leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy,
architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes
intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational
workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In
contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through
goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks
with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning
conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms,
debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative
workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems
thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in
enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We
further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language
interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we
articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed
for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest
that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm,
but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development
lifecycle.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used more and more for various coding

particularly given the flexibility of such generative AI models and tools. Yet
for many tasks it may not be suitable to use LLMs, for which it may be more
suitable to use smaller language models that can fit and easily execute and

smaller language models can be fine-tuned to achieve reasonable results for a
niche area: vulnerability detection -- specifically focusing on detecting the

Result: CIDRe在交叉熵评估中表现优于现有指标，且基于CIDRe过滤数据微调的模型在GPT-4o-mini评估中显示出显著质量提升。

Conclusion: CIDRe是一种有效的代码注释质量评估标准，能够显著提升模型生成注释的质量。

Abstract: Effective generation of structured code comments requires robust quality
metrics for dataset curation, yet existing approaches (SIDE, MIDQ, STASIS)
suffer from limited code-comment analysis. We propose CIDRe, a
language-agnostic reference-free quality criterion combining four synergistic
aspects: (1) relevance (code-comment semantic alignment), (2) informativeness
(functional coverage), (3) completeness (presence of all structure sections),
and (4) description length (detail sufficiency). We validate our criterion on a
manually annotated dataset. Experiments demonstrate CIDRe's superiority over
existing metrics, achieving improvement in cross-entropy evaluation. When
applied to filter comments, the models finetuned on CIDRe-filtered data show
statistically significant quality gains in GPT-4o-mini assessments.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在软件开发中的广泛应用，评估其生成结构化输出的能力变得至关重要。

Method: 通过生成任务（从自然语言提示生成结构化输出）和转换任务（在结构化格式之间转换）系统评估18种格式的结构保真度，并引入新的指标衡量格式一致性和结构正确性。

Result: 结果显示性能差距显著，即使是先进模型如o1-mini平均得分仅为75.58，开源模型落后约10分。生成任务比转换任务更具挑战性，生成视觉内容比文本结构更困难。

Conclusion: StructEval为评估LLMs的结构化输出能力提供了全面基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，尤其是在生成复杂结构方面的不足。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to software development
workflows, their ability to generate structured outputs has become critically
important. We introduce StructEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
LLMs' capabilities in producing both non-renderable (JSON, YAML, CSV) and
renderable (HTML, React, SVG) structured formats. Unlike prior benchmarks,
StructEval systematically evaluates structural fidelity across diverse formats
through two paradigms: 1) generation tasks, producing structured output from
natural language prompts, and 2) conversion tasks, translating between
structured formats. Our benchmark encompasses 18 formats and 44 types of task,
with novel metrics for format adherence and structural correctness. Results
reveal significant performance gaps, even state-of-the-art models like o1-mini
achieve only 75.58 average score, with open-source alternatives lagging
approximately 10 points behind. We find generation tasks more challenging than
conversion tasks, and producing correct visual content more difficult than

TLDR: 论文研究了如何利用检索增强生成（RAG）优化API描述的预处理，以减少输入令牌长度并保留关键信息，同时提出了一个发现代理（Discovery Agent）来进一步优化端点检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态环境中集成多个（子）系统时，传统方法依赖注册表提供API文档，但大型语言模型（LLM）在生成系统集成时需要简洁的输入。目前缺乏对API描述预处理的最佳实践。

Method: （i）分析RAG在端点发现和OpenAPI预处理中的应用；（ii）提出Discovery Agent，仅接收最相关端点的摘要并按需检索详细信息；（iii）使用SOCBench-D和RestBench基准评估RAG和Discovery Agent的性能。

Result: 实验表明，基于端点的预处理方法优于简单分块方法，Discovery Agent显著提高了精度，但可能降低召回率，表明需要进一步推理能力。

Conclusion: RAG和Discovery Agent能有效减少令牌数量并提升端点发现效率，但需进一步优化以平衡精度和召回率。

Abstract: Integrating multiple (sub-)systems is essential to create advanced
Information Systems. Difficulties mainly arise when integrating dynamic
environments, e.g., the integration at design time of not yet existing
services. This has been traditionally addressed using a registry that provides
the API documentation of the endpoints. Large Language Models have shown to be
capable of automatically creating system integrations (e.g., as service
composition) based on this documentation but require concise input due to input
oken limitations, especially regarding comprehensive API descriptions.
Currently, it is unknown how best to preprocess these API descriptions. In the
present work, we (i) analyze the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation for
endpoint discovery and the chunking, i.e., preprocessing, of state-of-practice
OpenAPIs to reduce the input oken length while preserving the most relevant
information. To further reduce the input token length for the composition
prompt and improve endpoint retrieval, we propose (ii) a Discovery Agent that
only receives a summary of the most relevant endpoints nd retrieves
specification details on demand. We evaluate RAG for endpoint discovery using
(iii) a proposed novel service discovery benchmark SOCBench-D representing a
general setting across numerous domains and the real-world RestBench enchmark,
first, for the different chunking possibilities and parameters measuring the
endpoint retrieval accuracy. Then, we assess the Discovery Agent using the same
test data set. The prototype shows how to successfully employ RAG for endpoint
discovery to reduce the token count. Our experiments show that endpoint-based
approaches outperform naive chunking methods for preprocessing. Relying on an
agent significantly improves precision while being prone to decrease recall,
disclosing the need for further reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.SE

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的代码评估方法CODE-DITING，通过数据蒸馏框架平衡准确性、效率和可解释性，优于现有大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代码评估方法依赖参考解决方案或可执行测试用例，缺乏灵活性和可扩展性。LLM-as-Judge方法虽提供替代方案，但仍存在复杂提示、缺乏可解释性或高计算成本的问题。

Method: 提出CODE-DITING方法，通过数据蒸馏框架将DeepSeek-R1671B的推理能力迁移到更小模型（1.5B和7B），并结合多数投票策略提升性能。

Result: CODE-DITING 1.5B在相同参数规模下表现最佳，7B版本超越GPT-4o和DeepSeek-V3 671B，仅使用其1%参数。

Conclusion: CODE-DITING是一种高效、可解释且稳健的代码评估方法，可作为现有技术的替代方案。

Abstract: Trustworthy evaluation methods for code snippets play a crucial role in
neural code generation. Traditional methods, which either rely on reference
solutions or require executable test cases, have inherent limitation in
flexibility and scalability. The recent LLM-as-Judge methodology offers a
promising alternative by directly evaluating functional consistency between the
problem description and the generated code. To systematically understand the
landscape of these LLM-as-Judge methods, we conduct a comprehensive empirical
study across three diverse datasets. Our investigation reveals the pros and
cons of two categories of LLM-as-Judge methods: the methods based on general
foundation models can achieve good performance but require complex prompts and
lack explainability, while the methods based on reasoning foundation models
provide better explainability with simpler prompts but demand substantial
computational resources due to their large parameter sizes. To address these
limitations, we propose CODE-DITING, a novel code evaluation method that
balances accuracy, efficiency and explainability. We develop a data
distillation framework that effectively transfers reasoning capabilities from
DeepSeek-R1671B to our CODE-DITING 1.5B and 7B models, significantly enhancing
evaluation explainability and reducing the computational cost. With the
majority vote strategy in the inference process, CODE-DITING 1.5B outperforms
all models with the same magnitude of parameters and achieves performance which
would normally exhibit in a model with 5 times of parameter scale. CODE-DITING
7B surpasses GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 671B, even though it only uses 1% of the
parameter volume of these large models. Further experiments show that
CODEDITING is robust to preference leakage and can serve as a promising
alternative for code evaluation.

foundation models (FMs), highlights open challenges, and outlines potential
research directions for advancing SBSE through its interplay with FMs. This
roadmap aims to establish a forward-thinking and innovative perspective for the
future of SBSE in the era of FMs.

Result: 比较了六种LLM的性能，并创建了故障模式目录以支持人工审查。

Conclusion: 讨论了LLM在代码生成中的局限性和能力，以及评估流程在现有过程中的应用。

Abstract: Software engineers in various industrial domains are already using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate the process of implementing parts of
software systems. When considering its potential use for ADAS or AD systems in
the automotive context, there is a need to systematically assess this new
setup: LLMs entail a well-documented set of risks for safety-related systems'
development due to their stochastic nature. To reduce the effort for code
reviewers to evaluate LLM-generated code, we propose an evaluation pipeline to
conduct sanity-checks on the generated code. We compare the performance of six
state-of-the-art LLMs (CodeLlama, CodeGemma, DeepSeek-r1, DeepSeek-Coders,
Mistral, and GPT-4) on four safety-related programming tasks. Additionally, we
qualitatively analyse the most frequent faults generated by these LLMs,
creating a failure-mode catalogue to support human reviewers. Finally, the
limitations and capabilities of LLMs in code generation, and the use of the
proposed pipeline in the existing process, are discussed.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码审查中的可靠性和准确性，填补系统性研究的空白。

Method: 测试了两种LLM对492个AI生成代码块和164个HumanEval基准代码块的审查能力，模拟代码审查任务。

Result: GPT4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash在提供问题描述时分别正确分类代码正确性68.50%和63.89%，改进代码成功率分别为67.83%和54.26%。

Conclusion: LLM代码审查有一定帮助，但存在错误风险，建议采用“人类参与的LLM代码审查”流程。

Abstract: Context: Code reviews are crucial for software quality. Recent AI advances
have allowed large language models (LLMs) to review and fix code; now, there
are tools that perform these reviews. However, their reliability and accuracy
have not yet been systematically evaluated. Objective: This study compares
different LLMs' performance in detecting code correctness and suggesting
improvements. Method: We tested GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash on 492 AI generated
code blocks of varying correctness, along with 164 canonical code blocks from
the HumanEval benchmark. To simulate the code review task objectively, we
expected LLMs to assess code correctness and improve the code if needed. We ran
experiments with different configurations and reported on the results. Results:
With problem descriptions, GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash correctly classified code
correctness 68.50% and 63.89% of the time, respectively, and corrected the code
67.83% and 54.26% of the time for the 492 code blocks of varying correctness.
Without problem descriptions, performance declined. The results for the 164
canonical code blocks differed, suggesting that performance depends on the type
of code. Conclusion: LLM code reviews can help suggest improvements and assess
correctness, but there is a risk of faulty outputs. We propose a process that
involves humans, called the "Human in the loop LLM Code Review" to promote
knowledge sharing while mitigating the risk of faulty outputs.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM Agents）的宏观经济预期模拟框架，通过构建数千个具有个性化特征的LLM Agents，复现了关于通胀和失业率的调查实验。结果表明，LLM Agents生成的预期虽比人类更同质化，但仍能有效捕捉异质性及其驱动因素。

Motivation: 传统调查方法在捕捉宏观经济预期形成时存在局限性，而LLM Agents能够提供一种新的补充手段，以探索AI行为科学在宏观经济研究中的应用。

Method: 构建数千个LLM Agents，赋予其个性化特征、先验预期和知识模块，模拟家庭和专家对通胀和失业率的预期形成过程。

Result: LLM Agents的预期比人类更同质化，但能有效捕捉异质性及其驱动因素；先验预期模块对模拟异质性起关键作用。

Conclusion: LLM Agents框架为宏观经济预期研究提供了新工具，补充了传统调查方法，并展示了AI行为科学的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for simulating macroeconomic expectation
formation using Large Language Model-Empowered Agents (LLM Agents). By
constructing thousands of LLM Agents equipped with modules for personal
characteristics, prior expectations, and knowledge, we replicate a survey
experiment involving households and experts on inflation and unemployment. Our
results show that although the expectations and thoughts generated by LLM
Agents are more homogeneous than those of human participants, they still
effectively capture key heterogeneity across agents and the underlying drivers
of expectation formation. Furthermore, a module-ablation exercise highlights
the critical role of prior expectations in simulating such heterogeneity. This
approach complements traditional survey methods and offers new insights into AI
behavioral science in macroeconomic research.

### [1026] [An AI Capability Threshold for Rent-Funded Universal Basic Income in an AI-Automated Economy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18687)
*Aran Nayebi*

Main category: econ.GN

TLDR: AI资本利润可持续资助全民基本收入（UBI）的封闭条件首次被推导出，无需额外税收或新工作创造。在特定经济参数下，AI生产力需达到现有自动化水平的5-6倍即可资助占GDP 11%的UBI。政策杠杆如提高公共收入份额或调整市场竞争结构可显著影响这一阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI资本利润如何在不依赖额外税收或新工作创造的情况下，可持续资助全民基本收入（UBI），以探索AI技术对社会福利的潜在贡献。

Method: 在Solow-Zeira经济模型中，分析AI生产力阈值与UBI资助的关系，考虑不同经济参数（如公共收入份额、市场竞争结构）的影响。

Result: AI生产力需达到现有自动化水平的5-6倍才能资助UBI；提高公共收入份额至33%可将阈值降至3倍，但超过50%后收益递减；市场竞争结构显著影响阈值。

Conclusion: 政策建议包括优化公共收入份额和管理市场竞争，以确保AI技术进步转化为实际社会福利。

Abstract: We derive the first closed-form condition under which artificial intelligence
(AI) capital profits could sustainably finance a universal basic income (UBI)
without additional taxes or new job creation. In a Solow-Zeira economy
characterized by a continuum of automatable tasks, a constant net saving rate
$s$, and task-elasticity $\sigma < 1$, we analyze how the AI capability
threshold--defined as the productivity level of AI relative to pre-AI
automation--varies under different economic scenarios. At present economic
parameters, we find that AI systems must achieve only approximately 5-6 times
existing automation productivity to finance an 11\%-of-GDP UBI, in the worst
case situation where \emph{no} new jobs or tasks are created.
  Our analysis also reveals some specific policy levers: raising public revenue
share (e.g. profit taxation) of AI capital from the current 15\% to about 33\%
halves the required AI capability threshold to attain UBI to 3 times existing
automotion productivity, but gains diminish beyond 50\% public revenue share,
especially if regulatory costs increase. Market structure also strongly affects
outcomes: monopolistic or concentrated oligopolistic markets reduce the
threshold by increasing economic rents, whereas heightened competition
significantly raises it.
  Overall, these results suggest a couple policy recommendations: maximizing
public revenue share up to a point so that operating costs are minimized, and
strategically managing market competition can ensure AI's growing capabilities
translate into meaningful social benefits within realistic technological
progress scenarios.

TLDR: FlashMD是一种通过机器学习预测原子位置和动量演化的方法，显著延长了分子动力学模拟的时间步长，同时保持了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分子动力学（MD）受限于微小时间步长，难以模拟长时间尺度的微观过程。FlashMD旨在通过机器学习突破这一限制。

Method: 结合哈密顿动力学的数学和物理特性设计架构，支持任何热力学系综的模拟，并评估长步长MD的潜在失败模式。

Result: 验证了FlashMD在平衡和时变性质上的准确性，适用于特定系统和通用模型，扩展了MD模拟的时间尺度。

Conclusion: FlashMD成功延长了MD模拟的时间步长，为研究长时间尺度的微观过程提供了新工具。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) provides insights into atomic-scale processes by
integrating over time the equations that describe the motion of atoms under the
action of interatomic forces. Machine learning models have substantially
accelerated MD by providing inexpensive predictions of the forces, but they
remain constrained to minuscule time integration steps, which are required by
the fast time scale of atomic motion. In this work, we propose FlashMD, a
method to predict the evolution of positions and momenta over strides that are
between one and two orders of magnitude longer than typical MD time steps. We
incorporate considerations on the mathematical and physical properties of
Hamiltonian dynamics in the architecture, generalize the approach to allow the
simulation of any thermodynamic ensemble, and carefully assess the possible
failure modes of such a long-stride MD approach. We validate FlashMD's accuracy
in reproducing equilibrium and time-dependent properties, using both
system-specific and general-purpose models, extending the ability of MD
simulation to reach the long time scales needed to model microscopic processes
of high scientific and technological relevance.

Result: 算法在固定句子时，延迟复杂度为域大小的二次方（对数因子内），接近最优。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在模型枚举问题上表现高效，复杂度接近理论下限。

Abstract: We study the model enumeration problem of the function-free, finite domain
fragment of first-order logic with two variables ($FO^2$). Specifically, given
an $FO^2$ sentence $\Gamma$ and a positive integer $n$, how can one enumerate
all the models of $\Gamma$ over a domain of size $n$? In this paper, we devise
a novel algorithm to address this problem. The delay complexity, the time
required between producing two consecutive models, of our algorithm is
quadratic in the given domain size $n$ (up to logarithmic factors) when the
sentence is fixed. This complexity is almost optimal since the interpretation
of binary predicates in any model requires at least $\Omega(n^2)$ bits to
represent.

Motivation: 为人工神经网络的输出提供解释在关键系统、数据保护法律和对抗样本处理中至关重要，但现有逻辑方法面临可扩展性问题。

Method: 比较两种编码方法：一种为文献中常用，另一种为适应解释性需求而优化，后者变量和约束更少。

Result: 实验显示两种方法在计算解释时运行时间相近，但优化编码在构建逻辑约束和整体时间上分别提升18%和16%。

Conclusion: 优化编码在效率和性能上优于传统方法，适合逻辑解释性需求。

Abstract: Providing explanations for the outputs of artificial neural networks (ANNs)
is crucial in many contexts, such as critical systems, data protection laws and
handling adversarial examples. Logic-based methods can offer explanations with
correctness guarantees, but face scalability challenges. Due to these issues,
it is necessary to compare different encodings of ANNs into logical
constraints, which are used in logic-based explainability. This work compares
two encodings of ANNs: one has been used in the literature to provide
explanations, while the other will be adapted for our context of
explainability. Additionally, the second encoding uses fewer variables and
constraints, thus, potentially enhancing efficiency. Experiments showed similar
running times for computing explanations, but the adapted encoding performed up
to 18\% better in building logical constraints and up to 16\% better in overall
time.

Result: KRR预测误差在5 dBA内，HR和GPR误差稍高，但均能有效捕捉噪声趋势。

Conclusion: 该方法为发电机组设计中的早期噪声预测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of machine learning regression
algorithms Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Huber Regressor (HR), and Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR) for predicting sound power levels of gensets, offering
significant value for marketing and sales teams during the early bidding
process. When engine sizes and genset enclosure dimensions are tentative, and
measured noise data is unavailable, these algorithms enable reliable noise
level estimation for unbuilt gensets. The study utilizes high fidelity datasets
from over 100 experiments conducted at Cummins Acoustics Technology Center
(ATC) in a hemi-anechoic chamber, adhering to ISO 3744 standards. By using
readily available information from the bidding and initial design stages, KRR
predicts sound power with an average accuracy of within 5 dBA. While HR and GPR
show slightly higher prediction errors, all models effectively capture the
overall noise trends across various genset configurations. These findings
present a promising method for early-stage noise estimation in genset design.

Result: STOPA提供了更广泛的生成因素控制和丰富的元数据，显著提高了源追踪的可靠性。

Conclusion: STOPA为深度伪造语音的源追踪、检测和生成模型透明度提供了重要支持。

Abstract: A key research area in deepfake speech detection is source tracing -
determining the origin of synthesised utterances. The approaches may involve
identifying the acoustic model (AM), vocoder model (VM), or other
generation-specific parameters. However, progress is limited by the lack of a
dedicated, systematically curated dataset. To address this, we introduce STOPA,
a systematically varied and metadata-rich dataset for deepfake speech source
tracing, covering 8 AMs, 6 VMs, and diverse parameter settings across 700k
samples from 13 distinct synthesisers. Unlike existing datasets, which often
feature limited variation or sparse metadata, STOPA provides a systematically
controlled framework covering a broader range of generative factors, such as
the choice of the vocoder model, acoustic model, or pretrained weights,
ensuring higher attribution reliability. This control improves attribution
accuracy, aiding forensic analysis, deepfake detection, and generative model
transparency.

Abstract: We present a framework to foster the evaluation of deep learning-based audio
watermarking algorithms, establishing a standardized benchmark and allowing
systematic comparisons. To simulate real-world usage, we introduce a
comprehensive audio attack pipeline, featuring various distortions such as
compression, background noise, and reverberation, and propose a diverse test
dataset, including speech, environmental sounds, and music recordings. By
assessing the performance of four existing watermarking algorithms on our
framework, two main insights stand out: (i) neural compression techniques pose
the most significant challenge, even when algorithms are trained with such
compressions; and (ii) training with audio attacks generally improves
robustness, although it is insufficient in some cases. Furthermore, we find
that specific distortions, such as polarity inversion, time stretching, or
reverb, seriously affect certain algorithms. Our contributions strengthen the
robustness and perceptual assessment of audio watermarking algorithms across a
wide range of applications, while ensuring a fair and consistent evaluation
approach. The evaluation framework, including the attack pipeline, is

Abstract: Deep learning voice models are commonly used nowadays, but the safety
processing of personal data, such as human identity and speech content, remains
suspicious. To prevent malicious user identification, speaker anonymization
methods were proposed. Current methods, particularly based on universal
adversarial patch (UAP) applications, have drawbacks such as significant
degradation of audio quality, decreased speech recognition quality, low
transferability across different voice biometrics models, and performance
dependence on the input audio length. To mitigate these drawbacks, in this
work, we introduce and leverage the novel Exponential Total Variance (TV) loss
function and provide experimental evidence that it positively affects UAP
strength and imperceptibility. Moreover, we present a novel scalable UAP
insertion procedure and demonstrate its uniformly high performance for various

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) in naturalistic settings remains a challenge
due to the intrinsic variability, diverse recording conditions, and class
imbalance. As participants in the Interspeech Naturalistic SER Challenge which
focused on these complexities, we present Abhinaya, a system integrating
speech-based, text-based, and speech-text models. Our approach fine-tunes
self-supervised and speech large language models (SLLM) for speech
representations, leverages large language models (LLM) for textual context, and
employs speech-text modeling with an SLLM to capture nuanced emotional cues. To
combat class imbalance, we apply tailored loss functions and generate
categorical decisions through majority voting. Despite one model not being
fully trained, the Abhinaya system ranked 4th among 166 submissions. Upon
completion of training, it achieved state-of-the-art performance among
published results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for SER in

Abstract: Most existing Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech(ZS-TTS) systems generate the unseen
speech based on single prompt, such as reference speech or text descriptions,
which limits their flexibility. We propose a customized emotion ZS-TTS system
based on multi-modal prompt. The system disentangles speech into the content,
timbre, emotion and prosody, allowing emotion prompts to be provided as text,
image or speech. To extract emotion information from different prompts, we
propose a multi-modal prompt emotion encoder. Additionally, we introduce an
prosody predictor to fit the distribution of prosody and propose an emotion
consistency loss to preserve emotion information in the predicted prosody. A
diffusion-based acoustic model is employed to generate the target
mel-spectrogram. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our
system outperforms existing systems in terms of naturalness and similarity. The
samples are available at https://mpetts-demo.github.io/mpetts_demo/.

TLDR: 论文探讨了如何提升大型音频语言模型（LALMs）的可靠性，提出了训练无关和训练相关的方法，并引入新评估指标RGI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LALMs缺乏识别知识边界和主动拒绝回答未知问题的能力，可靠性研究不足。

Method: 研究了多模态思维链（MCoT）等训练无关方法，以及监督微调（SFT）等训练相关方法。

Result: 两种方法均能不同程度提升LALMs可靠性，且可靠性意识可跨音频模态迁移。

Conclusion: 可靠性是LALMs的‘元能力’，需进一步探索跨模态迁移潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large audio language models (LALMs) have demonstrated
impressive results and promising prospects in universal understanding and
reasoning across speech, music, and general sound. However, these models still
lack the ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries and refuse to answer
questions they don't know proactively. While there have been successful
attempts to enhance the reliability of LLMs, reliable LALMs remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate various approaches
towards reliable LALMs, including training-free methods such as multi-modal
chain-of-thought (MCoT), and training-based methods such as supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Besides, we identify the limitations of previous evaluation
metrics and propose a new metric, the Reliability Gain Index (RGI), to assess
the effectiveness of different reliable methods. Our findings suggest that both
training-free and training-based methods enhance the reliability of LALMs to
different extents. Moreover, we find that awareness of reliability is a "meta
ability", which can be transferred across different audio modalities, although
significant structural and content differences exist among sound, music, and
speech.

Abstract: Generating high-quality piano audio from video requires precise
synchronization between visual cues and musical output, ensuring accurate
semantic and temporal alignment.However, existing evaluation datasets do not
fully capture the intricate synchronization required for piano music
generation. A comprehensive benchmark is essential for two primary reasons: (1)
existing metrics fail to reflect the complexity of video-to-piano music
interactions, and (2) a dedicated benchmark dataset can provide valuable
insights to accelerate progress in high-quality piano music generation. To
address these challenges, we introduce the CoP Benchmark Dataset-a fully
open-sourced, multimodal benchmark designed specifically for video-guided piano
music generation. The proposed Chain-of-Perform (CoP) benchmark offers several
compelling features: (1) detailed multimodal annotations, enabling precise
semantic and temporal alignment between video content and piano audio via
step-by-step Chain-of-Perform guidance; (2) a versatile evaluation framework
for rigorous assessment of both general-purpose and specialized video-to-piano
generation tasks; and (3) full open-sourcing of the dataset, annotations, and
evaluation protocols. The dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/acappemin/Video-to-Audio-and-Piano, with a continuously
updated leaderboard to promote ongoing research in this domain.

Motivation: 神经网络通过统计学习隐式地掌握了音乐结构，这为研究人类生成媒体的理论提供了新视角。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）从Transformer模型的残差流激活中提取可解释的音乐概念，并开发了自动标注和评估流程。

Result: 研究发现了熟悉的音乐概念和反直觉的模式，这些模式在现有理论或自然语言中缺乏对应。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了模型的透明度，还为发现传统分析方法难以捕捉的组织原则提供了新工具。

Abstract: The fidelity with which neural networks can now generate content such as
music presents a scientific opportunity: these systems appear to have learned
implicit theories of the structure of such content through statistical learning
alone. This could offer a novel lens on theories of human-generated media.
Where these representations align with traditional constructs (e.g. chord
progressions in music), they demonstrate how these can be inferred from
statistical regularities. Where they diverge, they highlight potential limits
in our theoretical frameworks -- patterns that we may have overlooked but that
nonetheless hold significant explanatory power. In this paper, we focus on the
specific case of music generators. We introduce a method to discover musical
concepts using sparse autoencoders (SAEs), extracting interpretable features
from the residual stream activations of a transformer model. We evaluate this
approach by extracting a large set of features and producing an automatic
labeling and evaluation pipeline for them. Our results reveal both familiar
musical concepts and counterintuitive patterns that lack clear counterparts in
existing theories or natural language altogether. Beyond improving model
transparency, our work provides a new empirical tool that might help discover
organizing principles in ways that have eluded traditional methods of analysis
and synthesis.

Motivation: TTS语音克隆技术引发隐私问题，需要一种保护机制防止未经授权的语音复制。

Method: 通过多目标优化生成对抗性扰动，使用MGDA算法确保鲁棒性，并通过Mel-spectrogram分解保持听觉自然性。

Result: 实验表明，CloneShield在保护音频质量的同时显著降低克隆样本的质量和说话人相似性。

Conclusion: CloneShield是一种有效的零样本语音克隆防御方法，兼顾保护效果和用户体验。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-speech (TTS) voice cloning have raised
serious privacy concerns, allowing highly accurate vocal identity replication
from just a few seconds of reference audio, while retaining the speaker's vocal
authenticity. In this paper, we introduce CloneShield, a universal time-domain
adversarial perturbation framework specifically designed to defend against
zero-shot voice cloning. Our method provides protection that is robust across
speakers and utterances, without requiring any prior knowledge of the
synthesized text. We formulate perturbation generation as a multi-objective
optimization problem, and propose Multi-Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to
ensure the robust protection across diverse utterances. To preserve natural
auditory perception for users, we decompose the adversarial perturbation via
Mel-spectrogram representations and fine-tune it for each sample. This design
ensures imperceptibility while maintaining strong degradation effects on
zero-shot cloned outputs. Experiments on three state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS
systems, five benchmark datasets and evaluations from 60 human listeners
demonstrate that our method preserves near-original audio quality in protected
inputs (PESQ = 3.90, SRS = 0.93) while substantially degrading both speaker
similarity and speech quality in cloned samples (PESQ = 1.07, SRS = 0.08).

Abstract: Audio generation systems now create very realistic soundscapes that can
enhance media production, but also pose potential risks. Several studies have
examined deepfakes in speech or singing voice. However, environmental sounds
have different characteristics, which may make methods for detecting speech and
singing deepfakes less effective for real-world sounds. In addition, existing
datasets for environmental sound deepfake detection are limited in scale and
audio types. To address this gap, we introduce EnvSDD, the first large-scale
curated dataset designed for this task, consisting of 45.25 hours of real and
316.74 hours of fake audio. The test set includes diverse conditions to
evaluate the generalizability, such as unseen generation models and unseen
datasets. We also propose an audio deepfake detection system, based on a
pre-trained audio foundation model. Results on EnvSDD show that our proposed
system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems from speech and singing
domains.

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了说话者独立性，并在语音转换等任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解耦了语音内容与说话者特征，为内容驱动任务提供了更好的表示。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has reduced the reliance on expensive labeling
in speech technologies by learning meaningful representations from unannotated
data. Since most SSL-based downstream tasks prioritize content information in
speech, ideal representations should disentangle content from unwanted
variations like speaker characteristics in the SSL representations. However,
removing speaker information often degrades other speech components, and
existing methods either fail to fully disentangle speaker identity or require
resource-intensive models. In this paper, we propose a novel disentanglement
method that linearly decomposes SSL representations into speaker-specific and
speaker-independent components, effectively generating speaker disentangled
representations. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach achieves
speaker independence and as such, when applied to content-driven tasks such as
voice conversion, our representations yield significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 音频与视觉线索的结合具有潜力，为未来音频地理定位研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Can we determine someone's geographic location purely from the sounds they
hear? Are acoustic signals enough to localize within a country, state, or even
city? We tackle the challenge of global-scale audio geolocation, formalize the
problem, and conduct an in-depth analysis with wildlife audio from the
iNatSounds dataset. Adopting a vision-inspired approach, we convert audio
recordings to spectrograms and benchmark existing image geolocation techniques.
We hypothesize that species vocalizations offer strong geolocation cues due to
their defined geographic ranges and propose an approach that integrates species
range prediction with retrieval-based geolocation. We further evaluate whether
geolocation improves when analyzing species-rich recordings or when aggregating
across spatiotemporal neighborhoods. Finally, we introduce case studies from
movies to explore multimodal geolocation using both audio and visual content.
Our work highlights the advantages of integrating audio and visual cues, and
sets the stage for future research in audio geolocation.

Abstract: Audio source separation aims to separate a mixture into target sources.
Previous audio source separation systems usually conduct one-step inference,
which does not fully explore the separation ability of models. In this work, we
reveal that pretrained one-step audio source separation models can be leveraged
for multi-step separation without additional training. We propose a simple yet
effective inference method that iteratively applies separation by optimally
blending the input mixture with the previous step's separation result. At each
step, we determine the optimal blending ratio by maximizing a metric. We prove
that our method always yield improvement over one-step inference, provide error
bounds based on model smoothness and metric robustness, and provide theoretical
analysis connecting our method to denoising along linear interpolation paths
between noise and clean distributions, a property we link to denoising
diffusion bridge models. Our approach effectively delivers improved separation
performance as a "free lunch" from existing models. Our empirical results
demonstrate that our multi-step separation approach consistently outperforms
one-step inference across both speech enhancement and music source separation
tasks, and can achieve scaling performance similar to training a larger model,
using more data, or in some cases employing a multi-step training objective.
These improvements appear not only on the optimization metric during multi-step
inference, but also extend to nearly all non-optimized metrics (with one
exception). We also discuss limitations of our approach and directions for
future research.

Result: 在泰米尔语和马来语数据集上，该方法显著优于随机森林、XGBoost和GPT-4o直接预测。

Conclusion: 提出的系统在低资源语言中有效提升了流利度评估的准确性。

Abstract: Assessment of children's speaking fluency in education is well researched for
majority languages, but remains highly challenging for low resource languages.
This paper proposes a system to automatically assess fluency by combining a
fine-tuned multilingual ASR model, an objective metrics extraction stage, and a
generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) network. The objective metrics include
phonetic and word error rates, speech rate, and speech-pause duration ratio.
These are interpreted by a GPT-based classifier guided by a small set of
human-evaluated ground truth examples, to score fluency. We evaluate the
proposed system on a dataset of children's speech in two low-resource
languages, Tamil and Malay and compare the classification performance against
Random Forest and XGBoost, as well as using ChatGPT-4o to predict fluency
directly from speech input. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach
achieves significantly higher accuracy than multimodal GPT or other methods.

Result: 实验证实方法能有效学习与说话人无关的情感嵌入。

Conclusion: DiEmo-TTS在保留情感的同时去除无关因素，提升了跨说话人情感迁移的效果。

Abstract: Cross-speaker emotion transfer in speech synthesis relies on extracting
speaker-independent emotion embeddings for accurate emotion modeling without
retaining speaker traits. However, existing timbre compression methods fail to
fully separate speaker and emotion characteristics, causing speaker leakage and
degraded synthesis quality. To address this, we propose DiEmo-TTS, a
self-supervised distillation method to minimize emotional information loss and
preserve speaker identity. We introduce cluster-driven sampling and information
perturbation to preserve emotion while removing irrelevant factors. To
facilitate this process, we propose an emotion clustering and matching approach
using emotional attribute prediction and speaker embeddings, enabling
generalization to unlabeled data. Additionally, we designed a dual conditioning
transformer to integrate style features better. Experimental results confirm
the effectiveness of our method in learning speaker-irrelevant emotion
embeddings.

Conclusion: EmoSphere-SER通过结构化学习和动态策略提升了情感预测的一致性和性能。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition predicts a speaker's emotional state from speech
signals using discrete labels or continuous dimensions such as arousal,
valence, and dominance (VAD). We propose EmoSphere-SER, a joint model that
integrates spherical VAD region classification to guide VAD regression for
improved emotion prediction. In our framework, VAD values are transformed into
spherical coordinates that are divided into multiple spherical regions, and an
auxiliary classification task predicts which spherical region each point
belongs to, guiding the regression process. Additionally, we incorporate a
dynamic weighting scheme and a style pooling layer with multi-head
self-attention to capture spectral and temporal dynamics, further boosting
performance. This combined training strategy reinforces structured learning and
improves prediction consistency. Experimental results show that our approach
exceeds baseline methods, confirming the validity of the proposed framework.

Result: 整理后的数据集支持自监督学习模型的开发，可用于监测海洋哺乳动物和评估声污染等任务。

Conclusion: 自动化数据整理流程为海洋声学数据的分析和生态监测提供了高效的工具。

Abstract: The sustainability of the ocean ecosystem is threatened by increased levels
of sound pollution, making monitoring crucial to understand its variability and
impact. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems collect a large amount of
underwater sound recordings, but the large volume of data makes manual analysis
impossible, creating the need for automation. Although machine learning offers
a potential solution, most underwater acoustic recordings are unlabeled.
Self-supervised learning models have demonstrated success in learning from
large-scale unlabeled data in various domains like computer vision, Natural
Language Processing, and audio. However, these models require large, diverse,
and balanced datasets for training in order to generalize well. To address
this, a fully automated self-supervised data curation pipeline is proposed to
create a diverse and balanced dataset from raw PAM data. It integrates
Automatic Identification System (AIS) data with recordings from various
hydrophones in the U.S. waters. Using hierarchical k-means clustering, the raw
audio data is sampled and then combined with AIS samples to create a balanced
and diverse dataset. The resulting curated dataset enables the development of
self-supervised learning models, facilitating various tasks such as monitoring
marine mammals and assessing sound pollution.

Conclusion: R-AutoEval+在保证评估可靠性的同时，提升了样本效率，为模型选择提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Selecting artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as large language models
(LLMs), from multiple candidates requires accurate performance estimation. This
is ideally achieved through empirical evaluations involving abundant real-world
data. However, such evaluations are costly and impractical at scale. To address
this challenge, autoevaluation methods leverage synthetic data produced by
automated evaluators, such as LLMs-as-judges, reducing variance but potentially
introducing bias. Recent approaches have employed semi-supervised
prediction-powered inference (\texttt{PPI}) to correct for the bias of
autoevaluators. However, the use of autoevaluators may lead in practice to a
degradation in sample efficiency compared to conventional methods using only
real-world data. In this paper, we propose \texttt{R-AutoEval+}, a novel
framework that provides finite-sample reliability guarantees on the model
evaluation, while also ensuring an enhanced (or at least no worse) sample
efficiency compared to conventional methods. The key innovation of
\texttt{R-AutoEval+} is an adaptive construction of the model evaluation
variable, which dynamically tunes its reliance on synthetic data, reverting to
conventional methods when the autoevaluator is insufficiently accurate.
Experiments on the use of LLMs-as-judges for the optimization of quantization
settings for the weights of an LLM, and for prompt design in LLMs confirm the
reliability and efficiency of \texttt{R-AutoEval+}.

Abstract: Designing algorithms for solving high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems
directly in infinite-dimensional function spaces - where such problems are
naturally formulated - is crucial to ensure stability and convergence as the
discretization of the underlying problem is refined. In this paper, we
contribute to this line of work by analyzing a widely used sampler for linear
inverse problems: Langevin dynamics driven by score-based generative models
(SGMs) acting as priors, formulated directly in function space. Building on the
theoretical framework for SGMs in Hilbert spaces, we give a rigorous definition
of this sampler in the infinite-dimensional setting and derive, for the first
time, error estimates that explicitly depend on the approximation error of the
score. As a consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for global convergence
in Kullback-Leibler divergence on the underlying function space. Preventing
numerical instabilities requires preconditioning of the Langevin algorithm and
we prove the existence and the form of an optimal preconditioner. The
preconditioner depends on both the score error and the forward operator and
guarantees a uniform convergence rate across all posterior modes. Our analysis
applies to both Gaussian and a general class of non-Gaussian priors. Finally,
we present examples that illustrate and validate our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实验上均优于现有技术，为含时薛定谔方程的演化算子学习提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the evolution operator for the
time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation, where the Hamiltonian may vary with
time. Existing neural network-based surrogates often ignore fundamental
properties of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, such as linearity and unitarity,
and lack theoretical guarantees on prediction error or time generalization. To
address this, we introduce a linear estimator for the evolution operator that
preserves a weak form of unitarity. We establish both upper and lower bounds on
the prediction error that hold uniformly over all sufficiently smooth initial
wave functions. Additionally, we derive time generalization bounds that
quantify how the estimator extrapolates beyond the time points seen during
training. Experiments across real-world Hamiltonians -- including hydrogen
atoms, ion traps for qubit design, and optical lattices -- show that our
estimator achieves relative errors $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}$ times smaller than
state-of-the-art methods such as the Fourier Neural Operator and DeepONet.

Abstract: Constrained stochastic nonlinear optimization problems have attracted
significant attention for their ability to model complex real-world scenarios
in physics, economics, and biology. As datasets continue to grow, online
inference methods have become crucial for enabling real-time decision-making
without the need to store historical data. In this work, we develop an online
inference procedure for constrained stochastic optimization by leveraging a
method called Sketched Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (SSQP). As a
direct generalization of sketched Newton methods, SSQP approximates the
objective with a quadratic model and the constraints with a linear model at
each step, then applies a sketching solver to inexactly solve the resulting
subproblem. Building on this design, we propose a new online inference
procedure called random scaling. In particular, we construct a test statistic
based on SSQP iterates whose limiting distribution is free of any unknown
parameters. Compared to existing online inference procedures, our approach
offers two key advantages: (i) it enables the construction of asymptotically
valid confidence intervals; and (ii) it is matrix-free, i.e. the computation
involves only primal-dual SSQP iterates $(\boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{\lambda}_t)$ without requiring any matrix inversions. We validate
our theory through numerical experiments on nonlinearly constrained regression
problems and demonstrate the superior performance of our random scaling method
over existing inference procedures.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization, where a student model trained on imperfect
labels generated by a weaker teacher nonetheless surpasses that teacher, has
been widely observed but the mechanisms that enable it have remained poorly
understood. In this paper, through a theoretical analysis of simple models, we
uncover three core mechanisms that can drive this phenomenon. First, by
analyzing ridge regression, we study the interplay between the teacher and
student regularization and prove that a student can compensate for a teacher's
under-regularization and achieve lower test error. We also analyze the role of
the parameterization regime of the models. Second, by analyzing weighted ridge
regression, we show that a student model with a regularization structure more
aligned to the target, can outperform its teacher. Third, in a nonlinear
multi-index setting, we demonstrate that a student can learn easy,
task-specific features from the teacher while leveraging its own broader
pre-training to learn hard-to-learn features that the teacher cannot capture.

Result: 仿真研究表明，满足新条件的隐结构可以从数据中准确估计。

Conclusion: 新方法显著放宽了现有识别条件，为复杂数据中的因果图模型识别提供了更灵活的工具。

Abstract: This paper considers a challenging problem of identifying a causal graphical
model under the presence of latent variables. While various identifiability
conditions have been proposed in the literature, they often require multiple
pure children per latent variable or restrictions on the latent causal graph.
Furthermore, it is common for all observed variables to exhibit the same
modality. Consequently, the existing identifiability conditions are often too
stringent for complex real-world data. We consider a general nonparametric
measurement model with arbitrary observed variable types and binary latent
variables, and propose a double triangular graphical condition that guarantees
identifiability of the entire causal graphical model. The proposed condition
significantly relaxes the popular pure children condition. We also establish
necessary conditions for identifiability and provide valuable insights into
fundamental limits of identifiability. Simulation studies verify that latent
structures satisfying our conditions can be accurately estimated from data.

Motivation: 研究分布式环境下无监督学习算法的性能，特别是针对高斯混合模型的K-means算法，填补了本地迭代在无监督学习中的理论空白。

Method: 提出LocalKMeans算法，在分布式机器上并行运行Lloyd算法的本地迭代，每L次同步一次。采用虚拟迭代方法处理非凸、非光滑目标函数，并结合Lloyd步骤的严格统计分析。

Result: 本地迭代的代价是需要更高的信噪比，但算法在分布式环境下仍能有效运行。

Conclusion: LocalKMeans算法为分布式无监督学习提供了理论支持，但需权衡本地迭代步长与信噪比要求。

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the classical $K$-means alternating-minimization
algorithm, also known as Lloyd's algorithm (Lloyd, 1956), for a mixture of
Gaussians in a data-distributed setting that incorporates local iteration
steps. Assuming unlabeled data distributed across multiple machines, we propose
an algorithm, LocalKMeans, that performs Lloyd's algorithm in parallel in the
machines by running its iterations on local data, synchronizing only every $L$
of such local steps. We characterize the cost of these local iterations against
the non-distributed setting, and show that the price paid for the local steps
is a higher required signal-to-noise ratio. While local iterations were
theoretically studied in the past for gradient-based learning methods, the
analysis of unsupervised learning methods is more involved owing to the
presence of latent variables, e.g. cluster identities, than that of an
iterative gradient-based algorithm. To obtain our results, we adapt a virtual
iterate method to work with a non-convex, non-smooth objective function, in
conjunction with a tight statistical analysis of Lloyd steps.

Result: 在满足区分性条件时，门控和提示参数达到极小极大最优估计速率；否则，估计速率显著下降。

Conclusion: 区分性条件是影响参数估计效率的关键因素，实验结果验证了理论发现。

Abstract: The softmax-contaminated mixture of experts (MoE) model is deployed when a
large-scale pre-trained model, which plays the role of a fixed expert, is
fine-tuned for learning downstream tasks by including a new contamination part,
or prompt, functioning as a new, trainable expert. Despite its popularity and
relevance, the theoretical properties of the softmax-contaminated MoE have
remained unexplored in the literature. In the paper, we study the convergence
rates of the maximum likelihood estimator of gating and prompt parameters in
order to gain insights into the statistical properties and potential challenges
of fine-tuning with a new prompt. We find that the estimability of these
parameters is compromised when the prompt acquires overlapping knowledge with
the pre-trained model, in the sense that we make precise by formulating a novel
analytic notion of distinguishability. Under distinguishability of the
pre-trained and prompt models, we derive minimax optimal estimation rates for
all the gating and prompt parameters. By contrast, when the distinguishability
condition is violated, these estimation rates become significantly slower due
to their dependence on the prompt convergence rate to the pre-trained model.
Finally, we empirically corroborate our theoretical findings through several
numerical experiments.

Abstract: Performativity of predictions refers to the phenomena that
prediction-informed decisions may influence the target they aim to predict,
which is widely observed in policy-making in social sciences and economics. In
this paper, we initiate the study of statistical inference under
performativity. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we build a central limit
theorem for estimation and inference under performativity, which enables
inferential purposes in policy-making such as constructing confidence intervals
or testing hypotheses. Second, we further leverage the derived central limit
theorem to investigate prediction-powered inference (PPI) under performativity,
which is based on a small labeled dataset and a much larger dataset of
machine-learning predictions. This enables us to obtain more precise estimation
and improved confidence regions for the model parameter (i.e., policy) of
interest in performative prediction. We demonstrate the power of our framework
by numerical experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first
one to establish statistical inference under performativity, which brings up
new challenges and inference settings that we believe will add significant
values to policy-making, statistics, and machine learning.

Abstract: Kernels are key to encoding prior beliefs and data structures in Gaussian
process (GP) models. The design of expressive and scalable kernels has garnered
significant research attention. Deep kernel learning enhances kernel
flexibility by feeding inputs through a neural network before applying a
standard parametric form. However, this approach remains limited by the choice
of base kernels, inherits high inference costs, and often demands sparse
approximations. Drawing on Mercer's theorem, we introduce a fully data-driven,
scalable deep kernel representation where a neural network directly represents
a low-rank kernel through a small set of basis functions. This construction
enables highly efficient exact GP inference in linear time and memory without
invoking inducing points. It also supports scalable mini-batch training based
on a principled variational inference framework. We further propose a simple
variance correction procedure to guard against overconfidence in uncertainty
estimates. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the
advantages of our deep kernel GP in terms of predictive accuracy, uncertainty
quantification, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 提出的算法在非平稳Lipschitz多臂老虎机问题中实现了最优性能，为相关研究提供了理论保障。

Abstract: We study the problem of non-stationary Lipschitz bandits, where the number of
actions is infinite and the reward function, satisfying a Lipschitz assumption,
can change arbitrarily over time. We design an algorithm that adaptively tracks
the recently introduced notion of significant shifts, defined by large
deviations of the cumulative reward function. To detect such reward changes,
our algorithm leverages a hierarchical discretization of the action space.
Without requiring any prior knowledge of the non-stationarity, our algorithm
achieves a minimax-optimal dynamic regret bound of
$\mathcal{\widetilde{O}}(\tilde{L}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, where $\tilde{L}$ is the
number of significant shifts and $T$ the horizon. This result provides the
first optimal guarantee in this setting.

Result: 通过数值研究和汽车保险数据集的实证分析，验证了该框架的实用性。

Conclusion: 边际公平性框架为在风险敏感和监管约束下实现公平决策提供了有效方法，并能捕捉协变量间的依赖关系对受保护属性影响的传播。

Abstract: This paper introduces marginal fairness, a new individual fairness notion for
equitable decision-making in the presence of protected attributes such as
gender, race, and religion. This criterion ensures that decisions based on
generalized distortion risk measures are insensitive to distributional
perturbations in protected attributes, regardless of whether these attributes
are continuous, discrete, categorical, univariate, or multivariate. To
operationalize this notion and reflect real-world regulatory environments (such
as the EU gender-neutral pricing regulation), we model business decision-making
in highly regulated industries (such as insurance and finance) as a two-step
process: (i) a predictive modeling stage, in which a prediction function for
the target variable (e.g., insurance losses) is estimated based on both
protected and non-protected covariates; and (ii) a decision-making stage, in
which a generalized distortion risk measure is applied to the target variable,
conditional only on non-protected covariates, to determine the decision. In
this second step, we modify the risk measure such that the decision becomes
insensitive to the protected attribute, thus enforcing fairness to ensure
equitable outcomes under risk-sensitive, regulatory constraints. Furthermore,
by utilizing the concept of cascade sensitivity, we extend the marginal
fairness framework to capture how dependencies between covariates propagate the
influence of protected attributes through the modeling pipeline. A numerical
study and an empirical implementation using an auto insurance dataset
demonstrate how the framework can be applied in practice.

Conclusion: 标签噪声会导致模型泛化能力下降，早期停止和样本选择是应对标签噪声的有效方法。

Abstract: Deep learning with noisy labels presents significant challenges. In this
work, we theoretically characterize the role of label noise from a feature
learning perspective. Specifically, we consider a signal-noise data
distribution, where each sample comprises a label-dependent signal and
label-independent noise, and rigorously analyze the training dynamics of a
two-layer convolutional neural network under this data setup, along with the
presence of label noise. Our analysis identifies two key stages. In Stage I,
the model perfectly fits all the clean samples (i.e., samples without label
noise) while ignoring the noisy ones (i.e., samples with noisy labels). During
this stage, the model learns the signal from the clean samples, which
generalizes well on unseen data. In Stage II, as the training loss converges,
the gradient in the direction of noise surpasses that of the signal, leading to
overfitting on noisy samples. Eventually, the model memorizes the noise present
in the noisy samples and degrades its generalization ability. Furthermore, our
analysis provides a theoretical basis for two widely used techniques for
tackling label noise: early stopping and sample selection. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world setups validate our theory.

Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data
dimensionality reduction. Various methods have been proposed to extend PCA to
the union of subspace (UoS) setting for clustering data that come from multiple
subspaces like K-Subspaces (KSS). However, some applications involve
heterogeneous data that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated
with each data sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data
quality. This paper develops a heteroscedastic-focused subspace clustering
method, named ALPCAHUS, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and
use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace bases associated
with the low-rank structure of the data. This clustering algorithm builds on
K-Subspaces (KSS) principles by extending the recently proposed heteroscedastic
PCA method, named LR-ALPCAH, for clusters with heteroscedastic noise in the UoS
setting. Simulations and real-data experiments show the effectiveness of
accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing clustering
algorithms. Code available at https://github.com/javiersc1/ALPCAHUS.

Result: BPS在二阶预测有效时提供最小预测集，否则通过共形风险控制保证边际覆盖。

Conclusion: BPS为二阶预测器在CP中的应用提供了灵活且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular frequentist framework for representing
uncertainty by providing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the true
label with a user-adjustable probability. In most applications, CP operates on
confidence scores coming from a standard (first-order) probabilistic predictor
(e.g., softmax outputs). Second-order predictors, such as credal set predictors
or Bayesian models, are also widely used for uncertainty quantification and are
known for their ability to represent both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
Despite their popularity, there is still an open question on ``how they can be
incorporated into CP''. In this paper, we discuss the desiderata for CP when
valid second-order predictions are available. We then introduce Bernoulli
prediction sets (BPS), which produce the smallest prediction sets that ensure
conditional coverage in this setting. When given first-order predictions, BPS
reduces to the well-known adaptive prediction sets (APS). Furthermore, when the
validity assumption on the second-order predictions is compromised, we apply
conformal risk control to obtain a marginal coverage guarantee while still
accounting for epistemic uncertainty.

Abstract: The widespread use of generative models has created a feedback loop, in which
each generation of models is trained on data partially produced by its
predecessors. This process has raised concerns about \emph{model collapse}: A
critical degradation in performance caused by repeated training on synthetic
data. However, different analyses in the literature have reached different
conclusions as to the severity of model collapse. As such, it remains unclear
how concerning this phenomenon is, and under which assumptions it can be
avoided. To address this, we theoretically study model collapse for maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE), in a natural setting where synthetic data is
gradually added to the original data set. Under standard assumptions (similar
to those long used for proving asymptotic consistency and normality of MLE), we
establish non-asymptotic bounds showing that collapse can be avoided even as
the fraction of real data vanishes. On the other hand, we prove that some
assumptions (beyond MLE consistency) are indeed necessary: Without them, model
collapse can occur arbitrarily quickly, even when the original data is still
present in the training set. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first
rigorous examples of iterative generative modeling with accumulating data that
rapidly leads to model collapse.

Abstract: In this paper we derive non-asymptotic Berry-Esseen bounds for Polyak-Ruppert
averaged iterates of the Linear Stochastic Approximation (LSA) algorithm driven
by the Markovian noise. Our analysis yields $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/4})$ convergence
rates to the Gaussian limit in the Kolmogorov distance. We further establish
the non-asymptotic validity of a multiplier block bootstrap procedure for
constructing the confidence intervals, guaranteeing consistent inference under
Markovian sampling. Our work provides the first non-asymptotic guarantees on
the rate of convergence of bootstrap-based confidence intervals for stochastic
approximation with Markov noise. Moreover, we recover the classical rate of
order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/8})$ up to logarithmic factors for estimating the
asymptotic variance of the iterates of the LSA algorithm.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in scientific machine learning is
increasingly critical as neural networks are widely adopted to tackle complex
problems across diverse scientific disciplines. For physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), a prominent model in scientific machine learning, uncertainty
is typically quantified using Bayesian or dropout methods. However, both
approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: the prior distribution or
dropout rate required to construct honest confidence sets cannot be determined
without additional information. In this paper, we propose a novel method within
the framework of extended fiducial inference (EFI) to provide rigorous
uncertainty quantification for PINNs. The proposed method leverages a
narrow-neck hyper-network to learn the parameters of the PINN and quantify
their uncertainty based on imputed random errors in the observations. This
approach overcomes the limitations of Bayesian and dropout methods, enabling
the construction of honest confidence sets based solely on observed data. This
advancement represents a significant breakthrough for PINNs, greatly enhancing
their reliability, interpretability, and applicability to real-world scientific
and engineering challenges. Moreover, it establishes a new theoretical
framework for EFI, extending its application to large-scale models, eliminating
the need for sparse hyper-networks, and significantly improving the
automaticity and robustness of statistical inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI offer promising solutions for synthetic data
generation but often rely on large datasets for effective training. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generative model that learns from limited
data by incorporating physical constraints to enhance performance.
Specifically, we extend the VAE architecture by incorporating physical models
in the generative process, enabling it to capture underlying dynamics more
effectively. While physical models provide valuable insights, they struggle to
capture complex temporal dependencies present in real-world data. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a discrepancy term to account for unmodeled dynamics,
represented within a latent Gaussian Process VAE (GPVAE). Furthermore, we apply
regularization to ensure the generated data aligns closely with observed data,
enhancing both the diversity and accuracy of the synthetic samples. The
proposed method is applied to indoor temperature data, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that PIGPVAE can
produce realistic samples beyond the observed distribution, highlighting its
robustness and usefulness under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: 本文为扩散模型中的引导调度提供了理论依据和优化方法，推动了条件生成和无条件样本质量的提升。

Abstract: Guidance is a cornerstone of modern diffusion models, playing a pivotal role
in conditional generation and enhancing the quality of unconditional samples.
However, current approaches to guidance scheduling--determining the appropriate
guidance weight--are largely heuristic and lack a solid theoretical foundation.
This work addresses these limitations on two fronts. First, we provide a
theoretical formalization that precisely characterizes the relationship between
guidance strength and classifier confidence. Second, building on this insight,
we introduce a stochastic optimal control framework that casts guidance
scheduling as an adaptive optimization problem. In this formulation, guidance
strength is not fixed but dynamically selected based on time, the current
sample, and the conditioning class, either independently or in combination. By
solving the resulting control problem, we establish a principled foundation for
more effective guidance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Calibration is a critical requirement for reliable probabilistic prediction,
especially in high-risk applications. However, the theoretical understanding of
which learning algorithms can simultaneously achieve high accuracy and good
calibration remains limited, and many existing studies provide empirical
validation or a theoretical guarantee in restrictive settings. To address this
issue, in this work, we focus on the smooth calibration error (CE) and provide
a uniform convergence bound, showing that the smooth CE is bounded by the sum
of the smooth CE over the training dataset and a generalization gap. We further
prove that the functional gradient of the loss function can effectively control
the training smooth CE. Based on this framework, we analyze three
representative algorithms: gradient boosting trees, kernel boosting, and
two-layer neural networks. For each, we derive conditions under which both
classification and calibration performances are simultaneously guaranteed. Our
results offer new theoretical insights and practical guidance for designing
reliable probabilistic models with provable calibration guarantees.

Result: 推导了重建损失的泛化误差界限，仅依赖潜在变量和编码器的复杂度；给出了生成数据与真实数据分布的2-Wasserstein距离上界。

Conclusion: 潜在变量的正则化对数据生成性能有重要贡献，为VQ-VAE的理论分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Latent variables (LVs) play a crucial role in encoder-decoder models by
enabling effective data compression, prediction, and generation. Although their
theoretical properties, such as generalization, have been extensively studied
in supervised learning, similar analyses for unsupervised models such as
variational autoencoders (VAEs) remain insufficiently underexplored. In this
work, we extend information-theoretic generalization analysis to
vector-quantized (VQ) VAEs with discrete latent spaces, introducing a novel
data-dependent prior to rigorously analyze the relationship among LVs,
generalization, and data generation. We derive a novel generalization error
bound of the reconstruction loss of VQ-VAEs, which depends solely on the
complexity of LVs and the encoder, independent of the decoder. Additionally, we
provide the upper bound of the 2-Wasserstein distance between the distributions
of the true data and the generated data, explaining how the regularization of
the LVs contributes to the data generation performance.

TLDR: Nash-MP是一种在线NLHF算法，利用Mirror Prox优化方案快速稳定地收敛到Nash均衡，理论分析显示其具有线性收敛性，并在实验中表现出竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF依赖奖励模型，假设偏好结构（如Bradley-Terry模型）可能无法准确捕捉真实人类偏好的复杂性（如不可传递性）。

Method: 提出Nash-MP算法，基于Mirror Prox优化，理论证明其KL散度以$(1+2\beta)^{-N/2}$速率收敛，并分析了近似版本和实际应用策略。

Result: Nash-MP在理论和实验中均表现出快速收敛性和兼容性，适用于大规模语言模型微调。

Conclusion: Nash-MP为NLHF提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案，适用于复杂偏好场景。

Abstract: Traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often relies on
reward models, frequently assuming preference structures like the Bradley-Terry
model, which may not accurately capture the complexities of real human
preferences (e.g., intransitivity). Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF)
offers a more direct alternative by framing the problem as finding a Nash
equilibrium of a game defined by these preferences. In this work, we introduce
Nash Mirror Prox ($\mathtt{Nash-MP}$), an online NLHF algorithm that leverages
the Mirror Prox optimization scheme to achieve fast and stable convergence to
the Nash equilibrium. Our theoretical analysis establishes that Nash-MP
exhibits last-iterate linear convergence towards the $\beta$-regularized Nash
equilibrium. Specifically, we prove that the KL-divergence to the optimal
policy decreases at a rate of order $(1+2\beta)^{-N/2}$, where $N$ is a number
of preference queries. We further demonstrate last-iterate linear convergence
for the exploitability gap and uniformly for the span semi-norm of
log-probabilities, with all these rates being independent of the size of the
action space. Furthermore, we propose and analyze an approximate version of
Nash-MP where proximal steps are estimated using stochastic policy gradients,
making the algorithm closer to applications. Finally, we detail a practical
implementation strategy for fine-tuning large language models and present
experiments that demonstrate its competitive performance and compatibility with
existing methods.

Motivation: 传统LOO交叉验证在估计积分平方误差（ISE）时精度不足，需要一种更精确的方法来评估预测器的性能。

Method: 基于高斯过程假设，构建平方LOO残差的最佳线性估计器，用于估计未采样站点的预测误差平方。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，加权LOO方法显著提高了ISE估计的精度，且对GP核的选择具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 加权LOO方法在ISE估计中表现优于传统方法，适用于模型选择等应用。

Abstract: We present a weighted version of Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation for
estimating the Integrated Squared Error (ISE) when approximating an unknown
function by a predictor that depends linearly on evaluations of the function
over a finite collection of sites. The method relies on the construction of the
best linear estimator of the squared prediction error at an arbitrary unsampled
site based on squared LOO residuals, assuming that the function is a
realization of a Gaussian Process (GP). A theoretical analysis of performance
of the ISE estimator is presented, and robustness with respect to the choice of
the GP kernel is investigated first analytically, then through numerical
examples. Overall, the estimation of ISE is significantly more precise than
with classical, unweighted, LOO cross validation. Application to model
selection is briefly considered through examples.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理分布反演问题，并加速计算。

Abstract: This work is focussed on the inversion task of inferring the distribution
over parameters of interest leading to multiple sets of observations. The
potential to solve such distributional inversion problems is driven by
increasing availability of data, but a major roadblock is blind deconvolution,
arising when the observational noise distribution is unknown. However, when
data originates from collections of physical systems, a population, it is
possible to leverage this information to perform deconvolution. To this end, we
propose a methodology leveraging large data sets of observations, collected
from different instantiations of the same physical processes, to simultaneously
deconvolve the data corrupting noise distribution, and to identify the
distribution over model parameters defining the physical processes. A
parameter-dependent mathematical model of the physical process is employed. A
loss function characterizing the match between the observed data and the output
of the mathematical model is defined; it is minimized as a function of the both
the parameter inputs to the model of the physics and the parameterized
observational noise. This coupled problem is addressed with a modified gradient
descent algorithm that leverages specific structure in the noise model.
Furthermore, a new active learning scheme is proposed, based on adaptive
empirical measures, to train a surrogate model to be accurate in parameter
regions of interest; this approach accelerates computation and enables
automatic differentiation of black-box, potentially nondifferentiable, code
computing parameter-to-solution maps. The proposed methodology is demonstrated
on porous medium flow, damped elastodynamics, and simplified models of
atmospheric dynamics.

Conclusion: 所提算法在噪声依赖性衰减的情况下表现良好，适用于更广泛的噪声模型。

Abstract: We study the linear stochastic bandit problem, relaxing the standard i.i.d.
assumption on the observation noise. As an alternative to this restrictive
assumption, we allow the noise terms across rounds to be sub-Gaussian but
interdependent, with dependencies that decay over time. To address this
setting, we develop new confidence sequences using a recently introduced
reduction scheme to sequential probability assignment, and use these to derive
a bandit algorithm based on the principle of optimism in the face of
uncertainty. We provide regret bounds for the resulting algorithm, expressed in
terms of the decay rate of the strength of dependence between observations.
Among other results, we show that our bounds recover the standard rates up to a
factor of the mixing time for geometrically mixing observation noise.

TLDR: PPI++是一种结合黄金标准标签和伪标签的统计估计方法，其渐近方差优于仅用黄金标准标签。然而，有限样本分析表明，PPI++的表现取决于伪标签与黄金标准标签的相关性，且并非总是优于后者。

Motivation: 探讨PPI++在有限样本下的表现，揭示其并非在所有情况下都优于仅用黄金标准标签，明确其适用条件。

Method: 通过精确的有限样本分析，研究PPI++在均值估计问题中的误差，并给出相关性阈值条件。

Result: PPI++仅在伪标签与黄金标准标签的相关性超过特定阈值（如高斯数据中为$1/\sqrt{n - 2}$）时表现更优。

Conclusion: PPI++并非“免费午餐”，其优势取决于数据特性和样本量，需谨慎应用。

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a popular strategy for combining
gold-standard and possibly noisy pseudo-labels to perform statistical
estimation. Prior work has shown an asymptotic "free lunch" for PPI++, an
adaptive form of PPI, showing that the *asymptotic* variance of PPI++ is always
less than or equal to the variance obtained from using gold-standard labels
alone. Notably, this result holds *regardless of the quality of the
pseudo-labels*. In this work, we demystify this result by conducting an exact
finite-sample analysis of the estimation error of PPI++ on the mean estimation
problem. We give a "no free lunch" result, characterizing the settings (and
sample sizes) where PPI++ has provably worse estimation error than using
gold-standard labels alone. Specifically, PPI++ will outperform if and only if
the correlation between pseudo- and gold-standard is above a certain level that
depends on the number of labeled samples ($n$). In some cases our results
simplify considerably: For Gaussian data, the correlation must be at least
$1/\sqrt{n - 2}$ in order to see improvement, and a similar result holds for
binary labels. In experiments, we illustrate that our theoretical findings hold
on real-world datasets, and give insights into trade-offs between single-sample
and sample-splitting variants of PPI++.

Conclusion: LLoCa为高能物理提供了高效且通用的Lorentz等变网络框架。

Abstract: Lorentz-equivariant neural networks are becoming the leading architectures
for high-energy physics. Current implementations rely on specialized layers,
limiting architectural choices. We introduce Lorentz Local Canonicalization
(LLoCa), a general framework that renders any backbone network exactly
Lorentz-equivariant. Using equivariantly predicted local reference frames, we
construct LLoCa-transformers and graph networks. We adapt a recent approach to
geometric message passing to the non-compact Lorentz group, allowing
propagation of space-time tensorial features. Data augmentation emerges from
LLoCa as a special choice of reference frame. Our models surpass
state-of-the-art accuracy on relevant particle physics tasks, while being
$4\times$ faster and using $5$-$100\times$ fewer FLOPs.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为Grassroots Consensus的协议，旨在为基层平台提供高效、响应迅速的共识机制，满足多种需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基层平台试图提供一种平等化的替代方案，以区别于集中化或去中心化的传统平台。为了实现这一目标，需要一个共识协议来支持数字社会契约的执行。

Method: 该协议基于两种前沿共识协议（Morpheus和Cordial Miners），改进了传播协议并使其支持UDP，同时增加了宪法和宪法修正组件。

Result: Grassroots Consensus协议在低吞吐量和高吞吐量场景下均表现出色，同时简洁优雅。

Conclusion: 该协议为基层平台提供了一种高效且灵活的共识解决方案，支持数字社区的民主化和去中心化。

Abstract: Grassroots platforms aim to offer an egalitarian alternative to global
platforms -- centralized/autocratic and decentralized/plutocratic alike. Within
the grassroots architecture, consensus is needed to realize platforms that
employ digital social contracts, which are like smart contracts except that
they are among people not accounts and are executed by these people's
smartphones not by high-performance servers controlled by parties outside to
the contract. Key envisioned grassroots platforms include sovereign democratic
digital communities and federations, community banks and their grassroots
cryptocurrencies, and digital cooperatives.
  The grassroots architecture can benefit from a consensus protocol that is (i)
quiescent, (ii) efficient during low- and high-throughput, (iii) responsive,
(iv) blocklace-based, (v) UDP-ready, and (vi) grassroots. The Grassroots
Consensus protocol addresses all these requirements while having competitive
performance in both low- and high-throughput scenarios and being one of the
most concise and elegant consensus protocols for partial synchrony. It achieves
that by building on two cutting-edge consensus protocols -- the quiescent
high-performance Morpheus and the blocklace-based Cordial Miners, improving the
latter's dissemination protocol and making it UDP-ready, and extending the
protocol with a constitution and a constitutional amendment component, making
it grassroots.

Result: 实验表明，PacTrain在带宽受限条件下，训练吞吐量提升1.25至8.72倍。

Conclusion: PacTrain提供了一种近最优的压缩策略，显著加速分布式训练且不影响精度。

Abstract: Large-scale deep neural networks (DNN) exhibit excellent performance for
various tasks. As DNNs and datasets grow, distributed training becomes
extremely time-consuming and demands larger clusters. A main bottleneck is the
resulting gradient aggregation overhead. While gradient compression and sparse
collective communication techniques are commonly employed to alleviate network
load, many gradient compression schemes do not achieve acceleration of the
training process while also preserving accuracy. This paper introduces
PacTrain, a novel framework that accelerates distributed training by combining
pruning with sparse gradient compression. Active pruning of the neural network
makes the model weights and gradients sparse. By ensuring the global knowledge
of the gradient sparsity among all distributed training workers, we can perform
lightweight compression communication without harming accuracy. We show that
the PacTrain compression scheme achieves a near-optimal compression strategy
while remaining compatible with the all-reduce primitive. Experimental
evaluations show that PacTrain improves training throughput by 1.25 to 8.72
times compared to state-of-the-art compression-enabled systems for
representative vision and language models training tasks under
bandwidth-constrained conditions.

Result: 在AM领域的RAISE-LPBF数据集上，推理速度提升约8.8倍，模型质量提高约1.35倍。

Conclusion: 硬件感知NAS是一种高效的方法，可显著优化边缘设备上的AI模型性能。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning models deployed on edge devices,
e.g., for quality control in Additive Manufacturing (AM), are frequently small
in size. Such models usually have to deliver highly accurate results within a
short time frame. Methods that are commonly employed in literature start out
with larger trained models and try to reduce their memory and latency footprint
by structural pruning, knowledge distillation, or quantization. It is, however,
also possible to leverage hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS), an
approach that seeks to systematically explore the architecture space to find
optimized configurations. In this study, a hardware-aware NAS workflow is
introduced that couples an edge device located in Belgium with a powerful
High-Performance Computing system in Germany, to train possible architecture
candidates as fast as possible while performing real-time latency measurements
on the target hardware. The approach is verified on a use case in the AM
domain, based on the open RAISE-LPBF dataset, achieving ~8.8 times faster
inference speed while simultaneously enhancing model quality by a factor of
~1.35, compared to a human-designed baseline.

Motivation: 传统去卷积方法估计ECG和PCG信号的耦合信号时会放大噪声，限制了临床实用性。

Method: NMCSE通过分布匹配和最优传输理论联合优化幅度和时间对齐，无需额外预处理。结合时空特征提取网络，实现鲁棒的多模态心血管疾病检测。

Result: 在PhysioNet 2016数据集上，NMCSE将估计误差降低约30%，同时保持较高的皮尔逊相关系数。心血管疾病检测准确率达97.38%，AUC为0.98。

Conclusion: NMCSE在噪声环境下表现优异，优于现有方法，适用于实际临床场景。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals are linked by a
latent coupling signal representing the electrical-to-mechanical cardiac
transformation. While valuable for cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection, this
coupling signal is traditionally estimated using deconvolution methods that
amplify noise, limiting clinical utility. In this paper, we propose
Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation (NMCSE), which reformulates
the problem as distribution matching via optimal transport theory. By jointly
optimizing amplitude and temporal alignment, NMCSE mitigates noise
amplification without additional preprocessing. Integrated with our
Temporal-Spatial Feature Extraction network, NMCSE enables robust multi-modal
CVD detection. Experiments on the PhysioNet 2016 dataset with realistic
hospital noise demonstrate that NMCSE reduces estimation errors by
approximately 30% in Mean Squared Error while maintaining higher Pearson
Correlation Coefficients across all tested signal-to-noise ratios. Our approach
achieves 97.38% accuracy and 0.98 AUC in CVD detection, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating robust performance for real-world
clinical applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography-based Emotion Recognition (EEG-ER) has become a
growing research area in recent years. Analyzing 216 papers published between
2018 and 2023, we uncover that the field lacks a unified evaluation protocol,
which is essential to fairly define the state of the art, compare new
approaches and to track the field's progress. We report the main
inconsistencies between the used evaluation protocols, which are related to
ground truth definition, evaluation metric selection, data splitting types
(e.g., subject-dependent or subject-independent) and the use of different
datasets. Capitalizing on this state-of-the-art research, we propose a unified
evaluation protocol, EEGain (https://github.com/EmotionLab/EEGain), which
enables an easy and efficient evaluation of new methods and datasets. EEGain is
a novel open source software framework, offering the capability to compare -
and thus define - state-of-the-art results. EEGain includes standardized
methods for data pre-processing, data splitting, evaluation metrics, and the
ability to load the six most relevant datasets (i.e., AMIGOS, DEAP, DREAMER,
MAHNOB-HCI, SEED, SEED-IV) in EEG-ER with only a single line of code. In
addition, we have assessed and validated EEGain using these six datasets on the
four most common publicly available methods (EEGNet, DeepConvNet,
ShallowConvNet, TSception). This is a significant step to make research on
EEG-ER more reproducible and comparable, thereby accelerating the overall
progress of the field.

Abstract: We propose a two-stage deep learning framework for the inverse design of
rectangular patch antennas. Our approach leverages generative modeling to learn
a latent representation of antenna frequency response curves and conditions a
subsequent generative model on these responses to produce feasible antenna
geometries. We further demonstrate that leveraging search and optimization
techniques at test-time improves the accuracy of the generated designs and
enables consideration of auxiliary objectives such as manufacturability. Our
approach generalizes naturally to different design criteria, and can be easily
adapted to more complex geometric design spaces.

Conclusion: PhySense通过联合优化重建与布局，提供了理论保证和实际性能提升。

Abstract: Physics sensing plays a central role in many scientific and engineering
domains, which inherently involves two coupled tasks: reconstructing dense
physical fields from sparse observations and optimizing scattered sensor
placements to observe maximum information. While deep learning has made rapid
advances in sparse-data reconstruction, existing methods generally omit
optimization of sensor placements, leaving the mutual enhancement between
reconstruction and placement on the shelf. To change this suboptimal practice,
we propose PhySense, a synergistic two-stage framework that learns to jointly
reconstruct physical fields and to optimize sensor placements, both aiming for
accurate physics sensing. The first stage involves a flow-based generative
model enhanced by cross-attention to adaptively fuse sparse observations.
\correct{Leveraging the reconstruction feedback, }the second stage performs
sensor placement via projected gradient descent to satisfy spatial constraints.
\correct{We further prove that the learning objectives of the two stages are
consistent with classical variance-minimization principles, providing
theoretical guarantees.} Extensive experiments across three challenging
benchmarks, especially a 3D geometry dataset, indicate PhySense achieves
state-of-the-art physics sensing accuracy and discovers informative sensor
placements previously unconsidered.

Abstract: Reliable automatic seizure detection from long-term EEG remains a challenge,
as current machine learning models often fail to generalize across patients or
clinical settings. Manual EEG review remains the clinical standard,
underscoring the need for robust models and standardized evaluation. To
rigorously assess algorithm performance, we organized a challenge using a
private dataset of continuous EEG recordings from 65 subjects (4,360 hours).
Expert neurophysiologists annotated the data, providing ground truth for
seizure events. Participants were required to detect seizure onset and
duration, with evaluation based on event-based metrics, including sensitivity,
precision, F1-score, and false positives per day. The SzCORE framework ensured
standardized evaluation. The primary ranking criterion was the event-based
F1-score, reflecting clinical relevance by balancing sensitivity and false
positives. The challenge received 30 submissions from 19 teams, with 28
algorithms evaluated. Results revealed wide variability in performance, with a
top F1-score of 43% (sensitivity 37%, precision 45%), highlighting the ongoing
difficulty of seizure detection. The challenge also revealed a gap between
reported performance and real-world evaluation, emphasizing the importance of
rigorous benchmarking. Compared to previous challenges and commercial systems,
the best-performing algorithm in this contest showed improved performance.
Importantly, the challenge platform now supports continuous benchmarking,
enabling reproducible research, integration of new datasets, and clinical
evaluation of seizure detection algorithms using a standardized framework.

<details>

Motivation: 传统单模态感知系统在复杂动态环境中表现不佳，且单设备系统视角有限。为解决这些问题，作者提出了多设备协作的多模态融合框架。

Method: 1. 开发RF-视觉融合网络（RVFN）实现多模态数据整合；2. 提出基于LLM的语义传输网络（LSTN）优化通信；3. 设计基于Transformer的聚合模型（TRAM）融合分布式特征；4. 采用两阶段分布式学习策略保护隐私。

Result: 在合成多视角RF-视觉数据集上，LLM-DiSAC表现出色。

Conclusion: LLM-DiSAC通过多模态融合和分布式协作显著提升了感知精度和通信效率。

Abstract: Traditional single-modal sensing systems-based solely on either radio
frequency (RF) or visual data-struggle to cope with the demands of complex and
dynamic environments. Furthermore, single-device systems are constrained by
limited perspectives and insufficient spatial coverage, which impairs their
effectiveness in urban or non-line-of-sight scenarios. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-driven distributed
integrated multimodal sensing and semantic communication (LLM-DiSAC) framework.
Specifically, our system consists of multiple collaborative sensing devices
equipped with RF and camera modules, working together with an aggregation
center to enhance sensing accuracy. First, on sensing devices, LLM-DiSAC
develops an RF-vision fusion network (RVFN), which employs specialized feature
extractors for RF and visual data, followed by a cross-attention module for
effective multimodal integration. Second, a LLM-based semantic transmission
network (LSTN) is proposed to enhance communication efficiency, where the
LLM-based decoder leverages known channel parameters, such as transceiver
distance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), to mitigate semantic distortion.
Third, at the aggregation center, a transformer-based aggregation model (TRAM)
with an adaptive aggregation attention mechanism is developed to fuse
distributed features and enhance sensing accuracy. To preserve data privacy, a
two-stage distributed learning strategy is introduced, allowing local model
training at the device level and centralized aggregation model training using
intermediate features. Finally, evaluations on a synthetic multi-view RF-visual
dataset generated by the Genesis simulation engine show that LLM-DiSAC achieves
a good performance.

Motivation: RF指纹识别在无人机安全中具有潜力，但跨信道性能下降严重，需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 采用对抗学习训练模型，减少不同RF信道间的域差距，提升跨信道识别性能。

Result: 在UAVSig数据集上，CrossRF在跨信道识别中达到99.03%准确率，远高于传统方法的26.39%。

Conclusion: CrossRF显著减少了跨信道性能下降，适用于实际无人机安全应用。

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting offers a promising approach for drone
identification and security, although it suffers from significant performance
degradation when operating on different transmission channels. This paper
presents CrossRF, a domain-invariant deep learning approach that addresses the
problem of cross-channel RF fingerprinting for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
identification. Our approach aims to minimize the domain gap between different
RF channels by using adversarial learning to train a more robust model that
maintains consistent identification performance despite channel variations. We
validate our approach using the UAVSig dataset, comprising real-world
over-the-air RF signals from identical drone models operating across several
frequency channels, ensuring that the findings correspond to real-world
scenarios. The experimental results show CrossRF's efficiency, achieving up to
99.03% accuracy when adapting from Channel 3 to Channel 4, compared to only
26.39% using conventional methods. The model maintains robust performance in
more difficult multi-channel scenarios (87.57% accuracy adapting from Channels
1,3 to 2,4) and achieves 89.45% accuracy with 0.9 precision for controller
classification. These results confirm CrossRF's ability to significantly reduce
performance degradation due to cross-channel variations while maintaining high
identification accuracy with minimal training data requirements, making it
particularly suitable for practical drone security applications.

Abstract: The increase in cardiac and pulmonary diseases presents an alarming and
pervasive health challenge on a global scale responsible for unexpected and
premature mortalities. In spite of how serious these conditions are, existing
methods of detection and treatment encounter challenges, particularly in
achieving timely diagnosis for effective medical intervention. Manual screening
processes commonly used for primary detection of cardiac and respiratory
problems face inherent limitations, increased by a scarcity of skilled medical
practitioners in remote or under-resourced areas. To address this, our study
introduces an innovative yet efficient model which integrates AI for diagnosing
lung and heart conditions concurrently using the auscultation sounds. Unlike
the already high-priced digital stethoscope, our proposed model has been
particularly designed to deploy on low-cost embedded devices and thus ensure
applicability in under-developed regions that actually face an issue of
accessing medical care. Our proposed model incorporates MFCC feature extraction
and engineering techniques to ensure that the signal is well analyzed for
accurate diagnostics through the hybrid model combining Gated Recurrent Unit
with CNN in processing audio signals recorded from the low-cost stethoscope.
Beyond its diagnostic capabilities, the model generates digital audio records
that facilitate in classifying six pulmonary and five cardiovascular diseases.
Hence, the integration of a cost effective stethoscope with an efficient AI
empowered model deployed on a web app providing real-time analysis, represents
a transformative step towards standardized healthcare

Abstract: With the advancement of energy Internet and energy system integration, the

multi-head self-attention to capture the complex dependencies between weather
factors, the method achieves precise PV generation predictions. Simulation

data, supporting improved monitoring and management of distributed energy
systems.

Conclusion: 机器学习策略在电池材料优化中具有变革潜力，能有效减少人为偏见和数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: The performance of battery materials is determined by their composition and
the processing conditions employed during commercial-scale fabrication, where
raw materials undergo complex processing steps with various additives to yield
final products. As the complexity of these parameters expands with the
development of industry, conventional one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experiment
becomes old fashioned. While domain expertise aids in parameter optimization,
this traditional approach becomes increasingly vulnerable to cognitive
limitations and anthropogenic biases as the complexity of factors grows.
Herein, we introduce an iterative machine learning (ML) framework that
integrates active learning to guide targeted experimentation and facilitate
incremental model refinement. This method systematically leverages
comprehensive experimental observations, including both successful and
unsuccessful results, effectively mitigating human-induced biases and
alleviating data scarcity. Consequently, it significantly accelerates
exploration within the high-dimensional design space. Our results demonstrate
that active-learning-driven experimentation markedly reduces the total number
of experimental cycles necessary, underscoring the transformative potential of
ML-based strategies in expediting battery material optimization.

Abstract: We propose a dim and small target detection algorithm for drone broadcast
frames based on the time-frequency analysis of communication protocol.
Specifically, by analyzing modulation parameters and frame structures, the
prior knowledge of transmission frequency, signal bandwidth, Zadoff-Chu (ZC)
sequences, and frame length of drone broadcast frames is established. The RF
signals are processed through the designed filter banks, and the frequency
domain parameters of bounding boxes generated by the detector are corrected
with transmission frequency and signal bandwidth. Given the remarkable
correlation characteristics of ZC sequences, the frequency domain parameters of
bounding boxes with low confidence scores are corrected based on ZC sequences
and frame length, which improves the detection accuracy of dim targets under
low signal-to noise ratio (SNR) situations. Besides, a segmented energy
refinement method is applied to mitigate the deviation caused by interference
signals with high energy strength, which ulteriorly corrects the time domain
detection parameters for dim targets. As the sampling duration increases, the
detection speed improves while the detection accuracy of broadcast frames
termed as small targets decreases. The trade-off between detection accuracy and
speed versus sampling duration is established, which helps to meet different
drone regulation requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm improves the average intersection over union, precision, and recall
by 3\%, 1.4\%, and 2.4\%, respectively, compared to existing algorithms. The
proposed algorithm also performs strong robustness under varying flight
distances, diverse types of environment noise, and different flight visual
environment.

Abstract: Electric energy is difficult to store, requiring stricter control over its
generation, transmission, and distribution. A persistent challenge in power
systems is maintaining real-time equilibrium between electricity demand and
supply. Oversupply contributes to resource wastage, while undersupply can
strain the grid, increase operational costs, and potentially impact service
reliability. To maintain grid stability, load forecasting is needed. Accurate
load forecasting balances generation and demand by striving to predict future
electricity consumption. This thesis examines and evaluates four machine
learning frameworks for short term load forecasting, including gradient
boosting decision tree methods such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and
Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). A hybrid framework is also
developed. In addition, two recurrent neural network architectures, Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), are designed and
implemented. Pearson Correlation Coefficient is applied to assess the
relationships between electricity demand and exogenous variables. The
experimental results show that, for the specific dataset and forecasting task
in this study, machine learning-based models achieved improved forecasting
performance compared to a classical ARIMA baseline.

Abstract: Objective: To conduct a systematic assessment of machine learning
applications that utilize electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart sound data in the
development of cost-effective detection tools for rheumatic heart disease (RHD)
from the year 2015 to 2025, thereby supporting the World Heart Federation's "25

echocardiography in underserved regions. Methods: Following PRISMA-ScR
guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search across PubMed, IEEE Xplore,
Scopus, and Embase for peer-reviewed literature focusing on ML-based ECG/PCG
analysis for RHD detection. Two independent reviewers screened studies, and
data extraction focused on methodology, validation approaches, and performance
metrics. Results: Analysis of 37 relevant studies revealed that convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have become the predominant technology in post-2020
implementations, achieving a median accuracy of 93.7%. However, 73% of studies
relied on single-center datasets, only 10.8% incorporated external validation,
and none addressed cost-effectiveness. Performance varied markedly across
different valvular lesions, and despite 44% of studies originating from endemic
regions, significant gaps persisted in implementation science and demographic
diversity. Conclusion: While ML-based ECG/PCG analysis shows promise for RHD
detection, substantial methodological limitations hinder clinical translation.
Future research must prioritize standardized benchmarking frameworks,
multimodal architectures, cost-effectiveness assessments, and prospective
trials in endemic settings. Significance: This review provides a critical
roadmap for developing accessible ML-based RHD screening tools to help bridge
the diagnostic gap in resourceconstrained settings where conventional
auscultation misses up to 90% of cases and echocardiography remains
inaccessible.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder
characterized by motor neuron degeneration, with alterations in neural
excitability serving as key indicators. Recent advancements in induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology have enabled the generation of human
iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, which, when combined with multi-electrode array
(MEA) electrophysiology, provide rich spatial and temporal electrophysiological
data. Traditionally, MEA data is analyzed using handcrafted features based on
potentially imperfect domain knowledge, which while useful may not fully
capture all useful characteristics inherent in the data. Machine learning,
particularly deep learning, has the potential to automatically learn relevant
characteristics from raw data without solely relying on handcrafted feature
extraction. However, handcrafted features remain critical for encoding domain
knowledge and improving interpretability, especially with limited or noisy
data. This study introduces FRAME-C, a knowledge-augmented machine learning
pipeline that combines domain knowledge, raw spike waveform data, and deep
learning techniques to classify MEA signals and identify ALS-specific
phenotypes. FRAME-C leverages deep learning to learn important features from
spike waveforms while incorporating handcrafted features such as spike
amplitude, inter-spike interval, and spike duration, preserving key spatial and
temporal information. We validate FRAME-C on both simulated and real MEA data
from human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, demonstrating superior performance
over existing classification methods. FRAME-C shows over 11% improvement on
real data and up to 25% on simulated data. We also show FRAME-C can evaluate
handcrafted feature importance, providing insights into ALS phenotypes.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural
activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by
dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit
distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor
configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches
typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits
the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni,
the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and
MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the
first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete
representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that
encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type,
enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the
discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain
signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the
first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG
and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available
sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both
existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range
of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG
and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training
yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and model
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Generating synthetic ECG data has numerous applications in healthcare, from
educational purposes to simulating scenarios and forecasting trends. While
recent diffusion models excel at generating short ECG segments, they struggle
with longer sequences needed for many clinical applications. This paper
proposes a novel three-layer synthesis framework for generating realistic
long-form ECG signals. We first generate high-fidelity single beats using a
diffusion model, then synthesize inter-beat features preserving critical
temporal dependencies, and finally assemble beats into coherent long sequences
using feature-guided matching. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that
the resulting synthetic ECGs maintain both beat-level morphological fidelity
and clinically relevant inter-beat relationships. In arrhythmia classification
tasks, our long-form synthetic ECGs significantly outperform end-to-end
long-form ECG generation using the diffusion model, highlighting their
potential for increasing utility for downstream applications. The approach
enables generation of unprecedented multi-minute ECG sequences while preserving
essential diagnostic characteristics.

prayer (the second pillar of Islam after Shahadah, the profession of faith) and
other religious duties such as Umrah and Hajj.
  The ontology development strategy followed six key steps: (1) domain
identification, (2) knowledge acquisition, (3) conceptualization, (4)
classification, (5) integration and implementation, and (6) ontology
generation. This paper includes examples of the constructed tables and
classifications.
  The focus is on the design and analysis phases, as technical implementation
is beyond the scope of this study. However, an initial implementation is
provided to illustrate the steps of the proposed strategy.
  The developed ontology ensures reusability by formally defining and encoding
the key concepts, attributes, and relationships related to the Book of
Purification. This structured representation is intended to support knowledge
sharing and reuse.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示文献数据库中的研究结构，评估图聚类算法在真实数据上的性能。

Method: 使用谱聚类、Louvain和Leiden算法，分析约70万篇论文和460万次引用的引文图。

Result: Louvain和Leiden算法效率高，但默认参数效果差；需针对网络结构调参。

Conclusion: 大规模文献聚类需根据网络结构选择方法和调参，凸显实际挑战。

Abstract: Clustering scientific publications can reveal underlying research structures
within bibliographic databases. Graph-based clustering methods, such as
spectral, Louvain, and Leiden algorithms, are frequently utilized due to their
capacity to effectively model citation networks. However, their performance may
degrade when applied to real-world data. This study evaluates the performance
of these clustering algorithms on a citation graph comprising approx. 700,000
papers and 4.6 million citations extracted from Web of Science. The results
show that while scalable methods like Louvain and Leiden perform efficiently,
their default settings often yield poor partitioning. Meaningful outcomes
require careful parameter tuning, especially for large networks with uneven
structures, including a dense core and loosely connected papers. These findings
highlight practical lessons about the challenges of large-scale data, method
selection and tuning based on specific structures of bibliometric clustering
tasks.

Conclusion: 该架构为自动分析研究局限性提供了有效工具，有望提升科学研究的透明度和信任度。

Abstract: In scientific research, limitations refer to the shortcomings, constraints,
or weaknesses within a study. Transparent reporting of such limitations can
enhance the quality and reproducibility of research and improve public trust in
science. However, authors often a) underreport them in the paper text and b)
use hedging strategies to satisfy editorial requirements at the cost of
readers' clarity and confidence. This underreporting behavior, along with an
explosion in the number of publications, has created a pressing need to
automatically extract or generate such limitations from scholarly papers. In
this direction, we present a complete architecture for the computational
analysis of research limitations. Specifically, we create a dataset of
limitations in ACL, NeurIPS, and PeerJ papers by extracting them from papers'
text and integrating them with external reviews; we propose methods to
automatically generate them using a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
technique; we create a fine-grained evaluation framework for generated
limitations; and we provide a meta-evaluation for the proposed evaluation
techniques.

Motivation: 科学文献引用过程耗时，现有方法难以准确识别引用意图和生成符合人类偏好的引用句子。

Method: 结合引用网络和情感意图提高推荐准确性，利用原文摘要、上下文、引用意图和推荐文献生成引用句子，并提出新评估指标。

Result: SciRGC提升了引用推荐的准确性和相关性，生成的引用句子更符合上下文需求。

Conclusion: SciRGC为跨学科研究者提供了高效工具，解决了引用生成中的关键问题。

Abstract: Citations are crucial in scientific research articles as they highlight the
connection between the current study and prior work. However, this process is
often time-consuming for researchers. In this study, we propose the SciRGC
framework, which aims to automatically recommend citation articles and generate
citation sentences for citation locations within articles. The framework
addresses two key challenges in academic citation generation: 1) how to
accurately identify the author's citation intent and find relevant citation
papers, and 2) how to generate high-quality citation sentences that align with
human preferences. We enhance citation recommendation accuracy in the citation
article recommendation module by incorporating citation networks and sentiment
intent, and generate reasoning-based citation sentences in the citation
sentence generation module by using the original article abstract, local
context, citation intent, and recommended articles as inputs. Additionally, we
propose a new evaluation metric to fairly assess the quality of generated
citation sentences. Through comparisons with baseline models and ablation
experiments, the SciRGC framework not only improves the accuracy and relevance
of citation recommendations but also ensures the appropriateness of the
generated citation sentences in context, providing a valuable tool for
interdisciplinary researchers.

### [1100] [Private Geometric Median in Nearly-Linear Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20189)
*Syamantak Kumar,Daogao Liu,Kevin Tian,Chutong Yang*

Main category: cs.DS

TLDR: 论文改进了[HSU24]的差分隐私算法，提出了一个更高效的几何中位数估计方法，运行时间接近线性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何中位数估计是计算几何中的基本问题，现有差分隐私算法的效率有待提升。

Method: 结合子采样和几何聚合工具，优化了[HSU24]算法的“预热启动”部分，并分析了DP-SGD的敏感性。

Result: 新算法在相同样本复杂度下实现了更快的运行时间，接近线性。

Conclusion: 改进算法在保持隐私保护的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Estimating the geometric median of a dataset is a robust counterpart to mean
estimation, and is a fundamental problem in computational geometry. Recently,
[HSU24] gave an $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithm
obtaining an $\alpha$-multiplicative approximation to the geometric median
objective, $\frac 1 n \sum_{i \in [n]} \|\cdot - \mathbf{x}_i\|$, given a
dataset $\mathcal{D} := \{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i \in [n]} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$.
Their algorithm requires $n \gtrsim \sqrt d \cdot \frac 1 {\alpha\varepsilon}$
samples, which they prove is information-theoretically optimal. This result is
surprising because its error scales with the \emph{effective radius} of
$\mathcal{D}$ (i.e., of a ball capturing most points), rather than the
worst-case radius. We give an improved algorithm that obtains the same
approximation quality, also using $n \gtrsim \sqrt d \cdot \frac 1
{\alpha\epsilon}$ samples, but in time $\widetilde{O}(nd + \frac d
{\alpha^2})$. Our runtime is nearly-linear, plus the cost of the cheapest
non-private first-order method due to [CLM+16]. To achieve our results, we use
subsampling and geometric aggregation tools inspired by FriendlyCore [TCK+22]
to speed up the "warm start" component of the [HSU24] algorithm, combined with
a careful custom analysis of DP-SGD's sensitivity for the geometric median
objective.

Result: 算法在顶点加权和AdWords问题中表现优异，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了高效算法，并探讨了鲁棒性与一致性之间的权衡限制。

Abstract: Online bipartite matching is a fundamental problem in online optimization,
extensively studied both in its integral and fractional forms due to its
theoretical significance and practical applications, such as online advertising
and resource allocation. Motivated by recent progress in learning-augmented
algorithms, we study online bipartite fractional matching when the algorithm is
given advice in the form of a suggested matching in each iteration. We develop
algorithms for both the vertex-weighted and unweighted variants that provably
dominate the naive "coin flip" strategy of randomly choosing between the
advice-following and advice-free algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm for the
vertex-weighted setting extends to the AdWords problem under the small bids
assumption, yielding a significant improvement over the seminal work of
Mahdian, Nazerzadeh, and Saberi (EC 2007, TALG 2012). Complementing our
positive results, we establish a hardness bound on the robustness-consistency
tradeoff that is attainable by any algorithm. We empirically validate our
algorithms through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Method: 提出多种方法（包括机器学习和传统运筹学方法）来选择省略的包裹，同时使用传统运筹学方法构建路径。

Result: 在静态问题中，传统运筹学方法表现优于机器学习方法。

Conclusion: 传统运筹学方法在带排放配额的车辆路径问题中更具优势。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are traditionally addressed using
Operations Research (OR) methods, including metaheuristics. In this study, we
introduce a demand selection problem for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with
an emission quota, referred to as QVRP. The objective is to minimize the number
of omitted deliveries while respecting the pollution quota. We focus on the
demand selection part, called Maximum Feasible Vehicle Assignment (MFVA), while
the construction of a routing for the VRP instance is solved using classical OR
methods. We propose several methods for selecting the packages to omit, both
from machine learning (ML) and OR. Our results show that, in this static
problem setting, classical OR-based methods consistently outperform ML-based
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba2在资源受限的边缘设备上部署时面临量化挑战、不规则张量操作和硬件不友好的非线性函数问题。

Method: 采用Hadamard变换实现8位量化，提出硬件友好的幂次量化框架，并优化非线性函数的一阶线性近似。

Result: 在Mamba2-130M和Mamba2-2.7B上，FastMamba分别实现了68.8倍和6倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: FastMamba通过硬件-算法协同设计显著提升了Mamba2的部署效率和能效。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), like recent Mamba2, have achieved remarkable
performance and received extensive attention. However, deploying Mamba2 on
resource-constrained edge devices encounters many problems: severe outliers
within the linear layer challenging the quantization, diverse and irregular
element-wise tensor operations, and hardware-unfriendly nonlinear functions in
the SSM block. To address these issues, this paper presents FastMamba, a
dedicated accelerator on FPGA with hardware-algorithm co-design to promote the
deployment efficiency of Mamba2. Specifically, we successfully achieve 8-bit
quantization for linear layers through Hadamard transformation to eliminate
outliers. Moreover, a hardware-friendly and fine-grained power-of-two
quantization framework is presented for the SSM block and convolution layer,
and a first-order linear approximation is developed to optimize the nonlinear
functions. Based on the accurate algorithm quantization, we propose an
accelerator that integrates parallel vector processing units, pipelined
execution dataflow, and an efficient SSM Nonlinear Approximation Unit, which
enhances computational efficiency and reduces hardware complexity. Finally, we
evaluate FastMamba on Xilinx VC709 FPGA. For the input prefill task on
Mamba2-130M, FastMamba achieves 68.80\times and 8.90\times speedup over Intel
Xeon 4210R CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, respectively. In the output decode
experiment with Mamba2-2.7B, FastMamba attains 6\times higher energy efficiency
than RTX 3090 GPU.

Motivation: 尽管posit格式在动态范围和精度上优于传统浮点数，但其在RISC-V处理器中的采用因缺乏轻量级、精度可扩展且兼容IEEE-754的硬件实现方案而受限。

Method: 1) 在原始FPU中集成专用posit编解码器以实现轻量级实现；2) 引入动态指数大小的多/混合精度支持以实现精度可扩展性；3) 重用和定制ISA扩展以实现兼容IEEE-754的posit运算。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法成功解决了posit格式在RISC-V处理器中的实现难题，显著提升了硬件效率和性能。

Abstract: While posit format offers superior dynamic range and accuracy for
transprecision computing, its adoption in RISC-V processors is hindered by the
lack of a unified solution for lightweight, precision-scalable, and IEEE-754
arithmetic compatible hardware implementation. To address these challenges, we
enhance RISC-V processors by 1) integrating dedicated posit codecs into the
original FPU for lightweight implementation, 2) incorporating
multi/mixed-precision support with dynamic exponent size for
precision-scalability, and 3) reusing and customizing ISA extensions for
IEEE-754 compatible posit operations. Our comprehensive evaluation spans the
modified FPU, RISC-V core, and SoC levels. It demonstrates that our
implementation achieves 47.9% LUTs and 57.4% FFs reduction compared to
state-of-the-art posit-enabled RISC-V processors, while achieving up to

Motivation: 解决传统Ising机器在处理多状态优化问题时因转换为QUBO形式而导致的探索空间复杂化问题。

Method: 使用广义布尔逻辑函数建模自旋相互作用，结合并行回火技术，并设计了一个1024神经元全连接的Ising加速器。

Result: 在准确性和性能上优于现有启发式算法和机器学习方法，且加速器在能量、性能、面积和解质量上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了Ising硬件的潜力，使其能够更高效地解决多状态优化问题。

Abstract: Ising Machines are a prominent class of hardware architectures that aim to
solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. These machines consist of a
network of interacting binary spins/neurons that evolve to represent the
optimum ground state energy solution. Generally, combinatorial problems are
transformed into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form to
harness the computational efficiency of these Ising machines. However, this
transformation, especially for multi-state problems, often leads to a more
complex exploration landscape than the original problem, thus severely
impacting the solution quality. To address this challenge, we model the spin
interactions as a generalized boolean logic function to significantly reduce
the exploration space. We benchmark the graph coloring problem from the class
of multi-state NP-hard optimization using probabilistic Ising solvers to
illustrate the effectiveness of our framework. The proposed methodology
achieves similar accuracy compared to state-of-the-art heuristics and machine
learning algorithms, and demonstrates significant improvement over the existing
Ising methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that combining parallel tempering
with our existing framework further reduces the coloring error by up to 50%
compared to the conventionally used Gibbs sampling algorithm. We also design a
1024-neuron all-to-all connected probabilistic Ising accelerator that shows up
to 10000x performance acceleration compared to heuristics while reducing the
number of required physical neurons by 1.5-4x compared to conventional Ising
machines. Indeed, this accelerator solution demonstrates improvement across all
metrics over the current methods, i.e., energy, performance, area, and solution
quality. Thus, this work expands the potential of existing Ising hardware to
solve a broad class of these multistate optimization problems.

Conclusion: TUHR系统为大规模活动中的废物管理提供了高效、智能的解决方案，具有环境、健康和经济多重效益。

Abstract: Waste management is a critical global issue with significant environmental
and public health implications. It has become more destructive during
large-scale events such as the annual pilgrimage to Makkah, Saudi Arabia, one
of the world's largest religious gatherings. This event's popularity has
attracted millions worldwide, leading to significant and un-predictable
accumulation of waste. Such a tremendous number of visitors leads to in-creased
waste management issues at the Grand Mosque and other holy sites, highlighting
the need for an effective solution other than traditional methods based on
rigid collection schedules.
  To address this challenge, this research proposed an innovative solution that
is context-specific and tailored to the unique requirements of pilgrimage
season: a Smart Waste Management System, called TUHR, that utilizes the
Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. This system encompasses
ultrasonic sensors that monitor waste levels in each container at the
performance sites. Once the container reaches full capacity, the sensor
communicates with the microcontroller, which alerts the relevant authorities.
Moreover, our system can detect harmful substances such as gas from the gas
detector sensor. Such a proactive and dynamic approach promises to mitigate the
environmental and health risks associated with waste accumulation and enhance
the cleanliness of these sites. It also delivers economic benefits by reducing
unnecessary gasoline consumption and optimizing waste management resources.
Importantly, this research aligns with the principles of smart cities and
exemplifies the innovative, sustainable, and health-conscious approach that
Saudi Arabia is implementing as part of its Vision 2030 initiative.

Abstract: Effective communication between AI and humans is essential for successful
human-AI co-creation. However, many current co-creative AI systems lack
effective communication, which limits their potential for collaboration. This
paper presents the initial design of the Framework for AI Communication (FAICO)
for co-creative AI, developed through a systematic review of 107 full-length
papers. FAICO presents key aspects of AI communication and their impact on user
experience, offering preliminary guidelines for designing human-centered AI
communication. To improve the framework, we conducted a preliminary study with
two focus groups involving skilled individuals in AI, HCI, and design. These
sessions sought to understand participants' preferences for AI communication,
gather their perceptions of the framework, collect feedback for refinement, and
explore its use in co-creative domains like collaborative writing and design.
Our findings reveal a preference for a human-AI feedback loop over linear
communication and emphasize the importance of context in fostering mutual
understanding. Based on these insights, we propose actionable strategies for
applying FAICO in practice and future directions, marking the first step toward
developing comprehensive guidelines for designing effective human-centered AI

Abstract: The growing demand for accessible mental health support, compounded by
workforce shortages and logistical barriers, has led to increased interest in
utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for scalable and real-time assistance.
However, their use in sensitive domains such as anxiety support remains
underexamined. This study presents a systematic evaluation of LLMs (GPT and
Llama) for their potential utility in anxiety support by using real
user-generated posts from the r/Anxiety subreddit for both prompting and
fine-tuning. Our approach utilizes a mixed-method evaluation framework
incorporating three main categories of criteria: (i) linguistic quality, (ii)
safety and trustworthiness, and (iii) supportiveness. Results show that
fine-tuning LLMs with naturalistic anxiety-related data enhanced linguistic
quality but increased toxicity and bias, and diminished emotional
responsiveness. While LLMs exhibited limited empathy, GPT was evaluated as more
supportive overall. Our findings highlight the risks of fine-tuning LLMs on
unprocessed social media content without mitigation strategies.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recommender systems necessitates robust fairness
practices to address inherent biases. Assessing fairness, though, is
challenging due to constantly evolving metrics and best practices. This paper
analyzes how industry practitioners perceive and incorporate these changing
fairness standards in their workflows. Through semi-structured interviews with
11 practitioners from technical teams across a range of large technology
companies, we investigate industry implementations of fairness in
recommendation system products. We focus on current debiasing practices,
applied metrics, collaborative strategies, and integrating academic research
into practice. Findings show a preference for multi-dimensional debiasing over
traditional demographic methods, and a reliance on intuitive rather than
academic metrics. This study also highlights the difficulties in balancing
fairness with both the practitioner's individual (bottom-up) roles and
organizational (top-down) workplace constraints, including the interplay with
legal and compliance experts. Finally, we offer actionable recommendations for
the recommender system community and algorithmic fairness practitioners,
underlining the need to refine fairness practices continually.

Abstract: Shared understanding plays a key role in the effective communication in and
performance of human-human interactions. With the increasingly common
integration of AI into human contexts, the future of personal and workplace
interactions will likely see human-AI interaction (HAII) in which the
perception of shared understanding is important. Existing literature has
addressed the processes and effects of PSU in human-human interactions, but the
construal remains underexplored in HAII. To better understand PSU in HAII, we
conducted an online survey to collect user reflections on interactions with a
large language model when it sunderstanding of a situation was thought to be
similar to or different from the participant's. Through inductive thematic
analysis, we identified eight dimensions comprising PSU in human-AI
interactions: Fluency, aligned operation, fluidity, outcome satisfaction,
contextual awareness, lack of humanlike abilities, computational limits, and

Motivation: AI决策过程通常不透明，开发者需借助可解释AI（XAI）技术提升系统透明度、公平性和可信度，但解释的呈现常被忽视，导致AI系统对用户不实用。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the major technological advancements
of this century, bearing incredible potential for users through AI-powered
applications and tools in numerous domains. Being often black-box (i.e., its
decision-making process is unintelligible), developers typically resort to
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to interpret the behaviour
of AI models to produce systems that are transparent, fair, reliable, and
trustworthy. However, presenting explanations to the user is not trivial and is
often left as a secondary aspect of the system's design process, leading to AI
systems that are not useful to end-users. This paper presents a Systematic
Literature Review on Explanation User Interfaces (XUIs) to gain a deeper
understanding of the solutions and design guidelines employed in the academic
literature to effectively present explanations to users. To improve the
contribution and real-world impact of this survey, we also present a framework
for Human-cEnteRed developMent of Explainable user interfaceS (HERMES) to guide
practitioners and academics in the design and evaluation of XUIs.

### [1113] [Geometric Determinations Of Characteristic Redshifts From DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR Observations: Hints For New Expansion Rate Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19083)
*Purba Mukherjee,Anjan A Sen*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TLDR: 通过结合DESI-DR2 BAO和DES-SN5YR数据，本研究重建了宇宙膨胀历史，发现与Planck 2018 ΛCDM预测存在显著偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究宇宙膨胀历史中的特征红移点，以发现可能的超出标准宇宙学框架的新物理现象。

Method: 采用高斯过程回归和基于节点的样条技术，重建宇宙距离及其导数，推断E(z)。

Result: 在红移范围z∼0.35−0.55内发现4到5σ的显著偏差，表明晚期宇宙膨胀异常。

Conclusion: 特征红移点是膨胀率异常的敏感指标，未来数据将进一步验证这些异常是否源于新物理或系统误差。

Abstract: In this work, we perform a model-agnostic reconstruction of the cosmic
expansion history by combining DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR data, with a focus on
geometric determination of characteristic redshifts where notable tensions in
the expansion rate are found to emerge. Employing Gaussian process regression
alongside knot-based spline techniques, we reconstruct cosmic distances and
their derivatives to pinpoint these characteristic redshifts and infer $E(z)$.
Our analysis reveals significant deviations of approximately 4 to 5$\sigma$
from the Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM predictions, particularly pronounced in the
redshift range $z \sim 0.35-0.55$. These anomalies are consistently observed
across both reconstruction methods and combined datasets, indicating robust
late-time departures that could signal new physics beyond the standard
cosmological framework. The joint use of BAO and SN probes enhances the
precision of our constraints, allowing us to isolate these deviations without
reliance on specific cosmological assumptions. Our findings underscore the role
of characteristic redshifts as sensitive indicators of expansion rate anomalies
and motivate further scrutiny with forthcoming datasets from DESI-5YR BAO,
Euclid, and LSST. These future surveys will tighten constraints and help
distinguish whether these late-time anomalies arise from new fundamental
physics or unresolved systematics in the data.

Result: SP2RINT在保持数字级精度的同时，比现有方法快1825倍。

Conclusion: SP2RINT为可实现的超光学神经系统的规模化高性能训练提供了解决方案。

Abstract: DONNs harness the physics of light propagation for efficient analog
computation, with applications in AI and signal processing. Advances in
nanophotonic fabrication and metasurface-based wavefront engineering have
opened new pathways to realize high-capacity DONNs across various spectral
regimes. Training such DONN systems to determine the metasurface structures
remains challenging. Heuristic methods are fast but oversimplify metasurfaces
modulation, often resulting in physically unrealizable designs and significant
performance degradation. Simulation-in-the-loop training methods directly
optimize a physically implementable metasurface using adjoint methods during
end-to-end DONN training, but are inherently computationally prohibitive and
unscalable.To address these limitations, we propose SP2RINT, a spatially
decoupled, progressive training framework that formulates DONN training as a
PDE-constrained learning problem. Metasurface responses are first relaxed into
freely trainable transfer matrices with a banded structure. We then
progressively enforce physical constraints by alternating between transfer
matrix training and adjoint-based inverse design, avoiding per-iteration PDE
solves while ensuring final physical realizability. To further reduce runtime,
we introduce a physics-inspired, spatially decoupled inverse design strategy
based on the natural locality of field interactions. This approach partitions
the metasurface into independently solvable patches, enabling scalable and
parallel inverse design with system-level calibration. Evaluated across diverse
DONN training tasks, SP2RINT achieves digital-comparable accuracy while being
1825 times faster than simulation-in-the-loop approaches. By bridging the gap
between abstract DONN models and implementable photonic hardware, SP2RINT
enables scalable, high-performance training of physically realizable
meta-optical neural systems.

Conclusion: LA-RCS能高效满足用户需求，减少人工干预。

Abstract: LA-RCS (LLM-agent-based robot control system) is a sophisticated robot
control system designed to autonomously plan, work, and analyze the external
environment based on user requirements by utilizing LLM-Agent. Utilizing a
dual-agent framework, LA-RCS generates plans based on user requests, observes
the external environment, executes the plans, and modifies the plans as needed
to adapt to changes in the external conditions. Additionally, LA-RCS interprets
natural language commands by the user and converts them into commands
compatible with the robot interface so that the robot can execute tasks and
meet user requests properly. During his process, the system autonomously
evaluates observation results, provides feedback on the tasks, and executes
commands based on real-time environmental monitoring, significantly reducing
the need for user intervention in fulfilling requests. We categorized the
scenarios that LA-RCS needs to perform into four distinct types and conducted a
quantitative assessment of its performance in each scenario. The results showed
an average success rate of 90 percent, demonstrating the system capability to
fulfill user requests satisfactorily. For more extensive results, readers can

TLDR: 提出BEDI基准，用于标准化评估无人机代理（UAV-EAs），填补领域空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无人机代理评估缺乏标准化基准和多样化测试场景，限制了研究进展。

Method: 基于感知-决策-行动循环的动态任务链范式，设计统一评估框架和混合测试平台。

Result: 通过实证评估揭示了现有VLM模型的局限性，验证了BEDI的有效性。

Conclusion: BEDI为无人机代理研究提供了标准化评估工具，推动领域发展。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of low-altitude remote sensing and Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), Embodied Agents based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have
shown significant potential in autonomous tasks. However, current evaluation
methods for UAV-Embodied Agents (UAV-EAs) remain constrained by the lack of
standardized benchmarks, diverse testing scenarios and open system interfaces.
To address these challenges, we propose BEDI (Benchmark for Embodied Drone
Intelligence), a systematic and standardized benchmark designed for evaluating
UAV-EAs. Specifically, we introduce a novel Dynamic Chain-of-Embodied-Task
paradigm based on the perception-decision-action loop, which decomposes complex
UAV tasks into standardized, measurable subtasks. Building on this paradigm, we
design a unified evaluation framework encompassing five core sub-skills:
semantic perception, spatial perception, motion control, tool utilization, and
task planning. Furthermore, we construct a hybrid testing platform that
integrates static real-world environments with dynamic virtual scenarios,
enabling comprehensive performance assessment of UAV-EAs across varied
contexts. The platform also offers open and standardized interfaces, allowing
researchers to customize tasks and extend scenarios, thereby enhancing
flexibility and scalability in the evaluation process. Finally, through
empirical evaluations of several state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, we reveal their
limitations in embodied UAV tasks, underscoring the critical role of the BEDI
benchmark in advancing embodied intelligence research and model optimization.
By filling the gap in systematic and standardized evaluation within this field,
BEDI facilitates objective model comparison and lays a robust foundation for
future development in this field. Our benchmark will be released at

Motivation: 现有数据集多为人类正常驾驶行为，缺乏安全关键场景，限制了驾驶算法学习风险或失败情况的能力。

Method: 提出CrashAgent多智能体框架，解析多模态真实事故报告，生成道路布局及车辆行为，并在模拟中执行。

Result: 从布局重建准确性、碰撞率和多样性等多角度评估生成的碰撞场景，生成高质量数据集。

Conclusion: 公开数据集将支持开发更安全的驾驶算法，应对安全关键场景。

Abstract: Training and evaluating autonomous driving algorithms requires a diverse
range of scenarios. However, most available datasets predominantly consist of
normal driving behaviors demonstrated by human drivers, resulting in a limited
number of safety-critical cases. This imbalance, often referred to as a
long-tail distribution, restricts the ability of driving algorithms to learn
from crucial scenarios involving risk or failure, scenarios that are essential
for humans to develop driving skills efficiently. To generate such scenarios,
we utilize Multi-modal Large Language Models to convert crash reports of
accidents into a structured scenario format, which can be directly executed
within simulations. Specifically, we introduce CrashAgent, a multi-agent
framework designed to interpret multi-modal real-world traffic crash reports
for the generation of both road layouts and the behaviors of the ego vehicle
and surrounding traffic participants. We comprehensively evaluate the generated
crash scenarios from multiple perspectives, including the accuracy of layout
reconstruction, collision rate, and diversity. The resulting high-quality and
large-scale crash dataset will be publicly available to support the development
of safe driving algorithms in handling safety-critical situations.

*Achkan Salehi*

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于MuJoCo的开源Ballbot模拟器，展示了通过经典无模型强化学习方法训练的智能体能够有效导航随机生成的不平坦地形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Ballbot导航依赖控制理论方法，强化学习方法应用较少且局限于子任务。强化学习无需对环境动态做简化假设，且能灵活结合额外观测数据，但相关研究不足，缺乏开源模拟器。

Method: 使用MuJoCo构建开源Ballbot模拟器，通过经典无模型强化学习方法训练策略，结合外感受观测和奖励塑形。

Result: 训练的策略能在随机生成的不平坦地形中有效导航，数据效率合理（500Hz系统下4-5小时）。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在Ballbot导航中具有潜力，开源模拟器填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Ballbot (i.e. Ball balancing robot) navigation usually relies on methods
rooted in control theory (CT), and works that apply Reinforcement learning (RL)
to the problem remain rare while generally being limited to specific subtasks
(e.g. balance recovery). Unlike CT based methods, RL does not require
(simplifying) assumptions about environment dynamics (e.g. the absence of
slippage between the ball and the floor). In addition to this increased
accuracy in modeling, RL agents can easily be conditioned on additional
observations such as depth-maps without the need for explicit formulations from
first principles, leading to increased adaptivity. Despite those advantages,
there has been little to no investigation into the capabilities,
data-efficiency and limitations of RL based methods for ballbot control and
navigation. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of an open-source,
RL-friendly simulator for this task. In this paper, we present an open-source
ballbot simulation based on MuJoCo, and show that with appropriate conditioning
on exteroceptive observations as well as reward shaping, policies learned by
classical model-free RL methods are capable of effectively navigating through
randomly generated uneven terrain, using a reasonable amount of data (four to
five hours on a system operating at 500hz).

Conclusion: ICon通过嵌入身体相关特征，有效提升了机器人操作任务的策略学习效率和迁移能力。

Abstract: Learning effective visual representations for robotic manipulation remains a
fundamental challenge due to the complex body dynamics involved in action
execution. In this paper, we study how visual representations that carry
body-relevant cues can enable efficient policy learning for downstream robotic
manipulation tasks. We present $\textbf{I}$nter-token $\textbf{Con}$trast
($\textbf{ICon}$), a contrastive learning method applied to the token-level
representations of Vision Transformers (ViTs). ICon enforces a separation in
the feature space between agent-specific and environment-specific tokens,
resulting in agent-centric visual representations that embed body-specific
inductive biases. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into end-to-end
policy learning by incorporating the contrastive loss as an auxiliary
objective. Our experiments show that ICon not only improves policy performance
across various manipulation tasks but also facilitates policy transfer across
different robots. The project website: https://github.com/HenryWJL/icon

Method: 提出轨迹级强化学习框架，结合伪奖励标签和多种实现优化策略。

Conclusion: VLA-RL展示了推理扩展潜力，适用于机器人领域。

Abstract: Recent high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated
impressive performance on a range of robotic manipulation tasks by imitating
human demonstrations. However, exploiting offline data with limited visited
states will cause execution failure in out-of-distribution scenarios.
Intuitively, an exploration-based method that improves on online collected data
at test time could address this limitation. We present VLA-RL, an algorithmic
and systematic framework that leverages online reinforcement learning (RL) to
improve pretrained auto-regressive VLAs in downstream tasks. Within a unified
perspective, we first introduce a trajectory-level RL formulation for
auto-regressive VLA training, which models general robotic manipulation
trajectory as multi-modal multi-turn conversation. To address the challenge of
sparse rewards, we fine-tune a pretrained vision-language model as a robotic
process reward model, which is trained on pseudo reward labels annotated on
automatically extracted task segments. To scale up, we identify several
implementation findings that improve the stability and efficiency including
curriculum selection strategy, GPU-balanced vectorized environments, batch
decoding, and critic warmup. VLA-RL enables OpenVLA-7B to surpass the strongest
finetuned baseline by 4.5% on 40 challenging robotic manipulation tasks in
LIBERO, and even matches the performance of advanced commercial models such as
$\pi_0$-FAST. Notably, we observe that VLA-RL benefits from increased test-time
optimization, indicating an early spark of inference scaling laws in robotics.

Result: WorldEval与真实世界策略表现强相关，且显著优于现有方法如real-to-sim。

Conclusion: 世界模型可作为机器人策略评估的可靠代理，Policy2Vec和WorldEval方法有效且高效。

Abstract: The field of robotics has made significant strides toward developing
generalist robot manipulation policies. However, evaluating these policies in
real-world scenarios remains time-consuming and challenging, particularly as
the number of tasks scales and environmental conditions change. In this work,
we demonstrate that world models can serve as a scalable, reproducible, and
reliable proxy for real-world robot policy evaluation. A key challenge is
generating accurate policy videos from world models that faithfully reflect the
robot actions. We observe that directly inputting robot actions or using
high-dimensional encoding methods often fails to generate action-following
videos. To address this, we propose Policy2Vec, a simple yet effective approach
to turn a video generation model into a world simulator that follows latent
action to generate the robot video. We then introduce WorldEval, an automated
pipeline designed to evaluate real-world robot policies entirely online.
WorldEval effectively ranks various robot policies and individual checkpoints
within a single policy, and functions as a safety detector to prevent dangerous
actions by newly developed robot models. Through comprehensive paired
evaluations of manipulation policies in real-world environments, we demonstrate
a strong correlation between policy performance in WorldEval and real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, our method significantly outperforms popular methods
such as real-to-sim approach.

Result: VGER在多样化的室内外环境中能生成平滑且符合场景几何的运动。

Conclusion: VGER框架有效解决了从单张RGB图像生成无碰撞运动的难题。

Abstract: Autonomous robots typically need to construct representations of their
surroundings and adapt their motions to the geometry of their environment.
Here, we tackle the problem of constructing a policy model for collision-free
motion generation, consistent with the environment, from a single input RGB
image. Extracting 3D structures from a single image often involves monocular
depth estimation. Developments in depth estimation have given rise to large
pre-trained models such as DepthAnything. However, using outputs of these
models for downstream motion generation is challenging due to frustum-shaped
errors that arise. Instead, we propose a framework known as Video-Generation
Environment Representation (VGER), which leverages the advances of large-scale
video generation models to generate a moving camera video conditioned on the
input image. Frames of this video, which form a multiview dataset, are then
input into a pre-trained 3D foundation model to produce a dense point cloud. We
then introduce a multi-scale noise approach to train an implicit representation
of the environment structure and build a motion generation model that complies
with the geometry of the representation. We extensively evaluate VGER over a
diverse set of indoor and outdoor environments. We demonstrate its ability to
produce smooth motions that account for the captured geometry of a scene, all
from a single RGB input image.

TLDR: 论文提出MaskedManipulator，一种通过两阶段学习方法开发的统一生成策略，用于实现高层次的全身控制目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物理动画中的全身灵巧操控方法缺乏对高层次目标的通用性，限制了用户对虚拟角色和对象的直观控制。

Method: 采用两阶段学习：首先训练跟踪控制器从大规模动作捕捉数据中重建交互，然后将其提炼为MaskedManipulator策略。

Result: MaskedManipulator允许用户通过直观的高层次目标（如目标物体姿态）指定任务，并自动合成全身动作。

Conclusion: MaskedManipulator为更交互式和逼真的虚拟角色铺平了道路。

Abstract: Humans interact with their world while leveraging precise full-body control
to achieve versatile goals. This versatility allows them to solve long-horizon,
underspecified problems, such as placing a cup in a sink, by seamlessly
sequencing actions like approaching the cup, grasping, transporting it, and
finally placing it in the sink. Such goal-driven control can enable new
procedural tools for animation systems, enabling users to define partial
objectives while the system naturally ``fills in'' the intermediate motions.
However, while current methods for whole-body dexterous manipulation in
physics-based animation achieve success in specific interaction tasks, they
typically employ control paradigms (e.g., detailed kinematic motion tracking,
continuous object trajectory following, or direct VR teleoperation) that offer
limited versatility for high-level goal specification across the entire coupled
human-object system. To bridge this gap, we present MaskedManipulator, a
unified and generative policy developed through a two-stage learning approach.
First, our system trains a tracking controller to physically reconstruct
complex human-object interactions from large-scale human mocap datasets. This
tracking controller is then distilled into MaskedManipulator, which provides
users with intuitive control over both the character's body and the manipulated
object. As a result, MaskedManipulator enables users to specify complex
loco-manipulation tasks through intuitive high-level objectives (e.g., target
object poses, key character stances), and MaskedManipulator then synthesizes
the necessary full-body actions for a physically simulated humanoid to achieve
these goals, paving the way for more interactive and life-like virtual
characters.

Abstract: Controlling the flight of flapping-wing drones requires versatile controllers
that handle their time-varying, nonlinear, and underactuated dynamics from
incomplete and noisy sensor data. Model-based methods struggle with accurate
modeling, while model-free approaches falter in efficiently navigating very
high-dimensional and nonlinear control objective landscapes. This article
presents a novel hybrid model-free/model-based approach to flight control based
on the recently proposed reinforcement twinning algorithm. The model-based (MB)
approach relies on an adjoint formulation using an adaptive digital twin,
continuously identified from live trajectories, while the model-free (MF)
approach relies on reinforcement learning. The two agents collaborate through
transfer learning, imitation learning, and experience sharing using the real
environment, the digital twin and a referee. The latter selects the best agent
to interact with the real environment based on performance within the digital
twin and a real-to-virtual environment consistency ratio. The algorithm is
evaluated for controlling the longitudinal dynamics of a flapping-wing drone,
with the environment simulated as a nonlinear, time-varying dynamical system
under the influence of quasi-steady aerodynamic forces. The hybrid control
learning approach is tested with three types of initialization of the adaptive
model: (1) offline identification using previously available data, (2) random
initialization with full online identification, and (3) offline pre-training
with an estimation bias, followed by online adaptation. In all three scenarios,
the proposed hybrid learning approach demonstrates superior performance
compared to purely model-free and model-based methods.

Abstract: To address the gaps between the static pre-set "thinking-planning-action" of
humanoid robots in unfamiliar scenarios and the highly programmed "call
tool-return result" due to the lack of autonomous coding capabilities, this
work designs a dynamic architecture connecting continuous thought machines
(CTM) and model context protocol (MCP). It proposes a theoretical parallel
solution through tick-slab and uses rank compression to achieve parameter
suppression to provide a solution for achieving autonomous actions due to
autonomous coding. The researcher used a simulation-based experiment using
OpenAI's o4-mini-high as a tool to build the experimental environment, and
introduced the extended SayCan dataset to conduct nine epochs of experiments.

effective through the data results of seven metrics: task success rate (TSR),
execution success rate (ESR), average episode length (AEL), ROSCOE, REVEAL,
proficiency self-assessment (PSA), task effectiveness (TE). In practice, it
provides a reference experience for exploring the autonomous dynamic coding of
humanoid robots based on continuous thinking to achieve human-like autonomous

TLDR: DreamPolicy是一个统一框架，通过整合离线数据和扩散驱动的运动合成，实现单策略在多地形上的泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统强化学习方法在任务特定奖励和数据集利用上的局限性，提升人形机器人在多样化地形中的运动能力。

Method: 引入Humanoid Motion Imagery (HMI)，通过地形感知扩散规划器合成未来状态预测，作为动态目标指导策略。

Result: 在训练环境中平均成功率90%，在未见地形上比主流方法高20%，并能泛化到扰动和复合场景。

Conclusion: DreamPolicy通过统一离线数据、扩散合成和策略优化，突破了传统方法的局限性，为可扩展的人形控制提供了新范式。

Abstract: Humanoid locomotion faces a critical scalability challenge: traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods require task-specific rewards and struggle
to leverage growing datasets, even as more training terrains are introduced. We
propose DreamPolicy, a unified framework that enables a single policy to master
diverse terrains and generalize zero-shot to unseen scenarios by systematically
integrating offline data and diffusion-driven motion synthesis. At its core,
DreamPolicy introduces Humanoid Motion Imagery (HMI) - future state predictions
synthesized through an autoregressive terrain-aware diffusion planner curated
by aggregating rollouts from specialized policies across various distinct
terrains. Unlike human motion datasets requiring laborious retargeting, our
data directly captures humanoid kinematics, enabling the diffusion planner to
synthesize "dreamed" trajectories that encode terrain-specific physical
constraints. These trajectories act as dynamic objectives for our
HMI-conditioned policy, bypassing manual reward engineering and enabling
cross-terrain generalization. DreamPolicy addresses the scalability limitations
of prior methods: while traditional RL fails to exploit growing datasets, our
framework scales seamlessly with more offline data. As the dataset expands, the
diffusion prior learns richer locomotion skills, which the policy leverages to
master new terrains without retraining. Experiments demonstrate that
DreamPolicy achieves average 90% success rates in training environments and an
average of 20% higher success on unseen terrains than the prevalent method. It
also generalizes to perturbed and composite scenarios where prior approaches
collapse. By unifying offline data, diffusion-based trajectory synthesis, and
policy optimization, DreamPolicy overcomes the "one task, one policy"
bottleneck, establishing a paradigm for scalable, data-driven humanoid control.

Result: 实验表明，传统RL方法在持续负奖励下表现不佳，而CBF方法能有效避免危险区域并提升学习效果。

Conclusion: CBF方法为安全机器人学习提供了有效解决方案，并在仿真和实际环境中验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Safety stands as the primary obstacle preventing the widespread adoption of
learning-based robotic systems in our daily lives. While reinforcement learning
(RL) shows promise as an effective robot learning paradigm, conventional RL
frameworks often model safety by using single scalar negative rewards with
immediate episode termination, failing to capture the temporal consequences of
unsafe actions (e.g., sustained collision damage). In this work, we introduce a
novel approach that simulates these temporal effects by applying continuous
negative rewards without episode termination. Our experiments reveal that
standard RL methods struggle with this model, as the accumulated negative
values in unsafe zones create learning barriers. To address this challenge, we
demonstrate how Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), with their proven safety
guarantees, effectively help robots avoid catastrophic regions while enhancing
learning outcomes. We present three CBF-based approaches, each integrating
traditional RL methods with Control Barrier Functions, guiding the agent to
learn safe behavior. Our empirical analysis, conducted in both simulated
environments and real-world settings using a four-wheel differential drive
robot, explores the possibilities of employing these approaches for safe
robotic learning.

Abstract: Autonomous robots operating in complex, unstructured environments face
significant challenges due to latent, unobserved factors that obscure their
understanding of both their internal state and the external world. Addressing
this challenge would enable robots to develop a more profound grasp of their
operational context. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework for online
learning of hidden state representations, with which the robots can adapt in
real-time to uncertain and dynamic conditions that would otherwise be ambiguous
and result in suboptimal or erroneous behaviors. Our approach is formalized as
a Generalized Hidden Parameter Markov Decision Process, which explicitly models
the influence of unobserved parameters on both transition dynamics and reward
structures. Our core innovation lies in learning online the joint distribution
of state transitions, which serves as an expressive representation of latent
ego- and environmental-factors. This probabilistic approach supports the
identification and adaptation to different operational situations, improving
robustness and safety. Through a multivariate extension of Bayesian Online
Changepoint Detection, our method segments changes in the underlying data
generating process governing the robot's dynamics. The robot's transition model
is then informed with a symbolic representation of the current situation
derived from the joint distribution of latest state transitions, enabling
adaptive and context-aware decision-making. To showcase the real-world
effectiveness, we validate our approach in the challenging task of unstructured
terrain navigation, where unmodeled and unmeasured terrain characteristics can
significantly impact the robot's motion. Extensive experiments in both
simulation and real world reveal significant improvements in data efficiency,
policy performance, and the emergence of safer, adaptive navigation strategies.

Abstract: Developing scalable and generalizable reward engineering for reinforcement
learning (RL) is crucial for creating general-purpose agents, especially in the
challenging domain of robotic manipulation. While recent advances in reward
engineering with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise, their sparse
reward nature significantly limits sample efficiency. This paper introduces
TeViR, a novel method that leverages a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion
model to generate dense rewards by comparing the predicted image sequence with
current observations. Experimental results across 11 complex robotic tasks
demonstrate that TeViR outperforms traditional methods leveraging sparse
rewards and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving better sample
efficiency and performance without ground truth environmental rewards. TeViR's
ability to efficiently guide agents in complex environments highlights its
potential to advance reinforcement learning applications in robotic
manipulation.

Abstract: Learning unknown dynamics under environmental (or external) constraints is
fundamental to many fields (e.g., modern robotics), particularly challenging
when constraint information is only locally available and uncertain. Existing
approaches requiring global constraints or using probabilistic filtering fail
to fully exploit the geometric structure inherent in local measurements (by
using, e.g., sensors) and constraints. This paper presents a geometric
framework unifying measurements, constraints, and dynamics learning through a
fiber bundle structure over the state space. This naturally induced geometric
structure enables measurement-aware Control Barrier Functions that adapt to
local sensing (or measurement) conditions. By integrating Neural ODEs, our
framework learns continuous-time dynamics while preserving geometric
constraints, with theoretical guarantees of learning convergence and constraint
satisfaction dependent on sensing quality. The geometric framework not only
enables efficient dynamics learning but also suggests promising directions for
integration with reinforcement learning approaches. Extensive simulations
demonstrate significant improvements in both learning efficiency and constraint
satisfaction over traditional methods, especially under limited and uncertain
sensing conditions.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models in natural language processing
has substantially elevated their semantic understanding and logical reasoning
capabilities. Such proficiencies have been leveraged in autonomous driving
systems, contributing to significant improvements in system performance. Models
such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning,
an advanced cognitive method that simulates human thinking processes,
demonstrating remarkable reasoning capabilities in complex tasks. By
structuring complex driving scenarios within a systematic reasoning framework,
this approach has emerged as a prominent research focus in autonomous driving,
substantially improving the system's ability to handle challenging cases. This
paper investigates how CoT methods improve the reasoning abilities of
autonomous driving models. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we
present a systematic analysis of the motivations, methodologies, challenges,
and future research directions of CoT in autonomous driving. Furthermore, we
propose the insight of combining CoT with self-learning to facilitate
self-evolution in driving systems. To ensure the relevance and timeliness of
this study, we have compiled a dynamic repository of literature and open-source
projects, diligently updated to incorporate forefront developments. The

Abstract: Despite recent progress in general purpose robotics, robot policies still lag
far behind basic human capabilities in the real world. Humans interact
constantly with the physical world, yet this rich data resource remains largely
untapped in robot learning. We propose EgoZero, a minimal system that learns
robust manipulation policies from human demonstrations captured with Project
Aria smart glasses, $\textbf{and zero robot data}$. EgoZero enables: (1)
extraction of complete, robot-executable actions from in-the-wild, egocentric,
human demonstrations, (2) compression of human visual observations into
morphology-agnostic state representations, and (3) closed-loop policy learning
that generalizes morphologically, spatially, and semantically. We deploy
EgoZero policies on a gripper Franka Panda robot and demonstrate zero-shot
transfer with 70% success rate over 7 manipulation tasks and only 20 minutes of
data collection per task. Our results suggest that in-the-wild human data can
serve as a scalable foundation for real-world robot learning - paving the way
toward a future of abundant, diverse, and naturalistic training data for
robots. Code and videos are available at https://egozero-robot.github.io.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in radio astronomy is challenging due to the vast amounts
of data and the rarity of labeled anomalous examples. Addressing this challenge
requires efficient methods capable of identifying unusual radio galaxy
morphologies without relying on extensive supervision. This work introduces an
innovative approach to anomaly detection based on morphological characteristics
of the radio sources using trainable COSFIRE (Combination of Shifted Filter
Responses) filters as an efficient alternative to complex deep learning
methods. The framework integrates COSFIRE descriptors with an unsupervised
Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to identify unusual radio galaxy
morphologies. Evaluations on a radio galaxy benchmark data set demonstrate
strong performance, with the COSFIRE-based approach achieving a geometric mean
(G-Mean) score of 79%, surpassing the 77% achieved by a computationally
intensive deep learning autoencoder. By characterizing normal patterns and
detecting deviations, this semi-supervised methodology overcomes the need for
anomalous examples in the training set, a major limitation of traditional
supervised methods. This approach shows promise for next-generation radio
telescopes, where fast processing and the ability to discover unknown phenomena
are crucial.

Conclusion: 该方法为高维路径依赖问题提供了实用解决方案，适用于随机控制和金融领域。

Abstract: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra
integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants.
The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a
single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit
classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error
bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root
dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments confirm this rate and reveal
two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains
stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps
wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method
handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution.
These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional,
path-dependent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.

Result: 社区驱动的审核虽能扩大规模和速度，但因公众偏见和文化差异而难以完全替代专业事实核查。

Conclusion: 社区驱动的虚假信息检测是有价值的补充，但无法完全取代专业事实核查的作用。

Abstract: Social media platforms have traditionally relied on internal moderation teams
and partnerships with independent fact-checking organizations to identify and
flag misleading content. Recently, however, platforms including X (formerly
Twitter) and Meta have shifted towards community-driven content moderation by
launching their own versions of crowd-sourced fact-checking -- Community Notes.
If effectively scaled and governed, such crowd-checking initiatives have the
potential to combat misinformation with increased scale and speed as
successfully as community-driven efforts once did with spam. Nevertheless,
general content moderation, especially for misinformation, is inherently more
complex. Public perceptions of truth are often shaped by personal biases,
political leanings, and cultural contexts, complicating consensus on what
constitutes misleading content. This suggests that community efforts, while
valuable, cannot replace the indispensable role of professional fact-checkers.
Here we systemically examine the current approaches to misinformation detection
across major platforms, explore the emerging role of community-driven
moderation, and critically evaluate both the promises and challenges of
crowd-checking at scale.

Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source graphs
to unlabeled target graphs, addressing the challenge of label scarcity. In this
paper, we highlight the significance of graph homophily, a pivotal factor for
graph domain alignment, which, however, has long been overlooked in existing
approaches. Specifically, our analysis first reveals that homophily
discrepancies exist in benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that homophily
discrepancies degrade GDA performance from both empirical and theoretical
aspects, which further underscores the importance of homophily alignment in
GDA. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel homophily alignment algorithm
that employs mixed filters to smooth graph signals, thereby effectively
capturing and mitigating homophily discrepancies between graphs. Experimental
results on a variety of benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: In the past decade, several small-scale quantum key distribution networks
have been established. However, the deployment of large-scale quantum networks
depends on the development of quantum repeaters, quantum channels, quantum
memories, and quantum network protocols. To improve the security of existing
networks and adopt currently feasible quantum technologies, the next step is to
augment classical networks with quantum devices, properties, and phenomena. To
achieve this, we propose a change in the structure of the HTTP protocol such
that it can carry both quantum and classical payload. This work lays the
foundation for dividing one single network packet into classical and quantum
payloads depending on the privacy needs. We implement logistic regression, CNN,
LSTM, and BiLSTM models to classify the privacy label for outgoing
communications. This enables reduced utilization of quantum resources allowing
for a more efficient secure quantum network design. Experimental results using
the proposed methods are presented.

Abstract: Quantum-augmented networks aim to use quantum phenomena to improve detection
and protection against malicious actors in a classical communication network.
This may include multiplexing quantum signals into classical fiber optical
channels and incorporating purely quantum links alongside classical links in
the network. In such hybrid networks, quantum protocols based on single photons
become a bottleneck for transmission distances and data speeds, thereby
reducing entire network performance. Furthermore, many of the security
assumptions of the single-photon protocols do not hold up in practice because
of the impossibility of manufacturing single-photon emitters. Multi-photon
quantum protocols, on the other hand, are designed to operate under practical
assumptions and do not require single photon emitters. As a result, they
provide higher levels of security guarantees and longer transmission distances.
However, the effect of channel and device noise on multiphoton protocols in
terms of security, transmission distances, and bit rates has not been
investigated. In this paper, we focus on channel noise and present our
observations on the effect of various types of noise on multi-photon protocols.
We also investigate the effect of topologies such as ring, star, and torus on
the noise characteristics of the multi-photon protocols. Our results show the
possible advantages of switching to multi-photon protocols and give insights
into the repeater placement and topology choice for quantum-augmented networks.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly expanding field that merges the
principles of quantum computing with the techniques of machine learning. One of
the powerful mathematical frameworks in this domain is tensor networks. These
networks are used to approximate high-order tensors by contracting tensors with
lower ranks. Initially developed for simulating quantum systems, tensor
networks have become integral to quantum computing and, by extension, to QML.
Drawing inspiration from these quantum methods, specifically the Matrix Product
States (MPS), we apply them in a classical machine learning setting. Their
ability to efficiently represent and manipulate complex, high-dimensional data
makes them effective in a supervised learning framework. Here, we present an
MPS model, in which the MPS functions as both a classifier and a generator. The
dual functionality of this novel MPS model permits a strategy that enhances the
traditional training of supervised MPS models. This framework is inspired by
generative adversarial networks and is geared towards generating more realistic
samples by reducing outliers. In addition, our contributions offer insights
into the mechanics of tensor network methods for generation tasks.
Specifically, we discuss alternative embedding functions and a new sampling
method from non-normalized MPSs.

Abstract: Complex tasks are increasingly delegated to ensembles of specialized
LLM-based agents that reason, communicate, and coordinate actions-both among
themselves and through interactions with external tools, APIs, and databases.
While persistent memory has been shown to enhance single-agent performance,
most approaches assume a monolithic, single-user context-overlooking the
benefits and challenges of knowledge transfer across users under dynamic,
asymmetric permissions. We introduce Collaborative Memory, a framework for
multi-user, multi-agent environments with asymmetric, time-evolving access
controls encoded as bipartite graphs linking users, agents, and resources. Our
system maintains two memory tiers: (1) private memory-private fragments visible
only to their originating user; and (2) shared memory-selectively shared
fragments. Each fragment carries immutable provenance attributes (contributing
agents, accessed resources, and timestamps) to support retrospective permission
checks. Granular read policies enforce current user-agent-resource constraints
and project existing memory fragments into filtered transformed views. Write
policies determine fragment retention and sharing, applying context-aware
transformations to update the memory. Both policies may be designed conditioned
on system, agent, and user-level information. Our framework enables safe,
efficient, and interpretable cross-user knowledge sharing, with provable
adherence to asymmetric, time-varying policies and full auditability of memory
operations.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) decompose complex tasks and delegate subtasks to
different large language model (LLM) agents and tools. Prior studies have
reported the superior accuracy performance of MAS across diverse domains,
enabled by long-horizon context tracking and error correction through
role-specific agents. However, the design and deployment of MAS incur higher
complexity and runtime cost compared to single-agent systems (SAS). Meanwhile,
frontier LLMs, such as OpenAI-o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, have rapidly advanced in
long-context reasoning, memory retention, and tool usage, mitigating many
limitations that originally motivated MAS designs. In this paper, we conduct an
extensive empirical study comparing MAS and SAS across various popular agentic
applications. We find that the benefits of MAS over SAS diminish as LLM
capabilities improve, and we propose efficient mechanisms to pinpoint the
error-prone agent in MAS. Furthermore, the performance discrepancy between MAS
and SAS motivates our design of a hybrid agentic paradigm, request cascading
between MAS and SAS, to improve both efficiency and capability. Our design
improves accuracy by 1.1-12% while reducing deployment costs by up to 20%
across various agentic applications.

Motivation: 现有Med-LVLMs在生成医学报告时偏向预测正常结果，且对关键异常和放射学相关区域的描述不足。

Method: 提出MRGAgents框架，针对不同疾病类别训练专用智能体，使用IU X-ray和MIMIC-CXR数据集进行微调。

Result: MRGAgents在报告全面性和诊断实用性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MRGAgents有效平衡了正常与异常结果的预测，并提升了报告质量。

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have been widely adopted for
medical report generation. Despite Med-LVLMs producing state-of-the-art
performance, they exhibit a bias toward predicting all findings as normal,
leading to reports that overlook critical abnormalities. Furthermore, these
models often fail to provide comprehensive descriptions of radiologically
relevant regions necessary for accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges,
we proposeMedical Report Generation Agents (MRGAgents), a novel multi-agent
framework that fine-tunes specialized agents for different disease categories.
By curating subsets of the IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets to train
disease-specific agents, MRGAgents generates reports that more effectively
balance normal and abnormal findings while ensuring a comprehensive description
of clinically relevant regions. Our experiments demonstrate that MRGAgents
outperformed the state-of-the-art, improving both report comprehensiveness and
diagnostic utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) exhibit
remarkable problem-solving and task planning capabilities across diverse
domains due to their specialized agentic roles and collaborative interactions.
However, this also amplifies the severity of security risks under MAS attacks.
To address this, we introduce MASTER, a novel security research framework for
MAS, focusing on diverse Role configurations and Topological structures across
various scenarios. MASTER offers an automated construction process for
different MAS setups and an information-flow-based interaction paradigm. To
tackle MAS security challenges in varied scenarios, we design a
scenario-adaptive, extensible attack strategy utilizing role and topological
information, which dynamically allocates targeted, domain-specific attack tasks
for collaborative agent execution. Our experiments demonstrate that such an
attack, leveraging role and topological information, exhibits significant
destructive potential across most models. Additionally, we propose
corresponding defense strategies, substantially enhancing MAS resilience across
diverse scenarios. We anticipate that our framework and findings will provide

Motivation: 中风是全球三大死因之一，准确识别中风病灶边界对诊断和治疗至关重要。现有监督深度学习方法需要大量标注数据，而ISLES'24挑战提供了纵向影像数据以解决这一问题。

Method: 采用深度学习预处理（颅骨剥离和自定义强度窗口化）结合大型残差nnU-Net架构进行病灶分割。

Result: 该方法在测试集上的平均Dice得分为28.5，标准差为21.27。

Conclusion: 精心设计的预处理流程结合标准分割架构能有效提升中风病灶分割的准确性。

Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate
identification of stroke lesion boundaries is critical for diagnosis and
treatment. Supervised deep learning methods have emerged as the leading
solution for stroke lesion segmentation but require large, diverse, and
annotated datasets. The ISLES'24 challenge addresses this need by providing
longitudinal stroke imaging data, including CT scans taken on arrival to the
hospital and follow-up MRI taken 2-9 days from initial arrival, with
annotations derived from follow-up MRI. Importantly, models submitted to the
ISLES'24 challenge are evaluated using only CT inputs, requiring prediction of
lesion progression that may not be visible in CT scans for segmentation. Our
winning solution shows that a carefully designed preprocessing pipeline
including deep-learning-based skull stripping and custom intensity windowing is
beneficial for accurate segmentation. Combined with a standard large residual
nnU-Net architecture for segmentation, this approach achieves a mean test Dice
of 28.5 with a standard deviation of 21.27.

Motivation: 标记MRI中由于亮度变化和运动导致的光流方法误差问题需要解决。

Method: BRITE技术结合扩散概率模型和物理信息神经网络，分离解剖结构和标记模式，同时估计拉格朗日运动。

Result: BRITE在凝胶模型实验中表现出更高的运动与应变估计准确性，且对标记褪色具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BRITE是一种有效的标记MRI运动跟踪方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is an imaging technique for noninvasively
tracking tissue motion in vivo by creating a visible pattern of magnetization
saturation (tags) that deforms with the tissue. Due to longitudinal relaxation
and progression to steady-state, the tags and tissue brightnesses change over
time, which makes tracking with optical flow methods error-prone. Although
Fourier methods can alleviate these problems, they are also sensitive to
brightness changes as well as spectral spreading due to motion. To address
these problems, we introduce the brightness-invariant tracking estimation
(BRITE) technique for tagged MRI. BRITE disentangles the anatomy from the tag
pattern in the observed tagged image sequence and simultaneously estimates the
Lagrangian motion. The inherent ill-posedness of this problem is addressed by
leveraging the expressive power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models to
represent the probabilistic distribution of the underlying anatomy and the
flexibility of physics-informed neural networks to estimate
biologically-plausible motion. A set of tagged MR images of a gel phantom was
acquired with various tag periods and imaging flip angles to demonstrate the
impact of brightness variations and to validate our method. The results show
that BRITE achieves more accurate motion and strain estimates as compared to
other state of the art methods, while also being resistant to tag fading.

TLDR: 提出ReflectGAN框架，通过生成对抗网络从植被覆盖的卫星图像中重建裸土反射率，提高土壤有机碳（SOC）估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植被覆盖会干扰卫星图像中土壤反射率的提取，影响SOC估计的可靠性，因此需要一种新方法解决这一问题。

Method: 使用ReflectGAN框架学习植被覆盖与裸土反射率之间的光谱转换，基于LUCAS 2018数据集和Landsat 8图像训练模型。

Result: ReflectGAN生成的反射率输入显著提升了模型性能（如R²提高35%，RMSE降低43%），优于现有植被校正方法。

Conclusion: ReflectGAN能有效提高植被覆盖区域SOC估计的准确性，为土壤监测提供更可靠支持。

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical indicator of soil health, but its
accurate estimation from satellite imagery is hindered in vegetated regions due
to spectral contamination from plant cover, which obscures soil reflectance and
reduces model reliability. This study proposes the Reflectance Transformation
Generative Adversarial Network (ReflectGAN), a novel paired GAN-based framework
designed to reconstruct accurate bare soil reflectance from vegetated soil
satellite observations. By learning the spectral transformation between
vegetated and bare soil reflectance, ReflectGAN facilitates more precise SOC
estimation under mixed land cover conditions. Using the LUCAS 2018 dataset and
corresponding Landsat 8 imagery, we trained multiple learning-based models on
both original and ReflectGAN-reconstructed reflectance inputs. Models trained
on ReflectGAN outputs consistently outperformed those using existing vegetation
correction methods. For example, the best-performing model (RF) achieved an
$R^2$ of 0.54, RMSE of 3.95, and RPD of 2.07 when applied to the
ReflectGAN-generated signals, representing a 35\% increase in $R^2$, a 43\%
reduction in RMSE, and a 43\% improvement in RPD compared to the best existing
method (PMM-SU). The performance of the models with ReflectGAN is also better
compared to their counterparts when applied to another dataset, i.e.,
Sentinel-2 imagery. These findings demonstrate the potential of ReflectGAN to
improve SOC estimation accuracy in vegetated landscapes, supporting more
reliable soil monitoring.

Result: 分辨率从7微米/体素提升至0.44微米/体素，准确分割矿物成分，显著改善孔隙表征和矿物区分。

Conclusion: 该框架为现代地球科学成像中的主要计算限制提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: We present a memory-efficient algorithm for significantly enhancing the
quality of segmented 3D micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) images of rocks
using a generative model. The proposed model achieves a 16x increase in
resolution and corrects inaccuracies in segmentation caused by the overlapping
X-ray attenuation in micro-CT measurements across different minerals. The
generative model employed is a 3D Octree-based convolutional Wasserstein
generative adversarial network with gradient penalty. To address the challenge
of high memory consumption inherent in standard 3D convolutional layers, we
implemented an Octree structure within the 3D progressive growing generator
model. This enabled the use of memory-efficient 3D Octree-based convolutional
layers. The approach is pivotal in overcoming the long-standing memory
bottleneck in volumetric deep learning, making it possible to reach 16x
super-resolution in 3D, a scale that is challenging to attain due to cubic
memory scaling. For training, we utilized segmented 3D low-resolution micro-CT
images along with unpaired segmented complementary 2D high-resolution laser
scanning microscope images. Post-training, resolution improved from 7 to 0.44
micro-m/voxel with accurate segmentation of constituent minerals. Validated on
Berea sandstone, this framework demonstrates substantial improvements in pore
characterization and mineral differentiation, offering a robust solution to one
of the primary computational limitations in modern geoscientific imaging.

Result: 在9种成像模态和4种任务中，MedITok在30多个数据集上表现最优。

Conclusion: MedITok为自回归建模提供统一标记空间，支持广泛的临床诊断和生成式医疗应用。

Abstract: Advanced autoregressive models have reshaped multimodal AI. However, their
transformative potential in medical imaging remains largely untapped due to the
absence of a unified visual tokenizer -- one capable of capturing fine-grained
visual structures for faithful image reconstruction and realistic image
synthesis, as well as rich semantics for accurate diagnosis and image
interpretation. To this end, we present MedITok, the first unified tokenizer
tailored for medical images, encoding both low-level structural details and
high-level clinical semantics within a unified latent space. To balance these
competing objectives, we introduce a novel two-stage training framework: a
visual representation alignment stage that cold-starts the tokenizer
reconstruction learning with a visual semantic constraint, followed by a
textual semantic representation alignment stage that infuses detailed clinical
semantics into the latent space. Trained on the meticulously collected
large-scale dataset with over 30 million medical images and 2 million
image-caption pairs, MedITok achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than
30 datasets across 9 imaging modalities and 4 different tasks. By providing a
unified token space for autoregressive modeling, MedITok supports a wide range
of tasks in clinical diagnostics and generative healthcare applications. Model

TLDR: 提出了一种名为PerA的自监督学习方法，通过语义完美对齐的样本对生成通用遥感特征，提高了对比学习在遥感图像中的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比学习方法在计算机视觉任务中表现优异，但在遥感图像中因领域差异需要特定适配。

Method: 使用空间分离掩码而非随机裁剪，从增强图像中获取特征，确保语义对齐但外观不一致，并通过教师-学生一致性和可学习掩码令牌提供高质量特征。

Result: 在多个下游任务数据集上表现优异，内存效率高且支持更大批次训练。

Conclusion: PerA方法在有限模型规模下达到先进性能，为遥感图像解释提供了实用贡献。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables us to pre-train foundation models
without costly labeled data. Among SSL methods, Contrastive Learning (CL)
methods are better at obtaining accurate semantic representations in noise
interference. However, due to the significant domain gap, while CL methods have
achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, they still require
specific adaptation for Remote Sensing (RS) images. To this end, we present a
novel self-supervised method called PerA, which produces all-purpose RS
features through semantically Perfectly Aligned sample pairs. Specifically,
PerA obtains features from sampled views by applying spatially disjoint masks
to augmented images rather than random cropping. With disjoint masks, we divide
patches from different views into different parts that are semantically aligned
but inconsistent in appearance. Our framework provides high-quality features by
ensuring consistency between teacher and student and predicting learnable mask
tokens. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method demonstrates
higher memory efficiency and can be trained with larger batches due to its
sparse inputs. We also collect an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which
contains about 5 million RS images. We conducted experiments on multiple
downstream task datasets and achieved performance comparable to previous
state-of-the-art methods with a limited model scale, which verified the
superiority of our method. We hope this work will contribute to practical
remote sensing interpretation works.

Conclusion: 眼动数据在屈光度估计中具有潜力，但泛化能力仍需改进。

Abstract: Refractive errors are among the most common visual impairments globally, yet
their diagnosis often relies on active user participation and clinical
oversight. This study explores a passive method for estimating refractive power
using two eye movement recording techniques: electrooculography (EOG) and
video-based eye tracking. Using a publicly available dataset recorded under
varying diopter conditions, we trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to
classify refractive power from unimodal (EOG or eye tracking) and multimodal
configuration. We assess performance in both subject-dependent and
subject-independent settings to evaluate model personalization and
generalizability across individuals. Results show that the multimodal model
consistently outperforms unimodal models, achieving the highest average
accuracy in both settings: 96.207\% in the subject-dependent scenario and
8.882\% in the subject-independent scenario. However, generalization remains
limited, with classification accuracy only marginally above chance in the
subject-independent evaluations. Statistical comparisons in the
subject-dependent setting confirmed that the multimodal model significantly
outperformed the EOG and eye-tracking models. However, no statistically
significant differences were found in the subject-independent setting. Our
findings demonstrate both the potential and current limitations of eye movement
data-based refractive error estimation, contributing to the development of
continuous, non-invasive screening methods using EOG signals and eye-tracking
data.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to process the DIC measurements of

As such, physically consistent displacement and strain fields are obtained.
Then, we further deploy a data-driven workflow to heterogeneous material
modeling from these physically consistent DIC measurements, by estimating a
nonlocal constitutive law together with the material microstructure. To
demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we apply it in learning a
material model and fiber orientation field from DIC measurements of a porcine
tricuspid valve anterior leaflet. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DIC
data processing approach can significantly improve the accuracy of modeling
biological materials.

*Seongsu Kim,Nayoung Kim,Dongwoo Kim,Sungsoo Ahn*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TLDR: QHFlow是一种基于高阶等变流匹配的框架，通过生成条件分子几何的哈密顿矩阵，避免了传统DFT中昂贵的SCF迭代过程，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DFT方法因SCF迭代过程计算成本高，而现有深度学习方法忽略了哈密顿矩阵的结构特性，QHFlow旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出QHFlow框架，利用连续时间轨迹的流匹配方法学习哈密顿矩阵的结构分布，并结合SE(3)-等变神经网络提升对称性处理能力，同时引入微调方案优化轨道能量预测。

Result: 在MD17和QH9数据集上，哈密顿矩阵误差分别降低71%和53%，显著加速DFT过程且不牺牲解的质量。

Conclusion: QHFlow通过结合流匹配和对称性处理，实现了高效且高精度的哈密顿矩阵预测，为量子化学模拟提供了新思路。

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a fundamental method for simulating
quantum chemical properties, but it remains expensive due to the iterative
self-consistent field (SCF) process required to solve the Kohn-Sham equations.
Recently, deep learning methods are gaining attention as a way to bypass this
step by directly predicting the Hamiltonian. However, they rely on
deterministic regression and do not consider the highly structured nature of
Hamiltonians. In this work, we propose QHFlow, a high-order equivariant flow
matching framework that generates Hamiltonian matrices conditioned on molecular
geometry. Flow matching models continuous-time trajectories between simple
priors and complex targets, learning the structured distributions over
Hamiltonians instead of direct regression. To further incorporate symmetry, we
use a neural architecture that predicts SE(3)-equivariant vector fields,
improving accuracy and generalization across diverse geometries. To further
enhance physical fidelity, we additionally introduce a fine-tuning scheme to
align predicted orbital energies with the target. QHFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reducing Hamiltonian error by 71% on MD17 and 53%
on QH9. Moreover, we further show that QHFlow accelerates the DFT process
without trading off the solution quality when initializing SCF iterations with
the predicted Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the number of iterations and
runtime.

Result: 高防御强度系统更稳定，低防御环境易受攻击；识别出五种均衡状态。

Conclusion: 基于EGT的自适应网络安全策略可提升资源分配和系统韧性，降低攻击风险。

Abstract: In the evolving digital landscape, it is crucial to study the dynamics of
cyberattacks and defences. This study uses an Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)
framework to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of attacks and defences in
cyberspace. We develop a two-population asymmetric game between attacker and
defender to capture the essential factors of costs, potential benefits, and the
probability of successful defences. Through mathematical analysis and numerical
simulations, we find that systems with high defence intensities show stability
with minimal attack frequencies, whereas low-defence environments show
instability, and are vulnerable to attacks. Furthermore, we find five
equilibria, where the strategy pair always defend and attack emerged as the
most likely stable state as cyber domain is characterised by a continuous
battle between defenders and attackers. Our theoretical findings align with
real-world data from past cyber incidents, demonstrating the interdisciplinary
impact, such as fraud detection, risk management and cybersecurity
decision-making. Overall, our analysis suggests that adaptive cybersecurity
strategies based on EGT can improve resource allocation, enhance system
resilience, and reduce the overall risk of cyberattacks. By incorporating
real-world data, this study demonstrates the applicability of EGT in addressing
the evolving nature of cyber threats and the need for secure digital ecosystems
through strategic planning and proactive defence measures.

Conclusion: 通过参数化算法，论文解锁了连续委员会选举模型的潜力，提升了其实用性。

Abstract: In a recently introduced model of successive committee elections (Bredereck
et al., AAAI-20) for a given set of ordinal or approval preferences one aims to
find a sequence of a given length of "best" same-size committees such that each
candidate is a member of a limited number of consecutive committees. However,
the practical usability of this model remains limited, as the described task
turns out to be NP-hard for most selection criteria already for seeking
committees of size three. Non-trivial or somewhat efficient algorithms for
these cases are lacking too. Motivated by a desire to unlock the full potential
of the described temporal model of committee elections, we devise
(parameterized) algorithms that effectively solve the mentioned hard cases in
realistic scenarios of a moderate number of candidates or of a limited time
horizon.

Abstract: Human-annotated data plays a vital role in training large language models
(LLMs), such as supervised fine-tuning and human preference alignment. However,
it is not guaranteed that paid human annotators produce high-quality data. In
this paper, we study how to incentivize human annotators to do so. We start
from a principal-agent model to model the dynamics between the company (the
principal) and the annotator (the agent), where the principal can only monitor
the annotation quality by examining $n$ samples. We investigate the maximum
likelihood estimators (MLE) and the corresponding hypothesis testing to
incentivize annotators: the agent is given a bonus if the MLE passes the test.
By analyzing the variance of the outcome, we show that the strategic behavior
of the agent makes the hypothesis testing very different from traditional ones:
Unlike the exponential rate proved by the large deviation theory, the
principal-agent model's hypothesis testing rate is of $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n \log
n})$. Our theory implies two criteria for the \emph{golden questions} to
monitor the performance of the annotators: they should be of (1) high certainty
and (2) similar format to normal ones. In that light, we select a set of golden
questions in human preference data. By doing incentive-compatible experiments,
we find out that the annotators' behavior is better revealed by those golden
questions, compared to traditional survey techniques such as instructed
manipulation checks.

Main category: cs.GT

TLDR: 本文研究了重球动量（HB）在极小极大博弈中的作用，发现较小的动量能增强算法稳定性并引导轨迹至损失函数的较平缓区域，与极小化问题中的现象相反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重球动量在极小化问题中被广泛研究，但在极小极大博弈中的作用尚未深入探索，限制了如Adam等算法的有效性。

Method: 通过连续时间分析，研究了HB在极小极大博弈中的同步和交替更新方案，并分析了动量的局部和全局影响。

Result: 较小的动量增强了算法稳定性，交替更新收敛更快；全局上，小动量引导轨迹至损失函数的平缓区域。

Conclusion: HB在极小极大博弈中的作用与极小化问题有根本差异，数值实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Since Polyak's pioneering work, heavy ball (HB) momentum has been widely
studied in minimization. However, its role in min-max games remains largely
unexplored. As a key component of practical min-max algorithms like Adam, this
gap limits their effectiveness. In this paper, we present a continuous-time
analysis for HB with simultaneous and alternating update schemes in min-max
games. Locally, we prove smaller momentum enhances algorithmic stability by
enabling local convergence across a wider range of step sizes, with alternating
updates generally converging faster. Globally, we study the implicit
regularization of HB, and find smaller momentum guides algorithms trajectories
towards shallower slope regions of the loss landscapes, with alternating
updates amplifying this effect. Surprisingly, all these phenomena differ from
those observed in minimization, where larger momentum yields similar effects.
Our results reveal fundamental differences between HB in min-max games and
minimization, and numerical experiments further validate our theoretical
results.

Motivation: 触觉感知在神经科学和人工智能中的研究相对滞后，作者希望通过新框架填补这一空白。

Method: 使用定制的啮齿动物触须阵列模拟器生成触觉输入序列，并训练EAD模型，重点比较了不同编码架构的性能。

Result: ConvRNN编码器在触觉分类中表现最优，其神经表征与啮齿动物体感皮层高度匹配，且自监督学习模型也能达到类似效果。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了非线性循环处理在触觉表征中的重要性，为神经科学和人工智能提供了新的工具和方法。

Abstract: Tactile sensing remains far less understood in neuroscience and less
effective in artificial systems compared to more mature modalities such as
vision and language. We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel
Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of
task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input
sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify
convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to
purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization.
Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural
representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the
explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship
between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment.
Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained
with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as
an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy.
  For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as
important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex,
providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive
biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of
recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with
tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile
perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured
environments.

Method: 使用单模态和多模态模型（跨模态和联合预训练）分析fMRI数据，研究模型与脑活动的对齐性。

Result: 多模态模型在语言和视觉区域对齐性更强，且多模态信息处理涉及额外信息。跨模态模型的对齐性部分归因于视频模态，联合预训练模型则归因于视频和音频模态。

Conclusion: 多模态模型为研究大脑多模态信息处理提供了新视角，推动神经科学社区探索模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Despite participants engaging in unimodal stimuli, such as watching images or
silent videos, recent work has demonstrated that multi-modal Transformer models
can predict visual brain activity impressively well, even with incongruent
modality representations. This raises the question of how accurately these
multi-modal models can predict brain activity when participants are engaged in
multi-modal stimuli. As these models grow increasingly popular, their use in
studying neural activity provides insights into how our brains respond to such
multi-modal naturalistic stimuli, i.e., where it separates and integrates
information across modalities through a hierarchy of early sensory regions to
higher cognition. We investigate this question by using multiple unimodal and
two types of multi-modal models-cross-modal and jointly pretrained-to determine
which type of model is more relevant to fMRI brain activity when participants
are engaged in watching movies. We observe that both types of multi-modal
models show improved alignment in several language and visual regions. This
study also helps in identifying which brain regions process unimodal versus
multi-modal information. We further investigate the contribution of each
modality to multi-modal alignment by carefully removing unimodal features one
by one from multi-modal representations, and find that there is additional
information beyond the unimodal embeddings that is processed in the visual and
language regions. Based on this investigation, we find that while for
cross-modal models, their brain alignment is partially attributed to the video
modality; for jointly pretrained models, it is partially attributed to both the
video and audio modalities. This serves as a strong motivation for the
neuroscience community to investigate the interpretability of these models for
deepening our understanding of multi-modal information processing in brain.

Conclusion: 增强MLLMs捕捉任务特定信息的能力可提高其对不同指令的区分度，从而更精准预测大脑响应。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models, though not explicitly trained to mimic
brain recordings, have demonstrated surprising alignment with brain activity.
Progress in these models-through increased size, instruction-tuning, and
multimodality-has led to better representational alignment with neural data.
Recently, a new class of instruction-tuned multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have
emerged, showing remarkable zero-shot capabilities in open-ended multimodal
vision tasks. However, it is unknown whether MLLMs, when prompted with natural
instructions, lead to better brain alignment and effectively capture
instruction-specific representations. To address this, we first investigate
brain alignment, i.e., measuring the degree of predictivity of neural visual
activity using text output response embeddings from MLLMs as participants
engage in watching natural scenes. Experiments with 10 different instructions
show that MLLMs exhibit significantly better brain alignment than vision-only
models and perform comparably to non-instruction-tuned multimodal models like
CLIP. We also find that while these MLLMs are effective at generating
high-quality responses suitable to the task-specific instructions, not all
instructions are relevant for brain alignment. Further, by varying
instructions, we make the MLLMs encode instruction-specific visual concepts
related to the input image. This analysis shows that MLLMs effectively capture
count-related and recognition-related concepts, demonstrating strong alignment
with brain activity. Notably, the majority of the explained variance of the
brain encoding models is shared between MLLM embeddings of image captioning and
other instructions. These results suggest that enhancing MLLMs' ability to
capture task-specific information could lead to better differentiation between
various types of instructions, and thereby improving their precision in
predicting brain responses.

Motivation: 无线信号的广播特性使其易受高斯噪声和未知干扰的影响，扩散模型能否有效消除干扰成为研究动机。

Method: 将干扰消除问题建模为MAP问题，开发ICDM模型分解联合后验概率，学习梯度并通过数值迭代实现快速干扰消除。

Result: 实验表明，ICDM显著降低MSE并提升感知质量，例如在CelebA数据集上MSE降低4.54 dB，LPIPS提升2.47 dB。

Conclusion: ICDM通过扩散模型和梯度学习，为无线语义通信系统提供了高效干扰消除方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved significant success in wireless
communications systems due to their denoising capabilities. The broadcast
nature of wireless signals makes them susceptible not only to Gaussian noise,
but also to unaware interference. This raises the question of whether DMs can
effectively mitigate interference in wireless semantic communication systems.
In this paper, we model the interference cancellation problem as a maximum a
posteriori (MAP) problem over the joint posterior probability of the signal and
interference, and theoretically prove that the solution provides excellent
estimates for the signal and interference. To solve this problem, we develop an
interference cancellation diffusion model (ICDM), which decomposes the joint
posterior into independent prior probabilities of the signal and interference,
along with the channel transition probablity. The log-gradients of these
distributions at each time step are learned separately by DMs and accurately
estimated through deriving. ICDM further integrates these gradients with
advanced numerical iteration method, achieving accurate and rapid interference
cancellation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICDM significantly reduces
the mean square error (MSE) and enhances perceptual quality compared to schemes
without ICDM. For example, on the CelebA dataset under the Rayleigh fading
channel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $20$ dB and signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of 0 dB, ICDM reduces the MSE by 4.54 dB
and improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) by 2.47 dB.

Abstract: Model-based clustering integrated with variable selection is a powerful tool
for uncovering latent structures within complex data. However, its
effectiveness is often hindered by challenges such as identifying relevant
variables that define heterogeneous subgroups and handling data that are
missing not at random, a prevalent issue in fields like transcriptomics. While
several notable methods have been proposed to address these problems, they
typically tackle each issue in isolation, thereby limiting their flexibility
and adaptability. This paper introduces a unified framework designed to address
these challenges simultaneously. Our approach incorporates a data-driven
penalty matrix into penalized clustering to enable more flexible variable
selection, along with a mechanism that explicitly models the relationship
between missingness and latent class membership. We demonstrate that, under
certain regularity conditions, the proposed framework achieves both asymptotic
consistency and selection consistency, even in the presence of missing data.
This unified strategy significantly enhances the capability and efficiency of
model-based clustering, advancing methodologies for identifying informative
variables that define homogeneous subgroups in the presence of complex missing
data patterns. The performance of the framework, including its computational
efficiency, is evaluated through simulations and demonstrated using both
synthetic and real-world transcriptomic datasets.

Result: 统计学在LLMs的研究中具有关键作用，尤其在处理不确定性和复杂性方面。

Conclusion: 统计学研究将形成多样化的专题，统计学界应积极参与LLMs研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) represent a new paradigm for processing
unstructured data, with applications across an unprecedented range of domains.
In this paper, we address, through two arguments, whether the development and
application of LLMs would genuinely benefit from foundational contributions
from the statistics discipline. First, we argue affirmatively, beginning with
the observation that LLMs are inherently statistical models due to their
profound data dependency and stochastic generation processes, where statistical
insights are naturally essential for handling variability and uncertainty.
Second, we argue that the persistent black-box nature of LLMs -- stemming from
their immense scale, architectural complexity, and development practices often
prioritizing empirical performance over theoretical interpretability -- renders
closed-form or purely mechanistic analyses generally intractable, thereby
necessitating statistical approaches due to their flexibility and often
demonstrated effectiveness. To substantiate these arguments, the paper outlines
several research areas -- including alignment, watermarking, uncertainty
quantification, evaluation, and data mixture optimization -- where statistical
methodologies are critically needed and are already beginning to make valuable
contributions. We conclude with a discussion suggesting that statistical
research concerning LLMs will likely form a diverse ``mosaic'' of specialized
topics rather than deriving from a single unifying theory, and highlighting the
importance of timely engagement by our statistics community in LLM research.

Conclusion: cellRCov方法有效解决了高维数据中的稳健协方差估计问题，并展示了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The sample covariance matrix is a cornerstone of multivariate statistics, but
it is highly sensitive to outliers. These can be casewise outliers, such as
cases belonging to a different population, or cellwise outliers, which are
deviating cells (entries) of the data matrix. Recently some robust covariance
estimators have been developed that can handle both types of outliers, but
their computation is only feasible up to at most 20 dimensions. To remedy this
we propose the cellRCov method, a robust covariance estimator that
simultaneously handles casewise outliers, cellwise outliers, and missing data.
It relies on a decomposition of the covariance on principal and orthogonal
subspaces, leveraging recent work on robust PCA. It also employs a ridge-type
regularization to stabilize the estimated covariance matrix. We establish some
theoretical properties of cellRCov, including its casewise and cellwise
influence functions as well as consistency and asymptotic normality. A
simulation study demonstrates the superior performance of cellRCov in
contaminated and missing data scenarios. Furthermore, its practical utility is
illustrated in a real-world application to anomaly detection. We also construct
and illustrate the cellRCCA method for robust and regularized canonical
correlation analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized algorithm development, yet
their application in symbolic regression, where algorithms automatically
discover symbolic expressions from data, remains constrained and is typically
designed manually by human experts. In this paper, we propose a
learning-to-evolve framework that enables LLMs to automatically design
selection operators for evolutionary symbolic regression algorithms. We first
identify two key limitations in existing LLM-based algorithm evolution
techniques: code bloat and a lack of semantic guidance. Bloat results in
unnecessarily complex components, and the absence of semantic awareness can
lead to ineffective exchange of useful code components, both of which can
reduce the interpretability of the designed algorithm or hinder evolutionary
learning progress. To address these issues, we enhance the LLM-based evolution
framework for meta symbolic regression with two key innovations: bloat control
and a complementary, semantics-aware selection operator. Additionally, we embed
domain knowledge into the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate more effective
and contextually relevant selection operators. Our experimental results on
symbolic regression benchmarks show that LLMs can devise selection operators
that outperform nine expert-designed baselines, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. This demonstrates that LLMs can exceed expert-level algorithm
design for symbolic regression.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在特定攻击下的漏洞，呼吁加强防护措施，尤其是在敏感领域。

Abstract: Despite their staggering capabilities as assistant tools, often exceeding
human performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) are still prone to jailbreak
attempts from malevolent users. Although red teaming practices have already
identified and helped to address several such jailbreak techniques, one
particular sturdy approach involving role-playing (which we named `Goofy Game')
seems effective against most of the current LLMs safeguards. This can result in
the provision of unsafe content, which, although not harmful per se, might lead
to dangerous consequences if delivered in a setting such as the medical domain.
In this preliminary and exploratory study, we provide an initial analysis of
how, even without technical knowledge of the internal architecture and
parameters of generative AI models, a malicious user could construct a
role-playing prompt capable of coercing an LLM into producing incorrect (and
potentially harmful) clinical suggestions. We aim to illustrate a specific
vulnerability scenario, providing insights that can support future advancements
in the field.

Abstract: AI Data Readiness Inspector (AIDRIN) is a framework to evaluate and improve
data preparedness for AI applications. It addresses critical data readiness
dimensions such as data quality, bias, fairness, and privacy. This paper
details enhancements to AIDRIN by focusing on user interface improvements and
integration with a privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) framework. By
refining the UI and enabling smooth integration with decentralized AI
pipelines, AIDRIN becomes more accessible and practical for users with varying
technical expertise. Integrating with an existing PPFL framework ensures that
data readiness and privacy are prioritized in federated learning environments.
A case study involving a real-world dataset demonstrates AIDRIN's practical
value in identifying data readiness issues that impact AI model performance.

*Smitha Kumar,Michael A. Lones,Manuel Maarek,Hind Zantout*

Main category: cs.CY

TLDR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在机器学习教育中的应用，发现其在识别代码常见错误和提供学习反馈方面存在局限性，尤其是早期ML流程中的信息泄露和模型选择问题。尽管存在不足，LLMs在成功识别错误时能提供有用指导，且开源与闭源模型差距较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在机器学习教育中的潜力，特别是识别代码错误和提供学习反馈的能力。

Method: 使用四种LLMs（一种闭源，三种开源）分析代码样本，评估其识别常见错误和提供反馈的能力。

Result: LLMs能识别基础错误，但对早期流程中的信息泄露和模型选择问题表现不佳。成功识别时，反馈内容有用。开源与闭源模型差距较小。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在支持机器学习教育方面存在局限性，但仍有潜力。开源模型因其效率和数据隐私优势，适合教育场景。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues
in education. This study examines the use of LLMs in supporting learning in
machine learning education; in particular, it focuses on the ability of LLMs to
identify common errors of practice (pitfalls) in machine learning code, and
their ability to provide feedback that can guide learning. Using a portfolio of
code samples, we consider four different LLMs: one closed model and three open
models. Whilst the most basic pitfalls are readily identified by all models,
many common pitfalls are not. They particularly struggle to identify pitfalls
in the early stages of the ML pipeline, especially those which can lead to
information leaks, a major source of failure within applied ML projects. They
also exhibit limited success at identifying pitfalls around model selection,
which is a concept that students often struggle with when first transitioning
from theory to practice. This questions the use of current LLMs to support
machine learning education, and also raises important questions about their use
by novice practitioners. Nevertheless, when LLMs successfully identify pitfalls
in code, they do provide feedback that includes advice on how to proceed,
emphasising their potential role in guiding learners. We also compare the
capability of closed and open LLM models, and find that the gap is relatively
small given the large difference in model sizes. This presents an opportunity
to deploy, and potentially customise, smaller more efficient LLM models within
education, avoiding risks around cost and data sharing associated with
commercial models.

Motivation: 整合分散的文献，概述GeoAI中的偏见，并分析欧盟AI法案如何规范高风险的GeoAI系统。

Result: 发现广泛部署的GeoAI应用属于高风险系统，并提出了检测偏见的具体方法。

Conclusion: 建议在2027年前对欧洲数据集进行常规偏见审计，以符合欧盟AI法案的要求。

Abstract: Bias in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) models has been
documented, yet the evidence is scattered across narrowly focused studies. We
synthesize this fragmented literature to provide a concise overview of bias in
GeoAI and examine how the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) shapes
audit obligations. We discuss recurring bias mechanisms, including
representation, algorithmic and aggregation bias, and map them to specific
provisions of the EU AI Act. By applying the Act's high-risk criteria, we
demonstrate that widely deployed GeoAI applications qualify as high-risk
systems. We then present examples of recent audits along with an outline of
practical methods for detecting bias. As far as we know, this study represents
the first integration of GeoAI bias evidence into the EU AI Act context, by
identifying high-risk GeoAI systems and mapping bias mechanisms to the Act's
Articles. Although the analysis is exploratory, it suggests that even
well-curated European datasets should employ routine bias audits before 2027,
when the AI Act's high-risk provisions take full effect.

Result: AI-LAWS可能引发意外升级、可靠性问题和人类监督缺失，需技术驱动的监管。

Conclusion: AI研究者应参与监管生命周期，技术定义和政策建议是解决AI-LAWS风险的关键。

Abstract: Military weapon systems and command-and-control infrastructure augmented by
artificial intelligence (AI) have seen rapid development and deployment in
recent years. However, the sociotechnical impacts of AI on combat systems,
military decision-making, and the norms of warfare have been understudied. We
focus on a specific subset of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) that use
AI for targeting or battlefield decisions. We refer to this subset as
AI-powered lethal autonomous weapon systems (AI-LAWS) and argue that they
introduce novel risks -- including unanticipated escalation, poor reliability
in unfamiliar environments, and erosion of human oversight -- all of which
threaten both military effectiveness and the openness of AI research. These
risks cannot be addressed by high-level policy alone; effective regulation must
be grounded in the technical behavior of AI models. We argue that AI
researchers must be involved throughout the regulatory lifecycle. Thus, we
propose a clear, behavior-based definition of AI-LAWS -- systems that introduce
unique risks through their use of modern AI -- as a foundation for technically
grounded regulation, given that existing frameworks do not distinguish them
from conventional LAWS. Using this definition, we propose several
technically-informed policy directions and invite greater participation from
the AI research community in military AI policy discussions.

Conclusion: 提出了解决方案和未来研究方向，并指出公开数据不足的困难。

Abstract: Climate implications of rapidly developing digital technologies, such as
blockchains and the associated crypto mining and NFT minting, have been well
documented and their massive GPU energy use has been identified as a cause for
concern. However, we postulate that due to their more mainstream consumer
appeal, the GPU use of text-prompt based diffusion AI art systems also requires
thoughtful considerations. Given the recent explosion in the number of highly
sophisticated generative art systems and their rapid adoption by consumers and
creative professionals, the impact of these systems on the climate needs to be
carefully considered. In this work, we report on the growth of diffusion-based
visual AI systems, their patterns of use, growth and the implications on the
climate. Our estimates show that the mass adoption of these tools potentially
contributes considerably to global energy consumption. We end this paper with
our thoughts on solutions and future areas of inquiry as well as associated
difficulties, including the lack of publicly available data.

Abstract: Conventional AI evaluation approaches concentrated within the AI stack
exhibit systemic limitations for exploring, navigating and resolving the human
and societal factors that play out in real world deployment such as in
education, finance, healthcare, and employment sectors. AI capability
evaluations can capture detail about first-order effects, such as whether
immediate system outputs are accurate, or contain toxic, biased or
stereotypical content, but AI's second-order effects, i.e. any long-term
outcomes and consequences that may result from AI use in the real world, have
become a significant area of interest as the technology becomes embedded in our
daily lives. These secondary effects can include shifts in user behavior,
societal, cultural and economic ramifications, workforce transformations, and
long-term downstream impacts that may result from a broad and growing set of
risks. This position paper argues that measuring the indirect and secondary
effects of AI will require expansion beyond static, single-turn approaches
conducted in silico to include testing paradigms that can capture what actually
materializes when people use AI technology in context. Specifically, we
describe the need for data and methods that can facilitate contextual awareness
and enable downstream interpretation and decision making about AI's secondary
effects, and recommend requirements for a new ecosystem.

Motivation: 揭示LLM中的偏见如何反映社会的隐性规则，特别是科学评审中的隐藏因素，以促进批判性讨论。

Method: 通过LLM生成自洽假设，分析45个计算机科学会议的论文配对，揭示评审中的隐性启发式方法。

Result: LLM的规范性先验（如理论严谨性）逐渐转向强调外部连接（如文献定位），揭示科学评审中隐性奖励的叙事因素。

Conclusion: 该框架可广泛用于揭示社会隐性规则，促进负责任AI的发展。

Abstract: This paper calls on the research community not only to investigate how human
biases are inherited by large language models (LLMs) but also to explore how
these biases in LLMs can be leveraged to make society's "unwritten code" - such
as implicit stereotypes and heuristics - visible and accessible for critique.
We introduce a conceptual framework through a case study in science: uncovering
hidden rules in peer review - the factors that reviewers care about but rarely
state explicitly due to normative scientific expectations. The idea of the
framework is to push LLMs to speak out their heuristics through generating
self-consistent hypotheses - why one paper appeared stronger in reviewer
scoring - among paired papers submitted to 45 computer science conferences,
while iteratively searching deeper hypotheses from remaining pairs where
existing hypotheses cannot explain. We observed that LLMs' normative priors
about the internal characteristics of good science extracted from their
self-talk, e.g. theoretical rigor, were systematically updated toward
posteriors that emphasize storytelling about external connections, such as how
the work is positioned and connected within and across literatures. This shift
reveals the primacy of scientific myths about intrinsic properties driving
scientific excellence rather than extrinsic contextualization and storytelling
that influence conceptions of relevance and significance. Human reviewers tend
to explicitly reward aspects that moderately align with LLMs' normative priors
(correlation = 0.49) but avoid articulating contextualization and storytelling
posteriors in their review comments (correlation = -0.14), despite giving
implicit reward to them with positive scores. We discuss the broad
applicability of the framework, leveraging LLMs as diagnostic tools to surface
the tacit codes underlying human society, enabling more precisely targeted
responsible AI.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在政治共识达成中的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建EuroCon基准，模拟议会场景，评估LLMs生成的决议是否符合政治目标。

Result: 现有模型在复杂任务（如三分之二多数通过决议）中表现不佳，但展示了某些共识策略。

Conclusion: EuroCon是研究LLMs政治共识能力的有效平台。

Abstract: Achieving political consensus is crucial yet challenging for the effective
functioning of social governance. However, although frontier AI systems
represented by large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent
years, their capabilities on this scope are still understudied. In this paper,
we introduce EuroCon, a novel benchmark constructed from 2,225 high-quality
deliberation records of the European Parliament over 13 years, ranging from
2009 to 2022, to evaluate the ability of LLMs to reach political consensus
among divergent party positions across diverse parliament settings.
Specifically, EuroCon incorporates four factors to build each simulated
parliament setting: specific political issues, political goals, participating
parties, and power structures based on seat distribution. We also develop an
evaluation framework for EuroCon to simulate real voting outcomes in different
parliament settings, assessing whether LLM-generated resolutions meet
predefined political goals. Our experimental results demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art models remain undersatisfied with complex tasks like passing
resolutions by a two-thirds majority and addressing security issues, while
revealing some common strategies LLMs use to find consensus under different
power structures, such as prioritizing the stance of the dominant party,
highlighting EuroCon's promise as an effective platform for studying LLMs'
ability to find political consensus.

Result: 揭示了LLM与数据管理的紧密联系，展示了双方如何相互促进，并提出了未来的研究方向。

Conclusion: LLM与数据管理的结合为两个领域带来了新的机遇和挑战，未来需要进一步探索其协同潜力。

Abstract: The integration of large language model (LLM) and data management (DATA) is
rapidly redefining both domains. In this survey, we comprehensively review the
bidirectional relationships. On the one hand, DATA4LLM, spanning large-scale
data processing, storage, and serving, feeds LLMs with high quality, diversity,
and timeliness of data required for stages like pre-training, post-training,
retrieval-augmented generation, and agentic workflows: (i) Data processing for
LLMs includes scalable acquisition, deduplication, filtering, selection, domain
mixing, and synthetic augmentation; (ii) Data Storage for LLMs focuses on
efficient data and model formats, distributed and heterogeneous storage
hierarchies, KV-cache management, and fault-tolerant checkpointing; (iii) Data
serving for LLMs tackles challenges in RAG (e.g., knowledge post-processing),
LLM inference (e.g., prompt compression, data provenance), and training
strategies (e.g., data packing and shuffling). On the other hand, in LLM4DATA,
LLMs are emerging as general-purpose engines for data management. We review
recent advances in (i) data manipulation, including automatic data cleaning,
integration, discovery; (ii) data analysis, covering reasoning over structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data, and (iii) system optimization (e.g.,
configuration tuning, query rewriting, anomaly diagnosis), powered by LLM
techniques like retrieval-augmented prompting, task-specialized fine-tuning,
and multi-agent collaboration.

Result: ODIN将生成正确SQL查询的概率提高了1.5-2倍。

Conclusion: ODIN通过解决模式歧义问题，显著提升了NL2SQL系统的实用性。

Abstract: NL2SQL (natural language to SQL) systems translate natural language into SQL
queries, allowing users with no technical background to interact with databases
and create tools like reports or visualizations. While recent advancements in
large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved NL2SQL accuracy,
schema ambiguity remains a major challenge in enterprise environments with
complex schemas, where multiple tables and columns with semantically similar
names often co-exist. To address schema ambiguity, we introduce ODIN, a NL2SQL
recommendation engine. Instead of producing a single SQL query given a natural
language question, ODIN generates a set of potential SQL queries by accounting
for different interpretations of ambiguous schema components. ODIN dynamically
adjusts the number of suggestions based on the level of ambiguity, and ODIN
learns from user feedback to personalize future SQL query recommendations. Our
evaluation shows that ODIN improves the likelihood of generating the correct
SQL query by 1.5-2$\times$ compared to baselines.

Motivation: 现有研究在降低充电成本的同时忽略了充电管理对各种不确定性（如充电行为变化和充电器故障）的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用MARL方法，将每个充电器视为智能体，并结合LSTM网络提取时间序列特征，设计密集奖励机制优化训练。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，该方法能有效应对系统不确定性和故障，同时降低充电成本并提升服务满意度。

Conclusion: 该方法为智能城市中电动汽车充电站的鲁棒能源管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the pursuit of energy net zero within smart cities, transportation
electrification plays a pivotal role. The adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs)
keeps increasing, making energy management of EV charging stations critically
important. While previous studies have managed to reduce energy cost of EV
charging while maintaining grid stability, they often overlook the robustness
of EV charging management against uncertainties of various forms, such as
varying charging behaviors and possible faults in faults in some chargers. To
address the gap, a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach is
proposed treating each charger to be an agent and coordinate all the agents in
the EV charging station with solar photovoltaics in a more realistic scenario,
where system faults may occur. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is
incorporated in the MARL algorithm to extract temporal features from
time-series. Additionally, a dense reward mechanism is designed for training
the agents in the MARL algorithm to improve EV charging experience. Through
validation on a real-world dataset, we show that our approach is robust against
system uncertainties and faults and also effective in minimizing EV charging
costs and maximizing charging service satisfaction.

Conclusion: 通过实例验证了方法的有效性，为复杂非线性系统的鲁棒性分析提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of the Lur'e problem under positivity
constraints, drawing on results from the positive Aizerman conjecture and the
robustness properties of Metzler matrices. Specifically, we consider a control
system of Lur'e type in which not only the linear part includes parametric
uncertainty but also the nonlinear sector bound is unknown. We investigate
tools from positive linear systems to effectively solve the problems in
complicated and uncertain nonlinear systems. By leveraging the positivity
characteristic of the system, we derive an explicit formula for the stability
radius of Lur'e systems. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to systems with
neural network (NN) feedback loops. Building on this approach, we also propose
a refinement method for sector bounds of feedforward neural networks (FFNNs).
This study introduces a scalable and efficient approach for robustness analysis
of both Lur'e and NN-controlled systems. Finally, the proposed results are
supported by illustrative examples.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通信号控制方法难以应对复杂、动态和安全性要求高的场景，需要一种更通用且安全的解决方案。

Method: VLMLight整合了基于图像的交通模拟器和大型语言模型（LLM），通过双分支策略（快速RL策略和结构化推理分支）实现高效与安全的平衡。

Result: 实验表明，VLMLight将紧急车辆等待时间减少65%，且在标准条件下实时性能仅下降不到1%。

Conclusion: VLMLight为下一代交通信号控制提供了可扩展、可解释且安全感知的解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is a core challenge in urban mobility, where
real-time decisions must balance efficiency and safety. Existing methods -
ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often
struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We
introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language
meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first
image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at
intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type,
motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a
safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for
routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the
latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize
emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight
reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems,
while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1%
degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware
solution for next-generation traffic signal control.

Conclusion: Alpay代数为未来具有稳定自引用行为的AI系统提供了数学基础，连接了范畴论、身份逻辑和观察者动态。

Abstract: This paper introduces a formal framework for modeling observer-dependent
collapse dynamics and temporal identity drift within artificial and
mathematical systems, grounded entirely in the symbolic foundations of Alpay
Algebra. Building upon the fixed-point emergence structures developed in Alpay
Algebra I and II, this third installment formalizes the observer-coupled
{\phi}-collapse process through transfinite categorical flows and
curvature-driven identity operators. We define a novel temporal drift mechanism
as a recursive deformation of identity signatures under entangled observer
influence, constructing categorical invariants that evolve across fold
iterations. The proposed system surpasses conventional identity modeling in
explainable AI (XAI) by encoding internal transformation history into a
symbolic fixed-point structure, offering provable traceability and temporal

logic systems where identity is not static but dynamically induced by
observation. The theoretical results also offer a mathematically rigorous basis
for future AI systems with stable self-referential behavior, positioning Alpay
Algebra as a next-generation symbolic framework bridging category theory,
identity logic, and observer dynamics.

Motivation: 弯曲射电AGN对研究星系团动力学和AGN物理至关重要，但缺乏专门的数据集和基准。

Method: 基于知名射电天文调查构建数据集，评估了CNN和基于Transformer的模型。

Result: ConvNeXT模型在NAT和WAT分类中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 共享数据集和基准以推动AGN分类和星系演化研究。

Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning dataset tailored for the classification
of bent radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) in astronomical observations. Bent
radio AGN, distinguished by their curved jet structures, provide critical
insights into galaxy cluster dynamics, interactions within the intracluster
medium, and the broader physics of AGN. Despite their astrophysical
significance, the classification of bent radio AGN remains a challenge due to
the scarcity of specialized datasets and benchmarks. To address this, we
present a dataset, derived from a well-recognized radio astronomy survey, that
is designed to support the classification of NAT (Narrow-Angle Tail) and WAT
(Wide-Angle Tail) categories, along with detailed data processing steps. We
further evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models on
the dataset, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and
transformer-based architectures. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
advanced machine learning models in classifying bent radio AGN, with ConvNeXT
achieving the highest F1-scores for both NAT and WAT sources. By sharing this
dataset and benchmarks, we aim to facilitate the advancement of research in AGN
classification, galaxy cluster environments and galaxy evolution.

Main category: cs.IR

TLDR: 将意图分类问题转化为查询相似性搜索问题，以解决低资源语言中意图定义和标注数据困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前意图分类方法在低资源语言中面临意图定义困难和标注数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 通过查询相似性搜索，利用已有查询示例定义意图，并在潜在空间中对新查询进行分类。

Result: 在零样本设置下，对低资源语言的查询实现了合理的意图分类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言中的意图分类提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Intent classification is an important component of a functional Information
Retrieval ecosystem. Many current approaches to intent classification,
typically framed as a classification problem, can be problematic as intents are
often hard to define and thus data can be difficult and expensive to annotate.
The problem is exacerbated when we need to extend the intent classification
system to support multiple and in particular low-resource languages. To address
this, we propose casting intent classification as a query similarity search
problem - we use previous example queries to define an intent, and a query
similarity method to classify an incoming query based on the labels of its most
similar queries in latent space. With the proposed approach, we are able to
achieve reasonable intent classification performance for queries in
low-resource languages in a zero-shot setting.

Result: 在专有企业语料库中，MRR@3和MRR@10分别提升15%和19%，并在公开数据集上验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，适用于实际企业应用。

Abstract: Enterprise search systems often struggle to retrieve accurate,
domain-specific information due to semantic mismatches and overlapping
terminologies. These issues can degrade the performance of downstream
applications such as knowledge management, customer support, and
retrieval-augmented generation agents. To address this challenge, we propose a
scalable hard-negative mining framework tailored specifically for
domain-specific enterprise data. Our approach dynamically selects semantically
challenging but contextually irrelevant documents to enhance deployed
re-ranking models.
  Our method integrates diverse embedding models, performs dimensionality
reduction, and uniquely selects hard negatives, ensuring computational
efficiency and semantic precision. Evaluation on our proprietary enterprise
corpus (cloud services domain) demonstrates substantial improvements of 15\% in
MRR@3 and 19\% in MRR@10 compared to state-of-the-art baselines and other
negative sampling techniques. Further validation on public domain-specific
datasets (FiQA, Climate Fever, TechQA) confirms our method's generalizability
and readiness for real-world applications.

TLDR: AcuRank是一种自适应重排序框架，通过动态调整计算量和目标，基于文档相关性的不确定性估计，优化检索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定大小的子集重排序忽略了查询难度和文档分布，导致效率低下。

Method: 使用贝叶斯TrueSkill模型迭代优化相关性估计，直到达到足够的置信水平。

Result: 在TREC-DL和BEIR基准测试中，AcuRank在准确性和效率之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: AcuRank在多样化检索任务和基于LLM的重排序模型中表现出高效性和通用性。

Abstract: Listwise reranking with large language models (LLMs) enhances top-ranked
results in retrieval-based applications. Due to the limit in context size and
high inference cost of long context, reranking is typically performed over a
fixed size of small subsets, with the final ranking aggregated from these
partial results. This fixed computation disregards query difficulty and
document distribution, leading to inefficiencies. We propose AcuRank, an
adaptive reranking framework that dynamically adjusts both the amount and
target of computation based on uncertainty estimates over document relevance.
Using a Bayesian TrueSkill model, we iteratively refine relevance estimates
until reaching sufficient confidence levels, and our explicit modeling of
ranking uncertainty enables principled control over reranking behavior and
avoids unnecessary updates to confident predictions. Results on the TREC-DL and
BEIR benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves a superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-off and scales better with compute than
fixed-computation baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method across diverse retrieval tasks and LLM-based
reranking models.

Motivation: 多语言新闻推荐系统在零样本跨语言迁移中性能损失严重，且传统微调方法在数据稀缺时不可行。

Method: 构建多语言新闻语料库，优化预训练的多语言句子编码器（NaSE），并提出基于冻结嵌入和点击行为融合的简单基线方法。

Result: NaSE在零样本和少样本新闻推荐中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: NaSE为跨语言新闻推荐提供了一种高效且无需大量数据的解决方案。

Abstract: Rapidly growing numbers of multilingual news consumers pose an increasing
challenge to news recommender systems in terms of providing customized
recommendations. First, existing neural news recommenders, even when powered by
multilingual language models (LMs), suffer substantial performance losses in
zero-shot cross-lingual transfer (ZS-XLT). Second, the current paradigm of
fine-tuning the backbone LM of a neural recommender on task-specific data is
computationally expensive and infeasible in few-shot recommendation and
cold-start setups, where data is scarce or completely unavailable. In this
work, we propose a news-adapted sentence encoder (NaSE), domain-specialized
from a pretrained massively multilingual sentence encoder (SE). To this end, we
construct and leverage PolyNews and PolyNewsParallel, two multilingual
news-specific corpora. With the news-adapted multilingual SE in place, we test
the effectiveness of (i.e., question the need for) supervised fine-tuning for
news recommendation, and propose a simple and strong baseline based on (i)
frozen NaSE embeddings and (ii) late click-behavior fusion. We show that NaSE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-XLT in true cold-start and few-shot
news recommendation.

Motivation: 解决LLM的幻觉和知识陈旧问题，同时克服现有KG-RAG方法在表示对齐、检索效率与动态更新方面的不足。

Method: 利用基于行走的图遍历和知识表达生成语料库，支持零样本RAG，无需领域数据微调。

Result: 在响应准确性和幻觉减少方面优于现有RAG系统，查询延迟低且可扩展性强。

Conclusion: Walk&Retrieve展示了轻量级检索策略的潜力，为未来RAG研究提供了强基线。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning abilities,
but often suffer from hallucinations or outdated knowledge. Knowledge Graph
(KG)-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remedies these shortcomings by
grounding LLM responses in structured external information from a knowledge
base. However, many KG-based RAG approaches struggle with (i) aligning KG and
textual representations, (ii) balancing retrieval accuracy and efficiency, and
(iii) adapting to dynamically updated KGs. In this work, we introduce
Walk&Retrieve, a simple yet effective KG-based framework that leverages
walk-based graph traversal and knowledge verbalization for corpus generation
for zero-shot RAG. Built around efficient KG walks, our method does not require
fine-tuning on domain-specific data, enabling seamless adaptation to KG
updates, reducing computational overhead, and allowing integration with any
off-the-shelf backbone LLM. Despite its simplicity, Walk&Retrieve performs
competitively, often outperforming existing RAG systems in response accuracy
and hallucination reduction. Moreover, it demonstrates lower query latency and
robust scalability to large KGs, highlighting the potential of lightweight
retrieval strategies as strong baselines for future RAG research.

Motivation: 当前RAG框架中检索器和LLM之间存在偏好差距，限制了系统性能的进一步提升。

Method: 提出GainRAG，定义“增益”指标衡量输入段落对输出的贡献，并训练中间件对齐偏好，同时引入伪段落策略缓解性能下降。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验验证了GainRAG的有效性。

Conclusion: GainRAG通过对齐检索器和LLM的偏好，显著提升了RAG框架的性能。

Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework introduces a retrieval
module to dynamically inject retrieved information into the input context of
large language models (LLMs), and has demonstrated significant success in
various NLP tasks. However, the current study points out that there is a
preference gap between retrievers and LLMs in the RAG framework, which limit
the further improvement of system performance. Some highly relevant passages
may interfere with LLM reasoning because they contain complex or contradictory
information; while some indirectly related or even inaccurate content may help
LLM generate more accurate answers by providing suggestive information or
logical clues. To solve this, we propose GainRAG, a novel approach that aligns
the retriever's and LLM's preferences by defining a new metric, "gain", which
measure how well an input passage contributes to correct outputs. Specifically,
we propose a method to estimate these gain signals and train a middleware that
aligns the preferences of the retriever and the LLM using only limited data. In
addition, we introduce a pseudo-passage strategy to mitigate degradation. The
experimental results on 6 datasets verify the effectiveness of GainRAG.

Motivation: 解决基于令牌匹配的广告覆盖范围扩大但相关性降低的问题。

Method: 使用预训练的Siamese模型生成广告关键词的密集向量表示，并通过最近邻搜索识别语义相关变体；引入基于聚类的阈值机制调整相似度截断；通过增量学习策略增强下游相关性模型。

Result: 系统提高了相关性和点击率（CTR），提供可扩展、低延迟的解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效平衡了广告覆盖范围和相关性，适应动态查询行为和广告库存。

Abstract: In search advertising, keyword matching connects user queries with relevant
ads. While token-based matching increases ad coverage, it can reduce relevance
due to overly permissive semantic expansion. This work extends keyword reach
through document-side semantic keyword expansion, using a language model to
broaden token-level matching without altering queries. We propose a solution
using a pre-trained siamese model to generate dense vector representations of
ad keywords and identify semantically related variants through nearest neighbor
search. To maintain precision, we introduce a cluster-based thresholding
mechanism that adjusts similarity cutoffs based on local semantic density. Each
expanded keyword maps to a group of seller-listed items, which may only
partially align with the original intent. To ensure relevance, we enhance the
downstream relevance model by adapting it to the expanded keyword space using
an incremental learning strategy with a lightweight decision tree ensemble.
This system improves both relevance and click-through rate (CTR), offering a
scalable, low-latency solution adaptable to evolving query behavior and
advertising inventory.

Motivation: 探索低资源、形态丰富的语言（如阿姆哈拉语）在神经检索中的表现，填补数据稀缺和分词优化不足的研究空白。

Method: 引入基于Amharic BERT和RoBERTa的密集检索模型，包括RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed和更紧凑的变体，以及ColBERT模型。

Result: RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed在MRR@10和Recall@10上分别提升17.6%和9.86%，ColBERT模型达到最高MRR@10（0.843）。

Conclusion: 语言特定适配对低资源检索至关重要，研究为未来低资源信息检索提供了数据集、代码和模型支持。

Abstract: Neural retrieval methods using transformer-based pre-trained language models
have advanced multilingual and cross-lingual retrieval. However, their
effectiveness for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Amharic
remains underexplored due to data scarcity and suboptimal tokenization. We
address this gap by introducing Amharic-specific dense retrieval models based
on pre-trained Amharic BERT and RoBERTa backbones. Our proposed
RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed model (110M parameters) achieves a 17.6% relative
improvement in MRR@10 and a 9.86% gain in Recall@10 over the strongest
multilingual baseline, Arctic Embed 2.0 (568M parameters). More compact
variants, such as RoBERTa-Medium-Amharic-Embed (42M), remain competitive while
being over 13x smaller. Additionally, we train a ColBERT-based late interaction
retrieval model that achieves the highest MRR@10 score (0.843) among all
evaluated models. We benchmark our proposed models against both sparse and
dense retrieval baselines to systematically assess retrieval effectiveness in
Amharic. Our analysis highlights key challenges in low-resource settings and
underscores the importance of language-specific adaptation. To foster future
research in low-resource IR, we publicly release our dataset, codebase, and
trained models at https://github.com/kidist-amde/amharic-ir-benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有GCL方法缺乏对分层项目结构的显式建模，而分层结构是提高推荐准确性的关键信号。

Method: HGCL通过跨层对比学习预训练GCL模块，构建双层用户-项目二分图，并基于分层图微调表示。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，HGCL表现优于基线模型，验证了分层结构的贡献。

Conclusion: HGCL通过分层项目结构显著提升了GCL在推荐任务中的性能。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which fuses graph neural networks with
contrastive learning, has evolved as a pivotal tool in user-item
recommendations. While promising, existing GCL methods often lack explicit
modeling of hierarchical item structures, which represent item similarities
across varying resolutions. Such hierarchical item structures are ubiquitous in
various items (e.g., online products and local businesses), and reflect their
inherent organizational properties that serve as critical signals for enhancing
recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Graph
Contrastive Learning (HGCL), a novel GCL method that incorporates hierarchical
item structures for user-item recommendations. First, HGCL pre-trains a GCL
module using cross-layer contrastive learning to obtain user and item
representations. Second, HGCL employs a representation compression and
clustering method to construct a two-hierarchy user-item bipartite graph.
Ultimately, HGCL fine-tunes user and item representations by learning on the
hierarchical graph, and then provides recommendations based on user-item
interaction scores. Experiments on three widely adopted benchmark datasets
ranging from 70K to 382K nodes confirm the superior performance of HGCL over
existing baseline models, highlighting the contribution of hierarchical item
structures in enhancing GCL methods for recommendation tasks.

Abstract: In the domain of sponsored search advertising, the focus of Keyphrase
recommendation has largely been on exact match types, which pose issues such as
high management expenses, limited targeting scope, and evolving search query
patterns. Alternatives like Broad match types can alleviate certain drawbacks
of exact matches but present challenges like poor targeting accuracy and
minimal supervisory signals owing to limited advertiser usage. This research
defines the criteria for an ideal broad match, emphasizing on both efficiency
and effectiveness, ensuring that a significant portion of matched queries are
relevant. We propose BroadGen, an innovative framework that recommends
efficient and effective broad match keyphrases by utilizing historical search
query data. Additionally, we demonstrate that BroadGen, through token
correspondence modeling, maintains better query stability over time. BroadGen's
capabilities allow it to serve daily, millions of sellers at eBay with over 2.3

Result: 实验证明HiT-LBM优于现有方法，显著提升了推荐性能。

Conclusion: HiT-LBM为LLMs在推荐系统中处理长期行为序列提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in
Recommendation Systems (RS) due to their extensive world knowledge and robust
reasoning capabilities. However, a critical challenge lies in enabling LLMs to
effectively comprehend and extract insights from massive user behaviors.
Current approaches that directly leverage LLMs for user interest learning face
limitations in handling long sequential behaviors, effectively extracting
interest, and applying interest in practical scenarios. To address these
issues, we propose a Hierarchical Tree Search-based User Lifelong Behavior
Modeling framework (HiT-LBM). HiT-LBM integrates Chunked User Behavior
Extraction (CUBE) and Hierarchical Tree Search for Interest (HTS) to capture
diverse interests and interest evolution of user. CUBE divides user lifelong
behaviors into multiple chunks and learns the interest and interest evolution
within each chunk in a cascading manner. HTS generates candidate interests
through hierarchical expansion and searches for the optimal interest with
process rating model to ensure information gain for each behavior chunk.
Additionally, we design Temporal-Ware Interest Fusion (TIF) to integrate
interests from multiple behavior chunks, constructing a comprehensive
representation of user lifelong interests. The representation can be embedded
into any recommendation model to enhance performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it surpasses
state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前密集检索器在处理含有逻辑连接词的查询时表现不佳，检索结果未能满足查询中的逻辑约束，而这一问题在下游应用中很重要。

Method: LogiCoL基于批量监督对比学习，通过两组软约束（使用t-norm表达）学习密集检索器，以尊重查询结果的子集和互斥集合关系。

Result: 实验表明，使用LogiCoL训练的模型在实体检索任务中提升了检索性能和逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: LogiCoL有效解决了密集检索器在逻辑连接词查询中的不足，并通过详细分析揭示了其有效性原因。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made with dual- and bi-encoder dense
retrievers, they often struggle on queries with logical connectives, a use case
that is often overlooked yet important in downstream applications. Current
dense retrievers struggle with such queries, such that the retrieved results do
not respect the logical constraints implied in the queries. To address this
challenge, we introduce LogiCoL, a logically-informed contrastive learning
objective for dense retrievers. LogiCoL builds upon in-batch supervised
contrastive learning, and learns dense retrievers to respect the subset and
mutually-exclusive set relation between query results via two sets of soft
constraints expressed via t-norm in the learning objective. We evaluate the
effectiveness of LogiCoL on the task of entity retrieval, where the model is
expected to retrieve a set of entities in Wikipedia that satisfy the implicit
logical constraints in the query. We show that models trained with LogiCoL
yield improvement both in terms of retrieval performance and logical
consistency in the results. We provide detailed analysis and insights to
uncover why queries with logical connectives are challenging for dense
retrievers and why LogiCoL is most effective.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic recommender systems powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs) represents a paradigm shift in personalized recommendations, leveraging
LLMs' advanced reasoning and role-playing capabilities to enable autonomous,
adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional recommendation approaches, agentic
recommender systems can dynamically gather and interpret user-item interactions
from complex environments, generating robust recommendation strategies that
generalize across diverse scenarios. However, the field currently lacks
standardized evaluation protocols to systematically assess these methods. To
address this critical gap, we propose: (1) an interactive textual
recommendation simulator incorporating rich user and item metadata and three
typical evaluation scenarios (classic, evolving-interest, and cold-start
recommendation tasks); (2) a unified modular framework for developing and
studying agentic recommender systems; and (3) the first comprehensive benchmark
comparing 10 classical and agentic recommendation methods. Our findings
demonstrate the superiority of agentic systems and establish actionable design
guidelines for their core components. The benchmark environment has been

previous diffusion-based methods, ADRec applies an independent noise process to
each token and performs diffusion across the entire target sequence during
training. ADRec captures token interdependency through auto-regression while
modeling per-token distributions through token-level diffusion. This dual
approach enables the model to effectively capture both sequence dynamics and
item representations, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. To
further mitigate embedding collapse, we propose a three-stage training
strategy: (1) pre-training the embedding weights, (2) aligning these weights
with the ADRec backbone, and (3) fine-tuning the model. During inference, ADRec
applies the denoising process only to the last token, ensuring that the
meaningful patterns in historical interactions are preserved. Our comprehensive
empirical evaluation across six datasets underscores the effectiveness of ADRec
in enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of diffusion-based sequential
recommendation systems.

Motivation: 传统推荐系统仅关注用户对物品的喜欢态度，忽略了更广泛的情感现象（如情绪、心境等）。本文旨在利用用户明确表达的情感状态，提升推荐的精准性和多样性。

Method: 1. 从书评中挖掘细粒度情感表达，构建大型数据集；2. 提出基于Transformer的架构，利用情感表达作为输入；3. 训练和评估多种推荐模型，匹配物品与用户情感偏好。

Result: 实验表明，结合物品文本描述和用户情感偏好的模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 通过利用用户明确表达的情感状态，推荐系统可以更精准地匹配用户需求，提升推荐效果。

Abstract: The affective attitude of liking a recommended item reflects just one
category in a wide spectrum of affective phenomena that also includes emotions
such as entranced or intrigued, moods such as cheerful or buoyant, as well as
more fine-grained affective states, such as "pleasantly surprised by the
conclusion". In this paper, we introduce a novel recommendation task that can
leverage a virtually unbounded range of affective states sought explicitly by
the user in order to identify items that, upon consumption, are likely to
induce those affective states. Correspondingly, we create a large dataset of
user preferences containing expressions of fine-grained affective states that
are mined from book reviews, and propose a Transformer-based architecture that
leverages such affective expressions as input. We then use the resulting
dataset of affective states preferences, together with the linked users and
their histories of book readings, ratings, and reviews, to train and evaluate
multiple recommendation models on the task of matching recommended items with
affective preferences. Experiments show that the best results are obtained by
models that can utilize textual descriptions of items and user affective
preferences.

Abstract: Cell boundary information is crucial for analyzing cell behaviors from
time-lapse microscopy videos. Existing supervised cell segmentation tools, such
as ImageJ, require tuning various parameters and rely on restrictive
assumptions about the shape of the objects. While recent supervised
segmentation tools based on convolutional neural networks enhance accuracy,
they depend on high-quality labelled images, making them unsuitable for
segmenting new types of objects not in the database. We developed a novel
unsupervised cell segmentation algorithm based on fast Gaussian processes for
noisy microscopy images without the need for parameter tuning or restrictive
assumptions about the shape of the object. We derived robust thresholding
criteria adaptive for heterogeneous images containing distinct brightness at
different parts to separate objects from the background, and employed watershed
segmentation to distinguish touching cell objects. Both simulated studies and
real-data analysis of large microscopy images demonstrate the scalability and
accuracy of our approach compared with the alternatives.
