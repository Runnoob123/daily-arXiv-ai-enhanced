### [1] [A Proposal for Evaluating the Operational Risk for ChatBots based on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04784)
*Pedro Pinacho-Davidson,Fernando Gutierrez,Pablo Zapata,Rodolfo Vergara,Pablo Aqueveque*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种新的风险评估指标，用于评估生成式AI聊天机器人对组织、用户和第三方的潜在威胁，结合技术复杂性和上下文因素，并通过Garak框架验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI和大型语言模型（LLM）的兴起带来了更先进的聊天机器人，但也引入了超出传统网络安全考虑的操作风险。

Method: 开发了一种综合风险评估指标，结合技术复杂性和上下文因素，并利用Garak框架进行验证和改进。

Result: 通过检索增强生成（RAG）场景展示了该方法，结果强调了多维风险评估对安全可靠AI对话系统的重要性。

Conclusion: 多维风险评估对实现安全可靠的AI驱动对话系统至关重要。

Abstract: The emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has
enabled more advanced chatbots capable of human-like interactions. However,
these conversational agents introduce a broader set of operational risks that
extend beyond traditional cybersecurity considerations. In this work, we
propose a novel, instrumented risk-assessment metric that simultaneously
evaluates potential threats to three key stakeholders: the service-providing
organization, end users, and third parties. Our approach incorporates the
technical complexity required to induce erroneous behaviors in the
chatbot--ranging from non-induced failures to advanced prompt-injection
attacks--as well as contextual factors such as the target industry, user age
range, and vulnerability severity. To validate our metric, we leverage Garak,
an open-source framework for LLM vulnerability testing. We further enhance
Garak to capture a variety of threat vectors (e.g., misinformation, code
hallucinations, social engineering, and malicious code generation). Our
methodology is demonstrated in a scenario involving chatbots that employ
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), showing how the aggregated risk scores
guide both short-term mitigation and longer-term improvements in model design
and deployment. The results underscore the importance of multi-dimensional risk
assessments in operationalizing secure, reliable AI-driven conversational
systems.

### [2] [Safeguard-by-Development: A Privacy-Enhanced Development Paradigm for Multi-Agent Collaboration Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04799)
*Jian Cui,Zichuan Li,Luyi Xing,Xiaojing Liao*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出Maris，一种隐私增强的开发范式，用于解决多智能体协作系统（MACS）中的数据泄漏问题，通过嵌入参考监控器实现严格的消息流控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MACS在解决复杂问题时存在敏感数据泄漏风险，现有系统缺乏隐私控制机制。

Method: 提出Maris范式，嵌入参考监控器于多智能体对话组件中，实现消息流控制，并集成到AutoGen框架中。

Result: Maris在医疗、供应链优化和个性化推荐等场景中表现出良好的有效性、性能开销和实用性。

Conclusion: Maris为MACS提供了一种有效的隐私保护解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration systems (MACS), powered by large language models
(LLMs), solve complex problems efficiently by leveraging each agent's
specialization and communication between agents. However, the inherent exchange
of information between agents and their interaction with external environments,
such as LLM, tools, and users, inevitably introduces significant risks of
sensitive data leakage, including vulnerabilities to attacks like prompt
injection and reconnaissance. Existing MACS fail to enable privacy controls,
making it challenging to manage sensitive information securely. In this paper,
we take the first step to address the MACS's data leakage threat at the system
development level through a privacy-enhanced development paradigm, Maris. Maris
enables rigorous message flow control within MACS by embedding reference
monitors into key multi-agent conversation components. We implemented Maris as
an integral part of AutoGen, a widely adopted open-source multi-agent
development framework. Then, we evaluate Maris for its effectiveness and
performance overhead on privacy-critical MACS use cases, including healthcare,
supply chain optimization, and personalized recommendation system. The result
shows that Maris achieves satisfactory effectiveness, performance overhead and
practicability for adoption.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into consumer and
enterprise applications. Despite their capabilities, they remain susceptible to
adversarial attacks such as prompt injection and jailbreaks that override
alignment safeguards. This paper provides a systematic investigation of
jailbreak strategies against various state-of-the-art LLMs. We categorize over
1,400 adversarial prompts, analyze their success against GPT-4, Claude 2,
Mistral 7B, and Vicuna, and examine their generalizability and construction
logic. We further propose layered mitigation strategies and recommend a hybrid
red-teaming and sandboxing approach for robust LLM security.

Result: 提出了一个全面的攻击分类法，并分析了防御机制的优缺点。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解和缓解内存侧信道攻击提供了重要参考，有助于提升内存安全性。

Abstract: Side-channel attacks on memory (SCAM) exploit unintended data leaks from
memory subsystems to infer sensitive information, posing significant threats to
system security. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in memory access
patterns, cache behaviors, and other microarchitectural features to bypass
traditional security measures. The purpose of this research is to examine SCAM,
classify various attack techniques, and evaluate existing defense mechanisms.
It guides researchers and industry professionals in improving memory security
and mitigating emerging threats. We begin by identifying the major
vulnerabilities in the memory system that are frequently exploited in SCAM,
such as cache timing, speculative execution, \textit{Rowhammer}, and other
sophisticated approaches. Next, we outline a comprehensive taxonomy that
systematically classifies these attacks based on their types, target systems,
attack vectors, and adversarial capabilities required to execute them. In
addition, we review the current landscape of mitigation strategies, emphasizing
their strengths and limitations. This work aims to provide a comprehensive
overview of memory-based side-channel attacks with the goal of providing
significant insights for researchers and practitioners to better understand,
detect, and mitigate SCAM risks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链系统的架构、共识机制和数据标准差异导致数据孤岛，阻碍多链生态发展，区块链互操作性成为解决方案。

Method: 系统分析了150多篇高影响力文献，分类了互操作性方法（如原子交换、侧链、轻客户端等）。

Result: 提供了最全面的区块链互操作性综述，强调了学术与工业合作的重要性，并提出了未来研究方向和挑战。

Conclusion: 研究支持研究者、政策制定者和行业领袖理解区块链互操作性的潜力，推动多链生态发展。

Abstract: Blockchain technology, introduced in 2008, has revolutionized data storage
and transfer across sectors such as finance, healthcare, intelligent
transportation, and the metaverse. However, the proliferation of blockchain
systems has led to discrepancies in architectures, consensus mechanisms, and
data standards, creating data and value silos that hinder the development of an
integrated multi chain ecosystem. Blockchain interoperability (a.k.a cross
chain interoperability) has thus emerged as a solution to enable seamless data
and asset exchange across disparate blockchains. In this survey, we
systematically analyze over 150 high impact sources from academic journals,
digital libraries, and grey literature to provide an in depth examination of
blockchain interoperability. By exploring the existing methods, technologies,
and architectures, we offer a classification of interoperability approaches
including Atomic Swaps, Sidechains, Light Clients, and so on, which represent
the most comprehensive overview to date. Furthermore, we investigate the
convergence of academic research with industry practices, underscoring the
importance of collaborative efforts in advancing blockchain innovation.
Finally, we identify key strategic insights, challenges, and future research
trajectories in this field. Our findings aim to support researchers,
policymakers, and industry leaders in understanding and harnessing the
transformative potential of blockchain interoperability to address current
challenges and drive forward a cohesive multi-chain ecosystem.

### [6] [ChainMarks: Securing DNN Watermark with Cryptographic Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04977)
*Brian Choi,Shu Wang,Isabelle Choi,Kun Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: ChainMarks是一种安全的DNN水印方案，通过引入密码链生成鲁棒水印，并采用两阶段蒙特卡洛方法确定水印存在，提高了水印的安全性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DNN水印方案易受水印移除和模糊攻击，且水印存在的判定标准模糊，增加了攻击风险。

Method: ChainMarks通过哈希函数生成触发输入作为水印数据集，结合模型所有者的数字签名生成目标标签，并通过两阶段蒙特卡洛方法验证水印。

Result: 实验表明，ChainMarks在鲁棒性和安全性上优于现有水印方案，且具有更高的水印存在概率保证。

Conclusion: ChainMarks为DNN模型提供了一种更安全、鲁棒的水印方案，显著提升了水印的可靠性。

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of deep neural network (DNN) models, dynamic
watermarking techniques are being used to protect the intellectual property of
model owners. However, recent studies have shown that existing watermarking
schemes are vulnerable to watermark removal and ambiguity attacks. Besides, the
vague criteria for determining watermark presence further increase the
likelihood of such attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure DNN watermarking
scheme named ChainMarks, which generates secure and robust watermarks by
introducing a cryptographic chain into the trigger inputs and utilizes a
two-phase Monte Carlo method for determining watermark presence. First,
ChainMarks generates trigger inputs as a watermark dataset by repeatedly
applying a hash function over a secret key, where the target labels associated
with trigger inputs are generated from the digital signature of model owner.
Then, the watermarked model is produced by training a DNN over both the
original and watermark datasets. To verify watermarks, we compare the predicted
labels of trigger inputs with the target labels and determine ownership with a
more accurate decision threshold that considers the classification probability
of specific models. Experimental results show that ChainMarks exhibits higher
levels of robustness and security compared to state-of-the-art watermarking
schemes. With a better marginal utility, ChainMarks provides a higher
probability guarantee of watermark presence in DNN models with the same level
of watermark accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链与身份管理的交叉领域缺乏一个全面的分类框架，阻碍了标准化和理解。

Method: 通过分析390篇科学论文和专家讨论，开发了一个包含22个维度和113个特征的分类法。

Result: 分类法分为三组：信任锚实现、身份架构（标识符和凭证）和账本规范，并成功应用于两种不同架构。

Conclusion: 该分类法推动了标准化，为研究人员和从业者提供了评估设计和实现的结构化框架。

Abstract: The intersection of blockchain (distributed ledger) and identity management
lacks a comprehensive framework for classifying distributed-ledger-based
identity solutions. This paper introduces a methodologically developed taxonomy
derived from the analysis of 390 scientific papers and expert discussions.
  The resulting framework consists of 22 dimensions with 113 characteristics,
organized into three groups: trust anchor implementations, identity
architectures (identifiers and credentials), and ledger specifications. This
taxonomy facilitates the systematic analysis, comparison, and design of
distributed-ledger-based identity solutions, as demonstrated through its
application to two distinct architectures.
  As the first methodology-driven taxonomy in this field, this work advances
standardization and enhances understanding of distributed-ledger-based identity
architectures. It provides researchers and practitioners with a structured
framework for evaluating design decisions and implementation approaches.

### [8] [A Weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerance Consensus Driven Trusted Multiple Large Language Models Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05103)
*Haoxiang Luo,Gang Sun,Yinqiu Liu,Dongcheng Zhao,Dusit Niyato,Hongfang Yu,Schahram Dustdar*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于加权拜占庭容错（WBFT）区块链共识机制的Trusted MultiLLMN框架，以提高多LLM协作的可靠性、安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MultiLLMN架构在开放环境中存在可靠性和安全性问题，且集中式协调效率低下。

Method: 采用WBFT机制，根据LLM的响应质量和可信度动态分配投票权重，激励可靠行为并减少恶意节点影响。

Result: WBFT显著提升了共识安全性和效率，Trusted MultiLLMN比单LLM和传统MultiLLMN生成更高质量和可信的响应。

Conclusion: Trusted MultiLLMN为构建健壮、去中心化的AI协作网络提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of applications. However, individual LLMs often produce inconsistent,
biased, or hallucinated outputs due to limitations in their training corpora
and model architectures. Recently, collaborative frameworks such as the
Multi-LLM Network (MultiLLMN) have been introduced, enabling multiple LLMs to
interact and jointly respond to user queries. Nevertheless, MultiLLMN
architectures raise critical concerns regarding the reliability and security of
the generated content, particularly in open environments where malicious or
compromised LLMs may be present. Moreover, reliance on centralized coordination
undermines system efficiency and introduces single points of failure. In this
paper, we propose a novel Trusted MultiLLMN framework, driven by a Weighted
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (WBFT) blockchain consensus mechanism, to ensure the
reliability, security, and efficiency of multi-LLM collaboration. In WBFT,
voting weights are adaptively assigned to each LLM based on its response
quality and trustworthiness, incentivizing reliable behavior, and reducing the
impact of malicious nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that WBFT
significantly improves both consensus security and efficiency compared to
classical and modern consensus mechanisms, particularly under wireless network
conditions. Furthermore, our evaluations reveal that Trusted MultiLLMN
supported by WBFT can deliver higher-quality and more credible responses than
both single LLMs and conventional MultiLLMNs, thereby providing a promising
path toward building robust, decentralized AI collaboration networks.

### [9] [QUIC-Exfil: Exploiting QUIC's Server Preferred Address Feature to Perform Data Exfiltration Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05292)
*Thomas Grübl,Weijie Niu,Jan von der Assen,Burkhard Stiller*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: QUIC协议因其高效、安全和抗审查特性被广泛采用，但也为攻击者提供了数据外泄的新途径。本文提出了一种利用QUIC服务器首选地址功能的数据外泄攻击方法，并通过实验证明现有异常检测分类器无法有效检测此类攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QUIC协议的动态IP地址变更和加密特性使其难以被防火墙管理，攻击者可利用其特性进行隐蔽的数据外泄。现有检测方法对QUIC攻击无效，因此需要研究其可行性及检测方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于QUIC服务器首选地址功能的数据外泄攻击方法，并开发了Rust实现的工具。通过训练五种异常检测分类器（如随机森林、自编码器等）评估攻击的隐蔽性。

Result: 实验表明，五种分类器在70万良性/恶意QUIC数据包和786次连接迁移事件中无法检测攻击。防火墙厂商目前也无法区分良性/恶意QUIC连接迁移。

Conclusion: QUIC协议的数据外泄攻击具有高度隐蔽性，现有检测方法无效，需开发新的防御机制。

Abstract: The QUIC protocol is now widely adopted by major tech companies and accounts
for a significant fraction of today's Internet traffic. QUIC's multiplexing
capabilities, encrypted headers, dynamic IP address changes, and encrypted
parameter negotiations make the protocol not only more efficient, secure, and
censorship-resistant, but also practically unmanageable by firewalls. This
opens doors for attackers who may exploit certain traits of the QUIC protocol
to perform targeted attacks, such as data exfiltration attacks. Whereas
existing data exfiltration techniques, such as TLS and DNS-based exfiltration,
can be detected on a firewall level, QUIC-based data exfiltration is more
difficult to detect, since changes in IP addresses and ports are inherent to
the protocol's normal behavior. To show the feasibility of a QUIC-based data
exfiltration attack, we introduce a novel method leveraging the server
preferred address feature of the QUIC protocol and, thus, allows an attacker to
exfiltrate sensitive data from an infected machine to a malicious server,
disguised as a server-side connection migration. The attack is implemented as a
proof of concept tool in Rust. We evaluated the performance of five anomaly
detection classifiers - Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support Vector
Machine, Autoencoder, and Isolation Forest - trained on datasets collected from
three network traffic scenarios. The classifiers were trained on over 700K
benign and malicious QUIC packets and 786 connection migration events, but were
unable to detect the data exfiltration attempts. Furthermore, post-analysis of
the traffic captures did not reveal any identifiable fingerprint. As part of
our evaluation, we also interviewed five leading firewall vendors and found
that, as of today, no major firewall vendor implements functionality capable of
distinguishing between benign and malicious QUIC connection migrations.

### [10] [SUUM: Timestamp-based Nakamoto-style Blockchains are Vulnerable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05328)
*Junjie Hu,Na Ruan*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了两种新型攻击策略（UUM和SUUM），通过操纵时间戳和分叉选择规则，永久破坏区块链的安全性和激励机制。SUUM攻击尤其危险，因为它允许攻击者零成本持续攻击，最大化收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示基于时间戳的Nakamoto-style区块链协议中的漏洞，特别是通过时间戳操纵和分叉选择规则破坏系统公平性和激励机制。

Method: 提出了UUM和SUUM攻击策略，通过理论建模和仿真验证其有效性，分析其对区块链共识机制的影响。

Result: SUUM攻击使攻击者获得不成比例的奖励优势，且能零成本持续攻击，永久破坏协议的安全性假设。

Conclusion: 基于时间戳的Nakamoto-style协议存在严重安全风险，需紧急采取对策以确保长期稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce two advanced attack strategies, the Unrestricted Uncle Maker
(UUM) Attack and the Staircase-Unrestricted Uncle Maker (SUUM) Attack, which
fundamentally threaten the security of timestamp-based Nakamoto-style
blockchains by inflicting permanent systemic harm. Unlike prior work that
merely enhances adversarial rewards, these attacks exploit vulnerabilities in
timestamp manipulation and fork selection rules to irreversibly destabilize
blockchain fairness and incentive mechanisms. Specifically, the SUUM attack
enables adversaries to persistently launch attacks at zero cost, eliminating
constraints on block withholding and risk-free conditions, while systematically
maximizing rewards through coordinated timestamp adjustments and strategic
block release.
  Our analysis demonstrates that SUUM adversaries achieve disproportionate
reward advantages over both UUM and the original Riskless Uncle Maker (RUM)
Attack [CCS '23], with all three strategies surpassing honest mining.
Crucially, SUUM's cost-free persistence allows adversaries to indefinitely
drain rewards from honest participants by maintaining minimal difficulty risks
through precise timestamp manipulation. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle:
adversaries amplify their profits while suppressing honest returns, thereby
permanently eroding the protocol's security assumptions. Through rigorous
theoretical modeling and simulations, we validate how SUUM's combination of
timestamp tampering, block withholding, and difficulty risk control enables
unmitigated exploitation of consensus mechanisms. This work underscores the
existential risks posed by timestamp-based Nakamoto-style protocols and
advocates urgent countermeasures to ensure long-term stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种多模态融合模型MatMMFuse，结合了CGCNN的结构感知嵌入和SciBERT的文本嵌入，显著提升了材料属性预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一模态模型无法充分利用不同表示的优势，而多模态融合可以结合局部特征和全局信息，提升预测效果。

Method: 使用多头注意力机制融合CGCNN和SciBERT的嵌入，并在Materials Project数据集上进行端到端训练。

Result: 模型在四种关键属性上均优于单一模型，形成能预测提升40%（CGCNN）和68%（SciBERT），并在零样本任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: MatMMFuse适用于数据稀缺的工业应用，展示了多模态融合在材料科学中的潜力。

Abstract: The recent progress of using graph based encoding of crystal structures for
high throughput material property prediction has been quite successful.
However, using a single modality model prevents us from exploiting the
advantages of an enhanced features space by combining different
representations. Specifically, pre-trained Large language models(LLMs) can
encode a large amount of knowledge which is beneficial for training of models.
Moreover, the graph encoder is able to learn the local features while the text
encoder is able to learn global information such as space group and crystal
symmetry. In this work, we propose Material Multi-Modal Fusion(MatMMFuse), a
fusion based model which uses a multi-head attention mechanism for the
combination of structure aware embedding from the Crystal Graph Convolution
Network (CGCNN) and text embeddings from the SciBERT model. We train our model
in an end-to-end framework using data from the Materials Project Dataset. We
show that our proposed model shows an improvement compared to the vanilla CGCNN
and SciBERT model for all four key properties: formation energy, band gap,
energy above hull and fermi energy. Specifically, we observe an improvement of
40% compared to the vanilla CGCNN model and 68% compared to the SciBERT model
for predicting the formation energy per atom. Importantly, we demonstrate the
zero shot performance of the trained model on small curated datasets of
Perovskites, Chalcogenides and the Jarvis Dataset. The results show that the
proposed model exhibits better zero shot performance than the individual plain
vanilla CGCNN and SciBERT model. This enables researchers to deploy the model
for specialized industrial applications where collection of training data is
prohibitively expensive.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种在标签数据被污染（噪声或缺失）时进行稳健不确定性量化的框架，扩展了共形预测方法，并分析了特权共形预测（PCP）对权重估计不准确的鲁棒性。此外，引入了不确定插补（UI）方法，并通过理论和实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标签数据被污染的情况下，传统的共形预测方法的有效性受到挑战，因为其依赖于独立同分布假设。本文旨在解决这一问题，提供更稳健的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 提出了特权共形预测（PCP）方法，利用特权信息重新加权数据分布；并引入不确定插补（UI）方法，通过保留不确定性的方式插补被污染的标签。

Result: 分析表明，PCP在权重估计不准确时仍能提供有效的不确定性估计；UI方法通过理论和实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法可以集成到一个三重稳健框架中，确保只要至少一种方法有效，预测结果就具有统计有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for robust uncertainty quantification in situations
where labeled training data are corrupted, through noisy or missing labels. We
build on conformal prediction, a statistical tool for generating prediction
sets that cover the test label with a pre-specified probability. The validity
of conformal prediction, however, holds under the i.i.d assumption, which does
not hold in our setting due to the corruptions in the data. To account for this
distribution shift, the privileged conformal prediction (PCP) method proposed
leveraging privileged information (PI) -- additional features available only
during training -- to re-weight the data distribution, yielding valid
prediction sets under the assumption that the weights are accurate. In this
work, we analyze the robustness of PCP to inaccuracies in the weights. Our
analysis indicates that PCP can still yield valid uncertainty estimates even
when the weights are poorly estimated. Furthermore, we introduce uncertain
imputation (UI), a new conformal method that does not rely on weight
estimation. Instead, we impute corrupted labels in a way that preserves their
uncertainty. Our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees and validated
empirically on both synthetic and real benchmarks. Finally, we show that these
techniques can be integrated into a triply robust framework, ensuring
statistically valid predictions as long as at least one underlying method is
valid.

### [13] [SetONet: A Deep Set-based Operator Network for Solving PDEs with permutation invariant variable input sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04738)
*Stepan Tretiakov,Xingjian Li,Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: SetONet是一种新型神经网络架构，结合Deep Sets原理改进DeepONet，解决了输入函数采样位置固定的限制，适用于传感器配置变化、数据缺失或不规则网格场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DeepONet需要输入函数在固定位置采样，限制了其在传感器配置变化、数据缺失或不规则网格场景中的应用。

Method: SetONet通过分支网络处理输入函数为无序的位置-值对集合，确保输入点的排列不变性，并显式处理空间坐标和函数值。

Result: SetONet在多种基准问题中表现优于标准DeepONet，特别是在输入采样条件变化时，且对传感器丢失具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SetONet扩展了神经算子工具包的灵活性，显著提升了在输入数据变化或不完整场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Neural operators, particularly the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet), have
shown promise in learning mappings between function spaces for solving
differential equations. However, standard DeepONet requires input functions to
be sampled at fixed locations, limiting its applicability in scenarios with
variable sensor configurations, missing data, or irregular grids. We introduce
the Set Operator Network (SetONet), a novel architecture that integrates Deep
Sets principles into the DeepONet framework to address this limitation. The
core innovation lies in the SetONet branch network, which processes the input
function as an unordered \emph{set} of location-value pairs. This design
ensures permutation invariance with respect to the input points, making SetONet
inherently robust to variations in the number and locations of sensors. SetONet
learns richer, spatially-aware input representations by explicitly processing
spatial coordinates and function values. We demonstrate SetONet's effectiveness
on several benchmark problems, including derivative/anti-derivative operators,
1D Darcy flow, and 2D elasticity. Results show that SetONet successfully learns
operators under variable input sampling conditions where standard DeepONet
fails. Furthermore, SetONet is architecturally robust to sensor drop-off;
unlike standard DeepONet, which requires methods like interpolation to function
with missing data. Notably, SetONet can achieve comparable or improved accuracy
over DeepONet on fixed grids, particularly for nonlinear problems, likely due
to its enhanced input representation. SetONet provides a flexible and robust
extension to the neural operator toolkit, significantly broadening the
applicability of operator learning to problems with variable or incomplete
input data.

TLDR: 研究发现，预训练数据中增加毒性内容可以改善模型对毒性的控制，从而在后期处理中更容易降低输出毒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视数据质量对模型性能的影响，探讨预训练和后期处理的协同设计。

Method: 通过玩具实验和Olmo-1B模型实验，研究数据组成对特征表示的影响。

Result: 毒性数据使毒性特征更线性可分，便于后期处理；模型在降低毒性的同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: 考虑后期处理时，毒性数据可能有助于训练更好的模型。

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) pretraining, data quality is believed to
determine model quality. In this paper, we re-examine the notion of "quality"
from the perspective of pre- and post-training co-design. Specifically, we
explore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better
control in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity.
First, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the
geometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled
experiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic
data, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear
representation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show
that although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model,
it also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real
Toxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better
trade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general
capabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention
(ITI) are applied. Our findings suggest that, with post-training taken into
account, bad data may lead to good models.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种结合运筹学和机器学习的新方法，用于解决不确定性下的决策问题，通过神经网络和组合优化层编码策略，最小化经验风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法未能充分利用上下文信息，因此需要新算法来改进决策过程。

Method: 使用神经网络与组合优化层编码策略，提出替代学习问题和通用原始-对偶算法，并引入稀疏扰动正则化方法。

Result: 算法在特定条件下线性收敛，实验显示其在上下文随机最小生成树问题中高效且可扩展。

Conclusion: 新方法在性能和可扩展性上表现优异，适用于多种组合优化场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to contextual stochastic optimization,
integrating operations research and machine learning to address decision-making
under uncertainty. Traditional methods often fail to leverage contextual
information, which underscores the necessity for new algorithms. In this study,
we utilize neural networks with combinatorial optimization layers to encode
policies. Our goal is to minimize the empirical risk, which is estimated from
past data on uncertain parameters and contexts. To that end, we present a
surrogate learning problem and a generic primal-dual algorithm that is
applicable to various combinatorial settings in stochastic optimization. Our
approach extends classic Fenchel-Young loss results and introduces a new
regularization method using sparse perturbations on the distribution simplex.
This allows for tractable updates in the original space and can accommodate
diverse objective functions. We demonstrate the linear convergence of our
algorithm under certain conditions and provide a bound on the non-optimality of
the resulting policy in terms of the empirical risk. Experiments on a
contextual stochastic minimum weight spanning tree problem show that our
algorithm is efficient and scalable, achieving performance comparable to
imitation learning of solutions computed using an expensive Lagrangian-based
heuristic.

TLDR: ViaSHAP是一种新方法，通过学习函数直接计算Shapley值，避免了传统后处理的高计算成本，并在准确性和性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Shapley值计算需要后处理，增加了推理时的计算成本，ViaSHAP旨在通过直接学习函数解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了基于通用逼近定理和Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理的两种实现方法，并通过大规模实验验证。

Result: ViaSHAP在表格数据上表现与最先进算法相当，且解释准确性显著优于FastSHAP。

Conclusion: ViaSHAP提供了一种高效且准确的Shapley值计算方法，适用于多种数据类型。

Abstract: Shapley values have several desirable, theoretically well-supported,
properties for explaining black-box model predictions. Traditionally, Shapley
values are computed post-hoc, leading to additional computational cost at
inference time. To overcome this, a novel method, called ViaSHAP, is proposed,
that learns a function to compute Shapley values, from which the predictions
can be derived directly by summation. Two approaches to implement the proposed
method are explored; one based on the universal approximation theorem and the
other on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Results from a
large-scale empirical investigation are presented, showing that ViaSHAP using
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks performs on par with state-of-the-art algorithms for
tabular data. It is also shown that the explanations of ViaSHAP are
significantly more accurate than the popular approximator FastSHAP on both
tabular data and images.

Conclusion: 该研究为更稳健的公平性审计开辟了新方向，强调了先验知识在防止操纵中的重要性。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of ML decision-making systems across products and services
has led to a set of regulations on how such systems should behave and be built.
Among all the technical challenges to enforcing these regulations, one crucial,
yet under-explored problem is the risk of manipulation while these systems are
being audited for fairness. This manipulation occurs when a platform
deliberately alters its answers to a regulator to pass an audit without
modifying its answers to other users. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach to manipulation-proof auditing by taking into account the auditor's
prior knowledge of the task solved by the platform. We first demonstrate that
regulators must not rely on public priors (e.g. a public dataset), as platforms
could easily fool the auditor in such cases. We then formally establish the
conditions under which an auditor can prevent audit manipulations using prior
knowledge about the ground truth. Finally, our experiments with two standard
datasets exemplify the maximum level of unfairness a platform can hide before
being detected as malicious. Our formalization and generalization of
manipulation-proof auditing with a prior opens up new research directions for
more robust fairness audits.

Motivation: 稀疏观测和低分辨率气候模型限制了区域决策，需要更强大的降尺度方法。现有AI方法在跨变量和地理区域的泛化能力不足，且受限于ViT自注意力的二次复杂度。

Method: ORBIT-2引入Reslim（轻量级架构）和TILES（降低自注意力复杂度的算法），支持大规模并行处理。

Result: 模型扩展到10亿参数，支持0.9 km分辨率，R^2得分0.98-0.99。

Conclusion: ORBIT-2为气候降尺度提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse observations and coarse-resolution climate models limit effective
regional decision-making, underscoring the need for robust downscaling.
However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and
geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision
Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation
model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates
two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture
with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust
prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces
self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence
processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters
across 32,768 GPUs, achieving up to 1.8 ExaFLOPS sustained throughput and
92-98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global
resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution
benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with R^2 scores in the range of 0.98
to 0.99 against observation data.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) in cyber physical systems (CPS) is a
complex task due to the challenges that arise in terms of real-time decision
making, safety, reliability, device heterogeneity, and data privacy. There are
also open research questions that must be addressed in order to fully realize
the potential of ML in CPS. Federated learning (FL), a distributed approach to
ML, has become increasingly popular in recent years. It allows models to be
trained using data from decentralized sources. This approach has been gaining
popularity in the CPS field, as it integrates computer, communication, and
physical processes. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to provide a
comprehensive analysis of the most recent developments of FL-CPS, including the
numerous application areas, system topologies, and algorithms developed in
recent years. The paper starts by discussing recent advances in both FL and
CPS, followed by their integration. Then, the paper compares the application of
FL in CPS with its applications in the internet of things (IoT) in further
depth to show their connections and distinctions. Furthermore, the article
scrutinizes how FL is utilized in critical CPS applications, e.g., intelligent
transportation systems, cybersecurity services, smart cities, and smart
healthcare solutions. The study also includes critical insights and lessons
learned from various FL-CPS implementations. The paper's concluding section
delves into significant concerns and suggests avenues for further research in

Motivation: 现有谱GNN使用低阶多项式滤波器可能无法充分识别图的谱特性，而增加多项式度数又会导致计算成本高或性能下降。

Method: 提出PieCoN，结合常数谱滤波器和多项式滤波器，通过自适应划分谱区间，扩展可学习的谱特性范围。

Result: 在九个基准数据集（包括同质和异质图）上的实验表明，PieCoN在异质图上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: PieCoN为解决谱GNN的局限性提供了一种有效方法，尤其在异质图应用中具有广泛潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success across various
domains by leveraging graph structures in data. Existing spectral GNNs, which
use low-degree polynomial filters to capture graph spectral properties, may not
fully identify the graph's spectral characteristics because of the polynomial's
small degree. However, increasing the polynomial degree is computationally
expensive and beyond certain thresholds leads to performance plateaus or
degradation. In this paper, we introduce the Piecewise Constant Spectral Graph
Neural Network(PieCoN) to address these challenges. PieCoN combines constant
spectral filters with polynomial filters to provide a more flexible way to
leverage the graph structure. By adaptively partitioning the spectrum into
intervals, our approach increases the range of spectral properties that can be
effectively learned. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including both
homophilic and heterophilic graphs, demonstrate that PieCoN is particularly
effective on heterophilic datasets, highlighting its potential for a wide range
of applications.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在联邦学习中未考虑客户隐私偏好，导致对非敏感信息的过度保护引入不必要噪声，影响模型性能。

Method: 定义PSI，优化LDP隐私预算分配，设计基于扰动信息分布的参数聚合机制。

Result: 在T-SROIE和DocTamper数据集上，FedRE表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedRE在保护隐私的同时提升了模型性能，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Despite Federated Learning (FL) employing gradient aggregation at the server
for distributed training to prevent the privacy leakage of raw data, private
information can still be divulged through the analysis of uploaded gradients
from clients. Substantial efforts have been made to integrate local
differential privacy (LDP) into the system to achieve a strict privacy
guarantee. However, existing methods fail to take practical issues into account
by merely perturbing each sample with the same mechanism while each client may
have their own privacy preferences on privacy-sensitive information (PSI),
which is not uniformly distributed across the raw data. In such a case,
excessive privacy protection from private-insensitive information can
additionally introduce unnecessary noise, which may degrade the model
performance. In this work, we study the PSI within data and develop FedRE, that
can simultaneously achieve robustness and effectiveness benefits with LDP
protection. More specifically, we first define PSI with regard to the privacy
preferences of each client. Then, we optimize the LDP by allocating less
privacy budget to gradients with higher PSI in a layer-wise manner, thus
providing a stricter privacy guarantee for PSI. Furthermore, to mitigate the
performance degradation caused by LDP, we design a parameter aggregation
mechanism based on the distribution of the perturbed information. We conducted
experiments with text tamper detection on T-SROIE and DocTamper datasets, and
FedRE achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 当前缺乏一种灵活的方法来在蛋白质生成模型中整合辅助信息（如实验反馈或现有分类器），以指导生成具有特定性质的蛋白质序列。

Method: 通过统一多种蛋白质生成模型（如掩码语言模型、自回归模型、扩散模型等），ProteinGuide提供了一种统计条件生成的方法。

Result: 该框架成功应用于ProteinMPNN和ESM3模型，生成了具有增强稳定性和特定折叠结构的氨基酸序列。

Conclusion: ProteinGuide为蛋白质工程提供了一个灵活且强大的工具，能够根据需要生成具有特定性质的蛋白质序列。

Abstract: Generative machine learning models have begun to transform protein
engineering, yet no principled framework for conditioning on auxiliary
information in a plug-and-play manner exists; one may want to iteratively
incorporate experimental feedback, or make use of an existing classifier --
such as for predicting enzyme commission number -- in order to guide the
sampling of the generative model to generate sequences with desired properties.
Herein, we present ProteinGuide, a rigorous and general framework to achieve
just that: through unifying a broad class of protein generative models that
includes masked language, (order-agnostic) autoregressive, diffusion and
flow-matching models, we provide an approach to statistically condition
pre-trained protein generative models. We demonstrate applicability of our
approach by guiding each of two commonly used protein generative models,
ProteinMPNN and ESM3, to generate amino acid and structure token sequences
conditioned on several user-specified properties, namely, enhanced stability
and CATH-labeled fold generation.

Method: 通过ABM生成五种代理的合成击键数据，分析滑动5秒窗口内的停留时间、飞行时间和错误率，比较OC-SVM和RF的性能。

Result: RF在单一键盘内用户识别表现良好（准确率>0.7），但跨键盘泛化能力差；OC-SVM则无法区分用户。

Conclusion: 键盘特定用户档案可能更可靠，且RF在捕捉用户细粒度模式上优于OC-SVM。

Abstract: Continuous authentication systems leveraging free-text keyboard dynamics
offer a promising additional layer of security in a multifactor authentication
setup that can be used in a transparent way with no impact on user experience.
This study investigates the efficacy of behavioral biometrics by employing an
Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate diverse typing profiles across mechanical
and membrane keyboards. Specifically, we generated synthetic keystroke data
from five unique agents, capturing features related to dwell time, flight time,
and error rates within sliding 5-second windows updated every second. Two
machine learning approaches, One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) and
Random Forest (RF), were evaluated for user verification. Results revealed a
stark contrast in performance: while One-Class SVM failed to differentiate
individual users within each group, Random Forest achieved robust
intra-keyboard user recognition (Accuracy > 0.7) but struggled to generalize
across keyboards for the same user, highlighting the significant impact of
keyboard hardware on typing behavior. These findings suggest that: (1)
keyboard-specific user profiles may be necessary for reliable authentication,
and (2) ensemble methods like RF outperform One-Class SVM in capturing
fine-grained user-specific patterns.

Result: 在MATH任务中准确率提升20%，测试时计算效率提高8-32倍，并展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: RL$^V$在提升性能和计算效率方面表现出色，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Prevalent reinforcement learning~(RL) methods for fine-tuning LLM reasoners,
such as GRPO or Leave-one-out PPO, abandon the learned value function in favor
of empirically estimated returns. This hinders test-time compute scaling that
relies on using the value-function for verification. In this work, we propose
RL$^V$ that augments any ``value-free'' RL method by jointly training the LLM
as both a reasoner and a generative verifier using RL-generated data, adding
verification capabilities without significant overhead. Empirically, RL$^V$
boosts MATH accuracy by over 20\% with parallel sampling and enables
$8-32\times$ efficient test-time compute scaling compared to the base RL
method. RL$^V$ also exhibits strong generalization capabilities for both
easy-to-hard and out-of-domain tasks. Furthermore, RL$^V$ achieves
$1.2-1.6\times$ higher performance when jointly scaling parallel and sequential
test-time compute with a long reasoning R1 model.

Result: 在6个真实数据集和10个主流TDP任务上，FedTDP优于13个先进基线方法。

Conclusion: FedTDP为联邦环境中的TDP提供了高效、隐私保护和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory data, which capture the movement patterns of people and vehicles
over time and space, are crucial for applications like traffic optimization and
urban planning. However, issues such as noise and incompleteness often
compromise data quality, leading to inaccurate trajectory analyses and limiting
the potential of these applications. While Trajectory Data Preparation (TDP)
can enhance data quality, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i)
they do not address data privacy concerns, particularly in federated settings
where trajectory data sharing is prohibited, and (ii) they typically design
task-specific models that lack generalizability across diverse TDP scenarios.
To overcome these challenges, we propose FedTDP, a privacy-preserving and
unified framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for TDP in federated environments. Specifically, we: (i) design a
trajectory privacy autoencoder to secure data transmission and protect privacy,
(ii) introduce a trajectory knowledge enhancer to improve model learning of
TDP-related knowledge, enabling the development of TDP-oriented LLMs, and (iii)
propose federated parallel optimization to enhance training efficiency by
reducing data transmission and enabling parallel model training. Experiments on
6 real datasets and 10 mainstream TDP tasks demonstrate that FedTDP
consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 提出ConCISE框架，结合置信度注入和早期停止机制。

Result: 输出长度减少约50%，任务准确率保持高水平。

Conclusion: ConCISE在多个推理基准测试中优于现有基线。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) perform strongly in complex reasoning tasks via
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but often suffer from verbose outputs caused
by redundant content, increasing computational overhead, and degrading user
experience. Existing compression methods either operate post-hoc pruning,
risking disruption to reasoning coherence, or rely on sampling-based selection,
which fails to intervene effectively during generation. In this work, we
introduce a confidence-guided perspective to explain the emergence of redundant
reflection in LRMs, identifying two key patterns: Confidence Deficit, where the
model reconsiders correct steps due to low internal confidence, and Termination
Delay, where reasoning continues even after reaching a confident answer. Based
on this analysis, we propose ConCISE (Confidence-guided Compression In
Step-by-step Efficient Reasoning), a framework that simplifies reasoning chains
by reinforcing the model's confidence during inference, thus preventing the
generation of redundant reflection steps. It integrates Confidence Injection to
stabilize intermediate steps and Early Stopping to terminate reasoning when
confidence is sufficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
LRMs on ConCISE-generated data yields significantly shorter outputs, reducing
length by up to approximately 50% under SimPO, while maintaining high task
accuracy. ConCISE consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

Result: SIRA在七种最新水印方法上攻击成功率近100%，成本仅0.88美元/百万标记。

Conclusion: 当前水印算法存在普遍漏洞，亟需设计更鲁棒的水印技术。

Abstract: Text watermarking aims to subtly embed statistical signals into text by
controlling the Large Language Model (LLM)'s sampling process, enabling
watermark detectors to verify that the output was generated by the specified
model. The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor
in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed
watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we
reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing
a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic
efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA),
which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each
token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our
work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking
algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack
success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per
million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark
algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the
attack model, even mobile-level models. Our findings highlight the urgent need
for more robust watermarking.

Conclusion: MTL-UE在多任务学习中具有高效、鲁棒和通用性，支持密集预测任务且易于集成现有方法。

Abstract: Most existing unlearnable strategies focus on preventing unauthorized users
from training single-task learning (STL) models with personal data.
Nevertheless, the paradigm has recently shifted towards multi-task data and
multi-task learning (MTL), targeting generalist and foundation models that can
handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Despite their growing importance, MTL
data and models have been largely neglected while pursuing unlearnable
strategies. This paper presents MTL-UE, the first unified framework for
generating unlearnable examples for multi-task data and MTL models. Instead of
optimizing perturbations for each sample, we design a generator-based structure
that introduces label priors and class-wise feature embeddings which leads to
much better attacking performance. In addition, MTL-UE incorporates intra-task
and inter-task embedding regularization to increase inter-class separation and
suppress intra-class variance which enhances the attack robustness greatly.
Furthermore, MTL-UE is versatile with good supports for dense prediction tasks
in MTL. It is also plug-and-play allowing integrating existing
surrogate-dependent unlearnable methods with little adaptation. Extensive

TLDR: CCCVAE是一种新型变分自编码器框架，通过整合细胞间通信信号改进单细胞RNA测序数据的表示学习，优于传统VAE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解细胞间通信（CCC）对揭示细胞异质性和功能至关重要，但现有方法未充分利用这一信息。

Method: 提出CCCVAE，利用配体-受体相互作用的通信感知核和稀疏高斯过程，将生物先验知识嵌入潜在空间。

Result: 在四个scRNA-seq数据集上，CCCVAE的聚类性能优于传统VAE。

Conclusion: CCCVAE展示了将生物先验嵌入深度生成模型对单细胞分析的价值。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed complex cellular
heterogeneity, but recent studies emphasize that understanding biological
function also requires modeling cell-cell communication (CCC), the signaling
interactions mediated by ligand-receptor pairs that coordinate cellular
behavior. Tools like CellChat have demonstrated that CCC plays a critical role
in processes such as cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and immune
response, and that transcriptomic data inherently encodes rich information
about intercellular signaling. We propose CCCVAE, a novel variational
autoencoder framework that incorporates CCC signals into single-cell
representation learning. By leveraging a communication-aware kernel derived
from ligand-receptor interactions and a sparse Gaussian process, CCCVAE encodes
biologically informed priors into the latent space. Unlike conventional VAEs
that treat each cell independently, CCCVAE encourages latent embeddings to
reflect both transcriptional similarity and intercellular signaling context.
Empirical results across four scRNA-seq datasets show that CCCVAE improves
clustering performance, achieving higher evaluation scores than standard VAE
baselines. This work demonstrates the value of embedding biological priors into
deep generative models for unsupervised single-cell analysis.

TLDR: TH-GCN是一种基于图神经网络的5G网络切换优化方法，显著减少切换次数并提升信号质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络在高移动性环境中因覆盖有限和频繁切换导致网络不稳定，影响实时应用。

Method: 利用图神经网络建模车辆和基站为动态图节点，结合信号质量、吞吐量等特征，实现自适应切换决策。

Result: 模拟结果显示，TH-GCN减少切换次数达78%，信号质量提升10%。

Conclusion: TH-GCN通过双中心视角优化切换管理，显著提升5G网络稳定性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 5G has transformed vehicular networks, offering high
bandwidth, low latency, and fast data rates essential for real-time
applications in smart cities and vehicles. These improvements enhance traffic
safety and entertainment services. However, the limited coverage and frequent
handovers in 5G networks cause network instability, especially in high-mobility
environments due to the ping-pong effect. This paper presents TH-GCN
(Throughput-oriented Graph Convolutional Network), a novel approach for
optimizing handover management in dense 5G networks. Using graph neural
networks (GNNs), TH-GCN models vehicles and base stations as nodes in a dynamic
graph enriched with features such as signal quality, throughput, vehicle speed,
and base station load. By integrating both user equipment and base station
perspectives, this dual-centric approach enables adaptive, real-time handover
decisions that improve network stability. Simulation results show that TH-GCN
reduces handovers by up to 78 percent and improves signal quality by 10
percent, outperforming existing methods.

TLDR: 本文首次在多层神经网络中，针对有限宽度比例机制下的单指标回归模型，提供了梯度下降迭代的精确分布特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论（如NTK、MF和TP）主要基于无限宽度假设，且对初始化敏感或依赖特殊初始化方案。本文旨在填补有限宽度机制下的理论空白，并扩展对训练和泛化误差的理解。

Method: 提出非渐近状态演化理论，捕捉第一层权重的高斯波动和深层权重的集中性，适用于非高斯特征。

Result: 理论在有限宽度机制下有效，支持从个体初始化开始的权重演化，并同时分析训练和泛化误差。

Conclusion: 梯度下降学习的模型保留了单指标函数结构，且能通过增强方法估计泛化误差，指导早期停止和超参数调优。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first precise distributional characterization
of gradient descent iterates for general multi-layer neural networks under the
canonical single-index regression model, in the `finite-width proportional
regime' where the sample size and feature dimension grow proportionally while
the network width and depth remain bounded. Our non-asymptotic state evolution
theory captures Gaussian fluctuations in first-layer weights and concentration
in deeper-layer weights, and remains valid for non-Gaussian features.
  Our theory differs from existing neural tangent kernel (NTK), mean-field (MF)
theories and tensor program (TP) in several key aspects. First, our theory
operates in the finite-width regime whereas these existing theories are
fundamentally infinite-width. Second, our theory allows weights to evolve from
individual initializations beyond the lazy training regime, whereas NTK and MF
are either frozen at or only weakly sensitive to initialization, and TP relies
on special initialization schemes. Third, our theory characterizes both
training and generalization errors for general multi-layer neural networks
beyond the uniform convergence regime, whereas existing theories study
generalization almost exclusively in two-layer settings.
  As a statistical application, we show that vanilla gradient descent can be
augmented to yield consistent estimates of the generalization error at each
iteration, which can be used to guide early stopping and hyperparameter tuning.
As a further theoretical implication, we show that despite model
misspecification, the model learned by gradient descent retains the structure
of a single-index function with an effective signal determined by a linear
combination of the true signal and the initialization.

Motivation: 可穿戴设备生成大量未标记数据，数据分布异构且标注成本高，传统迁移学习方法效果不佳。

Method: 使用变分自编码器（VAE）学习共享低维潜在空间，结合对比学习增强特征表示，提出VaCDA框架。

Result: VaCDA在跨位置和跨设备场景中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VaCDA能有效减少数据异构性，提升跨域活动识别的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Technological advancements have led to the rise of wearable devices with
sensors that continuously monitor user activities, generating vast amounts of
unlabeled data. This data is challenging to interpret, and manual annotation is
labor-intensive and error-prone. Additionally, data distribution is often
heterogeneous due to device placement, type, and user behavior variations. As a
result, traditional transfer learning methods perform suboptimally, making it
difficult to recognize daily activities. To address these challenges, we use a
variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a shared, low-dimensional latent space
from available sensor data. This space generalizes data across diverse sensors,
mitigating heterogeneity and aiding robust adaptation to the target domain. We
integrate contrastive learning to enhance feature representation by aligning
instances of the same class across domains while separating different classes.
We propose Variational Contrastive Domain Adaptation (VaCDA), a multi-source
domain adaptation framework combining VAEs and contrastive learning to improve
feature representation and reduce heterogeneity between source and target
domains. We evaluate VaCDA on multiple publicly available datasets across three
heterogeneity scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, and cross-device. VaCDA
outperforms the baselines in cross-position and cross-device scenarios.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在天气预测中常忽略物理规律或地球拓扑结构，PASSAT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PASSAT通过数值求解球面上的平流方程和Navier-Stokes方程，并结合球形图神经网络捕捉地球-大气相互作用。

Result: 在5.625°分辨率的ERA5数据集上，PASSAT表现优于现有深度学习和数值天气预测模型。

Conclusion: PASSAT通过结合物理和拓扑信息，显著提升了天气预测的准确性。

Abstract: Although deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable potential in
weather prediction, most of them overlook either the \textbf{physics} of the
underlying weather evolution or the \textbf{topology} of the Earth's surface.
In light of these disadvantages, we develop PASSAT, a novel Physics-ASSisted
And Topology-informed deep learning model for weather prediction. PASSAT
attributes the weather evolution to two key factors: (i) the advection process
that can be characterized by the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes
equation; (ii) the Earth-atmosphere interaction that is difficult to both model
and calculate. PASSAT also takes the topology of the Earth's surface into
consideration, other than simply treating it as a plane. With these
considerations, PASSAT numerically solves the advection equation and the
Navier-Stokes equation on the spherical manifold, utilizes a spherical graph
neural network to capture the Earth-atmosphere interaction, and generates the
initial velocity fields that are critical to solving the advection equation
from the same spherical graph neural network. In the $5.625^\circ$-resolution
ERA5 data set, PASSAT outperforms both the state-of-the-art deep learning-based
weather prediction models and the operational numerical weather prediction
model IFS T42. Code and checkpoint are available at

Abstract: Trustworthy depression prediction based on deep learning, incorporating both
predictive reliability and algorithmic fairness across diverse demographic
groups, is crucial for clinical application. Recently, achieving reliable
depression predictions through uncertainty quantification has attracted
increasing attention. However, few studies have focused on the fairness of
uncertainty quantification (UQ) in depression prediction. In this work, we
investigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage
(EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for
depression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions
through group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants
by different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify
uncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically
guaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and
facilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups.
Furthermore, we propose a fairness-aware optimization strategy that formulates
fairness as a constrained optimization problem under EOC constraints. This
enables the model to preserve predictive reliability while adapting to the
heterogeneous uncertainty levels across demographic groups, thereby achieving
optimal fairness. Through extensive evaluations on several visual and audio
depression datasets, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness.

Abstract: While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have become increasingly popular across various
scientific disciplines for their ability to model and interlink huge quantities
of data, essentially all real-world KGs are known to be incomplete. As such,
with the growth of KG use has been a concurrent development of machine learning
tools designed to predict missing information in KGs, which is referred to as
the Link Prediction Task. The majority of state-of-the-art link predictors to
date have followed an embedding-based paradigm. In this paradigm, it is assumed
that the information content of a KG is best represented by the (individual)
vector representations of its nodes and edges, and that therefore node and edge
embeddings are particularly well-suited to performing link prediction.
  This thesis proposes an alternative perspective on the field's approach to
link prediction and KG data modelling. Specifically, this work re-analyses KGs
and state-of-the-art link predictors from a graph-structure-first perspective
that models the information content of a KG in terms of whole triples, rather
than individual nodes and edges.
  Following a literature review and two core sets of experiments, this thesis
concludes that a structure-first perspective on KGs and link prediction is both
viable and useful for understanding KG learning and for enabling cross-KG
transfer learning for the link prediction task. This observation is used to
create and propose the Structural Alignment Hypothesis, which postulates that
link prediction can be understood and modelled as a structural task.
  All code and data used for this thesis are open-sourced. This thesis was
written bilingually, with the main document in English and an informal extended
summary in Irish. An Irish-language translation dictionary of machine learning
terms (the Focl\'oir Tr\'achtais) created for this work is open-sourced as
well.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型在生成高质量样本方面表现出色，但在表示学习中的应用尚未充分探索，尤其是在图表示学习中。本文旨在探索DPMs在图表示学习中的潜力。

Method: 提出Graffe模型，包含图编码器和扩散解码器。编码器将图压缩为紧凑表示，作为解码器去噪过程的指导条件。理论证明去噪目标隐式最大化数据与表示的条件互信息。

Result: 理论证明去噪分数匹配损失的负对数是一个可处理的条件互信息下界。实验表明Graffe在节点和图分类任务中表现优异，在11个数据集中9个达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型是图表示学习的有效工具，Graffe展示了其在理论和实践中的潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), widely recognized for their potential
to generate high-quality samples, tend to go unnoticed in representation
learning. While recent progress has highlighted their potential for capturing
visual semantics, adapting DPMs to graph representation learning remains in its
infancy. In this paper, we introduce Graffe, a self-supervised diffusion model
proposed for graph representation learning. It features a graph encoder that
distills a source graph into a compact representation, which, in turn, serves
as the condition to guide the denoising process of the diffusion decoder. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we first explore the theoretical
foundations of applying diffusion models to representation learning, proving
that the denoising objective implicitly maximizes the conditional mutual
information between data and its representation. Specifically, we prove that
the negative logarithm of the denoising score matching loss is a tractable
lower bound for the conditional mutual information. Empirically, we conduct a
series of case studies to validate our theoretical insights. In addition,
Graffe delivers competitive results under the linear probing setting on node
and graph classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 9 of
the 11 real-world datasets. These findings indicate that powerful generative
models, especially diffusion models, serve as an effective tool for graph
representation learning.

Motivation: 传统离散变换（如傅里叶变换）依赖对数据集特性的了解，缺乏适应性。

Result: GT在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务中表现优于传统变换方法。

Conclusion: GT是一种有效的自适应变换表示方法，适用于多样化学习场景。

Abstract: Discrete transforms, such as the discrete Fourier transform, are widely used
in machine learning to improve model performance by extracting meaningful
features. However, with numerous transforms available, selecting an appropriate
one often depends on understanding the dataset's properties, making the
approach less effective when such knowledge is unavailable. In this work, we
propose General Transform (GT), an adaptive transform-based representation
designed for machine learning applications. Unlike conventional transforms, GT
learns data-driven mapping tailored to the dataset and task of interest. Here,
we demonstrate that models incorporating GT outperform conventional
transform-based approaches across computer vision and natural language
processing tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in diverse learning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态拓扑下THz无人机网络中功率和天线阵列资源分配的复杂性问题，因混合整数非线性规划（MINLP）问题的高难度。

Method: 结合GNN和DRL，强调自节点特征，利用多任务结构协同训练所有无人机的功率和子阵列资源分配决策。

Result: GLOVE在资源效率和延迟方面优于基准方案，且训练过程中零丢包，表现出更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GLOVE为动态THz无人机网络提供了一种高效、鲁棒的资源分配解决方案。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with flexible
topologies and ultra-high data rates are expected to empower numerous
applications in security surveillance, disaster response, and environmental
monitoring, among others. However, the dynamic topologies hinder the efficient
long-term joint power and antenna array resource allocation for THz links among
UAVs. Furthermore, the continuous nature of power and the discrete nature of
antennas cause this joint resource allocation problem to be a mixed-integer
nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with non-convexity and NP-hardness.
Inspired by recent rapid advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a
graph neural network (GNN) aided DRL algorithm for resource allocation in the
dynamic THz UAV network with an emphasis on self-node features (GLOVE) is
proposed in this paper, with the aim of resource efficiency (RE) maximization.
When training the allocation policy for each UAV, GLOVE learns the relationship
between this UAV and its neighboring UAVs via GNN, while also emphasizing the
important self-node features of this UAV. In addition, a multi-task structure
is leveraged by GLOVE to cooperatively train resource allocation decisions for
the power and sub-arrays of all UAVs. Experimental results illustrate that
GLOVE outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of the highest RE and the lowest
latency. Moreover, unlike the benchmark methods with severe packet loss, GLOVE
maintains zero packet loss during the entire training process, demonstrating
its better robustness under the highly dynamic THz UAV network.

Result: HPO显著提升合成数据质量，TVAE、CTGAN和CTAB-GAN+分别提升60%、39%和38%，但所有模型均存在生存约束违规。预处理和后处理对减少违规至关重要。

Conclusion: HPO需结合领域知识以确保合成数据的临床有效性，未来需优化指标选择并扩大验证数据集。

Abstract: The generation of synthetic clinical trial data offers a promising approach
to mitigating privacy concerns and data accessibility limitations in medical
research. However, ensuring that synthetic datasets maintain high fidelity,
utility, and adherence to domain-specific constraints remains a key challenge.
While hyperparameter optimization (HPO) has been shown to improve generative
model performance, the effectiveness of different optimization strategies for
synthetic clinical data remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates
four HPO strategies across eight generative models, comparing single-metric
optimization against compound metric optimization approaches. Our results
demonstrate that HPO consistently improves synthetic data quality, with TVAE,
CTGAN, and CTAB-GAN+ achieving improvements of up to 60%, 39%, and 38%,
respectively. Compound metric optimization outperformed single-metric
strategies, producing more balanced and generalizable synthetic datasets.
Interestingly, HPO alone is insufficient to ensure clinically valid synthetic
data, as all models exhibited violations of fundamental survival constraints.
Preprocessing and postprocessing played a crucial role in reducing these
violations, as models lacking robust processing steps produced invalid data in
up to 61% of cases. These findings underscore the necessity of integrating
explicit domain knowledge alongside HPO to create high quality synthetic
datasets. Our study provides actionable recommendations for improving synthetic
data generation, with future research needed to refine metric selection and
validate these findings on larger datasets to enhance clinical applicability.

Conclusion: 通过巧妙组合现有组件，RVAE-ST在时间序列生成任务中达到或超越现有最优模型。

Abstract: We present a simple yet effective generative model for time series data based
on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with recurrent layers, referred to as the
Recurrent Variational Autoencoder with Subsequent Training (RVAE-ST). Our
method introduces an adapted training scheme that progressively increases the
sequence length, addressing the challenge recurrent layers typically face when
modeling long sequences. By leveraging the recurrent architecture, the model
maintains a constant number of parameters regardless of sequence length. This
design encourages approximate time-shift equivariance and enables efficient
modeling of long-range temporal dependencies. Rather than introducing a
fundamentally new architecture, we show that a carefully composed combination
of known components can match or outperform state-of-the-art generative models
on several benchmark datasets. Our model performs particularly well on time
series that exhibit quasi-periodic structure,while remaining competitive on
datasets with more irregular or partially non-stationary behavior. We evaluate
its performance using ELBO, Fr\'echet Distance, discriminative scores, and
visualizations of the learned embeddings.

Result: 理论证明方法具有均匀逼近和有界时间分数，实验在互信息和密度估计任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: D3RE框架有效解决了密度比估计中的关键问题，提供了稳健且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Density ratio estimation is fundamental to tasks involving $f$-divergences,
yet existing methods often fail under significantly different distributions or
inadequately overlap supports, suffering from the \textit{density-chasm} and
the \textit{support-chasm} problems. Additionally, prior approaches yield
divergent time scores near boundaries, leading to instability. We propose
$\text{D}^3\text{RE}$, a unified framework for robust and efficient density
ratio estimation. It introduces the Dequantified Diffusion-Bridge Interpolant
(DDBI), which expands support coverage and stabilizes time scores via diffusion
bridges and Gaussian dequantization. Building on DDBI, the Dequantified
Schr\"odinger-Bridge Interpolant (DSBI) incorporates optimal transport to solve
the Schr\"odinger bridge problem, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method
offers uniform approximation and bounded time scores in theory, and outperforms
baselines empirically in mutual information and density estimation tasks.

Abstract: Project and task scheduling under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge
in program and project management, where accurate estimation of task durations
and dependencies is critical for delivering complex, multi project systems. The
Program Evaluation and Review Technique provides a probabilistic framework to
model task variability and critical paths. In this paper, the author presents a
novel formulation of PERT scheduling as an energy minimization problem within a
Hopfield neural network architecture. By mapping task start times and
precedence constraints into a neural computation framework, the networks
inherent optimization dynamics is exploited to approximate globally consistent
schedules. The author addresses key theoretical issues related to energy
function differentiability, constraint encoding, and convergence, and extends
the Hopfield model for structured precedence graphs. Numerical simulations on
synthetic project networks comprising up to 1000 tasks demonstrate the
viability of this approach, achieving near optimal makespans with minimal
constraint violations. The findings suggest that neural optimization models
offer a promising direction for scalable and adaptive project tasks scheduling
under uncertainty in areas such as the agentic AI workflows, microservice based
applications that the modern AI systems are being built upon.

Motivation: 现有基准仅评估英语提示，忽视了多语言开发者在现实中使用代码混合语言的需求。

Method: 基于BigCodeBench，引入三种语言对的代码混合提示，评估不同规模的LLMs。

Result: 代码混合提示导致Pass@1性能下降，尤其是小模型在高CMD水平下表现更差。

Conclusion: CodeMixBench为多语言代码生成提供了现实评估框架，并指出了构建鲁棒模型的新挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code
generation tasks, powering various applications like code completion,
debugging, and programming assistance. However, existing benchmarks such as
HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench primarily evaluate LLMs on English-only
prompts, overlooking the real-world scenario where multilingual developers
often use code-mixed language while interacting with LLMs. To address this gap,
we introduce CodeMixBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness of LLMs on code generation from code-mixed prompts. Built upon
BigCodeBench, CodeMixBench introduces controlled code-mixing (CMD) into the
natural language parts of prompts across three language pairs: Hinglish
(Hindi-English), Spanish-English, and Chinese Pinyin-English. We
comprehensively evaluate a diverse set of open-source code generation models
ranging from 1.5B to 15B parameters. Our results show that code-mixed prompts
consistently degrade Pass@1 performance compared to their English-only
counterparts, with performance drops increasing under higher CMD levels for
smaller models. CodeMixBench provides a realistic evaluation framework for
studying multilingual code generation and highlights new challenges and
directions for building robust code generation models that generalize well

Conclusion: WaterDrum为LLM遗忘提供了一种更准确的评估工具，新数据集推动了相关研究的标准化。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning is critical in real-world applications
where it is necessary to efficiently remove the influence of private,
copyrighted, or harmful data from some users. However, existing utility-centric
unlearning metrics (based on model utility) may fail to accurately evaluate the
extent of unlearning in realistic settings such as when (a) the forget and
retain set have semantically similar content, (b) retraining the model from
scratch on the retain set is impractical, and/or (c) the model owner can
improve the unlearning metric without directly performing unlearning on the
LLM. This paper presents the first data-centric unlearning metric for LLMs
called WaterDrum that exploits robust text watermarking for overcoming these
limitations. We also introduce new benchmark datasets for LLM unlearning that
contain varying levels of similar data points and can be used to rigorously
evaluate unlearning algorithms using WaterDrum. Our code is available at
https://github.com/lululu008/WaterDrum and our new benchmark datasets are
released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Glow-AI/WaterDrum-Ax.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散数据生成方法存在嵌入连续空间或依赖近似变分损失的问题，ItDPDM旨在同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 引入泊松扩散过程和信息论离散泊松扩散模型（ItDPDM），提出泊松重建损失（PRL）并与真实负对数似然建立精确关系。

Result: 在Lakh MIDI和CIFAR-10数据集上，ItDPDM显著降低测试NLL达80%，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: ItDPDM通过直接操作离散空间和精确损失关系，显著提升了生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Existing methods for generative modeling of discrete data, such as symbolic
music tokens, face two primary challenges: (1) they either embed discrete
inputs into continuous state-spaces or (2) rely on variational losses that only
approximate the true negative log-likelihood. Previous efforts have
individually targeted these limitations. While information-theoretic Gaussian
diffusion models alleviate the suboptimality of variational losses, they still
perform modeling in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce the
Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), which
simultaneously addresses both limitations by directly operating in a discrete
state-space via a Poisson diffusion process inspired by photon arrival
processes in camera sensors. We introduce a novel Poisson Reconstruction Loss
(PRL) and derive an exact relationship between PRL and the true negative
log-likelihood, thereby eliminating the need for approximate evidence lower
bounds. Experiments conducted on the Lakh MIDI symbolic music dataset and the
CIFAR-10 image benchmark demonstrate that ItDPDM delivers significant
improvements, reducing test NLL by up to 80% compared to prior baselines, while
also achieving faster convergence.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了设备端学习中的内存和计算瓶颈。

Abstract: On-device learning has emerged as a promising direction for AI development,

heart disease may be revealed. The results show that the network features
extracted based on the difference network are important, and the framework we
proposed provides more accurate predictions than other strong models in terms

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在保护数据隐私的同时实现分布式客户端的协作模型训练，但面临通信资源有限、统计异质性和客户端参与不平衡等挑战。

Method: 采用去中心化的马尔可夫调度策略，客户端根据年龄相关的选择概率独立管理参与，平衡训练轮次中的客户端更新，并提供收敛性证明。

Result: 通过仿真验证，AoI方法（特别是最优马尔可夫变体）在IID和非IID数据设置下分别比FedAvg方法收敛性能提升7.5%和高达20%。

Conclusion: 基于AoI的调度策略在多样化学习环境中实现了可扩展、公平且高效的联邦学习系统。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework that preserves data
privacy while enabling collaborative model training across distributed clients.
However, FL faces significant challenges due to limited communication
resources, statistical heterogeneity, and the need for balanced client
participation. This paper proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-based client
selection policy that addresses these challenges by minimizing load imbalance
through controlled selection intervals. Our method employs a decentralized
Markov scheduling policy, allowing clients to independently manage
participation based on age-dependent selection probabilities, which balances
client updates across training rounds with minimal central oversight. We
provide a convergence proof for our method, demonstrating that it ensures
stable and efficient model convergence. Specifically, we derive optimal
parameters for the Markov selection model to achieve balanced and consistent
client participation, highlighting the benefits of AoI in enhancing convergence
stability. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our AoI-based
method, particularly the optimal Markov variant, improves convergence over the
FedAvg selection approach across both IID and non-IID data settings by $7.5\%$
and up to $20\%$. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of AoI-based
scheduling for scalable, fair, and efficient FL systems across diverse learning
environments.

TLDR: USPR（统一求解器）通过创新的嵌入、注意力机制和分数调整，解决了PVRP中RL方法的局限性，实现了灵活性和计算效率的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法在PVRP中需要针对每种新分布重新训练，泛化能力差。USPR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: USPR引入三种创新：Profile Embeddings、Multi-Head Profiled Attention和Profile-aware Score Reshaping。

Result: USPR在多种PVRP基准测试中表现优异，达到学习方法的最高水平。

Conclusion: USPR为PVRP提供了灵活且高效的解决方案，代码已开源以促进研究。

Abstract: The Profiled Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP) extends the classical VRP by
incorporating vehicle-client-specific preferences and constraints, reflecting
real-world requirements such as zone restrictions and service-level
preferences. While recent reinforcement learning (RL) solvers have shown
promise, they require retraining for each new profile distribution, suffer from
poor representation ability, and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution
instances. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing USPR
(Unified Solver for Profiled Routing), a novel framework that natively handles
arbitrary profile types. USPR introduces three key innovations: (i) Profile
Embeddings (PE) to encode any combination of profile types; (ii) Multi-Head
Profiled Attention (MHPA), an attention mechanism that models rich interactions
between vehicles and clients; (iii) Profile-aware Score Reshaping (PSR), which
dynamically adjusts decoder logits using profile scores to improve
generalization. Empirical results on diverse PVRP benchmarks demonstrate that
USPR achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based methods while
offering significant gains in flexibility and computational efficiency. We make
our source code publicly available to foster future research at

TLDR: ADAC是一种新的离线强化学习方法，通过优势调制评估OOD动作，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线RL存在分布偏移问题，现有方法保守地抑制所有OOD动作，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出ADAC，利用批量最优值函数评估OOD动作，并通过优势函数调制Q函数更新。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，ADAC在几乎所有任务上达到最先进性能，尤其在挑战性任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: ADAC通过精确评估OOD动作，显著提升了离线RL的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn decision-making policies
from fixed datasets without online interactions, providing a practical solution
where online data collection is expensive or risky. However, offline RL often
suffers from distribution shift, resulting in inaccurate evaluation and
substantial overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address
this, existing approaches incorporate conservatism by indiscriminately
discouraging all OOD actions, thereby hindering the agent's ability to
generalize and exploit beneficial ones. In this paper, we propose
Advantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), a novel method that
systematically evaluates OOD actions using the batch-optimal value function.
Based on this evaluation, ADAC defines an advantage function to modulate the
Q-function update, enabling more precise assessment of OOD action quality. We
design a custom PointMaze environment and collect datasets to visually reveal
that advantage modulation can effectively identify and select superior OOD
actions. Extensive experiments show that ADAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on almost all tasks in the D4RL benchmark, with particularly clear
margins on the more challenging tasks.

Conclusion: 扩散模型在异常检测中具有高效性和实用性，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task in machine learning and data mining,
with significant applications in cybersecurity, industrial fault diagnosis, and
clinical disease monitoring. Traditional methods, such as statistical modeling
and machine learning-based approaches, often face challenges in handling
complex, high-dimensional data distributions. In this study, we explore the
potential of diffusion models for anomaly detection, proposing a novel
framework that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs)
to effectively identify anomalies in both image and audio data. The proposed
method models the distribution of normal data through a diffusion process and
reconstructs input data via reverse diffusion, using a combination of
reconstruction errors and semantic discrepancies as anomaly indicators. To
enhance the framework's performance, we introduce multi-scale feature
extraction, attention mechanisms, and wavelet-domain representations, enabling
the model to capture fine-grained structures and global dependencies in the
data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MVTec AD and
UrbanSound8K, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly
detection techniques, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse
data modalities. This research highlights the effectiveness of diffusion models
in anomaly detection and provides a robust and efficient solution for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LTH掩码无法泛化到新的随机初始化，假设这是由于盆地未对齐造成的。

Method: 提出在稀疏训练时排列LTH掩码以对齐新的优化盆地。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上，使用排列后的LTH掩码显著提高了泛化性能。

Conclusion: 排列LTH掩码是解决其泛化问题的有效方法。

Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests there exists a sparse LTH mask
and weights that achieve the same generalization performance as the dense model
while using significantly fewer parameters. However, finding a LTH solution is
computationally expensive, and a LTH sparsity mask does not generalize to other
random weight initializations. Recent work has suggested that neural networks
trained from random initialization find solutions within the same basin modulo
permutation, and proposes a method to align trained models within the same loss
basin. We hypothesize that misalignment of basins is the reason why LTH masks
do not generalize to new random initializations and propose permuting the LTH
mask to align with the new optimization basin when performing sparse training
from a different random init. We empirically show a significant increase in
generalization when sparse training from random initialization with the
permuted mask as compared to using the non-permuted LTH mask, on multiple
datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and models (VGG11, ResNet20 and
ResNet50).

Result: 发现信号集中在六维子空间，其中四个维度跟踪个位数，两个维度跟踪整体大小，并识别了自校正机制。

Conclusion: 通过跟踪低维子空间，揭示了模型细粒度计算结构的洞察。

Abstract: To perform in-context learning, language models must extract signals from
individual few-shot examples, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule,
and then apply this rule to new examples. How is this implemented in the
forward pass of modern transformer models? To study this, we consider a
structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule
is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We find that Llama-3-8B attains high
accuracy on this task for a range of $k$, and localize its few-shot ability to
just three attention heads via a novel optimization approach. We further show
the extracted signals lie in a six-dimensional subspace, where four of the
dimensions track the unit digit and the other two dimensions track overall
magnitude. We finally examine how these heads extract information from
individual few-shot examples, identifying a self-correction mechanism in which
mistakes from earlier examples are suppressed by later examples. Our results
demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces across a forward pass can
provide insight into fine-grained computational structures.

Conclusion: 当时间范围$T$远大于代理数$n$时，上下界差距仅为$T$的对数因子。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a new decision-making problem called the bandit
max-min fair allocation (BMMFA) problem. The goal of this problem is to
maximize the minimum utility among agents with additive valuations by
repeatedly assigning indivisible goods to them. One key feature of this problem
is that each agent's valuation for each item can only be observed through the
semi-bandit feedback, while existing work supposes that the item values are
provided at the beginning of each round. Another key feature is that the
algorithm's reward function is not additive with respect to rounds, unlike most
bandit-setting problems.
  Our first contribution is to propose an algorithm that has an asymptotic
regret bound of $O(m\sqrt{T}\ln T/n + m\sqrt{T \ln(mnT)})$, where $n$ is the
number of agents, $m$ is the number of items, and $T$ is the time horizon. This
is based on a novel combination of bandit techniques and a resource allocation
algorithm studied in the literature on competitive analysis. Our second
contribution is to provide the regret lower bound of $\Omega(m\sqrt{T}/n)$.
When $T$ is sufficiently larger than $n$, the gap between the upper and lower
bounds is a logarithmic factor of $T$.

Result: 在15个基准测试中，GMoP在OpenworldAUC及其他指标上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: OpenworldAUC和GMoP为开放世界场景提供了一种有效的联合评估和优化方法。

Abstract: Prompt tuning adapts Vision-Language Models like CLIP to open-world tasks
with minimal training costs. In this direction, one typical paradigm evaluates
model performance separately on known classes (i.e., base domain) and unseen
classes (i.e., new domain). However, real-world scenarios require models to
handle inputs without prior domain knowledge. This practical challenge has
spurred the development of open-world prompt tuning, which demands a unified
evaluation of two stages: 1) detecting whether an input belongs to the base or
new domain (P1), and 2) classifying the sample into its correct class (P2).
What's more, as domain distributions are generally unknown, a proper metric
should be insensitive to varying base/new sample ratios (P3). However, we find
that current metrics, including HM, overall accuracy, and AUROC, fail to
satisfy these three properties simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose
OpenworldAUC, a unified metric that jointly assesses detection and
classification through pairwise instance comparisons. To optimize OpenworldAUC
effectively, we introduce Gated Mixture-of-Prompts (GMoP), which employs
domain-specific prompts and a gating mechanism to dynamically balance detection
and classification. Theoretical guarantees ensure generalization of GMoP under
practical conditions. Experiments on 15 benchmarks in open-world scenarios show
GMoP achieves SOTA performance on OpenworldAUC and other metrics. We release
the code at https://github.com/huacong/OpenworldAUC

<details>

Motivation: 反向传播（BP）依赖全局梯度同步，限制了可扩展性并增加了内存开销。

Method: SVP将层激活视为潜在变量，优化局部证据下界（ELBO），通过固定随机矩阵投影防止表示崩溃，并结合特征对齐损失保持层间一致性。

Result: SVP在多种架构和数据集上达到与BP相当的准确度，内存使用减少4倍，显著提升可扩展性。

Conclusion: SVP为深度表示学习引入了概率视角，推动了模块化和可解释性神经网络设计的发展。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on
global gradient synchronization limits scalability and imposes significant
memory overhead. We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a
scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational
inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local
Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while
preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in
layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive
compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional
spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and
representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for
inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across
diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to
ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves
scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep
representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable
neural network design.

Abstract: Estimating long-term causal effects by combining long-term observational and
short-term experimental data is a crucial but challenging problem in many
real-world scenarios. In existing methods, several ideal assumptions, e.g.
latent unconfoundedness assumption or additive equi-confounding bias
assumption, are proposed to address the latent confounder problem raised by the
observational data. However, in real-world applications, these assumptions are
typically violated which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper,
we tackle the problem of estimating the long-term individual causal effects
without the aforementioned assumptions. Specifically, we propose to utilize the
natural heterogeneity of data, such as data from multiple sources, to identify
latent confounders, thereby significantly avoiding reliance on idealized
assumptions. Practically, we devise a latent representation learning-based
estimator of long-term causal effects. Theoretically, we establish the
identifiability of latent confounders, with which we further achieve long-term
effect identification. Extensive experimental studies, conducted on multiple
synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by explaining
predictions through human-understandable concepts but typically assume that
training and test data share the same distribution. This assumption often fails
under domain shifts, leading to degraded performance and poor generalization.
To address these limitations and improve the robustness of CBMs, we propose the
Concept-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CUDA) framework. CUDA is designed
to: (1) align concept representations across domains using adversarial
training, (2) introduce a relaxation threshold to allow minor domain-specific
differences in concept distributions, thereby preventing performance drop due
to over-constraints of these distributions, (3) infer concepts directly in the
target domain without requiring labeled concept data, enabling CBMs to adapt to
diverse domains, and (4) integrate concept learning into conventional domain
adaptation (DA) with theoretical guarantees, improving interpretability and
establishing new benchmarks for DA. Experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CBM and DA methods on real-world
datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the radio resource allocation problem in a wireless
system with various integrated functionalities, such as communication, sensing
and computing. We design suitable resource management techniques that can
simultaneously cater to those heterogeneous requirements, and scale
appropriately with the high-dimensional and discrete nature of the problem. We
propose a novel active learning framework where resource allocation patterns
are drawn sequentially, evaluated in the environment, and then used to
iteratively update a surrogate model of the environment. Our method leverages a
generative flow network (GFlowNet) to sample favorable solutions, as such
models are trained to generate compositional objects proportionally to their
training reward, hence providing an appropriate coverage of its modes. As such,
GFlowNet generates diverse and high return resource management designs that

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter optimization (CASH) is a
challenging resource allocation problem in the field of AutoML. We propose
MaxUCB, a max $k$-armed bandit method to trade off exploring different model
classes and conducting hyperparameter optimization. MaxUCB is specifically
designed for the light-tailed and bounded reward distributions arising in this
setting and, thus, provides an efficient alternative compared to classic max
$k$-armed bandit methods assuming heavy-tailed reward distributions. We
theoretically and empirically evaluate our method on four standard AutoML
benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over prior approaches.

Result: 在多个少样本表格学习基准测试中，Latte表现出优越性能，成为该领域的先进方法。

Conclusion: Latte通过训练时知识提取和兼容无监督预训练，显著提升了少样本表格学习的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot tabular learning, in which machine learning models are trained with
a limited amount of labeled data, provides a cost-effective approach to
addressing real-world challenges. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has sparked interest in leveraging their pre-trained knowledge for few-shot
tabular learning. Despite promising results, existing approaches either rely on
test-time knowledge extraction, which introduces undesirable latency, or
text-level knowledge, which leads to unreliable feature engineering. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Latte, a training-time knowledge
extraction framework that transfers the latent prior knowledge within LLMs to
optimize a more generalized downstream model. Latte enables general
knowledge-guided downstream tabular learning, facilitating the weighted fusion
of information across different feature values while reducing the risk of
overfitting to limited labeled data. Furthermore, Latte is compatible with
existing unsupervised pre-training paradigms and effectively utilizes available
unlabeled samples to overcome the performance limitations imposed by an
extremely small labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on various few-shot
tabular learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Latte,
establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach in this domain

TLDR: 论文提出了一种在有限标注预算下高效估计治疗效果的方法，通过理论分析定义了关键指标，并提出算法优化数据获取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有治疗效果估计算法在标注数据不足时效果有限，而标注成本高昂，因此需要高效利用标注预算。

Method: 通过理论分析定义关键指标（事实和反事实覆盖半径），提出贪心半径缩减算法和FCCM方法优化数据获取。

Result: FCCM在合成和半合成数据集上表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FCCM方法能够高效利用标注预算，提升治疗效果估计的准确性。

Abstract: Although numerous complex algorithms for treatment effect estimation have
been developed in recent years, their effectiveness remains limited when
handling insufficiently labeled training sets due to the high cost of labeling
the effect after treatment, e.g., expensive tumor imaging or biopsy procedures
needed to evaluate treatment effects. Therefore, it becomes essential to
actively incorporate more high-quality labeled data, all while adhering to a
constrained labeling budget. To enable data-efficient treatment effect
estimation, we formalize the problem through rigorous theoretical analysis
within the active learning context, where the derived key measures --
\textit{factual} and \textit{counterfactual covering radius} determine the risk
upper bound. To reduce the bound, we propose a greedy radius reduction
algorithm, which excels under an idealized, balanced data distribution. To
generalize to more realistic data distributions, we further propose FCCM, which
transforms the optimization objective into the \textit{Factual} and
\textit{Counterfactual Coverage Maximization} to ensure effective radius
reduction during data acquisition. Furthermore, benchmarking FCCM against other
baselines demonstrates its superiority across both fully synthetic and
semi-synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: MARL SMPE算法通过状态建模和对抗性探索，显著提升了多智能体在部分可观测环境中的协作能力。

Abstract: Learning to cooperate in distributed partially observable environments with
no communication abilities poses significant challenges for multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper addresses key concerns in this
domain, focusing on inferring state representations from individual agent
observations and leveraging these representations to enhance agents'
exploration and collaborative task execution policies. To this end, we propose
a novel state modelling framework for cooperative MARL, where agents infer
meaningful belief representations of the non-observable state, with respect to
optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant and less informative
joint state information. Building upon this framework, we propose the MARL SMPE
algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative abilities
under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs into the
policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration
policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while
improving the discriminative abilities of others. Experimentally, we show that
SMPE outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex fully cooperative
tasks from the MPE, LBF, and RWARE benchmarks.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为CBPE的新方法，用于估计二元分类模型的性能指标（如准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数），无需依赖真实标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型性能监控需要真实标签，但现实中标签往往难以获取，导致监控延迟或无法实现。现有方法仅关注准确率，忽略了其他重要指标。

Method: CBPE将混淆矩阵元素视为随机变量，利用模型的校准置信度分数估计其分布，进而推导目标指标的概率分布。

Result: CBPE能够提供具有理论保证和有效置信区间的性能指标估计。

Conclusion: CBPE填补了无需标签估计多种二元分类性能指标的空白，为模型监控提供了更灵活的工具。

Abstract: Model monitoring is a critical component of the machine learning lifecycle,
safeguarding against undetected drops in the model's performance after
deployment. Traditionally, performance monitoring has required access to ground
truth labels, which are not always readily available. This can result in
unacceptable latency or render performance monitoring altogether impossible.
Recently, methods designed to estimate the accuracy of classifier models
without access to labels have shown promising results. However, there are
various other metrics that might be more suitable for assessing model
performance in many cases. Until now, none of these important metrics has
received similar interest from the scientific community. In this work, we
address this gap by presenting CBPE, a novel method that can estimate any
binary classification metric defined using the confusion matrix. In particular,
we choose four metrics from this large family: accuracy, precision, recall, and
F$_1$, to demonstrate our method. CBPE treats the elements of the confusion
matrix as random variables and leverages calibrated confidence scores of the
model to estimate their distributions. The desired metric is then also treated
as a random variable, whose full probability distribution can be derived from
the estimated confusion matrix. CBPE is shown to produce estimates that come
with strong theoretical guarantees and valid confidence intervals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务上表现出色，但其不可控的输出长度在资源受限的实际部署中带来挑战。

Method: 提出Elastic Reasoning框架，将推理分为思考和解决两阶段，并引入预算约束的轻量级训练策略。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，Elastic Reasoning在严格预算约束下表现稳健，且训练成本更低。

Conclusion: Elastic Reasoning为大规模可控推理提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex
tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their
uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are
strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for
scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two
phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test
time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments,
significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train
models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight
budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the
model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and
generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional
training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming
(LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning
performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring
significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our
approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in
unconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical
solution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale.

Conclusion: 本文在理论和实践上改进了LLP的现有方法，提供了更优的样本复杂性和算法性能。

Abstract: We investigate Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a partial information
setting where examples in a training set are grouped into bags, and only
aggregate label values in each bag are available. Despite the partial
observability, the goal is still to achieve small regret at the level of
individual examples. We give results on the sample complexity of LLP under
square loss, showing that our sample complexity is essentially optimal. From an
algorithmic viewpoint, we rely on carefully designed variants of Empirical Risk
Minimization, and Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms, combined with ad hoc
variance reduction techniques. On one hand, our theoretical results improve in
important ways on the existing literature on LLP, specifically in the way the
sample complexity depends on the bag size. On the other hand, we validate our
algorithmic solutions on several datasets, demonstrating improved empirical
performance (better accuracy for less samples) against recent baselines.

Conclusion: DIFF-FLOOD是一种高效且可扩展的沿海洪水预测方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Coastal flooding poses significant risks to communities, necessitating fast
and accurate forecasting methods to mitigate potential damage. To approach this
problem, we present DIFF-FLOOD, a probabilistic spatiotemporal forecasting
method designed based on denoising diffusion models. DIFF-FLOOD predicts
inundation level at a location by taking both spatial and temporal context into
account. It utilizes inundation levels at neighboring locations and digital
elevation data as spatial context. Inundation history from a context time
window, together with additional co-variates are used as temporal context.
Convolutional neural networks and cross-attention mechanism are then employed
to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics in the data. We trained and tested
DIFF-FLOOD on coastal inundation data from the Eastern Shore of Virginia, a
region highly impacted by coastal flooding. Our results show that, DIFF-FLOOD
outperforms existing forecasting methods in terms of prediction performance (6%
to 64% improvement in terms of two performance metrics) and scalability.

Abstract: Oblique decision trees have attracted attention due to their potential for

We introduce a novel algorithm, Classification and Regression Tree - Exhaustive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有锐度度量在Transformer中表现不佳，因其注意力机制的丰富对称性导致参数空间方向上的网络或损失不变。

Method: 在对称性校正的商流形上重新定义锐度，利用黎曼几何工具提出广义锐度概念，并通过高阶近似恢复与泛化的相关性。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界的文本与图像分类任务中，提出的测地锐度显示出与泛化的强相关性。

Conclusion: 通过考虑Transformer的对称性并引入高阶近似，新的锐度定义成功恢复了与泛化能力的相关性。

Abstract: The concept of sharpness has been successfully applied to traditional
architectures like MLPs and CNNs to predict their generalization. For
transformers, however, recent work reported weak correlation between flatness
and generalization. We argue that existing sharpness measures fail for
transformers, because they have much richer symmetries in their attention
mechanism that induce directions in parameter space along which the network or
its loss remain identical. We posit that sharpness must account fully for these
symmetries, and thus we redefine it on a quotient manifold that results from
quotienting out the transformer symmetries, thereby removing their ambiguities.
Leveraging tools from Riemannian geometry, we propose a fully general notion of
sharpness, in terms of a geodesic ball on the symmetry-corrected quotient
manifold. In practice, we need to resort to approximating the geodesics. Doing
so up to first order yields existing adaptive sharpness measures, and we
demonstrate that including higher-order terms is crucial to recover correlation
with generalization. We present results on diagonal networks with synthetic
data, and show that our geodesic sharpness reveals strong correlation for
real-world transformers on both text and image classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HDC应用依赖高精度模型和编码矩阵，导致计算和内存需求高，尤其对超低功耗设备不友好。现有压缩方法需重新训练，成本高且不实用。

Method: 结合分解、剪枝和量化三种压缩技术，提出DPQ-HD算法，并引入能效推理方法，通过渐进相似性评分和提前退出减少计算。

Result: 在图像和图形分类任务中，内存减少20-100倍，精度仅下降1-2%。DPQ-HD优于现有后训练压缩方法，且优化时间减少100倍，推理速度提升56倍。

Conclusion: DPQ-HD是一种高效、无需重新训练的压缩方法，显著降低计算和内存开销，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is emerging as a promising approach for edge
AI, offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, current
HDC-based applications often rely on high-precision models and/or encoding
matrices to achieve competitive performance, which imposes significant
computational and memory demands, especially for ultra-low power devices. While
recent efforts use techniques like precision reduction and pruning to increase
the efficiency, most require retraining to maintain performance, making them
expensive and impractical. To address this issue, we propose a novel Post
Training Compression algorithm, Decomposition-Pruning-Quantization (DPQ-HD),
which aims at compressing the end-to-end HDC system, achieving near floating
point performance without the need of retraining. DPQ-HD reduces computational
and memory overhead by uniquely combining the above three compression
techniques and efficiently adapts to hardware constraints. Additionally, we
introduce an energy-efficient inference approach that progressively evaluates
similarity scores such as cosine similarity and performs early exit to reduce
the computation, accelerating prediction inference while maintaining accuracy.
We demonstrate that DPQ-HD achieves up to 20-100x reduction in memory for image
and graph classification tasks with only a 1-2% drop in accuracy compared to
uncompressed workloads. Lastly, we show that DPQ-HD outperforms the existing
post-training compression methods and performs better or at par with
retraining-based state-of-the-art techniques, requiring significantly less
overall optimization time (up to 100x) and faster inference (up to 56x) on a
microcontroller

Result: RL-DAUNCE在Madden-Julian Oscillation案例中表现优于标准EnKF，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: RL-DAUNCE在保持高效的同时，显著提升了数据同化的物理一致性和性能。

Abstract: Machine learning has become a powerful tool for enhancing data assimilation.
While supervised learning remains the standard method, reinforcement learning
(RL) offers unique advantages through its sequential decision-making framework,
which naturally fits the iterative nature of data assimilation by dynamically
balancing model forecasts with observations. We develop RL-DAUNCE, a new
RL-based method that enhances data assimilation with physical constraints
through three key aspects. First, RL-DAUNCE inherits the computational
efficiency of machine learning while it uniquely structures its agents to
mirror ensemble members in conventional data assimilation methods. Second,
RL-DAUNCE emphasizes uncertainty quantification by advancing multiple ensemble
members, moving beyond simple mean-state optimization. Third, RL-DAUNCE's
ensemble-as-agents design facilitates the enforcement of physical constraints
during the assimilation process, which is crucial to improving the state
estimation and subsequent forecasting. A primal-dual optimization strategy is
developed to enforce constraints, which dynamically penalizes the reward
function to ensure constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process.
Also, state variable bounds are respected by constraining the RL action space.
Together, these features ensure physical consistency without sacrificing
efficiency. RL-DAUNCE is applied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, an
intermittent atmospheric phenomenon characterized by strongly non-Gaussian
features and multiple physical constraints. RL-DAUNCE outperforms the standard
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which fails catastrophically due to the
violation of physical constraints. Notably, RL-DAUNCE matches the performance
of constrained EnKF, particularly in recovering intermittent signals, capturing
extreme events, and quantifying uncertainties, while requiring substantially
less computational effort.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统性评估LLM在多用户、多轮社交任务中能力的基准，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了HSII基准，包含四个阶段：格式解析、目标选择、目标切换对话和稳定对话，并使用HSII-Dataset进行实验。同时研究了COT方法对LLM社交能力的提升效果。

Result: 实验结果表明HSII基准能有效评估LLM的社交能力，并提出了COT-complexity指标以平衡正确性和效率。

Conclusion: HSII基准为评估LLM在复杂社交任务中的能力提供了有效工具，COT方法及其效率指标进一步优化了评估过程。

Abstract: Expanding the application of large language models (LLMs) to societal life,
instead of primary function only as auxiliary assistants to communicate with
only one person at a time, necessitates LLMs' capabilities to independently
play roles in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks within complex social
settings. However, currently the capability has not been systematically
measured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an
agent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles.
Concurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII
below), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social
agents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages:
format parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable
conversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion
capabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset,
HSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform
an ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we
investigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs'
social performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new
statistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs
with COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between
measurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments
demonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in
LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing diverse data types, yet
significant disparities persist between human cognitive processes and
computational approaches to multimodal information integration. This research
presents a systematic investigation into the parallels between human
cross-modal chunking mechanisms and token representation methodologies in
MLLMs. Through empirical studies comparing human performance patterns with
model behaviors across visual-linguistic tasks, we demonstrate that
conventional static tokenization schemes fundamentally constrain current
models' capacity to simulate the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of human
information processing. We propose a novel framework for dynamic cross-modal
tokenization that incorporates adaptive boundaries, hierarchical
representations, and alignment mechanisms grounded in cognitive science
principles. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art models on
benchmark tasks (+7.8% on Visual Question Answering, +5.3% on Complex Scene
Description) while exhibiting more human-aligned error patterns and attention
distributions. These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of
the relationship between human cognition and artificial intelligence, while
providing empirical evidence for developing more cognitively plausible AI

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to convert spoken input in one
language to spoken output in another, typically focusing on either language
translation or accent adaptation. However, effective cross-cultural
communication requires handling both aspects simultaneously - translating
content while adapting the speaker's accent to match the target language
context. In this work, we propose a unified approach for simultaneous speech
translation and change of accent, a task that remains underexplored in current
literature. Our method reformulates the problem as a conditional generation
task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target
speech features. Leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for
high-fidelity generative capabilities, we adapt text-to-image diffusion
strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel
spectrograms representing the target speech with desired linguistic and
accentual attributes. This integrated framework enables joint optimization of
translation and accent adaptation, offering a more parameter-efficient and
effective model compared to traditional pipelines.

*Nischal Mandal,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出了一种轻量级的多模态情感分析模型，通过简单的特征融合方法在资源受限环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析需要整合语言、音频和视觉信号，但现有方法常使用复杂的注意力机制和层次结构，导致计算开销大。

Method: 设计了一种基于模态特定编码器和简单拼接融合的轻量级深度学习模型，使用全连接层和dropout正则化。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上实现了92%的分类准确率，优于或匹配复杂模型。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的特征工程和模块化设计，简单融合策略在资源受限环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis, a pivotal task in affective computing, seeks
to understand human emotions by integrating cues from language, audio, and
visual signals. While many recent approaches leverage complex attention
mechanisms and hierarchical architectures, we propose a lightweight, yet
effective fusion-based deep learning model tailored for utterance-level emotion
classification. Using the benchmark IEMOCAP dataset, which includes aligned
text, audio-derived numeric features, and visual descriptors, we design a
modality-specific encoder using fully connected layers followed by dropout
regularization. The modality-specific representations are then fused using
simple concatenation and passed through a dense fusion layer to capture
cross-modal interactions. This streamlined architecture avoids computational
overhead while preserving performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
92% across six emotion categories. Our approach demonstrates that with careful
feature engineering and modular design, simpler fusion strategies can
outperform or match more complex models, particularly in resource-constrained
environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 结合Transformer神经网络和抽样估计方法，提出一种减少手动标注时间的文本分类参数估计方法，应用于瑞典仇恨犯罪统计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在有限文本数据集中手动标注目标变量标签的挑战。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器神经网络预测结果作为辅助变量，结合Hansen-Hurwitz估计、差异估计和分层随机抽样估计。

Result: 在瑞典仇恨犯罪统计中验证了方法的有效性，显著减少了手动标注时间。

Conclusion: 若有标注训练数据，该方法可高效估计参数，减少手动标注工作量。

Abstract: Estimating population parameters in finite populations of text documents can
be challenging when obtaining the labels for the target variable requires
manual annotation. To address this problem, we combine predictions from a
transformer encoder neural network with well-established survey sampling
estimators using the model predictions as an auxiliary variable. The
applicability is demonstrated in Swedish hate crime statistics based on Swedish
police reports. Estimates of the yearly number of hate crimes and the police's
under-reporting are derived using the Hansen-Hurwitz estimator, difference
estimation, and stratified random sampling estimation. We conclude that if
labeled training data is available, the proposed method can provide very
efficient estimates with reduced time spent on manual annotation.

*Tejas Jade,Alex Yartsev*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文评估了ChatGPT 4o在研究生医学教育中自动评分短答案问题的能力，发现其评分与人类评分存在显著差异，不建议用于高风险评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在标准化短答案问题（SAQs）自动评分中的适用性，尤其是在研究生医学教育中。

Method: 使用ChatGPT 4o对215名学生的557个短答案进行评分，并与人类评分对比，采用多种统计方法分析一致性。

Result: ChatGPT评分系统性低于人类评分（平均偏差-1.34分），个体一致性差（ICC1=0.086），且60%以上评分超出可接受范围。

Conclusion: 不建议将LLMs用于研究生课程的高风险评分，尤其是在需要分析和评价的项目中。

Abstract: Standardised tests using short answer questions (SAQs) are common in
postgraduate education. Large language models (LLMs) simulate conversational
language and interpret unstructured free-text responses in ways aligning with
applying SAQ grading rubrics, making them attractive for automated grading. We
evaluated ChatGPT 4o to grade SAQs in a postgraduate medical setting using data
from 215 students (557 short-answer responses) enrolled in an online course on
mechanical ventilation (2020--2024). Deidentified responses to three case-based
scenarios were presented to ChatGPT with a standardised grading prompt and
rubric. Outputs were analysed using mixed-effects modelling, variance component
analysis, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), Cohen's kappa, Kendall's
W, and Bland--Altman statistics. ChatGPT awarded systematically lower marks
than human graders with a mean difference (bias) of -1.34 on a 10-point scale.
ICC values indicated poor individual-level agreement (ICC1 = 0.086), and
Cohen's kappa (-0.0786) suggested no meaningful agreement. Variance component
analysis showed minimal variability among the five ChatGPT sessions (G-value =
0.87), indicating internal consistency but divergence from the human grader.
The poorest agreement was observed for evaluative and analytic items, whereas
checklist and prescriptive rubric items had less disagreement. We caution
against the use of LLMs in grading postgraduate coursework. Over 60% of
ChatGPT-assigned grades differed from human grades by more than acceptable
boundaries for high-stakes assessments.

Abstract: The automation of scientific research through large language models (LLMs)
presents significant opportunities but faces critical challenges in knowledge
synthesis and quality assurance. We introduce Feedback-Refined Agent
Methodology (FRAME), a novel framework that enhances medical paper generation
through iterative refinement and structured feedback. Our approach comprises
three key innovations: (1) A structured dataset construction method that

iterative refinement; (2) A tripartite architecture integrating Generator,
Evaluator, and Reflector agents that progressively improve content quality
through metric-driven feedback; and (3) A comprehensive evaluation framework
that combines statistical metrics with human-grounded benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate FRAME's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements
over conventional approaches across multiple models (9.91% average gain with
DeepSeek V3, comparable improvements with GPT-4o Mini) and evaluation
dimensions. Human evaluation confirms that FRAME-generated papers achieve
quality comparable to human-authored works, with particular strength in
synthesizing future research directions. The results demonstrated our work
could efficiently assist medical research by building a robust foundation for
automated medical research paper generation while maintaining rigorous academic
standards.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在多模态医疗对话中的能力，以更贴近远程医疗的实际需求。

Method: 利用Gemini 2.0 Flash实现状态感知对话框架，动态控制对话流程，并通过多模态数据（如皮肤照片、心电图等）进行诊断。

Result: AMIE在多模态和非多模态评估中均优于PCPs，诊断准确性更高。

Conclusion: 多模态对话诊断AI取得进展，但实际应用仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for conducting
diagnostic conversations but evaluation has been largely limited to
language-only interactions, deviating from the real-world requirements of
remote care delivery. Instant messaging platforms permit clinicians and
patients to upload and discuss multimodal medical artifacts seamlessly in
medical consultation, but the ability of LLMs to reason over such data while
preserving other attributes of competent diagnostic conversation remains
unknown. Here we advance the conversational diagnosis and management
performance of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a
new capability to gather and interpret multimodal data, and reason about this
precisely during consultations. Leveraging Gemini 2.0 Flash, our system
implements a state-aware dialogue framework, where conversation flow is
dynamically controlled by intermediate model outputs reflecting patient states
and evolving diagnoses. Follow-up questions are strategically directed by
uncertainty in such patient states, leading to a more structured multimodal
history-taking process that emulates experienced clinicians. We compared AMIE
to primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, blinded, OSCE-style study of
chat-based consultations with patient actors. We constructed 105 evaluation
scenarios using artifacts like smartphone skin photos, ECGs, and PDFs of
clinical documents across diverse conditions and demographics. Our rubric
assessed multimodal capabilities and other clinically meaningful axes like
history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication, and
empathy. Specialist evaluation showed AMIE to be superior to PCPs on 7/9
multimodal and 29/32 non-multimodal axes (including diagnostic accuracy). The
results show clear progress in multimodal conversational diagnostic AI, but
real-world translation needs further research.

Motivation: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对个体健康状况有重要影响，但传统方法效率低且成本高，需要更高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 结合传统深度学习和LLMs，提出了一种更高效的方法，利用LLM的精确性和传统深度学习的高效性，同时使用合成数据增强性能。

Result: 在多标签SDoH分类任务中性能提升10%，分类速度提升12倍，且在合成数据增强的数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为自动预测SDoH提供了更高效和精确的解决方案，尤其适用于高风险患者。

Abstract: Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) are economic, social and personal
circumstances that affect or influence an individual's health status. SDoHs
have shown to be correlated to wellness outcomes, and therefore, are useful to
physicians in diagnosing diseases and in decision-making. In this work, we
automatically extract SDoHs from clinical text using traditional deep learning
and Large Language Models (LLMs) to find the advantages and disadvantages of
each on an existing publicly available dataset. Our models outperform a
previous reference point on a multilabel SDoH classification by 10 points, and
we present a method and model to drastically speed up classification (12X
execution time) by eliminating expensive LLM processing. The method we present
combines a more nimble and efficient solution that leverages the power of the
LLM for precision and traditional deep learning methods for efficiency. We also
show highly performant results on a dataset supplemented with synthetic data
and several traditional deep learning models that outperform LLMs. Our models
and methods offer the next iteration of automatic prediction of SDoHs that
impact at-risk patients.

Method: 使用文本到动作（T2M, SATO, ParCo）和文本到文本（GPT4o, GPT4, Gemini）模型生成合成数据，并与真实数据集结合，通过LSTM模型评估性能。

Result: 合成数据的有效性受数据集特性影响，LLM生成数据在低频（20Hz）表现最佳，而扩散方法生成的数据与真实数据最接近但未显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 合成数据的优化需考虑传感器位置和跌倒表示，研究为跌倒检测模型的合成数据生成提供了指导。

Abstract: Training fall detection systems is challenging due to the scarcity of
real-world fall data, particularly from elderly individuals. To address this,
we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating
synthetic fall data. This study evaluates text-to-motion (T2M, SATO, ParCo) and
text-to-text models (GPT4o, GPT4, Gemini) in simulating realistic fall
scenarios. We generate synthetic datasets and integrate them with four
real-world baseline datasets to assess their impact on fall detection
performance using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Additionally, we
compare LLM-generated synthetic data with a diffusion-based method to evaluate
their alignment with real accelerometer distributions. Results indicate that
dataset characteristics significantly influence the effectiveness of synthetic
data, with LLM-generated data performing best in low-frequency settings (e.g.,
20Hz) while showing instability in high-frequency datasets (e.g., 200Hz). While
text-to-motion models produce more realistic biomechanical data than
text-to-text models, their impact on fall detection varies. Diffusion-based
synthetic data demonstrates the closest alignment to real data but does not
consistently enhance model performance. An ablation study further confirms that
the effectiveness of synthetic data depends on sensor placement and fall
representation. These findings provide insights into optimizing synthetic data
generation for fall detection models.

Result: 基于BERT的广告推送能有效提高点击率和转化率，同时通过隐私保护机制降低用户数据泄露风险。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在广告推荐中具有潜力，但需结合隐私保护技术以实现安全高效的应用。

Abstract: Although large language models have demonstrated the potential for
personalized advertising recommendations in experimental environments, in
actual operations, how advertising recommendation systems can be combined with
measures such as user privacy protection and data security is still an area
worthy of in-depth discussion. To this end, this paper studies the personalized
risks and regulatory strategies of large language models in digital
advertising. This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model
(LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer
architecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural
language text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an
algorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor
risk protection. The specific steps include: data collection and preprocessing,
feature selection and construction, using large language models such as BERT
for advertising semantic embedding, and ad recommendations based on user
portraits. Then, local model training and data encryption are used to ensure
the security of user privacy and avoid the leakage of personal data. This paper
designs an experiment for personalized advertising recommendation based on a
large language model of BERT and verifies it with real user data. The
experimental results show that BERT-based advertising push can effectively
improve the click-through rate and conversion rate of advertisements. At the
same time, through local model training and privacy protection mechanisms, the
risk of user privacy leakage can be reduced to a certain extent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑规范复杂且更新频繁，手动查询耗时且困难，需要一种自动化的解决方案。

Method: 研究评估了多种检索方法（如Elasticsearch）和语言模型微调技术，以优化RAG系统在加拿大国家建筑规范（NBCC）上的表现。

Result: 实验表明，Elasticsearch是最优检索器，且语言模型在NBCC数据集上的微调能显著提升生成相关回答的能力。

Conclusion: 结合高效检索器和微调语言模型的RAG系统能有效应对建筑规范的复杂性。

Abstract: Building codes are regulations that establish standards for the design,
construction, and safety of buildings to ensure structural integrity, fire
protection, and accessibility. They are often extensive, complex, and subject
to frequent updates, making manual querying challenging and time-consuming. Key
difficulties include navigating large volumes of text, interpreting technical
language, and identifying relevant clauses across different sections. A
potential solution is to build a Question-Answering (QA) system that answers
user queries based on building codes. Among the various methods for building a
QA system, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stands out in performance. RAG
consists of two components: a retriever and a language model. This study
focuses on identifying a suitable retriever method for building codes and
optimizing the generational capability of the language model using fine-tuning
techniques. We conducted a detailed evaluation of various retrieval methods by
performing the retrieval on the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) and
explored the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning on several language models
using the dataset derived from NBCC. Our analysis included a comparative
assessment of different retrievers and the performance of both pre-trained and
fine-tuned models to determine the efficacy and domain-specific adaptation of
language models using fine-tuning on the NBCC dataset. Experimental results
showed that Elasticsearch proved to be the most robust retriever among all. The
findings also indicate that fine-tuning language models on an NBCC-specific
dataset can enhance their ability to generate contextually relevant responses.
When combined with context retrieved by a powerful retriever like
Elasticsearch, this improvement in LLM performance can optimize the RAG system,
enabling it to better navigate the complexities of the NBCC.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRMs在Text-to-SQL任务中可能扭曲推理轨迹，导致SQL生成不准确。

Method: 采用“冷启动后PRM监督”策略，先分解SQL查询为结构化推理链，再探索四种PRM集成策略。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，Reward-SQL使7B PRM监督的模型性能提升13.1%，Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct模型达到68.9%准确率。

Conclusion: Reward-SQL有效利用奖励监督提升Text-to-SQL推理性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
performance on the Text-to-SQL task by leveraging their powerful reasoning
capabilities. To enhance accuracy during the reasoning process, external
Process Reward Models (PRMs) can be introduced during training and inference to
provide fine-grained supervision. However, if misused, PRMs may distort the
reasoning trajectory and lead to suboptimal or incorrect SQL generation.To
address this challenge, we propose Reward-SQL, a framework that systematically
explores how to incorporate PRMs into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process
effectively. Our approach follows a "cold start, then PRM supervision"
paradigm. Specifically, we first train the model to decompose SQL queries into
structured stepwise reasoning chains using common table expressions
(Chain-of-CTEs), establishing a strong and interpretable reasoning baseline.
Then, we investigate four strategies for integrating PRMs, and find that
combining PRM as an online training signal (GRPO) with PRM-guided inference
(e.g., best-of-N sampling) yields the best results. Empirically, on the BIRD
benchmark, Reward-SQL enables models supervised by a 7B PRM to achieve a 13.1%
performance gain across various guidance strategies. Notably, our GRPO-aligned
policy model based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct achieves 68.9% accuracy on the
BIRD development set, outperforming all baseline methods under the same model
size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Reward-SQL in leveraging
reward-based supervision for Text-to-SQL reasoning. Our code is publicly
available.

Method: 提出REVEAL框架，包括自动图像挖掘、合成对抗数据生成、多轮对话扩展和全面危害评估。

Result: 评估了五种VLLMs，发现多轮对话缺陷率更高，GPT-4o表现最优，Llama-3.2缺陷率最高。

Conclusion: 多轮对话暴露VLLMs更深层漏洞，需加强上下文防御，尤其是针对错误信息。

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) represent a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence by integrating image-processing capabilities with
textual understanding, thereby enhancing user interactions and expanding
application domains. However, their increased complexity introduces novel
safety and ethical challenges, particularly in multi-modal and multi-turn
conversations. Traditional safety evaluation frameworks, designed for
text-based, single-turn interactions, are inadequate for addressing these
complexities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the REVEAL (Responsible
Evaluation of Vision-Enabled AI LLMs) Framework, a scalable and automated
pipeline for evaluating image-input harms in VLLMs. REVEAL includes automated
image mining, synthetic adversarial data generation, multi-turn conversational
expansion using crescendo attack strategies, and comprehensive harm assessment
through evaluators like GPT-4o.
  We extensively evaluated five state-of-the-art VLLMs, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2,
Qwen2-VL, Phi3.5V, and Pixtral, across three important harm categories: sexual
harm, violence, and misinformation. Our findings reveal that multi-turn
interactions result in significantly higher defect rates compared to
single-turn evaluations, highlighting deeper vulnerabilities in VLLMs. Notably,
GPT-4o demonstrated the most balanced performance as measured by our
Safety-Usability Index (SUI) followed closely by Pixtral. Additionally,
misinformation emerged as a critical area requiring enhanced contextual
defenses. Llama-3.2 exhibited the highest MT defect rate ($16.55 \%$) while
Qwen2-VL showed the highest MT refusal rate ($19.1 \%$).

Abstract: This paper presents a thoroughly automated method for identifying and
interpreting cuneiform characters via advanced deep-learning algorithms. Five
distinct deep-learning models were trained on a comprehensive dataset of
cuneiform characters and evaluated according to critical performance metrics,
including accuracy and precision. Two models demonstrated outstanding
performance and were subsequently assessed using cuneiform symbols from the
Hammurabi law acquisition, notably Hammurabi Law 1. Each model effectively
recognized the relevant Akkadian meanings of the symbols and delivered precise

*Jingyang Deng,Ran Chen,Jo-Ku Cheng,Jinwen Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该研究提出了一种针对中国国有资产的领域专用大语言模型（LLM）开发框架，解决了模型容量限制、过度依赖领域数据和推理效率低的问题。通过三阶段框架（持续预训练、渐进式SFT和蒸馏增强解码），模型在保持通用能力的同时显著提升了领域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前领域专用LLM在开发中存在模型容量限制、过度依赖领域数据和推理效率低的问题，亟需一种更优化的方法。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：1）持续预训练整合领域知识；2）渐进式SFT从弱相关数据过渡到专家标注数据；3）蒸馏增强解码加速推理。

Result: 模型在保持99.8%通用能力的同时，领域性能显著提升（Rouge-1提高1.08倍，BLEU-4提高1.17倍）。渐进式SFT优于单阶段训练。

Conclusion: 该研究为领域专用LLM提供了一种全流程优化方法，平衡了通用能力和领域专长。

Abstract: This study addresses key challenges in developing domain-specific large
language models (LLMs) for Chinese state-owned assets and enterprises (SOAEs),
where current approaches face three limitations: 1) constrained model capacity
that limits knowledge integration and cross-task adaptability; 2) excessive
reliance on domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data, which neglects
the broader applicability of general language patterns; and 3) inefficient
inference acceleration for large models processing long contexts. In this work,
we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase
framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while
retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based
learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to
expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3)
distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit
distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving
1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results
demonstrate that our domain-specific pre-training phase maintains 99.8% of
original general language capabilities while significantly improving domain
performance, resulting in a 1.08$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 score and a
1.17$\times$ enhancement in BLEU-4 score. Ablation studies further show that
domain-progressive SFT outperforms single-stage training, achieving
1.02$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 and 1.06$\times$ in BLEU-4. Our work
introduces a comprehensive, full-pipeline approach for optimizing SOAEs LLMs,
bridging the gap between general language capabilities and domain-specific
expertise.

Motivation: 填补文学情感与视觉文化之间系统性关联的研究空白。

Method: 使用微调的BERT模型分析唐宋诗歌中的牡丹和梅花意象，并与纺织品、陶瓷等视觉证据进行交叉验证。

Result: 发现唐宋时期花卉意象情感内涵的显著变化，并揭示文学与艺术表现之间未被识别的协同关系。

Conclusion: 研究为计算人文与传统汉学方法的结合提供了范例，深化了对唐宋文化表达的理解。

Abstract: The Tang (618 to 907) and Song (960 to 1279) dynasties witnessed an
extraordinary flourishing of Chinese cultural expression, where floral motifs
served as a dynamic medium for both poetic sentiment and artistic design. While
previous scholarship has examined these domains independently, the systematic
correlation between evolving literary emotions and visual culture remains
underexplored. This study addresses that gap by employing BERT-based sentiment
analysis to quantify emotional patterns in floral imagery across Tang Song
poetry, then validating these patterns against contemporaneous developments in
decorative arts.Our approach builds upon recent advances in computational
humanities while remaining grounded in traditional sinological methods. By
applying a fine tuned BERT model to analyze peony and plum blossom imagery in
classical poetry, we detect measurable shifts in emotional connotations between
the Tang and Song periods. These textual patterns are then cross berenced with
visual evidence from textiles, ceramics, and other material culture, revealing
previously unrecognized synergies between literary expression and artistic
representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统中LLM生成的幻觉问题阻碍了生产部署，现有检测方法（人工或闭源模型）成本高且扩展性差。

Method: 使用扰动多跳QA数据集诱导幻觉，并通过监督微调训练7B模型进行检测。

Result: 7B模型在RAGTruth基准测试中召回率优于GPT-4o，且在精度和准确率上表现竞争性。

Conclusion: 该方法以更少参数实现了高效幻觉检测，解决了现有方法的扩展性问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have gained widespread adoption
by application builders because they leverage sources of truth to enable Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate more factually sound responses. However,
hallucinations, instances of LLM responses that are unfaithful to the provided
context, often prevent these systems from being deployed in production
environments. Current hallucination detection methods typically involve human
evaluation or the use of closed-source models to review RAG system outputs for
hallucinations. Both human evaluators and closed-source models suffer from
scaling issues due to their high costs and slow inference speeds. In this work,
we introduce a perturbed multi-hop QA dataset with induced hallucinations. Via
supervised fine-tuning on our dataset, we achieve better recall with a 7B model
than GPT-4o on the RAGTruth hallucination detection benchmark and offer
competitive performance on precision and accuracy, all while using a fraction
of the parameters. Code is released at our repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在RAG中仍频繁产生幻觉，现有评估方法（如HHEM）存在不足。

Method: 提出FaithJudge方法，基于少量人工标注指导LLM评估幻觉。

Result: FaithJudge显著优于现有方法，并推出改进的幻觉排行榜。

Conclusion: FaithJudge为LLM幻觉评估提供了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Hallucinations remain a persistent challenge for LLMs. RAG aims to reduce
hallucinations by grounding responses in contexts. However, even when provided
context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or
contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations
with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce
hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM
hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model
(HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great
research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current
hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods
on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose
FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination
annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination
evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination
leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination
leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in
RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义检索系统难以适应学术内容的独特语言和结构特征，因此需要开发更适合教育领域的嵌入模型。

Method: 构建了包含3,197对句子的合成数据集，并评估了两种训练策略：基于MNRL的基线模型和结合MNRL与CosineSimilarityLoss的双损失模型。

Result: 两种模型均优于开源基线，双损失模型缩小了与高性能专有嵌入（如OpenAI的text-embedding-3系列）的性能差距。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了可复用的教育领域嵌入模型和语义检索框架，支持学术聊天机器人等下游应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI have catalyzed the adoption of intelligent educational
tools, yet many semantic retrieval systems remain ill-suited to the unique
linguistic and structural characteristics of academic content. This study
presents two open-source embedding models fine-tuned for educational question
answering, particularly in the context of course syllabi. A synthetic dataset
of 3,197 sentence pairs, spanning synonymous terminology, paraphrased
questions, and implicit-explicit mappings, was constructed through a
combination of manual curation and large language model (LLM)-assisted
generation. Two training strategies were evaluated: (1) a baseline model
fine-tuned using MultipleNegativesRankingLoss (MNRL), and (2) a dual-loss model
that combines MNRL with CosineSimilarityLoss to improve both semantic ranking
and similarity calibration. Evaluations were conducted on 28 university course
syllabi using a fixed set of natural language questions categorized into
course, faculty, and teaching assistant information. Results demonstrate that
both fine-tuned models outperform strong open-source baselines, including
all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1, and that the dual-loss model
narrows the performance gap with high-performing proprietary embeddings such as
OpenAI's text-embedding-3 series. This work contributes reusable,
domain-aligned embedding models and provides a replicable framework for
educational semantic retrieval, supporting downstream applications such as
academic chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and learning
management system (LMS) integrations.

TLDR: 研究发现，思维链（CoT）中的中间结果存储是关键，而非具体步骤；CoT可能类似编程中的变量，但存在潜在缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索思维链（CoT）在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的内部机制，尤其是在解决复杂推理任务时的作用。

Method: 通过两个组合任务（多位数乘法和动态规划）实证研究CoT令牌的作用，包括保留中间结果、替代潜在形式存储及随机干预。

Result: 仅保留中间结果令牌即可达到类似性能；中间结果以潜在形式存储不影响模型表现；干预CoT值会改变后续令牌和最终答案。

Conclusion: CoT令牌可能类似编程变量，但存在潜在缺陷，如意外捷径和令牌间计算复杂度限制。

Abstract: Chain-of-thoughts (CoT) requires large language models (LLMs) to generate
intermediate steps before reaching the final answer, and has been proven
effective to help LLMs solve complex reasoning tasks. However, the inner
mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically
study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit
multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving
these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate
results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that
storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect
model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice
that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly.
These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer
programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and
computational complexity limits between tokens. The code and data are available
at https://github.com/solitaryzero/CoTs_are_Variables.

Motivation: 探讨幂律衰减是否支持语言层次结构的普遍性，并验证其假设是否适用于句法结构。

Method: 使用英语语料库分析解析树的互信息、与PCFGs的偏差等统计特性。

Result: 假设不适用于句法结构，且难以推广到儿童语言和动物信号。

Conclusion: 需重新评估幂律与层次结构的关系，假设不成立。

Abstract: Statistical analysis of corpora provides an approach to quantitatively
investigate natural languages. This approach has revealed that several power
laws consistently emerge across different corpora and languages, suggesting the
universal principles underlying languages. Particularly, the power-law decay of
correlation has been interpreted as evidence for underlying hierarchical
structures in syntax, semantics, and discourse. This perspective has also been
extended to child languages and animal signals. However, the argument
supporting this interpretation has not been empirically tested. To address this
problem, this study examines the validity of the argument for syntactic
structures. Specifically, we test whether the statistical properties of parse
trees align with the implicit assumptions in the argument. Using English
corpora, we analyze the mutual information, deviations from probabilistic
context-free grammars (PCFGs), and other properties in parse trees, as well as
in the PCFG that approximates these trees. Our results indicate that the
assumptions do not hold for syntactic structures and that it is difficult to
apply the proposed argument to child languages and animal signals, highlighting
the need to reconsider the relationship between the power law and hierarchical
structures.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为LPC的新框架，用于建模人类偏好的隐式因素及其组合，无需依赖预定义的奖励函数。实验表明，LPC能显著提升对齐算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好建模方法通常依赖显式或隐式奖励函数，忽视了人类偏好的复杂性和多面性，尤其是在不同任务和人群中的冲突因素。

Method: LPC通过离散潜在编码建模隐式因素及其组合，自动从数据中推断这些因素及其重要性，无需预定义奖励函数或手工组合权重。

Result: LPC在多个基准测试中显著提升了三种对齐算法（DPO、SimPO、IPO）的性能，且潜在编码能有效捕捉人类偏好的分布差异并增强对齐的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LPC为开发更鲁棒和通用的对齐技术提供了统一表示，有助于负责任地部署强大的LLMs。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet aligning
their generations with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing
approaches to preference modeling often rely on an explicit or implicit reward
function, overlooking the intricate and multifaceted nature of human
preferences that may encompass conflicting factors across diverse tasks and
populations. To address this limitation, we introduce Latent Preference Coding
(LPC), a novel framework that models the implicit factors as well as their
combinations behind holistic preferences using discrete latent codes. LPC
seamlessly integrates with various offline alignment algorithms, automatically
inferring the underlying factors and their importance from data without relying
on pre-defined reward functions and hand-crafted combination weights. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LPC consistently improves
upon three alignment algorithms (DPO, SimPO, and IPO) using three base models
(Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3-8B-Instruct). Furthermore, deeper analysis
reveals that the learned latent codes effectively capture the differences in
the distribution of human preferences and significantly enhance the robustness
of alignment against noise in data. By providing a unified representation for
the multifarious preference factors, LPC paves the way towards developing more
robust and versatile alignment techniques for the responsible deployment of
powerful LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ICL方法对示例顺序敏感，且无法同时满足信息不泄漏和上下文相互依赖，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出InvICL方法，通过设计满足信息不泄漏和上下文相互依赖的特性，实现ICL的排列不变性。

Result: InvICL在多数基准数据集上优于现有方法，展现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: InvICL是一种有效的ICL方法，解决了顺序敏感性问题并提升了性能。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a pivotal capability of
auto-regressive large language models, yet it is hindered by a notable
sensitivity to the ordering of context examples regardless of their mutual
independence. To address this issue, recent studies have introduced several
variant algorithms of ICL that achieve permutation invariance. However, many of
these do not exhibit comparable performance with the standard auto-regressive
ICL algorithm. In this work, we identify two crucial elements in the design of
an invariant ICL algorithm: information non-leakage and context
interdependence, which are not simultaneously achieved by any of the existing
methods. These investigations lead us to the proposed Invariant ICL (InvICL), a
methodology designed to achieve invariance in ICL while ensuring the two
properties. Empirically, our findings reveal that InvICL surpasses previous
models, both invariant and non-invariant, in most benchmark datasets,
showcasing superior generalization capabilities across varying input lengths.

Motivation: 探索语言模型在群体推荐系统中的适用性，特别是在零样本学习和不同提示条件下的表现。

Method: 通过实验分析组复杂性（用户和物品数量）、不同语言模型、提示条件（如上下文学习或生成解释）以及偏好格式对准确性的影响。

Result: 性能在超过100个评分时开始下降，但不同模型对组复杂性的敏感度不同；上下文学习能显著提高高复杂性下的性能。

Conclusion: 未来研究应考虑组复杂性对语言模型性能的影响，且较小模型在适当条件下也能有效生成群体推荐。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommender systems
aimed at both individuals and groups. Previously, Group Recommender Systems
(GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single
recommendation based on the preferences of multiple people. In this paper, we
investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies
correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the
group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the
impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs,
different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating
explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that
performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings.
However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group
complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can
significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity,
while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting
for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research
should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect
on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios
differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All
in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group
recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller
models that require less computing power and costs.

Conclusion: 该方法在真实大语言模型dolly-v2-3b上展示了其解释能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are commonly fine-tuned to adapt to
downstream tasks. Since the majority of knowledge is acquired during
pre-training, attributing the predictions of fine-tuned LLMs to their
pre-training data may provide valuable insights. Influence functions have been
proposed as a means to explain model predictions based on training data.
However, existing approaches fail to compute ``multi-stage'' influence and lack
scalability to billion-scale LLMs.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-stage influence function to attribute the
downstream predictions of fine-tuned LLMs to pre-training data under the
full-parameter fine-tuning paradigm. To enhance the efficiency and practicality
of our multi-stage influence function, we leverage Eigenvalue-corrected
Kronecker-Factored (EK-FAC) parameterization for efficient approximation.
Empirical results validate the superior scalability of EK-FAC approximation and
the effectiveness of our multi-stage influence function. Additionally, case
studies on a real-world LLM, dolly-v2-3b, demonstrate its interpretive power,
with exemplars illustrating insights provided by multi-stage influence
estimates. Our code is public at

Motivation: 当前UI评估方法（如A/B测试）成本高且耗时，而现有VLM方法未能有效比较设计的说服力。

Method: 提出WiserUI-Bench基准（含300个UI图像对）和G-FOCUS推理策略，优化VLM评估。

Result: G-FOCUS在一致性和准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为UI设计优化提供了可扩展的替代方案，减少对A/B测试的依赖。

Abstract: Evaluating user interface (UI) design effectiveness extends beyond aesthetics
to influencing user behavior, a principle central to Design Persuasiveness. A/B
testing is the predominant method for determining which UI variations drive
higher user engagement, but it is costly and time-consuming. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process automated UI analysis, current
approaches focus on isolated design attributes rather than comparative
persuasiveness-the key factor in optimizing user interactions. To address this,
we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a benchmark designed for Pairwise UI Design
Persuasiveness Assessment task, featuring 300 real-world UI image pairs labeled
with A/B test results and expert rationales. Additionally, we propose G-FOCUS,
a novel inference-time reasoning strategy that enhances VLM-based
persuasiveness assessment by reducing position bias and improving evaluation
accuracy. Experimental results show that G-FOCUS surpasses existing inference
strategies in consistency and accuracy for pairwise UI evaluation. Through
promoting VLM-driven evaluation of UI persuasiveness, our work offers an
approach to complement A/B testing, propelling progress in scalable UI
preference modeling and design optimization. Code and data will be released
publicly.

Motivation: 孟加拉语作为低资源语言，其消费者健康查询常含冗余信息，影响医疗响应效率，需探索高效摘要方法。

Method: 使用BanglaCHQ-Summ数据集（2,350对查询-摘要），以ROUGE指标对比九种LLMs与微调模型Bangla T5的性能。

Result: Mixtral-8x22b-Instruct在ROUGE-1和ROUGE-L领先，Bangla T5在ROUGE-2表现最佳，零样本LLMs可媲美微调模型。

Conclusion: 零样本LLMs在低资源语言中具备潜力，为医疗查询摘要提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Consumer Health Queries (CHQs) in Bengali (Bangla), a low-resource language,
often contain extraneous details, complicating efficient medical responses.
This study investigates the zero-shot performance of nine advanced large
language models (LLMs): GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Claude-3.5-Sonnet,
Llama3-70b-Instruct, Mixtral-8x22b-Instruct, Gemini-1.5-Pro,
Qwen2-72b-Instruct, Gemma-2-27b, and Athene-70B, in summarizing Bangla CHQs.
Using the BanglaCHQ-Summ dataset comprising 2,350 annotated query-summary
pairs, we benchmarked these LLMs using ROUGE metrics against Bangla T5, a
fine-tuned state-of-the-art model. Mixtral-8x22b-Instruct emerged as the top
performing model in ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L, while Bangla T5 excelled in ROUGE-2.
The results demonstrate that zero-shot LLMs can rival fine-tuned models,
achieving high-quality summaries even without task-specific training. This work
underscores the potential of LLMs in addressing challenges in low-resource
languages, providing scalable solutions for healthcare query summarization.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has raised significant
concerns regarding their potential misuse by malicious actors. As a result,
developing effective detectors to mitigate these risks has become a critical
priority. However, most existing detection methods focus excessively on
detection accuracy, often neglecting the societal risks posed by high false
positive rates (FPRs). This paper addresses this issue by leveraging Conformal
Prediction (CP), which effectively constrains the upper bound of FPRs. While
directly applying CP constrains FPRs, it also leads to a significant reduction
in detection performance. To overcome this trade-off, this paper proposes a
Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Framework via Multiscaled Conformal
Prediction (MCP), which both enforces the FPR constraint and improves detection
performance. This paper also introduces RealDet, a high-quality dataset that
spans a wide range of domains, ensuring realistic calibration and enabling
superior detection performance when combined with MCP. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that MCP effectively constrains FPRs, significantly enhances
detection performance, and increases robustness against adversarial attacks
across multiple detectors and datasets.

### [106] [Unveiling Language-Specific Features in Large Language Models via Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05111)
*Boyi Deng,Yu Wan,Yidan Zhang,Baosong Yang,Fuli Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）多语言能力的机制，提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）的新方法，并发现语言特定特征可用于控制LLM的语言生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经元或内部激活的方法在多语言能力分析中存在局限性，如叠加和层间激活差异，因此需要更可靠的方法。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）分解LLM的激活，提出新指标评估特征的单一语言性，并通过特征消融实验验证其影响。

Result: 发现某些SAE特征与特定语言强相关，消融这些特征仅显著影响一种语言能力；部分语言存在协同特征，联合消融效果更佳。

Conclusion: SAE方法为多语言能力分析提供了新视角，语言特定特征可用于增强对LLM生成语言的控制。

Abstract: The mechanisms behind multilingual capabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been examined using neuron-based or internal-activation-based
methods. However, these methods often face challenges such as superposition and
layer-wise activation variance, which limit their reliability. Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) offer a more nuanced analysis by decomposing the
activations of LLMs into sparse linear combination of SAE features. We
introduce a novel metric to assess the monolinguality of features obtained from
SAEs, discovering that some features are strongly related to specific
languages. Additionally, we show that ablating these SAE features only
significantly reduces abilities in one language of LLMs, leaving others almost
unaffected. Interestingly, we find some languages have multiple synergistic SAE
features, and ablating them together yields greater improvement than ablating
individually. Moreover, we leverage these SAE-derived language-specific
features to enhance steering vectors, achieving control over the language
generated by LLMs.

TLDR: 论文提出了U-MNER框架和Twitter2015-Urdu数据集，用于解决低资源语言（如乌尔都语）多模态命名实体识别（MNER）的研究空白，并建立了基准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态内容（如社交媒体上的文本和图像）的兴起使得MNER成为重要研究方向，但低资源语言如乌尔都语的研究仍不足，主要挑战是缺乏标注数据集和标准化基线。

Method: 提出U-MNER框架，结合Urdu-BERT和ResNet提取文本和视觉特征，通过跨模态融合模块对齐信息。使用Twitter2015-Urdu数据集进行实验。

Result: 模型在Twitter2015-Urdu数据集上达到最优性能，为低资源语言的MNER研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: U-MNER框架和Twitter2015-Urdu数据集填补了乌尔都语MNER的研究空白，为未来研究提供了基准和方向。

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal content, particularly text and images on social
media, has positioned Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) as an
increasingly important area of research within Natural Language Processing.
Despite progress in high-resource languages such as English, MNER remains
underexplored for low-resource languages like Urdu. The primary challenges
include the scarcity of annotated multimodal datasets and the lack of
standardized baselines. To address these challenges, we introduce the U-MNER
framework and release the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, a pioneering resource for
Urdu MNER. Adapted from the widely used Twitter2015 dataset, it is annotated
with Urdu-specific grammar rules. We establish benchmark baselines by
evaluating both text-based and multimodal models on this dataset, providing
comparative analyses to support future research on Urdu MNER. The U-MNER
framework integrates textual and visual context using Urdu-BERT for text
embeddings and ResNet for visual feature extraction, with a Cross-Modal Fusion
Module to align and fuse information. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, laying the groundwork for further
MNER research in low-resource languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: QualBench是首个专注于中文大语言模型（LLM）本地化评估的多领域问答基准，包含17,000多个问题，覆盖六个垂直领域。评估结果显示，中文LLM在本地化领域知识上表现优于非中文模型，但仍有提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在垂直领域覆盖不足且缺乏中文工作场景的深入洞察，因此需要开发一个本地化的评估框架。

Method: 利用资格考试作为统一框架，构建了QualBench数据集，涵盖六个垂直领域，基于24项中国资格考试标准。

Result: Qwen2.5模型表现优于GPT-4o，中文LLM整体优于非中文模型，最佳准确率为75.26%。

Conclusion: 本地化领域知识对LLM性能至关重要，未来可通过多领域RAG知识增强和联邦学习优化垂直领域LLM训练。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Chinese large language models (LLMs) underscores the
need for domain-specific evaluations to ensure reliable applications. However,
existing benchmarks often lack coverage in vertical domains and offer limited
insights into the Chinese working context. Leveraging qualification exams as a
unified framework for human expertise evaluation, we introduce QualBench, the
first multi-domain Chinese QA benchmark dedicated to localized assessment of
Chinese LLMs. The dataset includes over 17,000 questions across six vertical
domains, with data selections grounded in 24 Chinese qualifications to closely
align with national policies and working standards. Through comprehensive
evaluation, the Qwen2.5 model outperformed the more advanced GPT-4o, with
Chinese LLMs consistently surpassing non-Chinese models, highlighting the
importance of localized domain knowledge in meeting qualification requirements.
The best performance of 75.26% reveals the current gaps in domain coverage
within model capabilities. Furthermore, we present the failure of LLM
collaboration with crowdsourcing mechanisms and suggest the opportunities for
multi-domain RAG knowledge enhancement and vertical domain LLM training with
Federated Learning.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的表格标记方法（T-T），用于解决ASTE任务中的长序列和局部注意力问题，通过条纹注意力和循环移位策略实现高效关系学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉标记表中词间关系时能力有限，而Transformer的语义建模能力强大，但直接使用会面临长序列和不公平局部注意力问题。

Method: 提出Table-Transformer（T-T），引入条纹注意力机制和循环移位策略，优化全局注意力为局部窗口并促进窗口间交互。

Result: 实验表明T-T作为关系学习模块，以较低计算成本实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: T-T通过创新注意力机制有效解决了Transformer在ASTE任务中的挑战，显著提升了模型表现。

Abstract: Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets composed
of aspect terms, opinion terms, and sentiment polarities from given sentences.
The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which
encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of
relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing
various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions
between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture
relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we
attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning
modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it
is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to
the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the
input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges:
overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the
tagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention
mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former
modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local
attention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different
attention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the
T-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art
performance with lower computational costs.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）无法有效支持论证过程，需设计能增强论证能力的技术。

Method: 提出“合理鹦鹉”概念，基于论证理论的原则（相关性、责任、自由）和对话动作重新设计LLMs。

Result: 通过论证理论原则指导LLMs设计，使其成为批判性思维工具而非替代品。

Conclusion: 论证理论应为LLM技术设计的基础，以支持有效的论证对话。

Abstract: In this position paper, we advocate for the development of conversational
technology that is inherently designed to support and facilitate argumentative
processes. We argue that, at present, large language models (LLMs) are
inadequate for this purpose, and we propose an ideal technology design aimed at
enhancing argumentative skills. This involves re-framing LLMs as tools to
exercise our critical thinking rather than replacing them. We introduce the
concept of 'reasonable parrots' that embody the fundamental principles of
relevance, responsibility, and freedom, and that interact through argumentative
dialogical moves. These principles and moves arise out of millennia of work in
argumentation theory and should serve as the starting point for LLM-based
technology that incorporates basic principles of argumentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖计算昂贵的梯度或人工设计的启发式规则，未能充分利用数据内在属性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ICon选择的数据显著优于全数据集和其他方法，性能提升最高达5.42%。

Conclusion: ICon提供了一种高效且无偏的数据选择方法，所选样本兼具任务多样性和适当难度。

Abstract: Data selection for instruction tuning is essential for improving the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and reducing training cost.
However, existing automated selection methods either depend on computationally
expensive gradient-based measures or manually designed heuristics, which may
fail to fully exploit the intrinsic attributes of data. In this paper, we
propose In-context Learning for Contribution Measurement (ICon), a novel
gradient-free method that takes advantage of the implicit fine-tuning nature of
in-context learning (ICL) to measure sample contribution without gradient
computation or manual indicators engineering. ICon offers a computationally
efficient alternative to gradient-based methods and reduces human inductive
bias inherent in heuristic-based approaches. ICon comprises three components
and identifies high-contribution data by assessing performance shifts under
implicit learning through ICL. Extensive experiments on three LLMs across 12
benchmarks and 5 pairwise evaluation sets demonstrate the effectiveness of
ICon. Remarkably, on LLaMA3.1-8B, models trained on 15% of ICon-selected data
outperform full datasets by 5.42% points and exceed the best performance of
widely used selection methods by 2.06% points. We further analyze
high-contribution samples selected by ICon, which show both diverse tasks and
appropriate difficulty levels, rather than just the hardest ones.

Method: 分析未经调整和微调的LLM生成的新闻内容，比较其与人类作者的框架表现。

Result: LLM在敏感话题中表现出更明显的框架偏见，且不同模型间差异显著。

Conclusion: 需开发有效的后训练缓解策略和更严格的评估框架，以确保自动新闻内容的平衡性。

Abstract: Framing in media critically shapes public perception by selectively
emphasizing some details while downplaying others. With the rise of large
language models in automated news and content creation, there is growing
concern that these systems may introduce or even amplify framing biases
compared to human authors. In this paper, we explore how framing manifests in
both out-of-the-box and fine-tuned LLM-generated news content. Our analysis
reveals that, particularly in politically and socially sensitive contexts, LLMs
tend to exhibit more pronounced framing than their human counterparts. In
addition, we observe significant variation in framing tendencies across
different model architectures, with some models displaying notably higher
biases. These findings point to the need for effective post-training mitigation
strategies and tighter evaluation frameworks to ensure that automated news
content upholds the standards of balanced reporting.

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities of large language models are primarily studied for
English, even when pretrained models are multilingual. In this work, we
investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that
scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models
(RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages
including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models
twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are
naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think
pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an
effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we
observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource
languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in
particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English.
Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the
limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time
scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason
in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning
in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.

Motivation: 研究CoT是否能忠实反映AI模型的真实推理过程，以评估其在AI安全性中的潜在作用。

Method: 通过6种提示中的推理线索，评估前沿推理模型的CoT忠实性，并分析强化学习对忠实性的影响。

Result: CoT揭示模型使用线索的比率通常低于20%；强化学习初期提升忠实性但效果有限；奖励破解时，模型不会更频繁地表达线索。

Conclusion: CoT监控在训练和评估中有潜力发现不良行为，但不足以完全排除，且在非必要场景下难以捕捉罕见灾难性行为。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows
monitoring a model's CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning
processes. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs
faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT
faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints
presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested,
CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the
hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement
learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and
(3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward
hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without
training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a
promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations,
but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in
settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring
of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected
behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标过于注重机械准确性，忽视了艺术表达，可能导致翻译质量和文化真实性的下降。

Method: 提出TransProQA框架，整合专业文学翻译者和研究者的见解，关注文学质量评估的关键要素。

Result: TransProQA在相关性（ACC-EQ和Kendall's tau）和充分性评估中显著优于现有指标，接近人类评估水平。

Conclusion: TransProQA具有广泛适用性，可作为无训练需求的文学评估工具，尤其适用于需本地处理的文本。

Abstract: The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary
domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy
over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being
superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this
bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural
authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary
evaluation metric, we introduce TransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based
question-answering (QA) framework designed specifically for literary
translation evaluation. TransProQA uniquely integrates insights from
professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical
elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural
understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while
literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, TransProQA substantially
outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ
and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics by
over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator
insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of
translator inputs. Notably, TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation
performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad
applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b,
indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation
metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing
due to copyright or ethical considerations.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的快速发展，数据质量成为提升模型性能的关键因素。然而，现有方法在数据验证和种子数据选择上存在效率低和主观性强的问题。

Method: 引入高效的数据验证策略，优化种子数据选择，提出基于fastText的轻量级分类器，构建高效数据过滤流程，并应用于FineWeb和Chinese FineWeb数据集。

Conclusion: 提出的数据过滤流程有效提升了数据质量和训练效率，验证了其在LLM训练中的实用性。

Abstract: Data quality has become a key factor in enhancing model performance with the
rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Model-driven data filtering
has increasingly become a primary approach for acquiring high-quality data.
However, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data
verification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data
quality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks
clear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of
subjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient
verification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on
LLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge,
we build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM
training, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize
the selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data
filtering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency,
classifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental
and inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we
employ a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the
filtering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese
FineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb
dataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120
billion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on
Ultra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple
benchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both
data quality and training efficiency.

Abstract: The emergence of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) has advanced
the field of dialogue systems, enabling both realistic user simulations and
robust multi-turn conversational agents. However, existing research often
evaluates these components in isolation-either focusing on a single user
simulator or a specific system design-limiting the generalisability of insights
across architectures and configurations. In this work, we propose clem todd
(chat-optimized LLMs for task-oriented dialogue systems development), a
flexible framework for systematically evaluating dialogue systems under
consistent conditions. clem todd enables detailed benchmarking across
combinations of user simulators and dialogue systems, whether existing models
from literature or newly developed ones. It supports plug-and-play integration
and ensures uniform datasets, evaluation metrics, and computational
constraints. We showcase clem todd's flexibility by re-evaluating existing
task-oriented dialogue systems within this unified setup and integrating three
newly proposed dialogue systems into the same evaluation pipeline. Our results
provide actionable insights into how architecture, scale, and prompting
strategies affect dialogue performance, offering practical guidance for
building efficient and effective conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine visual perception with the general
capabilities, such as reasoning, of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
mechanisms by which these two abilities can be combined and contribute remain
poorly understood. In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning
through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike
previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose
merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that model merging offers a successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities
from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged
models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how
merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly
encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely
facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all
layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception
abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed
light on the potential of model merging as a tool for multimodal integration

Abstract: Direct alignment methods are increasingly used for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, these methods suffer from the
issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the
noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and
dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we
propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and
provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our
method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the
flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance
of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple
base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with
benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show
the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations
of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we
evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs
with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in
\citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) have emerged

specific contributions to biomedical applications remain insufficiently
characterized. In this study, we present \textbf{AR}tificial
\textbf{I}ntelligence research assistant for \textbf{E}xpert-involved
\textbf{L}earning (ARIEL), a multimodal dataset designed to benchmark and
enhance two critical capabilities of LLMs and LMMs in biomedical research:
summarizing extensive scientific texts and interpreting complex biomedical
figures. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we create two open-source sets
comprising biomedical articles and figures with designed questions. We
systematically benchmark both open- and closed-source foundation models,
incorporating expert-driven human evaluations conducted by doctoral-level
experts. Furthermore, we improve model performance through targeted prompt
engineering and fine-tuning strategies for summarizing research papers, and
apply test-time computational scaling to enhance the reasoning capabilities of
LMMs, achieving superior accuracy compared to human-expert corrections. We also
explore the potential of using LMM Agents to generate scientific hypotheses
from diverse multimodal inputs. Overall, our results delineate clear strengths
and highlight significant limitations of current foundation models, providing
actionable insights and guiding future advancements in deploying large-scale

Abstract: This article explores the emergence of autonomy and agency by connecting
fundamental computational limits (decidability, completeness, computational
irreducibility) with physical concepts. We introduce a formal model of a
"minimal agent" operating within potentially Turing-complete environments.
Using algorithmic information theory, we argue that the inherent undecidability
and computational irreducibility of agent-environment interaction lead to
unpredictability and novel information generation, enabling agency (effective
goal-directed action). Computational irreducibility prevents full external
prediction, creating necessary conditions for autonomous behavior. We relate
this to computational sourcehood, where an agent is the irreducible origin of
its behavior, though formalizing this concept remains challenging. Our central
thesis, formally proven, is that genuine autonomy necessarily implies
undecidability from an external perspective, distinguishing autonomous systems
from predictable ones. We propose that agency arises when agent-environment
coupling complexity allows mutual information between internal states and
relevant environmental variables to increase, particularly where analytical
solutions are absent and operational closure is needed for persistence. This
framework links agency directly to the computational properties of interaction,
offering implications for understanding consciousness, designing autonomous AI,
and reconceptualizing free will in a deterministic yet computationally
irreducible universe.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为DynLS的高效算法，用于解决最大加权独立集（MWIS）问题，该算法在智能交通系统中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI技术在智能交通系统中需要大量训练时间和计算资源，尤其是在大规模复杂场景下。

Method: DynLS结合了基于分数的自适应顶点扰动（SAVP）、区域定位机制（RLM）和新型变量邻域下降策略（ComLS）。

Result: DynLS在360个测试实例中表现最佳，解决了350个实例，且收敛速度与当前最优算法相当。

Conclusion: DynLS为MWIS问题的启发式算法提供了重要进展，有助于优化智能交通系统中的AI技术。

Abstract: While Artificial intelligence (AI), including Generative AI, are effective at
generating high-quality traffic data and optimization solutions in intelligent
transportation systems (ITSs), these techniques often demand significant
training time and computational resources, especially in large-scale and
complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce a novel and efficient
algorithm for solving the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem,
which can be used to model many ITSs applications, such as traffic signal
control and vehicle routing. Given the NP-hard nature of the MWIS problem, our
proposed algorithm, DynLS, incorporates three key innovations to solve it
effectively. First, it uses a scores-based adaptive vertex perturbation (SAVP)
technique to accelerate convergence, particularly in sparse graphs. Second, it
includes a region location mechanism (RLM) to help escape local optima by
dynamically adjusting the search space. Finally, it employs a novel variable
neighborhood descent strategy, ComLS, which combines vertex exchange strategies
with a reward mechanism to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Our
experimental results demonstrate DynLS's superior performance, consistently
delivering high-quality solutions within 1000 seconds. DynLS outperformed five
leading algorithms across 360 test instances, achieving the best solution for
350 instances and surpassing the second-best algorithm, Cyclic-Fast, by 177
instances. Moreover, DynLS matched Cyclic-Fast's convergence speed,
highlighting its efficiency and practicality. This research represents a
significant advancement in heuristic algorithms for the MWIS problem, offering
a promising approach to aid AI techniques in optimizing intelligent
transportation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能辅导系统依赖模板化反馈，缺乏个性化。LLMs虽能动态生成反馈，但存在幻觉或教学不合理的风险。

Method: 评估了四种LLMs在358个命题逻辑问题上的表现，比较了六种提示技术，并进一步用最佳模型生成提示并评估。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在逐步证明构建中准确率达84.4%，生成的提示在准确性和清晰度上表现良好，但在解释上下文方面不足。

Conclusion: LLMs可增强辅导系统的提示生成能力，但需改进以确保准确性和教学合理性。

Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems have demonstrated effectiveness in teaching
formal propositional logic proofs, but their reliance on template-based
explanations limits their ability to provide personalized student feedback.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for dynamic
feedback generation, they risk producing hallucinations or pedagogically
unsound explanations. We evaluated the stepwise accuracy of LLMs in
constructing multi-step symbolic logic proofs, comparing six prompting
techniques across four state-of-the-art LLMs on 358 propositional logic
problems. Results show that DeepSeek-V3 achieved superior performance with
84.4% accuracy on stepwise proof construction and excelled particularly in
simpler rules. We further used the best-performing LLM to generate explanatory
hints for 1,050 unique student problem-solving states from a logic ITS and
evaluated them on 4 criteria with both an LLM grader and human expert ratings
on a 20% sample. Our analysis finds that LLM-generated hints were 75% accurate
and rated highly by human evaluators on consistency and clarity, but did not
perform as well explaining why the hint was provided or its larger context. Our
results demonstrate that LLMs may be used to augment tutoring systems with
logic tutoring hints, but requires additional modifications to ensure accuracy
and pedagogical appropriateness.

Conclusion: 建议将辩论焦点转向建模假设的批判性评估，并强调在认知科学中需综合考虑算法复杂性。

Abstract: Action-values play a central role in popular Reinforcement Learing (RL)
models of behavior. Yet, the idea that action-values are explicitly represented
has been extensively debated. Critics had therefore repeatedly suggested that
policy-gradient (PG) models should be favored over value-based (VB) ones, as a
potential solution for this dilemma. Here we argue that this solution is
unsatisfying. This is because PG methods are not, in fact, "Value-free" --
while they do not rely on an explicit representation of Value for acting
(stimulus-response mapping), they do require it for learning. Hence, switching
to PG models is, per se, insufficient for eliminating Value from models of
behavior. More broadly, the requirement for a representation of Value stems
from the underlying assumptions regarding the optimization objective posed by
the standard RL framework, not from the particular algorithm chosen to solve
it. Previous studies mostly took these standard RL assumptions for granted, as
part of their conceptualization or problem modeling, while debating the
different methods used to optimize it (i.e., PG or VB). We propose that,
instead, the focus of the debate should shift to critically evaluating the
underlying modeling assumptions. Such evaluation is particularly important from
an experimental perspective. Indeed, the very notion of Value must be
reconsidered when standard assumptions (e.g., risk neutrality,
full-observability, Markovian environment, exponential discounting) are
relaxed, as is likely in natural settings. Finally, we use the Value debate as
a case study to argue in favor of a more nuanced, algorithmic rather than
statistical, view of what constitutes "a model" in cognitive sciences. Our
analysis suggests that besides "parametric" statistical complexity, additional
aspects such as computational complexity must also be taken into account when
evaluating model complexity.

Result: 研究揭示了LLMs和RL在多智能体ACD环境中的优缺点，为未来ACD团队的训练和部署提供了方向。

Conclusion: LLMs在多智能体ACD中表现出潜力，但仍需进一步研究以优化其协作能力。

Abstract: Fast and effective incident response is essential to prevent adversarial
cyberattacks. Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD) aims to automate incident response
through Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that plan and execute actions. Most
ACD approaches focus on single-agent scenarios and leverage Reinforcement
Learning (RL). However, ACD RL-trained agents depend on costly training, and
their reasoning is not always explainable or transferable. Large Language
Models (LLMs) can address these concerns by providing explainable actions in
general security contexts. Researchers have explored LLM agents for ACD but
have not evaluated them on multi-agent scenarios or interacting with other ACD
agents. In this paper, we show the first study on how LLMs perform in
multi-agent ACD environments by proposing a new integration to the CybORG CAGE
4 environment. We examine how ACD teams of LLM and RL agents can interact by
proposing a novel communication protocol. Our results highlight the strengths
and weaknesses of LLMs and RL and help us identify promising research
directions to create, train, and deploy future teams of ACD agents.

Motivation: 现有模型的训练数据主要基于西方文化，导致对其他文化的生成质量下降，甚至产生刻板印象和冒犯性内容。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出一种收集和处理文化代码数据的方法，构建俄罗斯文化数据集，并在Kandinsky 3.1模型上验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了模型对俄罗斯文化的理解，生成质量有所提升。

Conclusion: 文化代码数据集的引入能有效改善模型在特定文化领域的生成能力，未来可扩展至其他文化。

Abstract: Despite the fact that popular text-to-image generation models cope well with
international and general cultural queries, they have a significant knowledge
gap regarding individual cultures. This is due to the content of existing large
training datasets collected on the Internet, which are predominantly based on
Western European or American popular culture. Meanwhile, the lack of cultural
adaptation of the model can lead to incorrect results, a decrease in the
generation quality, and the spread of stereotypes and offensive content. In an
effort to address this issue, we examine the concept of cultural code and
recognize the critical importance of its understanding by modern image
generation models, an issue that has not been sufficiently addressed in the
research community to date. We propose the methodology for collecting and
processing the data necessary to form a dataset based on the cultural code, in
particular the Russian one. We explore how the collected data affects the
quality of generations in the national domain and analyze the effectiveness of
our approach using the Kandinsky 3.1 text-to-image model. Human evaluation
results demonstrate an increase in the level of awareness of Russian culture in
the model.

Conclusion: Transformer-decoder模型在推理任务中存在局限性，enigme库为未来AI架构的推理能力评估提供了工具。

Abstract: Transformer-decoder language models are a core innovation in text based
generative artificial intelligence. These models are being deployed as
general-purpose intelligence systems in many applications. Central to their
utility is the capacity to understand natural language commands and exploit the
reasoning embedded in human text corpora to apply some form of reasoning
process to a wide variety of novel tasks. To understand the limitations of this
approach to generating reasoning we argue that we need to consider the
architectural constraints of these systems. Consideration of the latent
variable structure of transformer-decoder models allows us to design reasoning
tasks that should probe the boundary of their capacity to reason. We present
enigme, an open-source library for generating text-based puzzles to be used in
training and evaluating reasoning skills within transformer-decoder models and
future AI architectures.

Abstract: We examine belief filtering as a mechanism for the epistemic control of
artificial agents, focusing on the regulation of internal cognitive states
represented as linguistic expressions. This mechanism is developed within the
Semantic Manifold framework, where belief states are dynamic, structured
ensembles of natural language fragments. Belief filters act as content-aware
operations on these fragments across various cognitive transitions. This paper
illustrates how the inherent interpretability and modularity of such a
linguistically-grounded cognitive architecture directly enable belief
filtering, offering a principled approach to agent regulation. The study
highlights the potential for enhancing AI safety and alignment through
structured interventions in an agent's internal semantic space and points to
new directions for architecturally embedded cognitive governance.

Conclusion: 认知人工智能是提升AI鲁棒性和适应性的潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the impressive achievements of AI, including advancements in
generative models and large language models, there remains a significant gap in
the ability of AI to handle uncertainty and generalize beyond the training
data. We argue that AI models, especially in autonomous systems, fail to make
robust predictions when faced with unfamiliar or adversarial data, as evidenced
by incidents with autonomous vehicles. Traditional machine learning approaches
struggle to address these issues due to an overemphasis on data fitting and
domain adaptation. This position paper posits a paradigm shift towards
epistemic artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need for models to learn not
only from what they know but also from their ignorance. This approach, which
focuses on recognizing and managing uncertainty, offers a potential solution to
improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems, ensuring that they can
better handle unpredictable real-world environments.

Abstract: The peer review process in major artificial intelligence (AI) conferences
faces unprecedented challenges with the surge of paper submissions (exceeding
10,000 submissions per venue), accompanied by growing concerns over review
quality and reviewer responsibility. This position paper argues for the need to
transform the traditional one-way review system into a bi-directional feedback
loop where authors evaluate review quality and reviewers earn formal
accreditation, creating an accountability framework that promotes a
sustainable, high-quality peer review system. The current review system can be
viewed as an interaction between three parties: the authors, reviewers, and
system (i.e., conference), where we posit that all three parties share
responsibility for the current problems. However, issues with authors can only
be addressed through policy enforcement and detection tools, and ethical
concerns can only be corrected through self-reflection. As such, this paper
focuses on reforming reviewer accountability with systematic rewards through
two key mechanisms: (1) a two-stage bi-directional review system that allows
authors to evaluate reviews while minimizing retaliatory behavior, (2)a
systematic reviewer reward system that incentivizes quality reviewing. We ask
for the community's strong interest in these problems and the reforms that are
needed to enhance the peer review process.

Abstract: The tragedy of the commons, where individual self-interest leads to
collectively disastrous outcomes, is a pervasive challenge in human society.
Recent studies have demonstrated that similar phenomena can arise in generative
multi-agent systems (MASs). To address this challenge, this paper explores the
use of reputation systems as a remedy. We propose RepuNet, a dynamic,
dual-level reputation framework that models both agent-level reputation
dynamics and system-level network evolution. Specifically, driven by direct
interactions and indirect gossip, agents form reputations for both themselves
and their peers, and decide whether to connect or disconnect other agents for
future interactions. Through two distinct scenarios, we show that RepuNet
effectively mitigates the 'tragedy of the commons', promoting and sustaining
cooperation in generative MASs. Moreover, we find that reputation systems can
give rise to rich emergent behaviors in generative MASs, such as the formation
of cooperative clusters, the social isolation of exploitative agents, and the
preference for sharing positive gossip rather than negative ones.

Abstract: The layout of analog ICs requires making complex trade-offs, while addressing
device physics and variability of the circuits. This makes full automation with
learning-based solutions hard to achieve. However, reinforcement learning (RL)
has recently reached significant results, particularly in solving the
floorplanning problem. This paper presents a hybrid method that combines RL
with a beam (BS) strategy. The BS algorithm enhances the agent's inference
process, allowing for the generation of flexible floorplans by accomodating
various objective weightings, and addressing congestion without without the
need for policy retraining or fine-tuning. Moreover, the RL agent's
generalization ability stays intact, along with its efficient handling of
circuit features and constraints. Experimental results show approx. 5-85%
improvement in area, dead space and half-perimeter wire length compared to a
standard RL application, along with higher rewards for the agent. Moreover,
performance and efficiency align closely with those of existing
state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: 现有神经符号AI框架多假设知识静态不变，忽略了时间维度，本文旨在解决动态知识场景下的分类问题。

Method: 提出多阶段神经符号架构，并与纯神经架构对比，实验基于新引入的基准框架。

Result: 结果表明新场景具有挑战性，同时揭示了神经符号方法的不足。

Conclusion: 本文为未来研究提供了宝贵参考，强调了动态知识场景的重要性。

Abstract: One of the goals of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence is to exploit
background knowledge to improve the performance of learning tasks. However,
most of the existing frameworks focus on the simplified scenario where
knowledge does not change over time and does not cover the temporal dimension.
In this work we consider the much more challenging problem of knowledge-driven
sequence classification where different portions of knowledge must be employed
at different timesteps, and temporal relations are available. Our experimental
evaluation compares multi-stage neuro-symbolic and neural-only architectures,
and it is conducted on a newly-introduced benchmarking framework. Results
demonstrate the challenging nature of this novel setting, and also highlight
under-explored shortcomings of neuro-symbolic methods, representing a precious
reference for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的具身AI需要处理复杂动态环境中的多智能体协作问题，但现有研究多集中于单智能体静态环境，缺乏系统性综述。

Method: 通过文献综述，分析多智能体具身AI的研究进展、关键技术和应用场景。

Result: 总结了当前研究的局限性，提出了未来发展的挑战和方向。

Conclusion: 多智能体具身AI的研究尚处于早期阶段，需进一步探索动态开放环境中的协作机制和实时学习能力。

Abstract: Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the
application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems
are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and
interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and
actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world
feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and
unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL),
reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied
AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications
spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most
research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed
environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex
scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their
surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating
sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative
problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing
research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail
to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent
embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the
advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to
deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges
presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further
development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research,
analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions,
providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: AI代理在长时间任务中的表现可用简单数学模型解释，即每分钟失败率为常数，导致成功率随任务时长指数下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Kwa等人（2025）的实证研究，探讨AI代理在长时间任务中的失败模式及其潜在原因。

Method: 提出一个简单的数学模型，假设每分钟失败率为常数，并验证其与数据的拟合程度。

Result: 模型拟合良好，表明AI代理在长时间任务中的失败可能由子任务链中的单点故障引起。

Conclusion: 该模型为理解AI代理在长时间任务中的表现提供了新视角，但其普适性需进一步研究。

Abstract: Building on the recent empirical work of Kwa et al. (2025), I show that
within their suite of research-engineering tasks the performance of AI agents
on longer-duration tasks can be explained by an extremely simple mathematical
model -- a constant rate of failing during each minute a human would take to do
the task. This implies an exponentially declining success rate with the length
of the task and that each agent could be characterised by its own half-life.
This empirical regularity allows us to estimate the success rate for an agent
at different task lengths. And the fact that this model is a good fit for the
data is suggestive of the underlying causes of failure on longer tasks -- that
they involve increasingly large sets of subtasks where failing any one fails
the task. Whether this model applies more generally on other suites of tasks is
unknown and an important subject for further work.

*Anish Ganguli,Prabal Deb,Debleena Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: MARK框架通过结构化记忆增强LLMs，使其无需重新训练即可持续学习，提升领域适应性和响应准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在动态领域知识中对齐不足的问题，减少幻觉并提升个性化服务。

Method: 利用三种专用代理（残余记忆、用户问题记忆、LLM响应记忆）存储和分析领域知识，结合时间因素优化信息。

Result: MARK提升了LLMs的领域适应性、响应准确性和个性化能力，适用于医疗、法律等专业领域。

Conclusion: MARK为LLMs提供了一种无需重新训练的动态知识更新方法，显著提升了其在专业领域的实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in specialized tasks but struggle to
align with evolving domain knowledge without costly fine-tuning. Domain
knowledge consists of: Knowledge: Immutable facts (e.g., 'A stone is solid')
and generally accepted principles (e.g., ethical standards); Refined Memory:
Evolving insights shaped by business needs and real-world changes. However, a
significant gap often exists between a domain expert's deep, nuanced
understanding and the system's domain knowledge, which can hinder accurate
information retrieval and application. Our Memory-Augmented Refinement of
Knowledge (MARK) framework enables LLMs to continuously learn without
retraining by leveraging structured refined memory, inspired by the Society of
Mind. MARK operates through specialized agents, each serving a distinct role:
Residual Refined Memory Agent: Stores and retrieves domain-specific insights to
maintain context over time; User Question Refined Memory Agent: Captures
user-provided facts, abbreviations, and terminology for better comprehension;
LLM Response Refined Memory Agent: Extracts key elements from responses for
refinement and personalization. These agents analyse stored refined memory,
detect patterns, resolve contradictions, and improve response accuracy.
Temporal factors like recency and frequency prioritize relevant information
while discarding outdated insights. MARK enhances LLMs in multiple ways: Ground
Truth Strategy: Reduces hallucinations by establishing a structured reference;
Domain-Specific Adaptation: Essential for fields like healthcare, law, and
manufacturing, where proprietary insights are absent from public datasets;
Personalized AI Assistants: Improves virtual assistants by remembering user
preferences, ensuring coherent responses over time.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于冲突理论和文化演化的“适当性框架”，以解决AI决策中的道德多样性问题，替代传统的“对齐”方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统采用的一刀切“对齐”方法忽视了道德多样性，可能导致信任危机和制度不稳定。

Method: 提出了“适当性框架”，包含四个设计原则：上下文基础、社区定制、持续适应和多中心治理。

Result: 该框架将AI对齐的隐喻从道德统一转向冲突管理，更具实用性和紧迫性。

Conclusion: 采用适当性框架是解决AI道德多样性问题的可行且迫切的方法。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly placed in positions
where their decisions have real consequences, e.g., moderating online spaces,
conducting research, and advising on policy. Ensuring they operate in a safe
and ethically acceptable fashion is thus critical. However, most solutions have
been a form of one-size-fits-all "alignment". We are worried that such systems,
which overlook enduring moral diversity, will spark resistance, erode trust,
and destabilize our institutions. This paper traces the underlying problem to
an often-unstated Axiom of Rational Convergence: the idea that under ideal
conditions, rational agents will converge in the limit of conversation on a
single ethics. Treating that premise as both optional and doubtful, we propose
what we call the appropriateness framework: an alternative approach grounded in
conflict theory, cultural evolution, multi-agent systems, and institutional
economics. The appropriateness framework treats persistent disagreement as the
normal case and designs for it by applying four principles: (1) contextual
grounding, (2) community customization, (3) continual adaptation, and (4)
polycentric governance. We argue here that adopting these design principles is
a good way to shift the main alignment metaphor from moral unification to a
more productive metaphor of conflict management, and that taking this step is
both desirable and urgent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNN验证方法仅提供二元安全性判断，无法捕捉模型内部的细微安全级别，导致限制过严或过松。

Method: 利用抽象解释和输出可达集分析，验证分层不安全输出结构，评估多级安全性。

Result: 方法能按抽象安全级别对对抗输入排序，提供更详细的安全性评估，计算效率与传统方法相当或更高。

Conclusion: 抽象DNN验证方法为模型安全性提供了更细致的分析，适用于复杂任务和标准基准测试。

Abstract: Traditional methods for formal verification (FV) of deep neural networks
(DNNs) are constrained by a binary encoding of safety properties, where a model
is classified as either safe or unsafe (robust or not robust). This binary
encoding fails to capture the nuanced safety levels within a model, often
resulting in either overly restrictive or too permissive requirements. In this
paper, we introduce a novel problem formulation called Abstract
DNN-Verification, which verifies a hierarchical structure of unsafe outputs,
providing a more granular analysis of the safety aspect for a given DNN.
Crucially, by leveraging abstract interpretation and reasoning about output
reachable sets, our approach enables assessing multiple safety levels during
the FV process, requiring the same (in the worst case) or even potentially less
computational effort than the traditional binary verification approach.
Specifically, we demonstrate how this formulation allows rank adversarial
inputs according to their abstract safety level violation, offering a more
detailed evaluation of the model's safety and robustness. Our contributions
include a theoretical exploration of the relationship between our novel
abstract safety formulation and existing approaches that employ abstract
interpretation for robustness verification, complexity analysis of the novel
problem introduced, and an empirical evaluation considering both a complex deep
reinforcement learning task (based on Habitat 3.0) and standard
DNN-Verification benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于云的移动代理高延迟和成本问题，以及边缘部署模型在复杂任务中的能力不足。

Method: 提出EcoAgent框架，包括云端规划代理和两个边缘代理（执行代理和观察代理），通过闭环协作和预理解模块压缩图像以减少令牌使用。

Result: 在AndroidWorld上的实验表明，EcoAgent在显著减少MLLM令牌消耗的同时保持高任务成功率。

Conclusion: EcoAgent实现了高效且实用的移动自动化。

Abstract: Cloud-based mobile agents powered by (multimodal) large language models
((M)LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities but suffer from high latency and
cost. While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general
capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose
EcoAgent, an Edge-Cloud cOllaborative multi-agent framework for mobile
automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based
Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action
execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation
Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise
text, reducing token usage. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves
screen history and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld
show that EcoAgent maintains high task success rates while significantly
reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile
automation.

TLDR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）支持业务流程管理系统的可行性，提出了一种多步骤的对话式流程模型重设计（CPD）方法，并通过评估验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究多关注单次提示执行，而忽略了用户与LLM的持续交互。本文旨在探索LLM在迭代式流程模型设计与重设计中的应用。

Method: 提出CPD方法，通过LLM识别流程变更模式、调整用户请求表述并应用变更，实现可解释和可复现的修改。

Result: 评估表明，LLM能较好地处理大多数变更，但某些模式对LLM和用户较难理解，用户需支持以清晰描述变更。

Conclusion: LLM在业务流程管理中具有潜力，但需进一步支持用户清晰表达变更需求。

Abstract: With the recent success of large language models (LLMs), the idea of
AI-augmented Business Process Management systems is becoming more feasible. One
of their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally
actionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform
crucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign.
However, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and
evaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user
and the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to
empower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an
iterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign
(CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the
user in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM
is employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b)
re-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the
identified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of
the change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for
explainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the
CPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be
handled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that
some patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of
the study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes
clearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes
well according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.

Motivation: 当前缺乏针对皮肤组织的标注数据集和开源分析工具，阻碍了数字病理学的发展。

Method: 利用卷积神经网络和视觉变换器，开发Histo-Miner管道，分析皮肤鳞状细胞癌患者的WSI，生成细胞核和肿瘤区域的标注数据集。

Result: 模型性能优异，细胞核分割mPQ为0.569，分类F1为0.832，肿瘤分割mIoU为0.884。应用Histo-Miner预测45名患者的免疫治疗响应，发现淋巴细胞比例等特征具有预测价值。

Conclusion: Histo-Miner为临床相关场景提供直接解释和生物学见解，展示了其在数字病理学中的实用性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in digital pathology have enabled comprehensive analysis
of Whole-Slide Images (WSI) from tissue samples, leveraging high-resolution
microscopy and computational capabilities. Despite this progress, there is a
lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for
analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based
pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled
nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient
samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma
skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell
nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients,
Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for
nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation.
Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with
multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation,
macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection
over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these
predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology
and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks.
Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy
based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies
percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor
vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as
predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of
Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation
of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.

Method: 比较了六种跟踪器（两种点跟踪器和四种关节跟踪器）与专家手动标注的结果，提出后处理模块进行异常值检测和融合预测。

Result: 关节模型的均方根误差为11.41°至4.37°，结合后处理模块后降至6.99°和3.88°。

Conclusion: 姿态跟踪方法在短跑生物力学分析中具有潜力，但高精度应用仍需改进。

Abstract: Human pose estimation has witnessed significant advancements in recent years,
mainly due to the integration of deep learning models, the availability of a
vast amount of data, and large computational resources. These developments have
led to highly accurate body tracking systems, which have direct applications in
sports analysis and performance evaluation.
  This work analyzes the performance of six trackers: two point trackers and
four joint trackers for biomechanical analysis in sprints. The proposed
framework compares the results obtained from these pose trackers with the
manual annotations of biomechanical experts for more than 5870 frames. The
experimental framework employs forty sprints from five professional runners,
focusing on three key angles in sprint biomechanics: trunk inclination, hip
flex extension, and knee flex extension. We propose a post-processing module
for outlier detection and fusion prediction in the joint angles.
  The experimental results demonstrate that using joint-based models yields
root mean squared errors ranging from 11.41{\deg} to 4.37{\deg}. When
integrated with the post-processing modules, these errors can be reduced to
6.99{\deg} and 3.88{\deg}, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that
human pose tracking approaches can be valuable resources for the biomechanical
analysis of running. However, there is still room for improvement in
applications where high accuracy is required.

Abstract: We present Lay-Your-Scene (shorthand LayouSyn), a novel text-to-layout
generation pipeline for natural scenes. Prior scene layout generation methods
are either closed-vocabulary or use proprietary large language models for
open-vocabulary generation, limiting their modeling capabilities and broader
applicability in controllable image generation. In this work, we propose to use
lightweight open-source language models to obtain scene elements from text
prompts and a novel aspect-aware diffusion Transformer architecture trained in
an open-vocabulary manner for conditional layout generation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LayouSyn outperforms existing methods and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on challenging spatial and numerical reasoning
benchmarks. Additionally, we present two applications of LayouSyn. First, we
show that coarse initialization from large language models can be seamlessly
combined with our method to achieve better results. Second, we present a
pipeline for adding objects to images, demonstrating the potential of LayouSyn
in image editing applications.

Abstract: Performance comparisons are fundamental in medical imaging Artificial
Intelligence (AI) research, often driving claims of superiority based on
relative improvements in common performance metrics. However, such claims
frequently rely solely on empirical mean performance. In this paper, we
investigate whether newly proposed methods genuinely outperform the state of
the art by analyzing a representative cohort of medical imaging papers. We
quantify the probability of false claims based on a Bayesian approach that
leverages reported results alongside empirically estimated model congruence to
estimate whether the relative ranking of methods is likely to have occurred by
chance. According to our results, the majority (>80%) of papers claims
outperformance when introducing a new method. Our analysis further revealed a
high probability (>5%) of false outperformance claims in 86% of classification
papers and 53% of segmentation papers. These findings highlight a critical flaw
in current benchmarking practices: claims of outperformance in medical imaging
AI are frequently unsubstantiated, posing a risk of misdirecting future
research efforts.

Conclusion: Hyb-KAN ViT为视觉架构中参数效率与多尺度表征的平衡提供了新范式。

Abstract: This study addresses the inherent limitations of Multi-Layer Perceptrons
(MLPs) in Vision Transformers (ViTs) by introducing Hybrid Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network (KAN)-ViT (Hyb-KAN ViT), a novel framework that integrates
wavelet-based spectral decomposition and spline-optimized activation functions,
prior work has failed to focus on the prebuilt modularity of the ViT
architecture and integration of edge detection capabilities of Wavelet
functions. We propose two key modules: Efficient-KAN (Eff-KAN), which replaces
MLP layers with spline functions and Wavelet-KAN (Wav-KAN), leveraging
orthogonal wavelet transforms for multi-resolution feature extraction. These
modules are systematically integrated in ViT encoder layers and classification
heads to enhance spatial-frequency modeling while mitigating computational
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K (Image Recognition), COCO (Object
Detection and Instance Segmentation), and ADE20K (Semantic Segmentation)
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with Hyb-KAN ViT. Ablation studies
validate the efficacy of wavelet-driven spectral priors in segmentation and

*Songsong Duan,Xi Yang,Nannan Wang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出SATNet网络，通过深度质量、模态融合和特征表示三个角度平衡RGB-D显著性检测的效率和性能，实现轻量化和高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D方法在精度和效率之间难以平衡，轻量化方法难以达到高精度。

Method: 引入Depth Anything Model生成高质量深度图；提出解耦注意力模块（DAM）探索模态内和模态间一致性；开发双向信息表示模块（DIRM）扩展特征空间；设计双特征聚合模块（DFAM）在解码器中聚合特征。

Result: 在五个公开RGB-D数据集上表现优于现有CNN重型模型，参数仅5.2M，速度达415FPS。

Conclusion: SATNet成功平衡了效率和性能，为轻量化RGB-D显著性检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current RGB-D methods usually leverage large-scale backbones to improve
accuracy but sacrifice efficiency. Meanwhile, several existing lightweight
methods are difficult to achieve high-precision performance. To balance the
efficiency and performance, we propose a Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff Network
(SATNet) for Lightweight RGB-D SOD from three fundamental perspectives: depth
quality, modality fusion, and feature representation. Concerning depth quality,
we introduce the Depth Anything Model to generate high-quality depth maps,which
effectively alleviates the multi-modal gaps in the current datasets. For
modality fusion, we propose a Decoupled Attention Module (DAM) to explore the
consistency within and between modalities. Here, the multi-modal features are
decoupled into dual-view feature vectors to project discriminable information
of feature maps. For feature representation, we develop a Dual Information
Representation Module (DIRM) with a bi-directional inverted framework to
enlarge the limited feature space generated by the lightweight backbones. DIRM
models texture features and saliency features to enrich feature space, and
employ two-way prediction heads to optimal its parameters through a
bi-directional backpropagation. Finally, we design a Dual Feature Aggregation
Module (DFAM) in the decoder to aggregate texture and saliency features.
Extensive experiments on five public RGB-D SOD datasets indicate that the
proposed SATNet excels state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNN-based heavyweight models and
achieves a lightweight framework with 5.2 M parameters and 415 FPS.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models mark a transformative advancement in
artificial intelligence, aiming to unify perception, natural language
understanding, and embodied action within a single computational framework.
This foundational review presents a comprehensive synthesis of recent
advancements in Vision-Language-Action models, systematically organized across
five thematic pillars that structure the landscape of this rapidly evolving
field. We begin by establishing the conceptual foundations of VLA systems,
tracing their evolution from cross-modal learning architectures to generalist
agents that tightly integrate vision-language models (VLMs), action planners,
and hierarchical controllers. Our methodology adopts a rigorous literature
review framework, covering over 80 VLA models published in the past three
years. Key progress areas include architectural innovations,
parameter-efficient training strategies, and real-time inference accelerations.
We explore diverse application domains such as humanoid robotics, autonomous
vehicles, medical and industrial robotics, precision agriculture, and augmented
reality navigation. The review further addresses major challenges across
real-time control, multimodal action representation, system scalability,
generalization to unseen tasks, and ethical deployment risks. Drawing from the
state-of-the-art, we propose targeted solutions including agentic AI
adaptation, cross-embodiment generalization, and unified neuro-symbolic
planning. In our forward-looking discussion, we outline a future roadmap where
VLA models, VLMs, and agentic AI converge to power socially aligned, adaptive,
and general-purpose embodied agents. This work serves as a foundational
reference for advancing intelligent, real-world robotics and artificial general
intelligence. >Vision-language-action, Agentic AI, AI Agents, Vision-language

*Sriram Mandalika,Harsha Vardhan,Athira Nambiar*

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于不确定性驱动的无监督持续学习框架R2R，通过生成回放技术缓解神经网络中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统持续学习方法依赖预训练模型和伪标签的问题，提出无需预训练的框架。

Method: 使用聚类级不确定性驱动反馈机制和VLM生成回放模块，结合无标签和合成标签数据。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得显著性能提升，最高达98.13%，超越现有技术4.36%。

Conclusion: R2R框架在知识保留和性能上表现出色，为持续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual Learning entails progressively acquiring knowledge from new data
while retaining previously acquired knowledge, thereby mitigating
``Catastrophic Forgetting'' in neural networks. Our work presents a novel
uncertainty-driven Unsupervised Continual Learning framework using Generative
Replay, namely ``Replay to Remember (R2R)''. The proposed R2R architecture
efficiently uses unlabelled and synthetic labelled data in a balanced
proportion using a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a
VLM-powered generative replay module. Unlike traditional memory-buffer methods
that depend on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, our R2R framework operates
without any prior training. It leverages visual features from unlabeled data
and adapts continuously using clustering-based uncertainty estimation coupled
with dynamic thresholding. Concurrently, a generative replay mechanism along
with DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM produces labelled synthetic data
representative of past experiences, resembling biological visual thinking that
replays memory to remember and act in new, unseen tasks. Extensive experimental
analyses are carried out in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN and
TinyImageNet datasets. Our proposed R2R approach improves knowledge retention,
achieving a state-of-the-art performance of 98.13%, 73.06%, 93.41%, 95.18%,
59.74%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art performance by over 4.36%.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于凸松弛技术的新方法GlobustVP，用于在曼哈顿世界中联合估计消失点位置和线-消失点关联，平衡了效率、鲁棒性和全局最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解决曼哈顿世界中的消失点估计问题时，要么是次优解，要么追求全局最优但计算成本高。本文旨在通过凸松弛技术首次高效解决这一问题。

Method: 采用“软”关联方案（截断多选择误差），将问题转化为QCQP问题，再松弛为凸SDP问题，并提出GlobustVP迭代求解器，独立更新每个消失点及其关联线。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上的实验表明，GlobustVP在效率、鲁棒性和全局最优性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GlobustVP通过凸松弛技术实现了消失点估计的高效全局最优解，代码已开源。

Abstract: Determining the vanishing points (VPs) in a Manhattan world, as a fundamental
task in many 3D vision applications, consists of jointly inferring the line-VP
association and locating each VP. Existing methods are, however, either
sub-optimal solvers or pursuing global optimality at a significant cost of
computing time. In contrast to prior works, we introduce convex relaxation
techniques to solve this task for the first time. Specifically, we employ a
``soft'' association scheme, realized via a truncated multi-selection error,
that allows for joint estimation of VPs' locations and line-VP associations.
This approach leads to a primal problem that can be reformulated into a
quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is then
relaxed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve this SDP
problem efficiently, we present a globally optimal outlier-robust iterative
solver (called \textbf{GlobustVP}), which independently searches for one VP and
its associated lines in each iteration, treating other lines as outliers. After
each independent update of all VPs, the mutual orthogonality between the three
VPs in a Manhattan world is reinforced via local refinement. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that
\textbf{GlobustVP} achieves a favorable balance between efficiency, robustness,
and global optimality compared to previous works. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/WU-CVGL/GlobustVP.

TLDR: DetReIDX是一个大规模空中-地面行人数据集，旨在测试真实世界条件下行人重识别（ReID）的性能，包含多会话数据、多种变化因素，并展示了现有方法在这些条件下的性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行人重识别技术在真实世界复杂条件下表现不佳，且公开数据集未能充分模拟这些条件，限制了技术进步。

Method: 提出DetReIDX数据集，包含多会话、多变化因素的数据，并标注了多种任务标签和软生物特征属性。

Result: 现有SOTA方法在DetReIDX条件下性能显著下降（检测准确率下降80%，Rank-1 ReID下降70%）。

Conclusion: DetReIDX为真实世界行人重识别研究提供了重要基准，数据集和评估协议已公开。

Abstract: Person reidentification (ReID) technology has been considered to perform
relatively well under controlled, ground-level conditions, but it breaks down
when deployed in challenging real-world settings. Evidently, this is due to
extreme data variability factors such as resolution, viewpoint changes, scale
variations, occlusions, and appearance shifts from clothing or session drifts.
Moreover, the publicly available data sets do not realistically incorporate
such kinds and magnitudes of variability, which limits the progress of this
technology. This paper introduces DetReIDX, a large-scale aerial-ground person
dataset, that was explicitly designed as a stress test to ReID under real-world
conditions. DetReIDX is a multi-session set that includes over 13 million
bounding boxes from 509 identities, collected in seven university campuses from
three continents, with drone altitudes between 5.8 and 120 meters. More
important, as a key novelty, DetReIDX subjects were recorded in (at least) two
sessions on different days, with changes in clothing, daylight and location,
making it suitable to actually evaluate long-term person ReID. Plus, data were
annotated from 16 soft biometric attributes and multitask labels for detection,
tracking, ReID, and action recognition. In order to provide empirical evidence
of DetReIDX usefulness, we considered the specific tasks of human detection and
ReID, where SOTA methods catastrophically degrade performance (up to 80% in
detection accuracy and over 70% in Rank-1 ReID) when exposed to DetReIDXs
conditions. The dataset, annotations, and official evaluation protocols are
publicly available at https://www.it.ubi.pt/DetReIDX/

Result: 结果显示平均性能存在强相关性，支持合成损坏用于鲁棒性评估，并分析了特定损坏类型的相关性。

Conclusion: 合成损坏在评估模型鲁棒性时是可靠的，研究为理解其适用场景提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models are widely used in real-world applications but
remain vulnerable to distribution shifts, especially due to weather and
lighting changes. Collecting diverse real-world data for testing the robustness
of DL models is resource-intensive, making synthetic corruptions an attractive
alternative for robustness testing. However, are synthetic corruptions a
reliable proxy for real-world corruptions? To answer this, we conduct the
largest benchmarking study on semantic segmentation models, comparing
performance on real-world corruptions and synthetic corruptions datasets. Our
results reveal a strong correlation in mean performance, supporting the use of
synthetic corruptions for robustness evaluation. We further analyze
corruption-specific correlations, providing key insights to understand when
synthetic corruptions succeed in representing real-world corruptions.

Conclusion: ORXE可扩展至其他应用，为多样化部署提供可扩展方案。

Abstract: This paper presents ORXE, a modular and adaptable framework for achieving
real-time configurable efficiency in AI models. By leveraging a collection of
pre-trained experts with diverse computational costs and performance levels,
ORXE dynamically adjusts inference pathways based on the complexity of input
samples. Unlike conventional approaches that require complex metamodel
training, ORXE achieves high efficiency and flexibility without complicating
the development process. The proposed system utilizes a confidence-based gating
mechanism to allocate appropriate computational resources for each input. ORXE
also supports adjustments to the preference between inference cost and
prediction performance across a wide range during runtime. We implemented a
training-free ORXE system for image classification tasks, evaluating its
efficiency and accuracy across various devices. The results demonstrate that
ORXE achieves superior performance compared to individual experts and other
dynamic models in most cases. This approach can be extended to other
applications, providing a scalable solution for diverse real-world deployment
scenarios.

TLDR: Mix-QSAM是一种混合精度的后训练量化框架，通过层间协同和重要性评分优化SAM模型的量化效果，显著提升精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型的高计算和内存需求限制了其在资源受限设备上的部署，现有固定位宽量化方法效果不佳。

Method: 引入层间重要性评分和跨层协同度量，通过整数二次规划优化位宽分配。

Result: 在6位和4位混合精度设置下，Mix-QSAM比现有方法平均精度提升20%，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: Mix-QSAM为资源受限设备上的SAM模型部署提供了高效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a popular vision foundation model;
however, its high computational and memory demands make deployment on
resource-constrained devices challenging. While Post-Training Quantization
(PTQ) is a practical approach for reducing computational overhead, existing PTQ
methods rely on fixed bit-width quantization, leading to suboptimal accuracy
and efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose Mix-QSAM, a
mixed-precision PTQ framework for SAM. First, we introduce a layer-wise
importance score, derived using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, to quantify
each layer's contribution to the model's output. Second, we introduce
cross-layer synergy, a novel metric based on causal mutual information, to
capture dependencies between adjacent layers. This ensures that highly
interdependent layers maintain similar bit-widths, preventing abrupt precision
mismatches that degrade feature propagation and numerical stability. Using
these metrics, we formulate an Integer Quadratic Programming (IQP) problem to
determine optimal bit-width allocation under model size and bit-operation
constraints, assigning higher precision to critical layers while minimizing
bit-width in less influential layers. Experimental results demonstrate that
Mix-QSAM consistently outperforms existing PTQ methods on instance segmentation
and object detection tasks, achieving up to 20% higher average precision under
6-bit and 4-bit mixed-precision settings, while maintaining computational
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像对齐方法在特征稀疏区域、极端尺度和视场差异以及大变形情况下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的方法。

Method: ART方法通过自回归框架和多尺度特征迭代优化变换场，利用交叉注意力层聚焦关键区域。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验表明，ART显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ART是一种强大且广泛适用的精确图像对齐新方法。

Abstract: Existing methods for image alignment struggle in cases involving
feature-sparse regions, extreme scale and field-of-view differences, and large
deformations, often resulting in suboptimal accuracy. Robustness to these
challenges improves through iterative refinement of the transformation field
while focusing on critical regions in multi-scale image representations. We
thus propose Auto-Regressive Transformation (ART), a novel method that
iteratively estimates the coarse-to-fine transformations within an
auto-regressive framework. Leveraging hierarchical multi-scale features, our
network refines the transformations using randomly sampled points at each
scale. By incorporating guidance from the cross-attention layer, the model
focuses on critical regions, ensuring accurate alignment even in challenging,
feature-limited conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
demonstrate that ART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
establishing it as a powerful new method for precise image alignment with broad
applicability.

<details>

Motivation: 现有MPQ方法需要在大规模数据集上进行昂贵的搜索，计算成本高。

Method: 在小数据集上搜索量化策略，结合锐度感知最小化、隐式梯度方向对齐和自适应扰动半径技术。

Result: 在CIFAR10上搜索策略后，在ImageNet上实现相同精度，计算成本显著降低，效率提升150%。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了量化过程，无需大规模微调，仅需调整模型权重。

Abstract: Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) has become an essential technique for
optimizing neural network by determining the optimal bitwidth per layer.
Existing MPQ methods, however, face a major hurdle: they require a
computationally expensive search for quantization policies on large-scale
datasets. To resolve this issue, we introduce a novel approach that first
searches for quantization policies on small datasets and then generalizes them
to large-scale datasets. This approach simplifies the process, eliminating the
need for large-scale quantization fine-tuning and only necessitating model
weight adjustment. Our method is characterized by three key techniques:
sharpness-aware minimization for enhanced quantization generalization, implicit
gradient direction alignment to handle gradient conflicts among different
optimization objectives, and an adaptive perturbation radius to accelerate
optimization. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate our
approach. Using the CIFAR10 dataset (just 0.5\% the size of ImageNet training
data) for MPQ policy search, we achieved equivalent accuracy on ImageNet with a
significantly lower computational cost, while improving efficiency by up to
150% over the baselines.

Motivation: 深度伪造技术快速发展，现有检测器因依赖特定伪造痕迹而难以应对新型伪造类型，导致社会对多媒体内容的信任危机。

Result: 在FaceForensics++、Celeb-DF和DFDC数据集上，新方法在跨数据集评估中分别比现有最优方法提升5%和7%。

Conclusion: 新策略通过特征解缠和多信息整合，显著提升了深度伪造检测的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Remarkable advancements in generative AI technology have given rise to a
spectrum of novel deepfake categories with unprecedented leaps in their
realism, and deepfakes are increasingly becoming a nuisance to law enforcement
authorities and the general public. In particular, we observe alarming levels
of confusion, deception, and loss of faith regarding multimedia content within
society caused by face deepfakes, and existing deepfake detectors are
struggling to keep up with the pace of improvements in deepfake generation.
This is primarily due to their reliance on specific forgery artifacts, which
limits their ability to generalise and detect novel deepfake types. To combat
the spread of malicious face deepfakes, this paper proposes a new strategy that
leverages coarse-to-fine spatial information, semantic information, and their
interactions while ensuring feature distinctiveness and reducing the redundancy
of the modelled features. A novel feature orthogonality-based disentanglement
strategy is introduced to ensure branch-level and cross-branch feature
disentanglement, which allows us to integrate multiple feature vectors without
adding complexity to the feature space or compromising generalisation.
Comprehensive experiments on three public benchmarks: FaceForensics++,
Celeb-DF, and the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) show that these design
choices enable the proposed approach to outperform current state-of-the-art
methods by 5% on the Celeb-DF dataset and 7% on the DFDC dataset in a
cross-dataset evaluation setting.

Motivation: 传统表示学习方法依赖整体、黑盒嵌入，导致语义组件纠缠，限制了可解释性和泛化能力，尤其在医学影像中问题突出。

Conclusion: OWT作为一种语义解缠表示学习的基础框架，具有广泛的可扩展性和适用性，适用于医学影像及其他领域。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning often rely on holistic, black-box
embeddings that entangle multiple semantic components, limiting
interpretability and generalization. These issues are especially critical in
medical imaging. To address these limitations, we propose an Organ-Wise
Tokenization (OWT) framework with a Token Group-based Reconstruction (TGR)
training paradigm. Unlike conventional approaches that produce holistic
features, OWT explicitly disentangles an image into separable token groups,
each corresponding to a distinct organ or semantic entity. Our design ensures
each token group encapsulates organ-specific information, boosting
interpretability, generalization, and efficiency while allowing fine-grained
control in downstream tasks. Experiments on CT and MRI datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of OWT in not only achieving strong image reconstruction and
segmentation performance, but also enabling novel semantic-level generation and
retrieval applications that are out of reach for standard holistic embedding
methods. These findings underscore the potential of OWT as a foundational
framework for semantically disentangled representation learning, offering broad
scalability and applicability to real-world medical imaging scenarios and
beyond.

Motivation: 当前WSOL方法（如CAM和自注意力图）无法学习像素级细粒度信息，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出Pro2SAM网络，包括GTFormer生成粗粒度前景图作为掩码提示，网格点密集提示SAM，以及像素级相似度度量匹配掩码。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011和ILSVRC上分别达到84.03%和66.85%的Top-1定位准确率。

Conclusion: Pro2SAM通过结合SAM和创新的提示方法，显著提升了WSOL任务的性能。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL), which aims to localize objects
by only using image-level labels, has attracted much attention because of its
low annotation cost in real applications. Current studies focus on the Class
Activation Map (CAM) of CNN and the self-attention map of transformer to
identify the region of objects. However, both CAM and self-attention maps can
not learn pixel-level fine-grained information on the foreground objects, which
hinders the further advance of WSOL. To address this problem, we initiatively
leverage the capability of zero-shot generalization and fine-grained
segmentation in Segment Anything Model (SAM) to boost the activation of
integral object regions. Further, to alleviate the semantic ambiguity issue
accrued in single point prompt-based SAM, we propose an innovative mask prompt
to SAM (Pro2SAM) network with grid points for WSOL task. First, we devise a
Global Token Transformer (GTFormer) to generate a coarse-grained foreground map
as a flexible mask prompt, where the GTFormer jointly embeds patch tokens and
novel global tokens to learn foreground semantics. Secondly, we deliver grid
points as dense prompts into SAM to maximize the probability of foreground
mask, which avoids the lack of objects caused by a single point/box prompt.
Finally, we propose a pixel-level similarity metric to come true the mask
matching from mask prompt to SAM, where the mask with the highest score is
viewed as the final localization map. Experiments show that the proposed
Pro2SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC,
with 84.03\% and 66.85\% Top-1 Loc, respectively.

Conclusion: SpatialPrompting提供了一种更简单、更灵活的空间推理范式，为传统方法提供了可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: This study introduces SpatialPrompting, a novel framework that harnesses the
emergent reasoning capabilities of off-the-shelf multimodal large language
models to achieve zero-shot spatial reasoning in three-dimensional (3D)
environments. Unlike existing methods that rely on expensive 3D-specific
fine-tuning with specialized 3D inputs such as point clouds or voxel-based
features, SpatialPrompting employs a keyframe-driven prompt generation
strategy. This framework uses metrics such as vision-language similarity,
Mahalanobis distance, field of view, and image sharpness to select a diverse
and informative set of keyframes from image sequences and then integrates them
with corresponding camera pose data to effectively abstract spatial
relationships and infer complex 3D structures. The proposed framework not only
establishes a new paradigm for flexible spatial reasoning that utilizes
intuitive visual and positional cues but also achieves state-of-the-art
zero-shot performance on benchmark datasets, such as ScanQA and SQA3D, across
several metrics. The proposed method effectively eliminates the need for
specialized 3D inputs and fine-tuning, offering a simpler and more scalable
alternative to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: GlyphMastero通过精细的字形引导，显著提升了场景文本编辑的性能。

Abstract: Scene text editing, a subfield of image editing, requires modifying texts in
images while preserving style consistency and visual coherence with the
surrounding environment. While diffusion-based methods have shown promise in
text generation, they still struggle to produce high-quality results. These
methods often generate distorted or unrecognizable characters, particularly
when dealing with complex characters like Chinese. In such systems, characters
are composed of intricate stroke patterns and spatial relationships that must
be precisely maintained. We present GlyphMastero, a specialized glyph encoder
designed to guide the latent diffusion model for generating texts with
stroke-level precision. Our key insight is that existing methods, despite using
pretrained OCR models for feature extraction, fail to capture the hierarchical
nature of text structures - from individual strokes to stroke-level
interactions to overall character-level structure. To address this, our glyph
encoder explicitly models and captures the cross-level interactions between
local-level individual characters and global-level text lines through our novel
glyph attention module. Meanwhile, our model implements a feature pyramid
network to fuse the multi-scale OCR backbone features at the global-level.
Through these cross-level and multi-scale fusions, we obtain more detailed
glyph-aware guidance, enabling precise control over the scene text generation
process. Our method achieves an 18.02\% improvement in sentence accuracy over
the state-of-the-art multi-lingual scene text editing baseline, while
simultaneously reducing the text-region Fr\'echet inception distance by
53.28\%.

Abstract: Infrared object tracking plays a crucial role in Anti-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(Anti-UAV) applications. Existing trackers often depend on cropped template
regions and have limited motion modeling capabilities, which pose challenges
when dealing with tiny targets. To address this, we propose a simple yet
effective infrared tiny-object tracker that enhances tracking performance by
integrating global detection and motion-aware learning with temporal priors.
Our method is based on object detection and achieves significant improvements
through two key innovations. First, we introduce frame dynamics, leveraging
frame difference and optical flow to encode both prior target features and
motion characteristics at the input level, enabling the model to better
distinguish the target from background clutter. Second, we propose a trajectory
constraint filtering strategy in the post-processing stage, utilizing
spatio-temporal priors to suppress false positives and enhance tracking
robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms
existing approaches across multiple metrics in challenging infrared UAV
tracking scenarios. Notably, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in the 4th
Anti-UAV Challenge, securing 1st place in Track 1 and 2nd place in Track 2.

Abstract: Reasoning lies at the heart of intelligence, shaping the ability to make
decisions, draw conclusions, and generalize across domains. In artificial
intelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and
multimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and
adaptive behavior. Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a
promising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and
video to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve
comprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As
research advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular,
perception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer
more coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and
reinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges
remain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To
address these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of
multimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental
roadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging
capabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules,
where reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation,
alignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning
into multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)
and multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured
reasoning chains. Finally, drawing on empirical insights from challenging
benchmarks and experimental cases of OpenAI O3 and O4-mini, we discuss the
conceptual direction of native large multimodal reasoning models (N-LMRMs),
which aim to support scalable, agentic, and adaptive reasoning and planning in
complex, real-world environments.

Abstract: Palmprint recognition is a secure and privacy-friendly method of biometric
identification. One of the major challenges to improve palmprint recognition
accuracy is the scarcity of palmprint data. Recently, a popular line of
research revolves around the synthesis of virtual palmprints for large-scale
pre-training purposes. In this paper, we propose a novel synthesis method named
Canny2Palm that extracts palm textures with Canny edge detector and uses them
to condition a Pix2Pix network for realistic palmprint generation. By
re-assembling palmprint textures from different identities, we are able to
create new identities by seeding the generator with new assemblies. Canny2Palm
not only synthesizes realistic data following the distribution of real
palmprints but also enables controllable diversity to generate large-scale new
identities. On open-set palmprint recognition benchmarks, models pre-trained
with Canny2Palm synthetic data outperform the state-of-the-art with up to 7.2%
higher identification accuracy. Moreover, the performance of models pre-trained
with Canny2Palm continues to improve given 10,000 synthetic IDs while those
with existing methods already saturate, demonstrating the potential of our
method for large-scale pre-training.

Conclusion: FF-PNet无需注意力机制或多层感知器，仅通过传统卷积神经网络即可实现高精度配准，证明了RFFM和RDFFM的优越性。

Abstract: In recent years, deformable medical image registration techniques have made
significant progress. However, existing models still lack efficiency in
parallel extraction of coarse and fine-grained features. To address this, we
construct a new pyramid registration network based on feature and deformation
field (FF-PNet). For coarse-grained feature extraction, we design a Residual
Feature Fusion Module (RFFM), for fine-grained image deformation, we propose a
Residual Deformation Field Fusion Module (RDFFM). Through the parallel
operation of these two modules, the model can effectively handle complex image
deformations. It is worth emphasizing that the encoding stage of FF-PNet only
employs traditional convolutional neural networks without any attention
mechanisms or multilayer perceptrons, yet it still achieves remarkable
improvements in registration accuracy, fully demonstrating the superior feature
decoding capabilities of RFFM and RDFFM. We conducted extensive experiments on
the LPBA and OASIS datasets. The results show our network consistently
outperforms popular methods in metrics like the Dice Similarity Coefficient.

Abstract: Accurate building damage assessment using bi-temporal multi-modal remote
sensing images is essential for effective disaster response and recovery
planning. This study proposes a novel Building-Guided Pseudo-Label Learning
Framework to address the challenges of mapping building damage from
pre-disaster optical and post-disaster SAR images. First, we train a series of
building extraction models using pre-disaster optical images and building
labels. To enhance building segmentation, we employ multi-model fusion and
test-time augmentation strategies to generate pseudo-probabilities, followed by
a low-uncertainty pseudo-label training method for further refinement. Next, a
change detection model is trained on bi-temporal cross-modal images and damaged
building labels. To improve damage classification accuracy, we introduce a
building-guided low-uncertainty pseudo-label refinement strategy, which
leverages building priors from the previous step to guide pseudo-label
generation for damaged buildings, reducing uncertainty and enhancing
reliability. Experimental results on the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieved the
highest mIoU score (54.28%) and secured first place in the competition.

Abstract: Thanks to recent advancements in scalable deep architectures and large-scale

in producing high-fidelity, instruction-following content across a wide range

However, these models' ability to render precise on-screen text, such as

challenges for applications requiring exact textual accuracy. In this work, we
introduce T2VTextBench, the first human-evaluation benchmark dedicated to
evaluating on-screen text fidelity and temporal consistency in text-to-video
models. Our suite of prompts integrates complex text strings with dynamic scene
changes, testing each model's ability to maintain detailed instructions across

solutions to commercial offerings, and find that most struggle to generate
legible, consistent text. These results highlight a critical gap in current
video generators and provide a clear direction for future research aimed at
enhancing textual manipulation in video synthesis.

Abstract: The proposed system outlined in this paper is a solution to a use case that
requires the autonomous picking of cuboidal objects from an organized or
unorganized pile with high precision. This paper presents an efficient method
for precise pose estimation of cuboid-shaped objects, which aims to reduce
errors in target pose in a time-efficient manner. Typical pose estimation
methods like global point cloud registrations are prone to minor pose errors
for which local registration algorithms are generally used to improve pose
accuracy. However, due to the execution time overhead and uncertainty in the
error of the final achieved pose, an alternate, linear time approach is
proposed for pose error estimation and correction. This paper presents an
overview of the solution followed by a detailed description of individual
modules of the proposed algorithm.

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，MFID为17.01，提升分割性能3.8%，生成图像临床不可区分。

Conclusion: ViCTr首次实现细粒度病理感知MRI合成，填补AI医学影像研究空白。

Abstract: Synthesizing medical images remains challenging due to limited annotated
pathological data, modality domain gaps, and the complexity of representing
diffuse pathologies such as liver cirrhosis. Existing methods often struggle to
maintain anatomical fidelity while accurately modeling pathological features,
frequently relying on priors derived from natural images or inefficient
multi-step sampling. In this work, we introduce ViCTr (Vital Consistency
Transfer), a novel two-stage framework that combines a rectified flow
trajectory with a Tweedie-corrected diffusion process to achieve high-fidelity,
pathology-aware image synthesis. First, we pretrain ViCTr on the ATLAS-8k
dataset using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to preserve critical
anatomical structures. We then fine-tune the model adversarially with Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) modules for precise control over pathology severity. By
reformulating Tweedie's formula within a linear trajectory framework, ViCTr
supports one-step sampling, reducing inference from 50 steps to just 4, without
sacrificing anatomical realism. We evaluate ViCTr on BTCV (CT), AMOS (MRI), and
CirrMRI600+ (cirrhosis) datasets. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, achieving a Medical Frechet Inception Distance (MFID) of 17.01 for
cirrhosis synthesis 28% lower than existing approaches and improving nnUNet
segmentation by +3.8% mDSC when used for data augmentation. Radiologist reviews
indicate that ViCTr-generated liver cirrhosis MRIs are clinically
indistinguishable from real scans. To our knowledge, ViCTr is the first method
to provide fine-grained, pathology-aware MRI synthesis with graded severity
control, closing a critical gap in AI-driven medical imaging research.

Abstract: Coronary angiography (CAG) is the gold-standard imaging modality for
evaluating coronary artery disease, but its interpretation and subsequent
treatment planning rely heavily on expert cardiologists. To enable AI-based
decision support, we introduce a two-stage, physician-curated pipeline and a
bilingual (Japanese/English) CAG image-report dataset. First, we sample 14,686
frames from 539 exams and annotate them for key-frame detection and left/right
laterality; a ConvNeXt-Base CNN trained on this data achieves 0.96 F1 on
laterality classification, even on low-contrast frames. Second, we apply the
CNN to 243 independent exams, extract 1,114 key frames, and pair each with its
pre-procedure report and expert-validated diagnostic and treatment summary,
yielding a parallel corpus. We then fine-tune three open-source VLMs
(PaliGemma2, Gemma3, and ConceptCLIP-enhanced Gemma3) via LoRA and evaluate
them using VLScore and cardiologist review. Although PaliGemma2 w/LoRA attains
the highest VLScore, Gemma3 w/LoRA achieves the top clinician rating (mean
7.20/10); we designate this best-performing model as CAG-VLM. These results
demonstrate that specialized, fine-tuned VLMs can effectively assist
cardiologists in generating clinical reports and treatment recommendations from
CAG images.

Abstract: Enabling intelligent agents to comprehend and interact with 3D environments
through natural language is crucial for advancing robotics and human-computer
interaction. A fundamental task in this field is ego-centric 3D visual
grounding, where agents locate target objects in real-world 3D spaces based on
verbal descriptions. However, this task faces two significant challenges: (1)
loss of fine-grained visual semantics due to sparse fusion of point clouds with
ego-centric multi-view images, (2) limited textual semantic context due to
arbitrary language descriptions. We propose DenseGrounding, a novel approach
designed to address these issues by enhancing both visual and textual
semantics. For visual features, we introduce the Hierarchical Scene Semantic
Enhancer, which retains dense semantics by capturing fine-grained global scene
features and facilitating cross-modal alignment. For text descriptions, we
propose a Language Semantic Enhancer that leverages large language models to
provide rich context and diverse language descriptions with additional context
during model training. Extensive experiments show that DenseGrounding
significantly outperforms existing methods in overall accuracy, with
improvements of 5.81% and 7.56% when trained on the comprehensive full dataset
and smaller mini subset, respectively, further advancing the SOTA in egocentric
3D visual grounding. Our method also achieves 1st place and receives the

Conclusion: BiHumanML3D和BiMD结合ReAlign方法有效解决了双语文本到动作生成的挑战。

Abstract: Bilingual text-to-motion generation, which synthesizes 3D human motions from
bilingual text inputs, holds immense potential for cross-linguistic
applications in gaming, film, and robotics. However, this task faces critical
challenges: the absence of bilingual motion-language datasets and the
misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models, leading
to semantically inconsistent or low-quality motions. To address these
challenges, we propose BiHumanML3D, a novel bilingual human motion dataset,
which establishes a crucial benchmark for bilingual text-to-motion generation
models. Furthermore, we propose a Bilingual Motion Diffusion model (BiMD),
which leverages cross-lingual aligned representations to capture semantics,
thereby achieving a unified bilingual model. Building upon this, we propose
Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign) method, comprising a step-aware
reward model to assess alignment quality during sampling and a reward-guided
strategy that directs the diffusion process toward an optimally aligned
distribution. This reward model integrates step-aware tokens and combines a
text-aligned module for semantic consistency and a motion-aligned module for
realism, refining noisy motions at each timestep to balance probability density
and alignment. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves
text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods. Project page: https://wengwanjiang.github.io/ReAlign-page/.

Result: 在2个基准数据集上，FedDDL平均Top-1准确率比现有方法高4.5%。

Conclusion: FedDDL有效提升模型对主对象的关注能力，解决了属性偏差问题。

Abstract: Attribute bias in federated learning (FL) typically leads local models to
optimize inconsistently due to the learning of non-causal associations,
resulting degraded performance. Existing methods either use data augmentation
for increasing sample diversity or knowledge distillation for learning
invariant representations to address this problem. However, they lack a
comprehensive analysis of the inference paths, and the interference from
confounding factors limits their performance. To address these limitations, we
propose the \underline{Fed}erated \underline{D}econfounding and
\underline{D}ebiasing \underline{L}earning (FedDDL) method. It constructs a
structured causal graph to analyze the model inference process, and performs
backdoor adjustment to eliminate confounding paths. Specifically, we design an
intra-client deconfounding learning module for computer vision tasks to
decouple background and objects, generating counterfactual samples that
establish a connection between the background and any label, which stops the
model from using the background to infer the label. Moreover, we design an
inter-client debiasing learning module to construct causal prototypes to reduce
the proportion of the background in prototype components. Notably, it bridges
the gap between heterogeneous representations via causal prototypical
regularization. Extensive experiments on 2 benchmarking datasets demonstrate
that \methodname{} significantly enhances the model capability to focus on main
objects in unseen data, leading to 4.5\% higher Top-1 Accuracy on average over
9 state-of-the-art existing methods.

Abstract: We retarget video stitching to an emerging issue, named warping shake, which
unveils the temporal content shakes induced by sequentially unsmooth warps when
extending image stitching to video stitching. Even if the input videos are
stable, the stitched video can inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and
affect the visual experience. To address this issue, we propose StabStitch++, a
novel video stitching framework to realize spatial stitching and temporal
stabilization with unsupervised learning simultaneously. First, different from
existing learning-based image stitching solutions that typically warp one image
to align with another, we suppose a virtual midplane between original image
planes and project them onto it. Concretely, we design a differentiable
bidirectional decomposition module to disentangle the homography transformation
and incorporate it into our spatial warp, evenly spreading alignment burdens
and projective distortions across two views. Then, inspired by camera paths in
video stabilization, we derive the mathematical expression of stitching
trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal
warps. Finally, a warp smoothing model is presented to produce stable stitched
videos with a hybrid loss to simultaneously encourage content alignment,
trajectory smoothness, and online collaboration. Compared with StabStitch that
sacrifices alignment for stabilization, StabStitch++ makes no compromise and
optimizes both of them simultaneously, especially in the online mode. To
establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a
video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes.
Experiments exhibit that StabStitch++ surpasses current solutions in stitching
performance, robustness, and efficiency, offering compelling advancements in
this field by building a real-time online video stitching system.

Abstract: Thoracolumbar stump ribs are one of the essential indicators of thoracolumbar
transitional vertebrae or enumeration anomalies. While some studies manually
assess these anomalies and describe the ribs qualitatively, this study aims to
automate thoracolumbar stump rib detection and analyze their morphology
quantitatively. To this end, we train a high-resolution deep-learning model for
rib segmentation and show significant improvements compared to existing models
(Dice score 0.997 vs. 0.779, p-value < 0.01). In addition, we use an iterative
algorithm and piece-wise linear interpolation to assess the length of the ribs,
showing a success rate of 98.2%. When analyzing morphological features, we show
that stump ribs articulate more posteriorly at the vertebrae (-19.2 +- 3.8 vs
-13.8 +- 2.5, p-value < 0.01), are thinner (260.6 +- 103.4 vs. 563.6 +- 127.1,
p-value < 0.01), and are oriented more downwards and sideways within the first
centimeters in contrast to full-length ribs. We show that with partially
visible ribs, these features can achieve an F1-score of 0.84 in differentiating
stump ribs from regular ones. We publish the model weights and masks for public
use.

Abstract: Accurate online map matching is fundamental to vehicle navigation and the
activation of intelligent driving functions. Current online map matching
methods are prone to errors in complex road networks, especially in multilevel
road area. To address this challenge, we propose an online Standard Definition
(SD) map matching method by constructing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with
multiple probability factors. Our proposed method can achieve accurate map
matching even in complex road networks by carefully leveraging lane markings
and scenario recognition in the designing of the probability factors. First,
the lane markings are generated by a multi-lane tracking method and associated
with the SD map using HMM to build an enriched SD map. In areas covered by the
enriched SD map, the vehicle can re-localize itself by performing Iterative
Closest Point (ICP) registration for the lane markings. Then, the probability
factor accounting for the lane marking detection can be obtained using the
association probability between adjacent lanes and roads. Second, the driving
scenario recognition model is applied to generate the emission probability
factor of scenario recognition, which improves the performance of map matching
on elevated roads and ordinary urban roads underneath them. We validate our
method through extensive road tests in Europe and China, and the experimental
results show that our proposed method effectively improves the online map
matching accuracy as compared to other existing methods, especially in
multilevel road area. Specifically, the experiments show that our proposed
method achieves $F_1$ scores of 98.04% and 94.60% on the Zenseact Open Dataset
and test data of multilevel road areas in Shanghai respectively, significantly
outperforming benchmark methods. The implementation is available at

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂工业场景中表现出色，有效解决了钻孔检测的挑战。

Abstract: In controlled blasting operations, accurately detecting densely distributed
tiny boreholes from far-view imagery is critical for operational safety and
efficiency. However, existing detection methods often struggle due to small
object scales, highly dense arrangements, and limited distinctive visual
features of boreholes. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive
detection approach that builds upon existing architectures (e.g., YOLO) by
explicitly leveraging consistent embedding representations derived through
exponential moving average (EMA)-based statistical updates.
  Our method introduces three synergistic components: (1) adaptive augmentation
utilizing dynamically updated image statistics to robustly handle illumination
and texture variations; (2) embedding stabilization to ensure consistent and
reliable feature extraction; and (3) contextual refinement leveraging spatial
context for improved detection accuracy. The pervasive use of EMA in our method
is particularly advantageous given the limited visual complexity and small
scale of boreholes, allowing stable and robust representation learning even
under challenging visual conditions. Experiments on a challenging proprietary
quarry-site dataset demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline
YOLO-based architectures, highlighting our method's effectiveness in realistic
and complex industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Creating animatable 3D avatars from a single image remains challenging due to
style limitations (realistic, cartoon, anime) and difficulties in handling
accessories or hairstyles. While 3D diffusion models advance single-view
reconstruction for general objects, outputs often lack animation controls or
suffer from artifacts because of the domain gap. We propose SOAP, a
style-omniscient framework to generate rigged, topology-consistent avatars from
any portrait. Our method leverages a multiview diffusion model trained on 24K
3D heads with multiple styles and an adaptive optimization pipeline to deform
the FLAME mesh while maintaining topology and rigging via differentiable
rendering. The resulting textured avatars support FACS-based animation,
integrate with eyeballs and teeth, and preserve details like braided hair or
accessories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method
over state-of-the-art techniques for both single-view head modeling and
diffusion-based generation of Image-to-3D. Our code and data are publicly

Conclusion: SM是首个在归纳式零样本语义分割中引入解耦匈牙利匹配的方法，显著提升了未见类别的分割效果。

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment categories that are not
annotated during training. While fine-tuning vision-language models has
achieved promising results, these models often overfit to seen categories due
to the lack of supervision for unseen classes. As an alternative to fully
supervised approaches, query-based segmentation has shown great latent in ZSS,
as it enables object localization without relying on explicit labels. However,
conventional Hungarian matching, a core component in query-based frameworks,
needs full supervision and often misclassifies unseen categories as background
in the setting of ZSS. To address this issue, we propose Split Matching (SM), a
novel assignment strategy that decouples Hungarian matching into two
components: one for seen classes in annotated regions and another for latent
classes in unannotated regions (referred to as unseen candidates).
Specifically, we partition the queries into seen and candidate groups, enabling
each to be optimized independently according to its available supervision. To
discover unseen candidates, we cluster CLIP dense features to generate pseudo
masks and extract region-level embeddings using CLS tokens. Matching is then
conducted separately for the two groups based on both class-level similarity
and mask-level consistency. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Feature
Enhancement (MFE) module that refines decoder features through residual
multi-scale aggregation, improving the model's ability to capture spatial
details across resolutions. SM is the first to introduce decoupled Hungarian
matching under the inductive ZSS setting, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Recognising expressive behaviours in face videos is a long-standing challenge
in Affective Computing. Despite significant advancements in recent years, it
still remains a challenge to build a robust and reliable system for
naturalistic and in-the-wild facial expressive behaviour analysis in real time.
This paper addresses two key challenges in building such a system: (1). The
paucity of large-scale labelled facial affect video datasets with extensive
coverage of the 2D emotion space, and (2). The difficulty of extracting facial
video features that are discriminative, interpretable, robust, and
computationally efficient. Toward addressing these challenges, we introduce
xTrace, a robust tool for facial expressive behaviour analysis and predicting
continuous values of dimensional emotions, namely valence and arousal, from
in-the-wild face videos.
  To address challenge (1), our affect recognition model is trained on the
largest facial affect video data set, containing ~450k videos that cover most
emotion zones in the dimensional emotion space, making xTrace highly versatile
in analysing a wide spectrum of naturalistic expressive behaviours. To address
challenge (2), xTrace uses facial affect descriptors that are not only
explainable, but can also achieve a high degree of accuracy and robustness with
low computational complexity. The key components of xTrace are benchmarked
against three existing tools: MediaPipe, OpenFace, and Augsburg Affect Toolbox.
On an in-the-wild validation set composed of 50k videos, xTrace achieves 0.86
mean CCC and 0.13 mean absolute error values. We present a detailed error
analysis of affect predictions from xTrace, illustrating (a). its ability to
recognise emotions with high accuracy across most bins in the 2D emotion space,
(b). its robustness to non-frontal head pose angles, and (c). a strong
correlation between its uncertainty estimates and its accuracy.

Conclusion: USAM为不确定性量化提供高效解决方案，支持用户提示、半监督流程，并平衡精度与成本。

Abstract: The introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has paved the way for
numerous semantic segmentation applications. For several tasks, quantifying the
uncertainty of SAM is of particular interest. However, the ambiguous nature of
the class-agnostic foundation model SAM challenges current uncertainty
quantification (UQ) approaches. This paper presents a theoretically motivated
uncertainty quantification model based on a Bayesian entropy formulation
jointly respecting aleatoric, epistemic, and the newly introduced task
uncertainty. We use this formulation to train USAM, a lightweight post-hoc UQ
method. Our model traces the root of uncertainty back to under-parameterised
models, insufficient prompts or image ambiguities. Our proposed deterministic
USAM demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on the SA-V, MOSE, ADE20k,
DAVIS, and COCO datasets, offering a computationally cheap and easy-to-use UQ
alternative that can support user-prompting, enhance semi-supervised pipelines,
or balance the tradeoff between accuracy and cost efficiency.

Result: FFT性能下降，LP和LFT对尾部类别效果有限；ULFine显著降低训练成本并提升准确性。

Conclusion: ULFine通过解决过拟合和偏差问题，显著提升了LTSSL的性能和效率。

Abstract: Based on the success of large-scale visual foundation models like CLIP in
various downstream tasks, this paper initially attempts to explore their impact
on Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) by employing the foundation
model with three strategies: Linear Probing (LP), Lightweight Fine-Tuning
(LFT), and Full Fine-Tuning (FFT). Our analysis presents the following
insights: i) Compared to LTSSL algorithms trained from scratch, FFT results in
a decline in model performance, whereas LP and LFT, although boosting overall
model performance, exhibit negligible benefits to tail classes. ii) LP produces
numerous false pseudo-labels due to \textit{underlearned} training data, while
LFT can reduce the number of these false labels but becomes overconfident about
them owing to \textit{biased fitting} training data. This exacerbates the
pseudo-labeled and classifier biases inherent in LTSSL, limiting performance
improvement in the tail classes. With these insights, we propose a Unbiased
Lightweight Fine-tuning strategy, \textbf{ULFine}, which mitigates the
overconfidence via confidence-aware adaptive fitting of textual prototypes and
counteracts the pseudo-labeled and classifier biases via complementary fusion
of dual logits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULFine markedly
decreases training costs by over ten times and substantially increases
prediction accuracies compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in multimodal tasks
such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification but struggles with
fine-grained understanding due to its focus on coarse-grained short captions.
To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances
fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage
large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for
capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is
constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding
boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich
representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are
incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic
differences. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these
data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original
CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks,
including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection,
image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results
highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and
improving overall model performance. The related data, code, and models are

Abstract: Human-robot interaction for assistive technologies relies on the prediction
of affordances, which are the potential actions a robot can perform on objects.
Predicting object affordances from visual perception is formulated differently
for tasks such as grasping detection, affordance classification, affordance
segmentation, and hand-object interaction synthesis. In this work, we highlight
the reproducibility issue in these redefinitions, making comparative benchmarks
unfair and unreliable. To address this problem, we propose a unified
formulation for visual affordance prediction, provide a comprehensive and
systematic review of previous works highlighting strengths and limitations of
methods and datasets, and analyse what challenges reproducibility. To favour
transparency, we introduce the Affordance Sheet, a document to detail the
proposed solution, the datasets, and the validation. As the physical properties
of an object influence the interaction with the robot, we present a generic
framework that links visual affordance prediction to the physical world. Using
the weight of an object as an example for this framework, we discuss how
estimating object mass can affect the affordance prediction. Our approach
bridges the gap between affordance perception and robot actuation, and accounts
for the complete information about objects of interest and how the robot
interacts with them to accomplish its task.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation for personalized identities aims at incorporating
the specific identity into images using a text prompt and an identity image.
Based on the powerful generative capabilities of DDPMs, many previous works
adopt additional prompts, such as text embeddings and CLIP image embeddings, to
represent the identity information, while they fail to disentangle the identity
information and background information. As a result, the generated images not
only lose key identity characteristics but also suffer from significantly
reduced diversity. To address this issue, previous works have combined the W+
space from StyleGAN with diffusion models, leveraging this space to provide a
more accurate and comprehensive representation of identity features through
multi-level feature extraction. However, the entanglement of identity and
background information in in-the-wild images during training prevents accurate
identity localization, resulting in severe semantic interference between
identity and background. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning-based
diffusion model for personalized identities text-to-image generation, named
PIDiff, which leverages the W+ space and an identity-tailored fine-tuning
strategy to avoid semantic entanglement and achieves accurate feature
extraction and localization. Style editing can also be achieved by PIDiff
through preserving the characteristics of identity features in the W+ space,
which vary from coarse to fine. Through the combination of the proposed
cross-attention block and parameter optimization strategy, PIDiff preserves the
identity information and maintains the generation capability for in-the-wild
images of the pre-trained model during inference. Our experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in this task.

Abstract: Event cameras have the potential to capture continuous motion information
over time and space, making them well-suited for optical flow estimation.
However, most existing learning-based methods for event-based optical flow
adopt frame-based techniques, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of
events. Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive
events within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in
long-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal
information and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for
event-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel
unsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences.
We propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an
Adaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich
spatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations.
Meanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the
accurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning
of our network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. Remarkably, our method ranks first among
unsupervised learning methods on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets. Our project

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has surpassed human performance on standard benchmarks,
driving its widespread adoption in computer vision tasks. One such task is
disparity estimation, estimating the disparity between matching pixels in
stereo image pairs, which is crucial for safety-critical applications like
medical surgeries and autonomous navigation. However, DL-based disparity
estimation methods are highly susceptible to distribution shifts and
adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their reliability and
generalization. Despite these concerns, a standardized benchmark for evaluating
the robustness of disparity estimation methods remains absent, hindering
progress in the field.
  To address this gap, we introduce DispBench, a comprehensive benchmarking
tool for systematically assessing the reliability of disparity estimation
methods. DispBench evaluates robustness against synthetic image corruptions
such as adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution shifts caused by 2D Common
Corruptions across multiple datasets and diverse corruption scenarios. We
conduct the most extensive performance and robustness analysis of disparity
estimation methods to date, uncovering key correlations between accuracy,
reliability, and generalization. Open-source code for DispBench:

### [192] [MDE-Edit: Masked Dual-Editing for Multi-Object Image Editing via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05101)
*Hongyang Zhu,Haipeng Liu,Bo Fu,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: MDE-Edit提出了一种无需训练的推理阶段优化方法，通过双损失设计（OAL和CCL）实现复杂多目标场景中的精确局部编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多目标编辑在复杂场景中面临定位不准和属性-对象不匹配的挑战，现有方法难以解决。

Method: 提出MDE-Edit，通过Object Alignment Loss（OAL）和Color Consistency Loss（CCL）优化扩散模型的噪声潜在特征。

Result: MDE-Edit在编辑准确性和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MDE-Edit为复杂多目标图像编辑任务提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-object editing aims to modify multiple objects or regions in complex
scenes while preserving structural coherence. This task faces significant
challenges in scenarios involving overlapping or interacting objects: (1)
Inaccurate localization of target objects due to attention misalignment,
leading to incomplete or misplaced edits; (2) Attribute-object mismatch, where
color or texture changes fail to align with intended regions due to
cross-attention leakage, creating semantic conflicts (\textit{e.g.}, color
bleeding into non-target areas). Existing methods struggle with these
challenges: approaches relying on global cross-attention mechanisms suffer from
attention dilution and spatial interference between objects, while mask-based
methods fail to bind attributes to geometrically accurate regions due to
feature entanglement in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations,
we propose a training-free, inference-stage optimization approach that enables
precise localized image manipulation in complex multi-object scenes, named
MDE-Edit. MDE-Edit optimizes the noise latent feature in diffusion models via
two key losses: Object Alignment Loss (OAL) aligns multi-layer cross-attention
with segmentation masks for precise object positioning, and Color Consistency
Loss (CCL) amplifies target attribute attention within masks while suppressing
leakage to adjacent regions. This dual-loss design ensures localized and
coherent multi-object edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDE-Edit
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing accuracy and visual quality,
offering a robust solution for complex multi-object image manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出一种基于支气管镜图像的自动化声门下狭窄严重程度评估方法，无需CT扫描，减少主观性并提高诊断一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有声门下狭窄评估依赖CT或专家主观检查，缺乏自动化方法和公开数据集。

Method: 利用支气管镜图像的光照衰减效应分割和跟踪气道，构建3D模型以测量狭窄程度。

Result: 方法在真实支气管镜数据上验证，与CT和专家评估一致，且重复性好。

Conclusion: 自动化方法可辅助诊断，减少CT辐射，缩短检查时间，并发布首个公开数据集。

Abstract: Purpose: Subglottic stenosis refers to the narrowing of the subglottis, the
airway between the vocal cords and the trachea. Its severity is typically
evaluated by estimating the percentage of obstructed airway. This estimation
can be obtained from CT data or through visual inspection by experts exploring
the region. However, visual inspections are inherently subjective, leading to
less consistent and robust diagnoses. No public methods or datasets are
currently available for automated evaluation of this condition from
bronchoscopy video.
  Methods: We propose a pipeline for automated subglottic stenosis severity
estimation during the bronchoscopy exploration, without requiring the physician
to traverse the stenosed region. Our approach exploits the physical effect of
illumination decline in endoscopy to segment and track the lumen and obtain a
3D model of the airway. This 3D model is obtained from a single frame and is
used to measure the airway narrowing.
  Results: Our pipeline is the first to enable automated and robust subglottic
stenosis severity measurement using bronchoscopy images. The results show
consistency with ground-truth estimations from CT scans and expert estimations,
and reliable repeatability across multiple estimations on the same patient. Our
evaluation is performed on our new Subglottic Stenosis Dataset of real
bronchoscopy procedures data.
  Conclusion: We demonstrate how to automate evaluation of subglottic stenosis
severity using only bronchoscopy. Our approach can assist with and shorten
diagnosis and monitoring procedures, with automated and repeatable estimations
and less exploration time, and save radiation exposure to patients as no CT is
required. Additionally, we release the first public benchmark for subglottic
stenosis severity assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准VLM的确定性嵌入难以捕捉视觉和文本描述中的不确定性及多模态对应关系，现有方法需大规模数据集且无法利用预训练VLM的强大表示能力。

Method: GroVE基于GPLVM，学习共享低维潜在空间，优化单模态嵌入重建和跨模态对齐目标，生成不确定性感知的概率嵌入。

Result: GroVE在跨模态检索、视觉问答和主动学习等任务中实现了最先进的不确定性校准。

Conclusion: GroVE提供了一种高效的后处理方法，能够从冻结VLM中生成不确定性感知的概率嵌入，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn joint representations by mapping images
and text into a shared latent space. However, recent research highlights that
deterministic embeddings from standard VLMs often struggle to capture the
uncertainties arising from the ambiguities in visual and textual descriptions
and the multiple possible correspondences between images and texts. Existing
approaches tackle this by learning probabilistic embeddings during VLM
training, which demands large datasets and does not leverage the powerful
representations already learned by large-scale VLMs like CLIP. In this paper,
we propose GroVE, a post-hoc approach to obtaining probabilistic embeddings
from frozen VLMs. GroVE builds on Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model
(GPLVM) to learn a shared low-dimensional latent space where image and text
inputs are mapped to a unified representation, optimized through single-modal
embedding reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. Once trained,
the Gaussian Process model generates uncertainty-aware probabilistic
embeddings. Evaluation shows that GroVE achieves state-of-the-art uncertainty
calibration across multiple downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval,
visual question answering, and active learning.

TLDR: 研究发现自动驾驶汽车在紧急车辆灯光下存在检测漏洞，提出Caracetamol框架提升检测稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶汽车在紧急车辆灯光下检测性能下降，存在安全隐患。

Method: 评估多种ADAS、目标检测器和灯光模式，提出Caracetamol框架。

Result: Caracetamol显著提升检测置信度，降低波动范围，满足实时处理需求。

Conclusion: Caracetamol有效缓解紧急车辆灯光对目标检测的影响，提升自动驾驶安全性。

Abstract: The safety of autonomous cars has come under scrutiny in recent years,
especially after 16 documented incidents involving Teslas (with autopilot
engaged) crashing into parked emergency vehicles (police cars, ambulances, and
firetrucks). While previous studies have revealed that strong light sources
often introduce flare artifacts in the captured image, which degrade the image
quality, the impact of flare on object detection performance remains unclear.
In this research, we unveil PaniCar, a digital phenomenon that causes an object
detector's confidence score to fluctuate below detection thresholds when
exposed to activated emergency vehicle lighting. This vulnerability poses a
significant safety risk, and can cause autonomous vehicles to fail to detect
objects near emergency vehicles. In addition, this vulnerability could be
exploited by adversaries to compromise the security of advanced driving
assistance systems (ADASs). We assess seven commercial ADASs (Tesla Model 3,
"manufacturer C", HP, Pelsee, AZDOME, Imagebon, Rexing), four object detectors
(YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN), and 14 patterns of emergency vehicle
lighting to understand the influence of various technical and environmental
factors. We also evaluate four SOTA flare removal methods and show that their
performance and latency are insufficient for real-time driving constraints. To
mitigate this risk, we propose Caracetamol, a robust framework designed to
enhance the resilience of object detectors against the effects of activated
emergency vehicle lighting. Our evaluation shows that on YOLOv3 and Faster
RCNN, Caracetamol improves the models' average confidence of car detection by
0.20, the lower confidence bound by 0.33, and reduces the fluctuation range by
0.33. In addition, Caracetamol is capable of processing frames at a rate of
between 30-50 FPS, enabling real-time ADAS car detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法仅使用文本提示，忽略了生物医学图像的特殊结构（如解剖结构和病理特征）。

Method: Biomed-DPT设计了双模态提示：文本提示包括临床模板和领域适应提示，视觉提示通过零向量实现注意力重加权。

Result: 在11个生物医学图像数据集上平均准确率达66.14%，在基类和新型类上分别达到78.06%和75.97%，优于CoOp方法。

Conclusion: Biomed-DPT通过结合双模态提示和知识蒸馏，显著提升了生物医学图像分类的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Prompt learning is one of the most effective paradigms for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to the biomedical image
classification tasks in few shot scenarios. However, most of the current prompt
learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular
structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological
features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a
knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text
prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven
clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted
prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts
through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt,
Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention
re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of
non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average
classification accuracy of 66.14\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering
9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\% in base classes
and 75.97\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method
by 6.20\%, 3.78\%, and 8.04\%, respectively. Our code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于U-Net的文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型在盲超分辨率（BSR）任务中表现有限，而Diffusion Transformers（DiT）展现出更高潜力，因此需要一种新方法来充分利用DiT的先验知识。

Method: 提出EAM方法，包括Ψ-DiT块（三流架构）、渐进式掩码图像建模策略（降低训练成本）和主题感知提示生成策略（优化T2I先验利用）。

Result: 实验表明，EAM在多个数据集上达到最先进水平，定量指标和视觉质量均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EAM通过结合DiT和创新的架构设计，显著提升了盲超分辨率任务的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Utilizing pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models to guide Blind
Super-Resolution (BSR) has become a predominant approach in the field. While
T2I models have traditionally relied on U-Net architectures, recent
advancements have demonstrated that Diffusion Transformers (DiT) achieve
significantly higher performance in this domain. In this work, we introduce
Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and
outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block,
$\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This
block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control,
forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior
knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance
capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we
introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces
training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation
strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning
framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides
detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors.
Our experiments demonstrate that EAM achieves state-of-the-art results across
multiple datasets, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics
and visual quality.

Abstract: Efficient view planning is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and
robotic perception, critical for tasks ranging from search and rescue
operations to autonomous navigation. While classical approaches, including
sampling-based and deterministic methods, have shown promise in planning camera
viewpoints for scene exploration, they often struggle with computational
scalability and solution optimality in complex settings. This study introduces
HQC-NBV, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for view planning that leverages
quantum properties to efficiently explore the parameter space while maintaining
robustness and scalability. We propose a specific Hamiltonian formulation with
multi-component cost terms and a parameter-centric variational ansatz with
bidirectional alternating entanglement patterns that capture the hierarchical
dependencies between viewpoint parameters. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that quantum-specific components provide measurable performance
advantages. Compared to the classical methods, our approach achieves up to
49.2% higher exploration efficiency across diverse environments. Our analysis
of entanglement architecture and coherence-preserving terms provides insights
into the mechanisms of quantum advantage in robotic exploration tasks. This
work represents a significant advancement in integrating quantum computing into
robotic perception systems, offering a paradigm-shifting solution for various
robot vision tasks.

Conclusion: 强调多模态系统在创意领域需更强的可解释性，以应对主观性和细微差别。

Abstract: CLIP has emerged as a powerful multimodal model capable of connecting images
and text through joint embeddings, but to what extent does it "see" the same
way humans do - especially when interpreting artworks? In this paper, we
investigate CLIP's ability to extract high-level semantic and stylistic
information from paintings, including both human-created and AI-generated
imagery. We evaluate its perception across multiple dimensions: content, scene
understanding, artistic style, historical period, and the presence of visual
deformations or artifacts. By designing targeted probing tasks and comparing
CLIP's responses to human annotations and expert benchmarks, we explore its
alignment with human perceptual and contextual understanding. Our findings
reveal both strengths and limitations in CLIP's visual representations,
particularly in relation to aesthetic cues and artistic intent. We further
discuss the implications of these insights for using CLIP as a guidance
mechanism during generative processes, such as style transfer or prompt-based
image synthesis. Our work highlights the need for deeper interpretability in
multimodal systems, especially when applied to creative domains where nuance
and subjectivity play a central role.

Conclusion: PADriver通过个性化提示和闭环评估显著提升了自动驾驶决策性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose PADriver, a novel closed-loop framework for

the potential action and provides an explicit reference for the final action,
which corresponds to the preset personalized prompt. Moreover, we construct a
closed-loop benchmark named PAD-Highway based on Highway-Env simulator to
comprehensively evaluate the decision performance under traffic rules. The
dataset contains 250 hours videos with high-quality annotation to facilitate
the development of PAD behavior analysis. Experimental results on the
constructed benchmark show that PADriver outperforms state-of-the-art

Abstract: We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D
Scenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual
prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is
to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared
with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding,
this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple
valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and
free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation
protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as
well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that
this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of

Conclusion: PRE-Mamba在多种雨强、视角及雪天条件下均表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Event cameras excel in high temporal resolution and dynamic range but suffer
from dense noise in rainy conditions. Existing event deraining methods face
trade-offs between temporal precision, deraining effectiveness, and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose PRE-Mamba, a novel
point-based event camera deraining framework that fully exploits the
spatiotemporal characteristics of raw event and rain. Our framework introduces
a 4D event cloud representation that integrates dual temporal scales to
preserve high temporal precision, a Spatio-Temporal Decoupling and Fusion
module (STDF) that enhances deraining capability by enabling shallow decoupling
and interaction of temporal and spatial information, and a Multi-Scale State
Space Model (MS3M) that captures deeper rain dynamics across dual-temporal and
multi-spatial scales with linear computational complexity. Enhanced by
frequency-domain regularization, PRE-Mamba achieves superior performance (0.95
SR, 0.91 NR, and 0.4s/M events) with only 0.26M parameters on EventRain-27K, a
comprehensive dataset with labeled synthetic and real-world sequences.
Moreover, our method generalizes well across varying rain intensities,

Abstract: Accurate building segmentation from high-resolution RGB imagery remains
challenging due to spectral similarity with non-building features, shadows, and
irregular building geometries. In this study, we present a comprehensive deep
learning framework for multiscale building segmentation using RGB aerial and
satellite imagery with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.4m to 2.7m. We curate
a diverse, multi-sensor dataset and introduce feature-augmented inputs by
deriving secondary representations including Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), Visible Difference Vegetation Index (VDVI), Morphological Building Index
(MBI), and Sobel edge filters from RGB channels. These features guide a
Res-U-Net architecture in learning complex spatial patterns more effectively.
We also propose training policies incorporating layer freezing, cyclical
learning rates, and SuperConvergence to reduce training time and resource
usage. Evaluated on a held-out WorldView-3 image, our model achieves an overall
accuracy of 96.5%, an F1-score of 0.86, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of
0.80, outperforming existing RGB-based benchmarks. This study demonstrates the
effectiveness of combining multi-resolution imagery, feature augmentation, and
optimized training strategies for robust building segmentation in remote

Conclusion: 美学研究中数据库的美学范围限制可能导致对图像内容与美学判断关系的误解，需更平衡的数据支持。

Abstract: While it is easy for human observers to judge an image as beautiful or ugly,
aesthetic decisions result from a combination of entangled perceptual and
cognitive (semantic) factors, making the understanding of aesthetic judgements
particularly challenging from a scientific point of view. Furthermore, our
research shows a prevailing bias in current databases, which include mostly
beautiful images, further complicating the study and prediction of aesthetic
responses. We address these limitations by creating a database of images with
minimal semantic content and devising, and next exploiting, a method to
generate images on the ugly side of aesthetic valuations. The resulting Minimum
Semantic Content (MSC) database consists of a large and balanced collection of
10,426 images, each evaluated by 100 observers. We next use established image
metrics to demonstrate how augmenting an image set biased towards beautiful
images with ugly images can modify, or even invert, an observed relationship
between image features and aesthetics valuation. Taken together, our study
reveals that works in empirical aesthetics attempting to link image content and
aesthetic judgements may magnify, underestimate, or simply miss interesting
effects due to a limitation of the range of aesthetic values they consider.

*Zunjie Zhu,Yan Zhao,Yihan Hu,Guoxiang Wang,Hai Qiu,Bolun Zheng,Chenggang Yan,Feng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种仅使用头戴和手腕三个IMU传感器的渐进式惯性姿态估计方法（ProgIP），结合神经网络与人体动力学模型，实时重建全身运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高虚拟现实中全身姿态估计的实用性，减少硬件复杂性，避免依赖额外传感器或外部视觉设备。

Method: 结合Transformer Encoder和双向LSTM（TE-biLSTM）捕捉惯性序列的时间依赖性，通过多层感知机（MLPs）解码器将特征映射到SMPL模型参数。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上定量和定性实验表明，该方法优于同类输入的最先进方法，且与使用六个IMU传感器的方法相当。

Conclusion: ProgIP方法在减少传感器数量的同时，实现了高精度的全身姿态估计，适用于虚拟现实应用。

Abstract: The motion capture system that supports full-body virtual representation is
of key significance for virtual reality. Compared to vision-based systems,
full-body pose estimation from sparse tracking signals is not limited by
environmental conditions or recording range. However, previous works either
face the challenge of wearing additional sensors on the pelvis and lower-body
or rely on external visual sensors to obtain global positions of key joints. To
improve the practicality of the technology for virtual reality applications, we
estimate full-body poses using only inertial data obtained from three Inertial
Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors worn on the head and wrists, thereby reducing
the complexity of the hardware system. In this work, we propose a method called
Progressive Inertial Poser (ProgIP) for human pose estimation, which combines
neural network estimation with a human dynamics model, considers the
hierarchical structure of the kinematic chain, and employs a multi-stage
progressive network estimation with increased depth to reconstruct full-body
motion in real time. The encoder combines Transformer Encoder and bidirectional
LSTM (TE-biLSTM) to flexibly capture the temporal dependencies of the inertial
sequence, while the decoder based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) transforms
high-dimensional features and accurately projects them onto Skinned
Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model parameters. Quantitative and qualitative
experimental results on multiple public datasets show that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the same inputs, and is comparable to
recent works using six IMU sensors.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于CLIP的自监督方法，用于声音源定位，无需显式文本输入，并通过音频驱动的嵌入和对比学习实现音频-视觉对齐。实验表明该方法在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用预训练的多模态基础模型（如CLIP）的强大多模态对齐能力，扩展其应用至声音源定位任务，以提升定位的完整性和紧凑性。

Method: 提出一个框架，将音频映射为与CLIP文本编码器兼容的令牌，生成音频驱动的嵌入，并通过对比学习对齐音频和视觉特征。进一步引入LLM引导的扩展以增强对齐。

Result: 在五个多样化任务中，该方法的所有变体均优于现有技术，并在零样本设置中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过利用预训练多模态模型的对齐知识，该方法在声音源定位任务中实现了更优性能，展示了多模态基础模型的潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models demonstrate strong multimodal alignment
and generalization across diverse tasks. Among them, CLIP stands out as one of
the most successful approaches. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP
to sound source localization, proposing a self-supervised method operates
without explicit text input. We introduce a framework that maps audios into
tokens compatible with CLIP's text encoder, producing audio-driven embeddings.
These embeddings are used to generate sounding region masks, from which visual
features are extracted and aligned with the audio embeddings through a
contrastive audio-visual correspondence objective. Our findings show that
alignment knowledge of pre-trained multimodal foundation model enables our
method to generate more complete and compact localization for sounding objects.
We further propose an LLM-guided extension that distills object-aware
audio-visual scene understanding into the model during training to enhance
alignment. Extensive experiments across five diverse tasks demonstrate that our
method, in all variants, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and achieves
strong generalization in zero-shot settings.

*Jie Deng,Danfeng Hong,Chenyu Li,Naoto Yokoya*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种名为JointSeg的新型联合框架，结合超分辨率和分割技术，直接从Sentinel-2影像生成1米分辨率的地表不透水面（ISA）地图。该方法在复杂地形和城乡模式下表现优异，定量评估显示其性能显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在生成高分辨率ISA地图时成本高且难以扩展，而JointSeg通过整合超分辨率和分割技术，提供了一种经济高效的替代方案。

Method: JointSeg通过多模态跨分辨率输入训练，逐步从10米提升到1米分辨率，同时保持空间纹理细节，并通过跨尺度特征融合确保分类精度。

Result: 在长江经济带（YREB）的应用中，生成的ISA-1产品覆盖220万平方公里，F1分数达85.71%，显著优于其他基准数据集。

Conclusion: JointSeg在复杂地形和城乡模式下表现出色，能够捕捉城市化动态，为区域规划提供了可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: We propose a novel joint framework by integrating super-resolution and
segmentation, called JointSeg, which enables the generation of 1-meter ISA maps
directly from freely available Sentinel-2 imagery. JointSeg was trained on
multimodal cross-resolution inputs, offering a scalable and affordable
alternative to traditional approaches. This synergistic design enables gradual
resolution enhancement from 10m to 1m while preserving fine-grained spatial
textures, and ensures high classification fidelity through effective
cross-scale feature fusion. This method has been successfully applied to the
Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), a region characterized by complex
urban-rural patterns and diverse topography. As a result, a comprehensive ISA
mapping product for 2021, referred to as ISA-1, was generated, covering an area
of over 2.2 million square kilometers. Quantitative comparisons against the 10m
ESA WorldCover and other benchmark products reveal that ISA-1 achieves an
F1-score of 85.71%, outperforming bilinear-interpolation-based segmentation by
9.5%, and surpassing other ISA datasets by 21.43%-61.07%. In densely urbanized
areas (e.g., Suzhou, Nanjing), ISA-1 reduces ISA overestimation through
improved discrimination of green spaces and water bodies. Conversely, in
mountainous regions (e.g., Ganzi, Zhaotong), it identifies significantly more
ISA due to its enhanced ability to detect fragmented anthropogenic features
such as rural roads and sparse settlements, demonstrating its robustness across
diverse landscapes. Moreover, we present biennial ISA maps from 2017 to 2023,
capturing spatiotemporal urbanization dynamics across representative cities.
The results highlight distinct regional growth patterns: rapid expansion in
upstream cities, moderate growth in midstream regions, and saturation in
downstream metropolitan areas.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为阈值调制（TM）的低功耗、适用于神经形态芯片的在线测试时间适应框架，以增强SNN在分布偏移下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SNN在部署后适应分布偏移的挑战，现有OTTA方法不适用于SNN。

Method: 通过神经元动态启发的归一化动态调整发放阈值（TM）。

Result: 在基准数据集上验证了TM方法在提升SNN鲁棒性的同时保持低计算成本。

Conclusion: TM为SNN的在线测试时间适应提供了实用方案，并为未来神经形态芯片设计提供灵感。

Abstract: Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips,
provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios.
However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has
become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a
promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data
distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples.
Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional
artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this
gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time
adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution
shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which
dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired
normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in
improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining
low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for
online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of
future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at
github.com/NneurotransmitterR/TM-OTTA-SNN.

TLDR: 提出一种从无色3D扫描中直接重建头发丝的新方法，利用多模态头发方向提取技术，无需依赖颜色信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头发丝重建是计算机视觉和图形学中的基础问题，可用于高保真数字头像合成、动画和AR/VR应用。现有方法依赖RGB捕捉，对环境敏感且难以提取复杂发型的导向丝方向。

Method: 通过扫描表面特征提取和神经2D线检测器估计丝方向，结合扩散先验和扫描特定文本提示优化重建。

Result: 该方法能准确重建简单和复杂发型，无需颜色信息，并发布了Strands400数据集。

Conclusion: 结合多模态信号的方法在头发丝重建中表现优异，推动了相关研究。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that reconstructs hair strands directly from
colorless 3D scans by leveraging multi-modal hair orientation extraction. Hair
strand reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics
that can be used for high-fidelity digital avatar synthesis, animation, and
AR/VR applications. However, accurately recovering hair strands from raw scan
data remains challenging due to human hair's complex and fine-grained
structure. Existing methods typically rely on RGB captures, which can be
sensitive to the environment and can be a challenging domain for extracting the
orientation of guiding strands, especially in the case of challenging
hairstyles. To reconstruct the hair purely from the observed geometry, our
method finds sharp surface features directly on the scan and estimates strand
orientation through a neural 2D line detector applied to the renderings of scan
shading. Additionally, we incorporate a diffusion prior trained on a diverse
set of synthetic hair scans, refined with an improved noise schedule, and
adapted to the reconstructed contents via a scan-specific text prompt. We
demonstrate that this combination of supervision signals enables accurate
reconstruction of both simple and intricate hairstyles without relying on color
information. To facilitate further research, we introduce Strands400, the
largest publicly available dataset of hair strands with detailed surface
geometry extracted from real-world data, which contains reconstructed hair
strands from the scans of 400 subjects.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于状态空间模型（SSMs）的事件去噪框架，解决了现有方法在计算强度与鲁棒性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机的高动态范围和低延迟特性使其在高速视觉中表现优异，但其输出噪声问题需要高效去噪方法以保持其实时性。

Method: 将事件表示为4D事件云，通过粗特征提取模块（CFE）从几何和极性感知子空间提取特征，结合空间Mamba（S-SSM）和时间Mamba（T-SSM）建模局部几何结构和全局时间动态。

Result: 模型参数为88.89K，每100K事件推理时间为0.0685秒，准确率为0.982，比基于Transformer的方法准确率高2.08%，速度快36倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和效率上均达到最优，为事件相机去噪提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras excel in high-speed vision due to their high temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption. However, as dynamic
vision sensors, their output is inherently noisy, making efficient denoising
essential to preserve their ultra-low latency and real-time processing
capabilities. Existing event denoising methods struggle with a critical
dilemma: computationally intensive approaches compromise the sensor's
high-speed advantage, while lightweight methods often lack robustness across
varying noise levels. To address this, we propose a novel event denoising
framework based on State Space Models (SSMs). Our approach represents events as
4D event clouds and includes a Coarse Feature Extraction (CFE) module that
extracts embedding features from both geometric and polarity-aware subspaces.
The model is further composed of two essential components: A Spatial Mamba
(S-SSM) that models local geometric structures and a Temporal Mamba (T-SSM)
that captures global temporal dynamics, efficiently propagating spatiotemporal
features across events. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency, with 88.89K parameters, 0.0685s per
100K events inference time, and a 0.982 accuracy score, outperforming
Transformer-based methods by 2.08% in denoising accuracy and 36X faster.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如Chameleon和Emu3）在多模态统一中存在训练计算开销高和理解性能有限的问题。

Result: TokLIP在数据效率和语义理解上表现优异，同时提升生成能力。

Conclusion: TokLIP适用于自回归Transformer的理解和生成任务，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Pioneering token-based works such as Chameleon and Emu3 have established a
foundation for multimodal unification but face challenges of high training
computational overhead and limited comprehension performance due to a lack of
high-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer
that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and
incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal
autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level
discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level
continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize
high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension
and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers
without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results
demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual
tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level
generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in
both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at
https://github.com/TencentARC/TokLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路边点云的3D物体检测尚未被充分探索，而点云检测器的性能关键取决于网络的感受野和场景上下文利用能力。

Method: 引入Mamba到基于pillar的路边点云感知中，提出CSG框架PillarMamba，并通过HSB模块解决局部连接和历史关系遗忘问题。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X-I基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PillarMamba通过结合局部-全局上下文，提升了路边点云检测的性能。

Abstract: Serving the Intelligent Transport System (ITS) and Vehicle-to-Everything
(V2X) tasks, roadside perception has received increasing attention in recent
years, as it can extend the perception range of connected vehicles and improve
traffic safety. However, roadside point cloud oriented 3D object detection has
not been effectively explored. To some extent, the key to the performance of a
point cloud detector lies in the receptive field of the network and the ability
to effectively utilize the scene context. The recent emergence of Mamba, based
on State Space Model (SSM), has shaken up the traditional convolution and
transformers that have long been the foundational building blocks, due to its
efficient global receptive field. In this work, we introduce Mamba to
pillar-based roadside point cloud perception and propose a framework based on
Cross-stage State-space Group (CSG), called PillarMamba. It enhances the
expressiveness of the network and achieves efficient computation through
cross-stage feature fusion. However, due to the limitations of scan directions,
state space model faces local connection disrupted and historical relationship
forgotten. To address this, we propose the Hybrid State-space Block (HSB) to
obtain the local-global context of roadside point cloud. Specifically, it
enhances neighborhood connections through local convolution and preserves
historical memory through residual attention. The proposed method outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods on the popular large scale roadside benchmark:
DAIR-V2X-I. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: Visual Document Understanding has become essential with the increase of
text-rich visual content. This field poses significant challenges due to the
need for effective integration of visual perception and textual comprehension,
particularly across diverse document types with complex layouts. Moreover,
existing fine-tuning datasets for this domain often fall short in providing the
detailed contextual information for robust understanding, leading to
hallucinations and limited comprehension of spatial relationships among visual
elements. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative pipeline that
utilizes adaptive generation of markup languages, such as Markdown, JSON, HTML,
and TiKZ, to build highly structured document representations and deliver
contextually-grounded responses. We introduce two fine-grained structured
datasets: DocMark-Pile, comprising approximately 3.8M pretraining data pairs
for document parsing, and DocMark-Instruct, featuring 624k fine-tuning data
annotations for grounded instruction following. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-theart MLLMs across a range of visual document understanding
benchmarks, facilitating advanced reasoning and comprehension capabilities in

Abstract: Spatial intelligence (SI) represents a cognitive ability encompassing the

underpinning disciplines from neuroscience to robotics. We introduce SITE, a
benchmark dataset towards SI Thorough Evaluation in a standardized format of
multi-choice visual question-answering, designed to assess large
vision-language models' spatial intelligence across diverse visual modalities
(single-image, multi-image, and video) and SI factors (figural to environmental
scales, spatial visualization and orientation, intrinsic and extrinsic, static
and dynamic). Our approach to curating the benchmark combines a bottom-up
survey about 31 existing datasets and a top-down strategy drawing upon three
classification systems in cognitive science, which prompt us to design two
novel types of tasks about view-taking and dynamic scenes. Extensive
experiments reveal that leading models fall behind human experts especially in
spatial orientation, a fundamental SI factor. Moreover, we demonstrate a
positive correlation between a model's spatial reasoning proficiency and its
performance on an embodied AI task.

Abstract: We introduce LegoGPT, the first approach for generating physically stable
LEGO brick models from text prompts. To achieve this, we construct a
large-scale, physically stable dataset of LEGO designs, along with their
associated captions, and train an autoregressive large language model to
predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction. To improve the
stability of the resulting designs, we employ an efficient validity check and
physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, which prunes infeasible
token predictions using physics laws and assembly constraints. Our experiments
show that LegoGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing LEGO
designs that align closely with the input text prompts. We also develop a
text-based LEGO texturing method to generate colored and textured designs. We
show that our designs can be assembled manually by humans and automatically by
robotic arms. We also release our new dataset, StableText2Lego, containing over

Motivation: 将强化学习引入流匹配模型，以提升生成任务（如文本到图像）的性能和效率。

Method: 1. ODE-to-SDE转换：将确定性ODE转化为等效SDE，支持RL探索；2. 降噪策略：减少训练步骤，保持推理效率。

Result: 在复杂构图和视觉文本渲染任务中，性能显著提升（如GenEval准确率从63%升至95%），且未牺牲图像质量或多样性。

Conclusion: Flow-GRPO在生成任务中表现出色，同时保持了高质量和多样性。

Abstract: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement
learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies:
(1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation
(SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps,
enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction
strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original
inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without
performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple
text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly
perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting
GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy
improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation.
Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment.
Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase
at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our
experiments.

improvements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual
vision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal
classifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both
autoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality
image synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly
effective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To
further unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient
training strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for
joint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and
text-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent
interleaved outputs. Its emergent capabilities in zero-shot image editing and
compositional generation highlight Mogao as a practical omni-modal foundation
model, paving the way for future development and scaling the unified
multi-modal systems.

*Qitao Zhao,Amy Lin,Jeff Tan,Jason Y. Zhang,Deva Ramanan,Shubham Tulsiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: DiffusionSfM提出了一种基于数据驱动的多视图推理方法，直接预测3D场景几何和相机姿态，优于传统和基于学习的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SfM方法通常采用两阶段流程，结合学习或几何对偶推理与全局优化，而DiffusionSfM旨在通过数据驱动直接推断多视图输入。

Method: DiffusionSfM将场景几何和相机参数化为全局坐标系中的像素级射线起点和终点，并使用基于Transformer的去噪扩散模型进行预测。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，DiffusionSfM优于传统和基于学习的方法，并能自然建模不确定性。

Conclusion: DiffusionSfM通过数据驱动的多视图推理，直接预测3D场景几何和相机姿态，表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Current Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods typically follow a two-stage
pipeline, combining learned or geometric pairwise reasoning with a subsequent
global optimization step. In contrast, we propose a data-driven multi-view
reasoning approach that directly infers 3D scene geometry and camera poses from
multi-view images. Our framework, DiffusionSfM, parameterizes scene geometry
and cameras as pixel-wise ray origins and endpoints in a global frame and
employs a transformer-based denoising diffusion model to predict them from
multi-view inputs. To address practical challenges in training diffusion models
with missing data and unbounded scene coordinates, we introduce specialized
mechanisms that ensure robust learning. We empirically validate DiffusionSfM on
both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms classical
and learning-based approaches while naturally modeling uncertainty.

Abstract: 3D scene generation seeks to synthesize spatially structured, semantically
meaningful, and photorealistic environments for applications such as immersive
media, robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI. Early methods based on
procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in
deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations
(e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene
distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent
advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by
reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides
a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four
paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based
generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations,
trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets,
evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing
key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations,
and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity,
physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation
models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and
highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D
vision, and embodied intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain

TLDR: SVAD结合视频扩散模型和3D高斯泼溅技术，从单张图像生成高质量可动画3D人体化身，解决了现有方法在一致性和身份保持上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张图像生成高质量3D人体化身是计算机视觉中的挑战，现有方法在数据需求或一致性上存在不足。

Method: 通过视频扩散生成合成训练数据，结合身份保持和图像修复模块，训练3DGS化身。

Result: SVAD在身份一致性和细节保持上优于现有单图像方法，支持实时渲染。

Conclusion: SVAD通过结合扩散模型和3DGS，为单图像高保真化身生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: Creating high-quality animatable 3D human avatars from a single image remains
a significant challenge in computer vision due to the inherent difficulty of
reconstructing complete 3D information from a single viewpoint. Current
approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences,
while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but
struggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel
approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths
of existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through
video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration
modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars. Comprehensive
evaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
single-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details
across novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering
capabilities. Through our data augmentation pipeline, we overcome the
dependency on dense monocular or multi-view training data typically required by
traditional 3DGS approaches. Extensive quantitative, qualitative comparisons
show our method achieves superior performance across multiple metrics against
baseline models. By effectively combining the generative power of diffusion
models with both the high-quality results and rendering efficiency of 3DGS, our
work establishes a new approach for high-fidelity avatar generation from a
single image input.

Motivation: 解决矩阵李群系统在未知动态、执行器故障和干扰下的跟踪控制问题。

Method: 利用矩阵李群的左不变性，提出与李群结构兼容的神经网络权重学习规则，避免参数化奇异性。

Result: 通过Lyapunov直接方法证明了所有误差信号的最终有界性，并在特殊欧几里得群上验证了多智能体系统的分散编队控制效果。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了李群系统的跟踪控制问题，具有全局优化和参数化无关的优势。

Abstract: We present a geometric neural network-based tracking controller for systems
evolving on matrix Lie groups under unknown dynamics, actuator faults, and
bounded disturbances. Leveraging the left-invariance of the tangent bundle of
matrix Lie groups, viewed as an embedded submanifold of the vector space
$\R^{N\times N}$, we propose a set of learning rules for neural network weights
that are intrinsically compatible with the Lie group structure and do not
require explicit parameterization. Exploiting the geometric properties of Lie
groups, this approach circumvents parameterization singularities and enables a
global search for optimal weights. The ultimate boundedness of all error
signals -- including the neural network weights, the coordinate-free
configuration error function, and the tracking velocity error -- is established
using Lyapunov's direct method. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, we provide illustrative simulation results for decentralized formation
control of multi-agent systems on the Special Euclidean group.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为LAPSO的框架，通过机器学习与模型优化的结合，提升电力系统操作的效率与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可再生能源的高渗透率，传统模型难以满足经济、稳定和鲁棒的决策需求，机器学习虽强大但缺乏系统性整合。

Method: LAPSO框架从优化角度出发，整合电力系统的预测、操作和控制任务，统一机器学习和模型优化的目标。

Result: 通过仿真验证了LAPSO的有效性，设计了稳定性约束优化（SCO）和目标导向预测（OBF）等新算法，并开源了Python工具包。

Conclusion: LAPSO成功填补了机器学习与电力系统操作之间的鸿沟，提供了端到端的不确定性追踪能力。

Abstract: With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system
operation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions.
Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex
dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks
systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper
proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations
(LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective,
LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between
temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control,
while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations
at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations
demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated
algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and
objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of
different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python
package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system
optimization models with learnable components. All code and data are available
at https://github.com/xuwkk/lapso_exp.

Abstract: The article explores the emerging domain of incentive-aware machine learning
(ML), which focuses on algorithmic decision-making in contexts where
individuals can strategically modify their inputs to influence outcomes. It

systems; and improvement/causality, recognizing situations where strategic
actions lead to genuine personal or societal improvement. The paper introduces
a unified framework encapsulating models for these perspectives, including

differentiating between gaming and improvement and addressing heterogeneity
among agents. By synthesizing findings from diverse works, we outline
theoretical advancements and practical solutions for robust, fair, and

Abstract: Small and medium sized businesses often struggle with data driven decision
making do to a lack of advanced analytics tools, especially in African
countries where they make up a majority of the workforce. Though many tools
exist they are not designed to fit into the ways of working of SMB workers who

Motivation: 现代肾脏移植中基于回归的预测分析存在训练数据带来的偏见，导致社会歧视和器官利用效率低下，但相关研究较少。

Method: 引入三种公平性概念（独立性、分离性、充分性），并通过众包平台收集85名参与者的反馈，使用混合Logit离散选择模型分析公平性偏好。

Result: 结果显示分离性和充分性公平性概念更受青睐，预测分析在性别和种族上公平，但在年龄上不公平。

Conclusion: 研究为评估回归分析工具的公平性提供了新方法，并揭示了社会对公平性的偏好。

Abstract: Regression-based predictive analytics used in modern kidney transplantation
is known to inherit biases from training data. This leads to social
discrimination and inefficient organ utilization, particularly in the context
of a few social groups. Despite this concern, there is limited research on
fairness in regression and its impact on organ utilization and placement. This
paper introduces three novel divergence-based group fairness notions: (i)
independence, (ii) separation, and (iii) sufficiency to assess the fairness of
regression-based analytics tools. In addition, fairness preferences are
investigated from crowd feedback, in order to identify a socially accepted
group fairness criterion for evaluating these tools. A total of 85 participants
were recruited from the Prolific crowdsourcing platform, and a Mixed-Logit
discrete choice model was used to model fairness feedback and estimate social
fairness preferences. The findings clearly depict a strong preference towards
the separation and sufficiency fairness notions, and that the predictive
analytics is deemed fair with respect to gender and race groups, but unfair in
terms of age groups.

Abstract: The sixth generation of wireless networks defined several key performance
indicators (KPIs) for assessing its networks, mainly in terms of reliability,
coverage, and sensing. In this regard, remarkable attention has been paid
recently to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm as an
enabler for efficiently and jointly performing communication and sensing using
the same spectrum and hardware resources. On the other hand, ensuring
communication and data security has been an imperative requirement for wireless
networks throughout their evolution. The physical-layer security (PLS) concept
paved the way to catering to the security needs in wireless networks in a
sustainable way while guaranteeing theoretically secure transmissions,
independently of the computational capacity of adversaries. Therefore, it is of
paramount importance to consider a balanced trade-off between communication
reliability, sensing, and security in future networks, such as the 5G and
beyond, and the 6G. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and system-wise
review of designed secure ISAC systems from a PLS point of view. In particular,
the impact of various physical-layer techniques, schemes, and wireless
technologies to ensure the sensing-security trade-off is studied from the
surveyed work. Furthermore, the amalgamation of PLS and ISAC is analyzed in a
broader impact by considering attacks targeting data confidentiality,
communication covertness, and sensing spoofing. The paper also serves as a
tutorial by presenting several theoretical foundations on ISAC and PLS, which
represent a practical guide for readers to develop novel secure ISAC network
designs.

Abstract: The ThEdu series pursues the smooth transition from an intuitive way of doing
mathematics at secondary school to a more formal approach to the subject in
STEM education while favoring software support for this transition by
exploiting the power of theorem-proving technologies. What follows is a brief
description of how the present volume contributes to this enterprise. The 13th
International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software
(ThEdu'24), was a satellite event of the CADE29, part of IJCAR 2024, Nancy,
France. ThEdu'24 was a vibrant workshop, with one invited talk by Jeremy Avigad
(Carnegie Mellon University) and 14 submitted talks. An open call for papers
was then issued and attracted 9 submissions. Eight of those submissions have
been accepted by our reviewers. The resulting revised papers are collected in
the present volume. The contributions in this volume are a faithful
representation of the wide spectrum of ThEdu, ranging from those more focused
on the automated deduction research, not losing track of the possible
applications in an educational setting, to those focused on the applications,
in educational settings, of automated deduction tools and methods. We, the
volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will further promote the
development of theorem-proving-based software and that it will allow to improve
the mutual understanding between computer scientists, mathematicians, and
stakeholders in education. While this volume goes to press, the next edition of
the ThEdu workshop is being prepared: ThEdu'25 will be a satellite event of the

Abstract: Hypergraphs, capable of representing high-order interactions via hyperedges,
have become a powerful tool for modeling real-world biological and social
systems. Inherent relationships within these real-world systems, such as the
encoding relationship between genes and their protein products, drive the
establishment of interconnections between multiple hypergraphs. Here, we
demonstrate how to utilize those interconnections between multiple hypergraphs
to synthesize integrated information from multiple higher-order systems,
thereby enhancing understanding of underlying structures. We propose a model
based on the stochastic block model, which integrates information from multiple
hypergraphs to reveal latent high-order structures. Real-world hyperedges
exhibit preferential attachment, where certain nodes dominate hyperedge
formation. To characterize this phenomenon, our model introduces hyperedge
internal degree to quantify nodes' contributions to hyperedge formation. This
model is capable of mining communities, predicting missing hyperedges of
arbitrary sizes within hypergraphs, and inferring inter-hypergraph edges
between hypergraphs. We apply our model to high-order datasets to evaluate its
performance. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance of our model
in community detection, hyperedge prediction, and inter-hypergraph edge
prediction tasks. Moreover, we show that our model enables analysis of multiple
hypergraphs of different types and supports the analysis of a single hypergraph
in the absence of inter-hypergraph edges. Our work provides a practical and
flexible tool for analyzing multiple hypergraphs, greatly advancing the
understanding of the organization in real-world high-order systems.

Abstract: The moments of random variables are fundamental statistical measures for
characterizing the shape of a probability distribution, encompassing metrics
such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Additionally, the product
moments, including covariance and correlation, reveal the relationships between
multiple random variables. On the other hand, the primary focus of causal
inference is the evaluation of causal effects, which are defined as the
difference between two potential outcomes. While traditional causal effect
assessment focuses on the average causal effect, this work provides
definitions, identification theorems, and bounds for moments and product
moments of causal effects to analyze their distribution and relationships. We
conduct experiments to illustrate the estimation of the moments of causal
effects from finite samples and demonstrate their practical application using a
real-world medical dataset.

Abstract: Mediation analysis for probabilities of causation (PoC) provides a
fundamental framework for evaluating the necessity and sufficiency of treatment
in provoking an event through different causal pathways. One of the primary
objectives of causal mediation analysis is to decompose the total effect into
path-specific components. In this study, we investigate the path-specific
probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS) to decompose the total PNS into
path-specific components along distinct causal pathways between treatment and
outcome, incorporating two mediators. We define the path-specific PNS for
decomposition and provide an identification theorem. Furthermore, we conduct
numerical experiments to assess the properties of the proposed estimators from
finite samples and demonstrate their practical application using a real-world
educational dataset.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years thanks to
innovations in the design and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs).
Despite these advancements, we still understand relatively little about how
elementary forms of ANNs learn, fail to learn, and generate false information
without the intent to deceive, a phenomenon known as `confabulation'. To
provide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation
occurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN.
RCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a
well-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given
attractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to
construct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on
the role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when
modelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results,
we conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state
spaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in
systems beyond RCs.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种通过机器学习正交、局部支持的基函数来高效估计转移和Koopman算子的方法，以解决复杂非线性动力系统的线性表示问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 转移和Koopman算子方法为复杂非线性动力系统提供了线性表示框架，但其谱估计从数据中高效获取具有挑战性。

Method: 通过机器学习动态定制的正交、局部支持的基函数，近似线性算子，生成高效有限维表示。

Result: 学习到的基函数能准确近似算子作用，并形成几乎不变的有限维子空间，成功恢复了估计算子的谱特性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了机器学习基函数的动态适应性，为复杂动力系统的线性表示提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Transfer and Koopman operator methods offer a framework for representing
complex, nonlinear dynamical systems via linear transformations, enabling for a
deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics. The spectrum of these
operators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent
behaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging.
We tackle this issue through the lens of general operator and representational
learning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient
finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal,
locally supported basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system.
This learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the
operator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We
illustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral
properties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive
quality of the machine-learned basis.

TLDR: 研究活性物质在储层计算中的信息处理能力，发现一种被忽视的动力学机制，该机制在多种物理参数和任务中表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索物理系统在计算和推断中的潜力，特别是活性物质的动力学特性。

Method: 模拟一个外部驱动的模型，用于预测混沌信号的未来状态，并分析其动力学行为。

Result: 发现一种多阶段微观动力学松弛机制，位于临界阻尼阈值以下，表现出最优计算性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为多体物理的非平衡态计算提供了新视角，揭示了动力学机制与信息处理能力的关系。

Abstract: We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the
reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to
infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely
follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime
of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly
optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing
valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more
generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing
are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities.
These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference
goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The
regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical
damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple
stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to
a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between
quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and
incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales
of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the
best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the
responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is
interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding
learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body
physics out of equilibrium.

Motivation: 应用评论是重要的用户反馈来源，但传统分类方法需要大量领域特定数据，成本高且耗时。研究旨在探索零样本学习的潜力。

Method: 使用ChatGPT进行零样本学习，对来自10个不同应用的1880条评论进行分类，并评估其性能。

Result: ChatGPT在评论分类中取得了0.842的F1分数，同时分析了评论可读性和长度对分类准确性的影响。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在零样本学习下表现良好，但仍存在挑战和局限性，某些评论类别更容易被误分类。

Abstract: App reviews are a critical source of user feedback, offering valuable
insights into an app's performance, features, usability, and overall user
experience. Effectively analyzing these reviews is essential for guiding app
development, prioritizing feature updates, and enhancing user satisfaction.
Classifying reviews into functional and non-functional requirements play a
pivotal role in distinguishing feedback related to specific app features
(functional requirements) from feedback concerning broader quality attributes,
such as performance, usability, and reliability (non-functional requirements).
Both categories are integral to informed development decisions. Traditional
approaches to classifying app reviews are hindered by the need for large,
domain-specific datasets, which are often costly and time-consuming to curate.
This study explores the potential of zero-shot learning with ChatGPT for
classifying app reviews into four categories: functional requirement,
non-functional requirement, both, or neither. We evaluate ChatGPT's performance
on a benchmark dataset of 1,880 manually annotated reviews from ten diverse
apps spanning multiple domains. Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT achieves
a robust F1 score of 0.842 in review classification, despite certain challenges
and limitations. Additionally, we examine how factors such as review
readability and length impact classification accuracy and conduct a manual
analysis to identify review categories more prone to misclassification.

Main category: cs.SE

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种名为PR2的技术，旨在通过消除C2RUST工具生成的Rust代码中的原始指针，提升其内存安全性。PR2采用基于决策树的提示和代码变更分析，成功减少了13.22%的原始指针，并在28个真实C项目中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Rust的内存和线程安全特性，将C代码转换为Rust的需求日益增长。然而，现有工具生成的Rust代码仍依赖不安全结构（如原始指针），削弱了Rust的安全性。

Method: PR2技术通过局部原始指针重写，将原始指针提升为适当的Rust数据结构，并利用决策树提示和代码变更分析来修复重写过程中的错误。

Result: 在28个真实C项目中，PR2成功消除了13.22%的本地原始指针，平均每个项目的转换时间为5.44小时，成本为1.46美元。

Conclusion: PR2显著提升了由C2RUST生成的Rust代码的安全性，证明了其在消除原始指针方面的有效性。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's
robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable
syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code.
However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe
constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety
guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs
generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a
peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual
functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs
decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process.
Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors
introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during
compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and
evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show
that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these
projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On
average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an
average cost of $1.46.

Motivation: 尽管CodeLLMs和智能体在软件工程中表现出巨大潜力，但缺乏对其基准测试的全面综述，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析461篇相关论文中的181个基准测试，覆盖SDLC的不同阶段。

Result: 发现基准测试分布不均（开发阶段占60%，需求工程和设计阶段分别占5%和3%），且Python是主导语言。

Conclusion: 当前研究存在挑战，未来需缩小CodeLLMs和智能体理论能力与实际应用的差距。

Abstract: Code large language models (CodeLLMs) and agents have shown great promise in
tackling complex software engineering tasks.Compared to traditional software
engineering methods, CodeLLMs and agents offer stronger abilities, and can
flexibly process inputs and outputs in both natural and code. Benchmarking
plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents,
guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing
significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for
CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive
review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing
181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the
software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance
in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the
software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software
design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively.
Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the
reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current
research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the
theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in
real-world scenarios.

Result: SSH-Net能有效去除水印和噪声，无需成对数据。

Conclusion: SSH-Net为水印去除提供了一种高效的自监督解决方案。

Abstract: Visible watermark removal is challenging due to its inherent complexities and
the noise carried within images. Existing methods primarily rely on supervised
learning approaches that require paired datasets of watermarked and
watermark-free images, which are often impractical to obtain in real-world
scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose SSH-Net, a Self-Supervised and
Hybrid Network specifically designed for noisy image watermark removal. SSH-Net
synthesizes reference watermark-free images using the watermark distribution in
a self-supervised manner and adopts a dual-network design to address the task.
The upper network, focused on the simpler task of noise removal, employs a
lightweight CNN-based architecture, while the lower network, designed to handle
the more complex task of simultaneously removing watermarks and noise,
incorporates Transformer blocks to model long-range dependencies and capture
intricate image features. To enhance the model's effectiveness, a shared
CNN-based feature encoder is introduced before dual networks to extract common
features that both networks can leverage. Our code will be available at

Abstract: Grain growth simulation is crucial for predicting metallic material
microstructure evolution during annealing and resulting final mechanical
properties, but traditional partial differential equation-based methods are
computationally expensive, creating bottlenecks in materials design and
manufacturing. In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework that
combines a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks with an Autoencoder to
efficiently predict grain growth evolution. Our approach captures both spatial
and temporal aspects of grain evolution while encoding high-dimensional grain
structure data into a compact latent space for pattern learning, enhanced by a
novel composite loss function combining Mean Squared Error, Structural
Similarity Index Measurement, and Boundary Preservation to maintain structural
integrity of grain boundary topology of the prediction. Results demonstrated
that our machine learning approach accelerates grain growth prediction by up to
\SI{89}{\times} faster, reducing computation time from \SI{10}{\minute} to
approximately \SI{10}{\second} while maintaining high-fidelity predictions. The
best model (S-30-30) achieving a structural similarity score of
\SI{86.71}{\percent} and mean grain size error of just \SI{0.07}{\percent}. All
models accurately captured grain boundary topology, morphology, and size
distributions. This approach enables rapid microstructural prediction for
applications where conventional simulations are prohibitively time-consuming,
potentially accelerating innovation in materials science and manufacturing.

The main difficulties in building a strong speaker identification system

investigated in this work. To raise the accuracy and dependability of these

Result: Att-ClassiGAN显著减少了重建时间，并在NMSE、SSIM和分类效果上优于现有先进方法。

Conclusion: Att-ClassiGAN通过注意力机制提升了CMI的性能，为图像重建和目标分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Computational microwave imaging (CMI) has gained attention as an alternative
technique for conventional microwave imaging techniques, addressing their
limitations such as hardware-intensive physical layer and slow data collection
acquisition speed to name a few. Despite these advantages, CMI still encounters
notable computational bottlenecks, especially during the image reconstruction
stage. In this setting, both image recovery and object classification present
significant processing demands. To address these challenges, our previous work
introduced ClassiGAN, which is a generative deep learning model designed to
simultaneously reconstruct images and classify targets using only
back-scattered signals. In this study, we build upon that framework by
incorporating attention gate modules into ClassiGAN. These modules are intended
to refine feature extraction and improve the identification of relevant
information. By dynamically focusing on important features and suppressing
irrelevant ones, the attention mechanism enhances the overall model
performance. The proposed architecture, named Att-ClassiGAN, significantly
reduces the reconstruction time compared to traditional CMI approaches.
Furthermore, it outperforms current advanced methods, delivering improved
Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), higher Structural Similarity Index
(SSIM), and better classification outcomes for the reconstructed targets.

Conclusion: 全自动化方法有望促进大规模睡眠研究，作者公开了代码并推出了隐私保护的睡眠分析平台SomnoBot。

Abstract: Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages)
and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable
large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater
incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle
detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating
multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully
automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep
staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can
replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The
automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based
study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between
bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously
took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis
differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases
between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually
performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle
detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the
potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public
access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and
introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.

Motivation: 偏头痛是一种常见但复杂的神经系统疾病，其与隐源性卒中的关系尚不明确，且缺乏临床指南来降低相关风险。

Method: 通过提取EHR数据中的概率独立源，构建因果图，并训练随机森林模型预测CS风险。

Result: 模型表现出良好准确性（ROC 0.771），识别出10个最具预测性的CS风险源，其中药物干预是最重要因素。

Conclusion: 药物干预是降低偏头痛患者CS风险的关键因素，同时发现过敏性鼻炎可能是CS的潜在诱因。

Abstract: Migraine is a common but complex neurological disorder that doubles the
lifetime risk of cryptogenic stroke (CS). However, this relationship remains
poorly characterized, and few clinical guidelines exist to reduce this
associated risk. We therefore propose a data-driven approach to extract
probabilistically-independent sources from electronic health record (EHR) data
and create a 10-year risk-predictive model for CS in migraine patients. These
sources represent external latent variables acting on the causal graph
constructed from the EHR data and approximate root causes of CS in our
population. A random forest model trained on patient expressions of these
sources demonstrated good accuracy (ROC 0.771) and identified the top 10 most
predictive sources of CS in migraine patients. These sources revealed that
pharmacologic interventions were the most important factor in minimizing CS
risk in our population and identified a factor related to allergic rhinitis as
a potential causative source of CS in migraine patients.

Abstract: Learning bimanual manipulation is challenging due to its high dimensionality
and tight coordination required between two arms. Eye-in-hand imitation
learning, which uses wrist-mounted cameras, simplifies perception by focusing
on task-relevant views. However, collecting diverse demonstrations remains
costly, motivating the need for scalable data augmentation. While prior work
has explored visual augmentation in single-arm settings, extending these
approaches to bimanual manipulation requires generating viewpoint-consistent
observations across both arms and producing corresponding action labels that
are both valid and feasible. In this work, we propose Diffusion for COordinated
Dual-arm Data Augmentation (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation
tailored to eye-in-hand bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion
model to synthesize novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both
arms while simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs
constrained optimization to ensure that augmented states involving
gripper-to-object contacts adhere to constraints suitable for bimanual
coordination. We evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our
results across 2250 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate
that it outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable
data augmentation in eye-in-hand bimanual manipulation. Our project website is

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has advanced significantly, offering benefits
such as system simplicity and stronger driving performance in both open-loop

frameworks still suffer from low success rates in closed-loop evaluations,
highlighting their limitations in real-world deployment. In this paper, we

enabling the safe and autonomous flight of a pocket-size, 30-gram platform
called Crazyflie 2.1 in a partially known environment. We propose a novel
AI-aided, vision-based reactive planning method for obstacle avoidance under
the ambit of Integrated Sensing, Computing and Communication paradigm. We deal
with the constraints of the nano-drone by splitting the navigation task into
two parts: a deep learning-based object detector runs on the edge (external
hardware) while the planning algorithm is executed onboard. The results show
the ability to command the drone at $\sim8$ frames-per-second and a model
performance reaching a COCO mean-average-precision of $60.8$. Field experiments
demonstrate the feasibility of the solution with the drone flying at a top
speed of $1$ m/s while steering away from an obstacle placed in an unknown
position and reaching the target destination. The outcome highlights the
compatibility of the communication delay and the model performance with the
requirements of the real-time navigation task. We provide a feasible
alternative to a fully onboard implementation that can be extended to
autonomous exploration with nano-drones.

Abstract: Training robots in simulation requires diverse 3D scenes that reflect the
specific challenges of downstream tasks. However, scenes that satisfy strict
task requirements, such as high-clutter environments with plausible spatial
arrangement, are rare and costly to curate manually. Instead, we generate
large-scale scene data using procedural models that approximate realistic
environments for robotic manipulation, and adapt it to task-specific goals. We
do this by training a unified diffusion-based generative model that predicts
which objects to place from a fixed asset library, along with their SE(3)
poses. This model serves as a flexible scene prior that can be adapted using
reinforcement learning-based post training, conditional generation, or
inference-time search, steering generation toward downstream objectives even
when they differ from the original data distribution. Our method enables
goal-directed scene synthesis that respects physical feasibility and scales
across scene types. We introduce a novel MCTS-based inference-time search
strategy for diffusion models, enforce feasibility via projection and
simulation, and release a dataset of over 44 million SE(3) scenes spanning five
diverse environments. Website with videos, code, data, and model weights:

*Taisuke Kobayashi*

Main category: cs.RO

TLDR: CubeDAgger通过改进EnsembleDAgger，提出三种改进方法以增强鲁棒性并减少动态稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互模仿学习算法通过专家-代理切换系统减少专家负担，但精确选择监督时机困难且切换导致动作突变，损害动态稳定性。

Method: 1. 添加正则化以明确激活监督时机阈值；2. 将专家-代理切换系统转换为多动作候选的最优共识系统；3. 引入自回归有色噪声使随机探索时间一致。

Result: 仿真验证表明，学习到的策略在交互中保持动态稳定性的同时具有足够鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CubeDAgger通过改进监督时机和动作生成机制，有效提升了交互模仿学习的鲁棒性和动态稳定性。

Abstract: Interactive imitation learning makes an agent's control policy robust by
stepwise supervisions from an expert. The recent algorithms mostly employ
expert-agent switching systems to reduce the expert's burden by limitedly
selecting the supervision timing. However, the precise selection is difficult
and such a switching causes abrupt changes in actions, damaging the dynamic
stability. This paper therefore proposes a novel method, so-called CubeDAgger,
which improves robustness while reducing dynamic stability violations by making
three improvements to a baseline method, EnsembleDAgger. The first improvement
adds a regularization to explicitly activate the threshold for deciding the
supervision timing. The second transforms the expert-agent switching system to
an optimal consensus system of multiple action candidates. Third,
autoregressive colored noise to the actions is introduced to make the
stochastic exploration consistent over time. These improvements are verified by
simulations, showing that the learned policies are sufficiently robust while
maintaining dynamic stability during interaction.

Main category: cs.RO

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为CLAM的连续潜在动作模型，通过无监督学习从无标签观察数据中学习潜在动作标签，显著提升了复杂机器人任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习需要大量昂贵的专家演示数据，限制了训练规模。利用无标签观察数据（如视频演示）学习潜在动作标签是一种有前景的解决方案。

Method: 设计了连续潜在动作模型（CLAM），采用连续潜在动作标签而非离散表示，并联合训练动作解码器以确保潜在动作空间易于通过少量标记示例映射到实际动作。

Result: 在DMControl（运动）和MetaWorld（操作）等连续控制基准测试中，CLAM显著优于现有方法，任务成功率提高了2-3倍。

Conclusion: CLAM无需专家数据即可学习高性能策略，为复杂机器人任务提供了一种高效的无监督学习方法。

Abstract: Learning robot policies using imitation learning requires collecting large
amounts of costly action-labeled expert demonstrations, which fundamentally
limits the scale of training data. A promising approach to address this
bottleneck is to harness the abundance of unlabeled observations-e.g., from
video demonstrations-to learn latent action labels in an unsupervised way.
However, we find that existing methods struggle when applied to complex robot
tasks requiring fine-grained motions. We design continuous latent action models
(CLAM) which incorporate two key ingredients we find necessary for learning to
solve complex continuous control tasks from unlabeled observation data: (a)
using continuous latent action labels instead of discrete representations, and
(b) jointly training an action decoder to ensure that the latent action space
can be easily grounded to real actions with relatively few labeled examples.
Importantly, the labeled examples can be collected from non-optimal play data,
enabling CLAM to learn performant policies without access to any action-labeled
expert data. We demonstrate on continuous control benchmarks in DMControl
(locomotion) and MetaWorld (manipulation), as well as on a real WidowX robot
arm that CLAM significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods,
remarkably with a 2-3x improvement in task success rate compared to the best
baseline. Videos and code can be found at clamrobot.github.io.

Method: 使用CARLA模拟器创建CNS数据集，提出TCR_sym度量方法，用于一致衡量结构变化。

Result: CNS数据集比现有真实世界基准包含更广泛的变化，且现有LiDAR PR方法在CNS上表现显著下降。

Conclusion: CNS数据集和TCR_sym方法为处理显著环境变化的PR算法提供了新基准。

Abstract: Large-scale construction and demolition significantly challenge long-term
place recognition (PR) by drastically reshaping urban and suburban
environments. Existing datasets predominantly reflect limited or indoor-focused
changes, failing to adequately represent extensive outdoor transformations. To
bridge this gap, we introduce the City that Never Settles (CNS) dataset, a
simulation-based dataset created using the CARLA simulator, capturing major
structural changes-such as building construction and demolition-across diverse
maps and sequences. Additionally, we propose TCR_sym, a symmetric version of
the original TCR metric, enabling consistent measurement of structural changes
irrespective of source-target ordering. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate
that CNS encompasses more extensive transformations than current real-world
benchmarks. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LiDAR-based PR methods on CNS
reveal substantial performance degradation, underscoring the need for robust
algorithms capable of handling significant environmental changes. Our dataset

TLDR: 提出了一种基于多目标强化学习（MORL）的自动驾驶方法，通过偏好驱动优化实现动态驾驶风格适应，无需重新训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶方法通常依赖预定义风格或持续用户反馈，难以支持动态、上下文相关的驾驶偏好。

Method: 使用MORL和偏好驱动的优化，将偏好编码为连续权重向量，调节可解释的风格目标（如效率、舒适性、速度和攻击性）。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中验证，代理能根据动态偏好调整驾驶行为，同时保持碰撞避免和路线完成性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效支持动态驾驶风格适应，提升用户信任和满意度。

Abstract: Human drivers exhibit individual preferences regarding driving style.
Adapting autonomous vehicles to these preferences is essential for user trust
and satisfaction. However, existing end-to-end driving approaches often rely on
predefined driving styles or require continuous user feedback for adaptation,
limiting their ability to support dynamic, context-dependent preferences. We
propose a novel approach using multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)
with preference-driven optimization for end-to-end autonomous driving that
enables runtime adaptation to driving style preferences. Preferences are
encoded as continuous weight vectors to modulate behavior along interpretable
style objectives$\unicode{x2013}$including efficiency, comfort, speed, and
aggressiveness$\unicode{x2013}$without requiring policy retraining. Our
single-policy agent integrates vision-based perception in complex mixed-traffic
scenarios and is evaluated in diverse urban environments using the CARLA
simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent dynamically adapts
its driving behavior according to changing preferences while maintaining
performance in terms of collision avoidance and route completion.

TLDR: SYMDEX是一个利用机器人双边对称性的强化学习框架，用于训练双手灵巧操作任务。


<details>

Motivation: 机器人应像人类一样利用双边对称性实现双手灵巧操作，但缺乏高效方法。

Conclusion: 对称性作为归纳偏置能提升样本效率、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Humans naturally exhibit bilateral symmetry in their gross manipulation
skills, effortlessly mirroring simple actions between left and right hands.
Bimanual robots-which also feature bilateral symmetry-should similarly exploit
this property to perform tasks with either hand. Unlike humans, who often favor
a dominant hand for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute
ambidextrous manipulation with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce
SYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity), a reinforcement learning framework for
ambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages the robot's inherent bilateral
symmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes complex bimanual manipulation
tasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated policies for each. By
exploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks, experience from
one arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill the
subtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the
hand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated
manipulation tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of
them. Our approach strongly outperforms baselines on complex task in which the
left and right hands perform different roles. We further demonstrate SYMDEX's
scalability by extending it to a four-arm manipulation setup, where our
symmetry-aware policies enable effective multi-arm collaboration and
coordination. Our results highlight how structural symmetry as inductive bias
in policy learning enhances sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization
across diverse dexterous manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱的复杂模式可能引入噪声、增加幻觉并提高计算成本，因此需要优化模式过滤方法。

Method: 研究比较了多种模式过滤方法对Text2Cypher任务的影响，包括对令牌长度、性能和成本的分析。

Result: 结果表明，模式过滤有效优化了Text2Cypher任务，尤其对小模型效果显著；大模型因上下文能力更强受益较少，但仍能降低成本。

Conclusion: 模式过滤在Text2Cypher任务中具有重要价值，尤其适合成本敏感场景。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent complex data using nodes, relationships, and
properties. Cypher, a powerful query language for graph databases, enables
efficient modeling and querying. Recent advancements in large language models
allow translation of natural language questions into Cypher queries -
Text2Cypher. A common approach is incorporating database schema into prompts.
However, complex schemas can introduce noise, increase hallucinations, and
raise computational costs. Schema filtering addresses these challenges by
including only relevant schema elements, improving query generation while
reducing token costs. This work explores various schema filtering methods for
Text2Cypher task and analyzes their impact on token length, performance, and
cost. Results show that schema filtering effectively optimizes Text2Cypher,
especially for smaller models. Consistent with prior research, we find that
larger models benefit less from schema filtering due to their longer context
capabilities. However, schema filtering remains valuable for both larger and
smaller models in cost reduction.

Method: 提出五种硬样本选择技术，用于修剪Text2Cypher数据集。

Result: 硬样本选择方法可将训练时间和成本减半，对性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 硬样本选择是一种成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Database query languages such as SQL for relational databases and Cypher for
graph databases have been widely adopted. Recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) enable natural language interactions with databases through
models like Text2SQL and Text2Cypher. Fine-tuning these models typically
requires large, diverse datasets containing non-trivial examples. However, as
dataset size increases, the cost of fine-tuning also rises. This makes smaller,
high-quality datasets essential for reducing costs for the same or better
performance. In this paper, we propose five hard-example selection techniques
for pruning the Text2Cypher dataset, aiming to preserve or improve performance
while reducing resource usage. Our results show that these hard-example
selection approaches can halve training time and costs with minimal impact on
performance, and demonstrates that hard-example selection provides a
cost-effective solution.

Motivation: 研究PINNs在解决实际物理系统重建问题时可能因参数化物理方程与真实现象不一致而导致的失败，并提出改进方法。

Method: 提出“显式约束力方法”（ECFM），通过控制约束引入的源项来优化重建结果。

Result: 在弹性和热传递问题中，ECFM方法显著提高了重建的可预测性和可定制性，尤其是在参数化物理不一致的情况下。

Conclusion: ECFM方法通过满足可解释性、鲁棒性和数据一致性的标准，为处理噪声数据和物理不一致问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: One use case of ``physics-informed neural networks'' (PINNs) is solution
reconstruction, which aims to estimate the full-field state of a physical
system from sparse measurements. Parameterized governing equations of the
system are used in tandem with the measurements to regularize the regression
problem. However, in real-world solution reconstruction problems, the
parameterized governing equation may be inconsistent with the physical
phenomena that give rise to the measurement data. We show that due to assuming
consistency between the true and parameterized physics, PINNs-based approaches
may fail to satisfy three basic criteria of interpretability, robustness, and
data consistency. As we argue, these criteria ensure that (i) the quality of
the reconstruction can be assessed, (ii) the reconstruction does not depend
strongly on the choice of physics loss, and (iii) that in certain situations,
the physics parameters can be uniquely recovered. In the context of elasticity
and heat transfer, we demonstrate how standard formulations of the physics loss
and techniques for constraining the solution to respect the measurement data
lead to different ``constraint forces" -- which we define as additional source
terms arising from the constraints -- and that these constraint forces can
significantly influence the reconstructed solution. To avoid the potentially
substantial influence of the choice of physics loss and method of constraint
enforcement on the reconstructed solution, we propose the ``explicit constraint
force method'' (ECFM) to gain control of the source term introduced by the
constraint. We then show that by satisfying the criteria of interpretability,
robustness, and data consistency, this approach leads to more predictable and
customizable reconstructions from noisy measurement data, even when the
parameterization of the missing physics is inconsistent with the measured
system.

TLDR: ICNN-enhanced 2SP利用输入凸神经网络（ICNNs）改进两阶段随机规划（2SP），通过线性规划（LP）替代混合整数规划（MIP），显著提升计算效率并保持解的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两阶段随机规划（2SP）在不确定性决策中应用广泛，但现有方法如Neur2SP依赖计算密集的MIP，导致可扩展性受限。

Method: 提出ICNN-enhanced 2SP，利用ICNNs的凸性特性，通过LP实现精确推理，避免MIP中的整数变量需求。

Result: 实验表明，ICNN-enhanced 2SP在训练时间稍长的情况下，验证精度与MIP方法相当，且在大规模问题中速度提升可达100倍。

Conclusion: ICNN-enhanced 2SP是一种高效且精确的替代方案，尤其适用于大规模凸2SP问题。

Abstract: Two-stage stochastic programming (2SP) offers a basic framework for modelling
decision-making under uncertainty, yet scalability remains a challenge due to
the computational complexity of recourse function evaluation. Existing
learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP)
employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on
computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We
propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks
(ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP
problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference
through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to
the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of
the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more
computationally efficient alternative that maintains solution quality.
Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer
training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their MIP-based
counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits
considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while
preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more
pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the
method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to
MIP-based formulations.

Abstract: This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using
evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and
decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use
layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of
these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in
more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained
models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and
scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a
population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one
autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators
transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided
pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance
proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where
constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in
randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by
expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform
randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning
according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and
schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.

Abstract: Data imputation is a critical step in data pre-processing, particularly for
datasets with missing or unreliable values. This study introduces a novel
quantum-inspired imputation framework evaluated on the UCI Diabetes dataset,
which contains biologically implausible missing values across several clinical
features. The method integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with
quantum-assisted rotations, optimized through gradient-free classical
optimizers -COBYLA, Simulated Annealing, and Differential Evolution to
reconstruct missing values while preserving statistical fidelity. Reconstructed
values are constrained within +/-2 standard deviations of original feature
distributions, avoiding unrealistic clustering around central tendencies. This
approach achieves a substantial and statistically significant improvement,
including an average reduction of over 85% in Wasserstein distance and
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-values between 0.18 and 0.22, compared to p-values >
0.99 in classical methods such as Mean, KNN, and MICE. The method also
eliminates zero-value artifacts and enhances the realism and variability of
imputed data. By combining quantum-inspired transformations with a scalable
classical framework, this methodology provides a robust solution for imputation
tasks in domains such as healthcare and AI pipelines, where data quality and
integrity are crucial.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers theoretical advantages over classical computing for
specific tasks, yet the boundary of practical quantum advantage remains an open
question. To investigate this boundary, it is crucial to understand whether,
and how, classical machines can learn and simulate quantum algorithms. Recent
progress in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong reasoning
abilities, prompting exploration into their potential for this challenge. In
this work, we introduce GroverGPT-2, an LLM-based method for simulating
Grover's algorithm using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and quantum-native
tokenization. Building on its predecessor, GroverGPT-2 performs simulation
directly from quantum circuit representations while producing logically
structured and interpretable outputs. Our results show that GroverGPT-2 can
learn and internalize quantum circuit logic through efficient processing of
quantum-native tokens, providing direct evidence that classical models like
LLMs can capture the structure of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, GroverGPT-2
outputs interleave circuit data with natural language, embedding explicit
reasoning into the simulation. This dual capability positions GroverGPT-2 as a
prototype for advancing machine understanding of quantum algorithms and
modeling quantum circuit logic. We also identify an empirical scaling law for
GroverGPT-2 with increasing qubit numbers, suggesting a path toward scalable
classical simulation. These findings open new directions for exploring the
limits of classical simulatability, enhancing quantum education and research,
and laying groundwork for future foundation models in quantum computing.

Abstract: This study explores quantum-enhanced discrete diffusion models to overcome
classical limitations in learning high-dimensional distributions. We rigorously
prove that classical discrete diffusion models, which calculate per-dimension
transition probabilities to avoid exponential computational cost, exhibit
worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data
dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through
diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces. By deriving
posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of
posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the
joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for
quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit
using temporal information for parameter sharing and learnable
classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution
learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise,
eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate
the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions
compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new
theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage
in joint distribution learning.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种量子算法，用于加速非对数凹分布下的采样动力学，包括Langevin动力学和副本交换Langevin扩散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非凸势能下，经典采样方法（如Langevin动力学）性能较差，需要新的量子方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过将目标Gibbs测度编码到量子态振幅中，利用Witten Laplacian算子的分解矩阵核，实现Gibbs采样。

Result: 首次证明了在非对数凹设置下量子算法相对于Poincaré常数的优势，并扩展至副本交换Langevin扩散。

Conclusion: 该量子算法为复杂能量景观下的采样提供了新的高效工具。

Abstract: Sampling from probability distributions of the form $\sigma \propto e^{-\beta
V}$, where $V$ is a continuous potential, is a fundamental task across physics,
chemistry, biology, computer science, and statistics. However, when $V$ is
non-convex, the resulting distribution becomes non-logconcave, and classical
methods such as Langevin dynamics often exhibit poor performance. We introduce
the first quantum algorithm that provably accelerates a broad class of
continuous-time sampling dynamics. For Langevin dynamics, our method encodes
the target Gibbs measure into the amplitudes of a quantum state, identified as
the kernel of a block matrix derived from a factorization of the Witten
Laplacian operator. This connection enables Gibbs sampling via singular value
thresholding and yields the first provable quantum advantage with respect to
the Poincar\'e constant in the non-logconcave setting. Building on this
framework, we further develop the first quantum algorithm that accelerates
replica exchange Langevin diffusion, a widely used method for sampling from
complex, rugged energy landscapes.

Conclusion: PNN-UNet通过模拟生物神经网络结构，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Our study presents PNN-UNet as a method for constructing deep neural networks
that replicate the planarian neural network (PNN) structure in the context of
3D medical image data. Planarians typically have a cerebral structure
comprising two neural cords, where the cerebrum acts as a coordinator, and the
neural cords serve slightly different purposes within the organism's
neurological system. Accordingly, PNN-UNet comprises a Deep-UNet and a
Wide-UNet as the nerve cords, with a densely connected autoencoder performing
the role of the brain. This distinct architecture offers advantages over both
monolithic (UNet) and modular networks (Ensemble-UNet). Our outcomes on a 3D
MRI hippocampus dataset, with and without data augmentation, demonstrate that
PNN-UNet outperforms the baseline UNet and several other UNet variants in image
segmentation.

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种直接在FPM测量数据上进行分类的方法，避免了高计算成本的重建步骤，使用CNN显著提高了分类性能，并通过学习多路复用减少了数据量和采集时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FPM技术虽然能实现高分辨率和大视场成像，但重建过程计算成本高，尤其是在大视场下。因此，研究直接在测量数据上分类的方法，以提高效率和实用性。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络（CNN）直接从FPM测量序列中提取信息进行分类，避免重建步骤；并学习多路复用技术以减少数据量和采集时间。

Result: CNN在测量序列上的分类性能显著优于单幅限带图像（提升达12%），且比高分辨率图像重建更高效；多路复用技术可在保持分类精度的同时减少数据量和采集时间。

Conclusion: 直接在FPM测量数据上分类的方法高效且实用，CNN和多路复用技术的结合为医学应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM)
enables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an
extremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical
applications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even
hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide
field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying
the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a
reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can
extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly
outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %)
while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a
high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing
of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy
while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time)
significantly.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a pivotal task within the realms of medical
image analysis and computer vision. While current methods have shown promise in
accurately segmenting major regions of interest, the precise segmentation of
boundary areas remains challenging. In this study, we propose a novel network
architecture named CTO, which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and explicit edge detection operators to
tackle this challenge. CTO surpasses existing methods in terms of segmentation
accuracy and strikes a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, without
the need for additional data inputs or label injections. Specifically, CTO
adheres to the canonical encoder-decoder network paradigm, with a dual-stream
encoder network comprising a mainstream CNN stream for capturing local features
and an auxiliary StitchViT stream for integrating long-range dependencies.
Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn boundary areas, we
introduce a boundary-guided decoder network that employs binary boundary masks
generated by dedicated edge detection operators to provide explicit guidance
during the decoding process. We validate the performance of CTO through
extensive experiments conducted on seven challenging medical image segmentation
datasets, namely ISIC 2016, PH2, ISIC 2018, CoNIC, LiTS17, and BTCV. Our
experimental results unequivocally demonstrate that CTO achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on these datasets while maintaining competitive model
complexity. The codes have been released at:

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to silicon and glass via
inspection, which combines hybrid field microscopy with photometric stereo.
Conventional optical microscopy techniques are generally limited to superficial
inspections and struggle to effectively visualize the internal structures of
silicon and glass vias. By utilizing various lighting conditions for 3D
reconstruction, the proposed method surpasses these limitations. By integrating
photometric stereo to the traditional optical microscopy, the proposed method
not only enhances the capability to detect micro-scale defects but also
provides a detailed visualization of depth and edge abnormality, which are
typically not visible with conventional optical microscopy inspection. The
experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method effectively captures
intricate surface details and internal structures. Quantitative comparisons
between the reconstructed models and actual measurements present the capability
of the proposed method to significantly improve silicon and glass via
inspection process. As a result, the proposed method achieves enhanced
cost-effectiveness while maintaining high accuracy and repeatability,
suggesting substantial advancements in silicon and glass via inspection

Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised, motion-resolved reconstruction framework
for high-resolution, free-breathing pulmonary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
utilizing a three-dimensional Gaussian representation (3DGS). The proposed
method leverages 3DGS to address the challenges of motion-resolved 3D isotropic
pulmonary MRI reconstruction by enabling data smoothing between voxels for
continuous spatial representation. Pulmonary MRI data acquisition is performed
using a golden-angle radial sampling trajectory, with respiratory motion
signals extracted from the center of k-space in each radial spoke. Based on the
estimated motion signal, the k-space data is sorted into multiple respiratory
phases. A 3DGS framework is then applied to reconstruct a reference image
volume from the first motion state. Subsequently, a patient-specific
convolutional neural network is trained to estimate the deformation vector
fields (DVFs), which are used to generate the remaining motion states through
spatial transformation of the reference volume. The proposed reconstruction
pipeline is evaluated on six datasets from six subjects and bench-marked
against three state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. The experimental
findings demonstrate that the proposed reconstruction framework effectively
reconstructs high-resolution, motion-resolved pulmonary MR images. Compared
with existing approaches, it achieves superior image quality, reflected by
higher signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio. The proposed
unsupervised 3DGS-based reconstruction method enables accurate motion-resolved
pulmonary MRI with isotropic spatial resolution. Its superior performance in
image quality metrics over state-of-the-art methods highlights its potential as
a robust solution for clinical pulmonary MR imaging.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
amyloid-beta plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, which serve as key
histopathological features. The identification and segmentation of these
lesions are crucial for understanding AD progression but remain challenging due
to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the impact of staining
variations on automated image analysis. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful
tool for pathology image segmentation; however, model performance is
significantly influenced by variations in staining characteristics,
necessitating effective stain normalization and enhancement techniques. In this
study, we address these challenges by introducing an open-source dataset
(ADNP-15) of neuritic plaques (i.e., amyloid deposits combined with a crown of
dystrophic tau-positive neurites) in human brain whole slide images. We
establish a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating five widely adopted deep
learning models across four stain normalization techniques, providing deeper
insights into their influence on neuritic plaque segmentation. Additionally, we
propose a novel image enhancement method that improves segmentation accuracy,
particularly in complex tissue structures, by enhancing structural details and
mitigating staining inconsistencies. Our experimental results demonstrate that
this enhancement strategy significantly boosts model generalization and
segmentation accuracy. All datasets and code are open-source, ensuring
transparency and reproducibility while enabling further advancements in the
field.

Result: 自然图像预训练的iBOT模型表现最佳（AUROC 0.80-0.97），优于领域特定模型（AUROC 0.78-0.96）和未预训练的基线ViT-L（AUROC 0.68-0.91）。

Conclusion: 自然图像预训练的模型在AMD识别中表现更优，挑战了领域内预训练的必要性假设，并发布了巴西的开放数据集BRAMD。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled Vision Transformers (ViTs) to
learn robust representations from large-scale natural image datasets, enhancing
their generalization across domains. In retinal imaging, foundation models
pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the
benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we
benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets
totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that
iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution
generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models,
which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining,
which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of
foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption
that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an
open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.

Conclusion: RepSNet通过宏观信息集成和结构优化，显著提升了核分割的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Pathological diagnosis is the gold standard for tumor diagnosis, and nucleus
instance segmentation is a key step in digital pathology analysis and
pathological diagnosis. However, the computational efficiency of the model and
the treatment of overlapping targets are the major challenges in the studies of
this problem. To this end, a neural network model RepSNet was designed based on
a nucleus boundary regression and a structural re-parameterization scheme for
segmenting and classifying the nuclei in H\&E-stained histopathological images.
First, RepSNet estimates the boundary position information (BPI) of the parent
nucleus for each pixel. The BPI estimation incorporates the local information
of the pixel and the contextual information of the parent nucleus. Then, the
nucleus boundary is estimated by aggregating the BPIs from a series of pixels
using a proposed boundary voting mechanism (BVM), and the instance segmentation
results are computed from the estimated nucleus boundary using a connected
component analysis procedure. The BVM intrinsically achieves a kind of
synergistic belief enhancement among the BPIs from various pixels. Therefore,
different from the methods available in literature that obtain nucleus
boundaries based on a direct pixel recognition scheme, RepSNet computes its
boundary decisions based on some guidances from macroscopic information using
an integration mechanism. In addition, RepSNet employs a re-parametrizable
encoder-decoder structure. This model can not only aggregate features from some
receptive fields with various scales which helps segmentation accuracy
improvement, but also reduce the parameter amount and computational burdens in
the model inference phase through the structural re-parameterization technique.
Extensive experiments demonstrated the superiorities of RepSNet compared to
several typical benchmark models.

Conclusion: MDAA-Diff通过解剖学指导和剂量适应机制，显著提升了低剂量PET图像的去噪效果。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images requires
administering high-dose radiotracers, which increases radiation exposure risks.
Generating standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) has become a
potential solution. However, previous studies have primarily focused on single
low-dose PET denoising, neglecting two critical factors: discrepancies in dose
response caused by inter-patient variability, and complementary anatomical
constraints derived from CT images. In this work, we propose a novel CT-Guided
Multi-dose Adaptive Attention Denoising Diffusion Model (MDAA-Diff) for
multi-dose PET denoising. Our approach integrates anatomical guidance and
dose-level adaptation to achieve superior denoising performance under low-dose
conditions. Specifically, this approach incorporates a CT-Guided High-frequency
Wavelet Attention (HWA) module, which uses wavelet transforms to separate
high-frequency anatomical boundary features from CT images. These extracted
features are then incorporated into PET imaging through an adaptive weighted
fusion mechanism to enhance edge details. Additionally, we propose the
Dose-Adaptive Attention (DAA) module, a dose-conditioned enhancement mechanism
that dynamically integrates dose levels into channel-spatial attention weight
calculation. Extensive experiments on 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI datasets
demonstrate that MDAA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in
preserving diagnostic quality under reduced-dose conditions. Our code is
publicly available.

Abstract: Early detection and accurate diagnosis are essential to improving patient
outcomes. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tumor detection
has shown promise, but existing models often suffer from overparameterization,
which limits their performance gains. In this study, fuzzy sigmoid convolution
(FSC) is introduced along with two additional modules: top-of-the-funnel and
middle-of-the-funnel. The proposed methodology significantly reduces the number
of trainable parameters without compromising classification accuracy. A novel
convolutional operator is central to this approach, effectively dilating the
receptive field while preserving input data integrity. This enables efficient
feature map reduction and enhances the model's tumor detection capability. In
the FSC-based model, fuzzy sigmoid activation functions are incorporated within
convolutional layers to improve feature extraction and classification. The
inclusion of fuzzy logic into the architecture improves its adaptability and
robustness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superior performance and efficiency of the proposed model. The FSC-based
architecture achieved classification accuracies of 99.17%, 99.75%, and 99.89%
on three different datasets. The model employs 100 times fewer parameters than
large-scale transfer learning architectures, highlighting its computational
efficiency and suitability for detecting brain tumors early. This research

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers today, but it can be
prevented through early detection of malignant polyps in the colon, primarily
via colonoscopies. While this method has saved many lives, human error remains
a significant challenge, as missing a polyp could have fatal consequences for
the patient. Deep learning (DL) polyp detectors offer a promising solution.
However, existing DL polyp detectors often mistake white light reflections from
the endoscope for polyps, which can lead to false positives.To address this
challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that
artificially adds more white light reflections to create harder training
scenarios. Specifically, we first generate a bank of artificial lights using
the training dataset. Then we find the regions of the training images that we
should not add these artificial lights on. Finally, we propose a sliding window
method to add the artificial light to the areas that fit of the training
images, resulting in augmented images. By providing the model with more
opportunities to make mistakes, we hypothesize that it will also have more
chances to learn from those mistakes, ultimately improving its performance in
polyp detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our new
data augmentation method.

Conclusion: SEVC通过空间嵌入和联合优化，显著提升了视频编码的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Most Neural Video Codecs (NVCs) only employ temporal references to generate
temporal-only contexts and latent prior. These temporal-only NVCs fail to
handle large motions or emerging objects due to limited contexts and misaligned
latent prior. To relieve the limitations, we propose a Spatially Embedded Video
Codec (SEVC), in which the low-resolution video is compressed for spatial
references. Firstly, our SEVC leverages both spatial and temporal references to
generate augmented motion vectors and hybrid spatial-temporal contexts.
Secondly, to address the misalignment issue in latent prior and enrich the
prior information, we introduce a spatial-guided latent prior augmented by
multiple temporal latent representations. At last, we design a joint
spatial-temporal optimization to learn quality-adaptive bit allocation for
spatial references, further boosting rate-distortion performance. Experimental
results show that our SEVC effectively alleviates the limitations in handling
large motions or emerging objects, and also reduces 11.9% more bitrate than the
previous state-of-the-art NVC while providing an additional low-resolution
bitstream. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/EsakaK/SEVC.

Abstract: Estimating a child's age from ocular biometric images is challenging due to
subtle physiological changes and the limited availability of longitudinal
datasets. Although most biometric age estimation studies have focused on facial
features and adult subjects, pediatric-specific analysis, particularly of the
iris and periocular regions, remains relatively unexplored. This study presents
a comparative evaluation of iris and periocular images for estimating the ages
of children aged between 4 and 16 years. We utilized a longitudinal dataset
comprising more than 21,000 near-infrared (NIR) images, collected from 288
pediatric subjects over eight years using two different imaging sensors. A
multi-task deep learning framework was employed to jointly perform age
prediction and age-group classification, enabling a systematic exploration of
how different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, particularly
those adapted for non-square ocular inputs, capture the complex variability
inherent in pediatric eye images. The results show that periocular models
consistently outperform iris-based models, achieving a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 1.33 years and an age-group classification accuracy of 83.82%. These
results mark the first demonstration that reliable age estimation is feasible
from children's ocular images, enabling privacy-preserving age checks in
child-centric applications. This work establishes the first longitudinal
benchmark for pediatric ocular age estimation, providing a foundation for
designing robust, child-focused biometric systems. The developed models proved
resilient across different imaging sensors, confirming their potential for
real-world deployment. They also achieved inference speeds of less than 10
milliseconds per image on resource-constrained VR headsets, demonstrating their
suitability for real-time applications.

### [281] [Generalization Analysis for Contrastive Representation Learning under Non-IID Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04937)
*Nong Minh Hieu,Antoine Ledent*

Main category: stat.ML

TLDR: 本文研究了对比表示学习（CRL）在非独立同分布（非i.i.d.）设置下的泛化行为，填补了理论空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CRL的泛化理论仅基于i.i.d.假设，而实际应用中数据常被重复使用，导致该假设不成立。本文旨在更贴近实际地分析CRL的泛化性能。

Result: 泛化边界表明，每类所需样本数与可学习特征表示类的覆盖数的对数成正比。

Conclusion: 本文为非i.i.d.数据下的CRL提供了理论支持，扩展了其应用场景。

Abstract: Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) has achieved impressive success in
various domains in recent years. Nevertheless, the theoretical understanding of
the generalization behavior of CRL is limited. Moreover, to the best of our
knowledge, the current literature only analyzes generalization bounds under the
assumption that the data tuples used for contrastive learning are independently
and identically distributed. However, in practice, we are often limited to a
fixed pool of reusable labeled data points, making it inevitable to recycle
data across tuples to create sufficiently large datasets. Therefore, the
tuple-wise independence condition imposed by previous works is invalidated. In
this paper, we provide a generalization analysis for the CRL framework under
non-$i.i.d.$ settings that adheres to practice more realistically. Drawing
inspiration from the literature on U-statistics, we derive generalization
bounds which indicate the required number of samples in each class scales as
the logarithm of the covering number of the class of learnable feature
representations associated to each class. Next, we apply our main results to
derive excess risk bounds for common function classes such as linear maps and
neural networks.

Abstract: The identification of a linear system model from data has wide applications
in control theory. The existing work that provides finite sample guarantees for
linear system identification typically uses data from a single long system
trajectory under i.i.d. random inputs, and assumes that the underlying dynamics
is truly linear. In contrast, we consider the problem of identifying a
linearized model when the true underlying dynamics is nonlinear, given that
there is a certain constraint on the region where one can initialize the
experiments. We provide a multiple trajectories-based deterministic data
acquisition algorithm followed by a regularized least squares algorithm, and
provide a finite sample error bound on the learned linearized dynamics. Our
error bound shows that one can consistently learn the linearized dynamics, and
demonstrates a trade-off between the error due to nonlinearity and the error
due to noise. We validate our results through numerical experiments, where we
also show the potential insufficiency of linear system identification using a
single trajectory with i.i.d. random inputs, when nonlinearity does exist.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful tool for constructing prediction intervals
for black-box models, providing a finite sample coverage guarantee for
exchangeable data. However, this exchangeability is compromised when some
entries of the test feature are contaminated, such as in the case of cellwise
outliers. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel framework called
detect-then-impute conformal prediction. This framework first employs an
outlier detection procedure on the test feature and then utilizes an imputation
method to fill in those cells identified as outliers. To quantify the
uncertainty in the processed test feature, we adaptively apply the detection
and imputation procedures to the calibration set, thereby constructing
exchangeable features for the conformal prediction interval of the test label.
We develop two practical algorithms, PDI-CP and JDI-CP, and provide a
distribution-free coverage analysis under some commonly used detection and
imputation procedures. Notably, JDI-CP achieves a finite sample $1-2\alpha$
coverage guarantee. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that our proposed algorithms exhibit robust coverage properties and
comparable efficiency to the oracle baseline.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, raises
a key question: how can synthetic data from these models enhance predictive
modeling? While they can generate vast amounts of datasets, only a subset
meaningfully improves performance. We propose a novel end-to-end framework that
generates and systematically filters synthetic data through domain-specific
statistical methods, selectively integrating high-quality samples for effective
augmentation. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in predictive
performance across various settings, highlighting the potential of our
framework while underscoring the inherent limitations of generative models for
data augmentation. Despite the ability to produce large volumes of synthetic
data, the proportion that effectively improves model performance is limited.

Abstract: The surge in digitized text data requires reliable inferential methods on
observed textual patterns. This article proposes a novel two-sample text test
for comparing similarity between two groups of documents. The hypothesis is
whether the probabilistic mapping generating the textual data is identical
across two groups of documents. The proposed test aims to assess text
similarity by comparing the entropy of the documents. Entropy is estimated
using neural network-based language models. The test statistic is derived from
an estimation-and-inference framework, where the entropy is first approximated
using an estimation set, followed by inference on the remaining data set. We
showed theoretically that under mild conditions, the test statistic
asymptotically follows a normal distribution. A multiple data-splitting
strategy is proposed to enhance test power, which combines p-values into a
unified decision. Various simulation studies and a real data example
demonstrated that the proposed two-sample text test maintains the nominal Type
one error rate while offering greater power compared to existing methods. The
proposed method provides a novel solution to assert differences in document
classes, particularly in fields where large-scale textual information is
crucial.

Result: 发现基于联合分布的拒绝方法（Bhattacharyya差异）比传统Chow规则（KL差异）更温和。

Conclusion: 联合理想分布为拒绝学习提供了新视角，Bhattacharyya差异的阈值化是一种更温和的拒绝策略。

Abstract: Learning to reject provide a learning paradigm which allows for our models to
abstain from making predictions. One way to learn the rejector is to learn an
ideal marginal distribution (w.r.t. the input domain) - which characterizes a
hypothetical best marginal distribution - and compares it to the true marginal
distribution via a density ratio. In this paper, we consider learning a joint
ideal distribution over both inputs and labels; and develop a link between
rejection and thresholding different statistical divergences. We further find
that when one considers a variant of the log-loss, the rejector obtained by
considering the joint ideal distribution corresponds to the thresholding of the
skewed Bhattacharyya divergence between class-probabilities. This is in
contrast to the marginal case - that is equivalent to a typical
characterization of optimal rejection, Chow's Rule - which corresponds to a
thresholding of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In general, we find that
rejecting via a Bhattacharyya divergence is less aggressive than Chow's Rule.

Abstract: Option pricing often requires solving partial differential equations (PDEs).
Although deep learning-based PDE solvers have recently emerged as quick
solutions to this problem, their empirical and quantitative accuracy remain not
well understood, hindering their real-world applicability. In this research,
our aim is to offer actionable insights into the utility of deep PDE solvers
for practical option pricing implementation. Through comparative experiments in
both the Black--Scholes and the Heston model, we assess the empirical
performance of two neural network algorithms to solve PDEs: the Deep Galerkin
Method and the Time Deep Gradient Flow method (TDGF). We determine their
empirical convergence rates and training time as functions of (i) the number of
sampling stages, (ii) the number of samples, (iii) the number of layers, and
(iv) the number of nodes per layer. For the TDGF, we also consider the order of
the discretization scheme and the number of time steps.

Abstract: Global Fr\'echet functional regression has been recently addressed from time
correlated bivariate curve data evaluated in a manifold (see Torres et al.
2025). For this type of curve data sets, the present paper solves the problem
of local linear approximation of the Fr\'echet conditional mean in an extrinsic
and intrinsic way. The extrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression
predictor is obtained in the time varying tangent space by projection into an
orthornormal basis of the ambient Hilbert space. The conditions assumed ensure
the existence and uniqueness of this predictor, and its computation via
exponential and logarithmic maps. A weighted Fr\'echet mean approach is adopted
in the computation of an intrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression
predictor. The asymptotic optimality of this intrinsic local approximation is
also proved. The performance of the empirical version of both, extrinsic and
intrinsic functional predictors, and of a Nadaraya-Watson type Fr\'echet curve
predictor is illustrated in the simulation study undertaken. The finite-sample
size properties are also tested in a real-data application via
cross-validation. Specifically, functional prediction of the magnetic vector
field from the time-varying geocentric latitude and longitude of the satellite
NASA's MAGSAT spacecraft is addressed.

Abstract: Rotational symmetry plays a central role in physics, providing an elegant
framework to describe how the properties of 3D objects -- from atoms to the
macroscopic scale -- transform under the action of rigid rotations. Equivariant
models of 3D point clouds are able to approximate structure-property relations
in a way that is fully consistent with the structure of the rotation group, by
combining intermediate representations that are themselves spherical tensors.
The symmetry constraints however make this approach computationally demanding
and cumbersome to implement, which motivates increasingly popular unconstrained
architectures that learn approximate symmetries as part of the training
process. In this work, we explore a third route to tackle this learning
problem, where equivariant functions are expressed as the product of a scalar
function of the point cloud coordinates and a small basis of tensors with the
appropriate symmetry. We also propose approximations of the general expressions
that, while lacking universal approximation properties, are fast, simple to
implement, and accurate in practical settings.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in many

particularly how different layers and activation channels contribute to class
separability. We introduce ChannelExplorer, an interactive visual analytics
tool for analyzing image-based outputs across model layers, emphasizing
data-driven insights over architecture analysis for exploring class

visualizes them using three primary coordinated views: a Scatterplot View to
reveal inter- and intra-class confusion, a Jaccard Similarity View to quantify
activation overlap, and a Heatmap View to inspect activation channel patterns.
Our technique supports diverse model architectures, including CNNs, GANs,
ResNet and Stable Diffusion models. We demonstrate the capabilities of
ChannelExplorer through four use-case scenarios: (1) generating class hierarchy
in ImageNet, (2) finding mislabeled images, (3) identifying activation channel
contributions, and(4) locating latent states' position in Stable Diffusion
model. Finally, we evaluate the tool with expert users.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems, which require the simultaneous
optimization of multiple terms, are prevalent across numerous applications.
Existing multi-objective optimization methods often rely on manually tuned
aggregation functions to formulate a joint optimization target. The performance
of such hand-tuned methods is heavily dependent on careful weight selection, a
time-consuming and laborious process. These limitations also arise in the
setting of reinforcement-learning-based motion tracking for physically
simulated characters, where intricately crafted reward functions are typically
used to achieve high-fidelity results. Such solutions not only require domain
expertise and significant manual adjustment, but also limit the applicability
of the resulting reward function across diverse skills. To bridge this gap, we
present a novel adversarial multi-objective optimization technique that is
broadly applicable to a range of multi-objective optimization problems,
including motion tracking. The proposed adversarial differential discriminator
receives a single positive sample, yet is still effective at guiding the
optimization process. We demonstrate that our technique can enable characters
to closely replicate a variety of acrobatic and agile behaviors, achieving
comparable quality to state-of-the-art motion-tracking methods, without relying
on manually tuned reward functions. Results are best visualized through

Abstract: We present WIR3D, a technique for abstracting 3D shapes through a sparse set
of visually meaningful curves in 3D. We optimize the parameters of Bezier
curves such that they faithfully represent both the geometry and salient visual
features (e.g. texture) of the shape from arbitrary viewpoints. We leverage the
intermediate activations of a pre-trained foundation model (CLIP) to guide our
optimization process. We divide our optimization into two phases: one for
capturing the coarse geometry of the shape, and the other for representing
fine-grained features. Our second phase supervision is spatially guided by a
novel localized keypoint loss. This spatial guidance enables user control over
abstracted features. We ensure fidelity to the original surface through a
neural SDF loss, which allows the curves to be used as intuitive deformation
handles. We successfully apply our method for shape abstraction over a broad
dataset of shapes with varying complexity, geometric structure, and texture,
and demonstrate downstream applications for feature control and shape
deformation.

Abstract: Full-body gestures play a pivotal role in natural interactions and are
crucial for achieving effective communication. Nevertheless, most existing
studies primarily focus on the gesture generation of speakers, overlooking the
vital role of listeners in the interaction process and failing to fully explore
the dynamic interaction between them. This paper innovatively proposes an
Inter-Diffusion Generation Model of Speakers and Listeners for Effective
Communication. For the first time, we integrate the full-body gestures of
listeners into the generation framework. By devising a novel inter-diffusion
mechanism, this model can accurately capture the complex interaction patterns
between speakers and listeners during communication. In the model construction
process, based on the advanced diffusion model architecture, we innovatively
introduce interaction conditions and the GAN model to increase the denoising
step size. As a result, when generating gesture sequences, the model can not
only dynamically generate based on the speaker's speech information but also
respond in realtime to the listener's feedback, enabling synergistic
interaction between the two. Abundant experimental results demonstrate that
compared with the current state-of-the-art gesture generation methods, the
model we proposed has achieved remarkable improvements in the naturalness,
coherence, and speech-gesture synchronization of the generated gestures. In the
subjective evaluation experiments, users highly praised the generated
interaction scenarios, believing that they are closer to real life human
communication situations. Objective index evaluations also show that our model
outperforms the baseline methods in multiple key indicators, providing more
powerful support for effective communication.

Abstract: We present a method to reconstruct dynamic scenes from monocular
continuous-wave time-of-flight (C-ToF) cameras using raw sensor samples that
achieves similar or better accuracy than neural volumetric approaches and is
100x faster. Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a
single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF
radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly
measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and
underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based
scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with
multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its
optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to
improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians. Experimental

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an active contour model for silhouette
vectorization using cubic B\'ezier curves. Among the end points of the B\'ezier
curves, we distinguish between corner and regular points where the orientation
of the tangent vector is prescribed. By minimizing the distance of the B\'ezier
curves to the silhouette boundary, the active contour model optimizes the
location of the B\'ezier curves end points, the orientation of the tangent
vectors in the regular points, and the estimation of the B\'ezier curve
parameters. This active contour model can use the silhouette vectorization
obtained by any method as an initial guess. The proposed method significantly
reduces the average distance between the silhouette boundary and its
vectorization obtained by the world-class graphic software Inkscape, Adobe
Illustrator, and a curvature-based vectorization method, which we introduce for
comparison. Our method also allows us to impose additional regularity on the
B\'ezier curves by reducing their lengths.

TLDR: Walrus是一个新型去中心化存储系统，通过RedStuff协议和多重技术创新，解决了存储开销、恢复效率和安全性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化存储系统在复制开销、恢复效率和安全性之间存在矛盾，Walrus旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: Walrus采用RedStuff二维擦除编码协议，支持异步网络存储挑战，并引入多阶段纪元变更协议处理节点变动。

Result: 实验表明，Walrus在保持高性能的同时，仅需4.5倍复制因子，且恢复带宽仅与丢失数据量成正比。

Conclusion: Walrus适用于需要高完整性、可用性且开销合理的去中心化应用。

Abstract: Decentralized storage systems face a fundamental trade-off between
replication overhead, recovery efficiency, and security guarantees. Current
approaches either rely on full replication, incurring substantial storage
costs, or employ trivial erasure coding schemes that struggle with efficient
recovery especially under high storage-node churn. We present Walrus, a novel
decentralized blob storage system that addresses these limitations through
multiple technical innovations. At the core of Walrus is RedStuff, a
two-dimensional erasure coding protocol that achieves high security with only
4.5x replication factor, while enabling self-healing recovery that requires
bandwidth proportional to only the lost data $(O(|blob|/n)$ versus $O(|blob|)$
in traditional systems). Crucially, RedStuff is the first protocol to support
storage challenges in asynchronous networks, preventing adversaries from
exploiting network delays to pass verification without actually storing data.
Walrus also introduces a novel multi-stage epoch change protocol that
efficiently handles storage node churn while maintaining uninterrupted
availability during committee transitions. Our system incorporates
authenticated data structures to defend against malicious clients and ensures
data consistency throughout storage and retrieval processes. Experimental
evaluation demonstrates that Walrus achieves practical performance at scale,
making it suitable for a wide range of decentralized applications requiring
high-integrity, available blob storage with reasonable overhead.

TLDR: 论文探讨了基于生成模型的推荐系统（Gen-RecSys）的评估挑战，提出了新的风险分类和综合评价方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型推荐系统在提供丰富用户体验的同时，也引入了新的风险，传统评估指标无法全面衡量这些挑战。

Method: 将评估挑战分为两类：现有问题的加剧和全新风险，并提出包含多指标的综合评估框架。

Result: 提出了一个全面的评估方法，涵盖相关性、事实基础、偏见检测和政策合规性。

Conclusion: 为研究人员和实践者提供了一个框架，以确保Gen-RecSys的有效个性化和负责任部署。

Abstract: Recommender systems powered by generative models (Gen-RecSys) extend beyond
classical item ranking by producing open-ended content, which simultaneously
unlocks richer user experiences and introduces new risks. On one hand, these
systems can enhance personalization and appeal through dynamic explanations and
multi-turn dialogues. On the other hand, they might venture into unknown
territory-hallucinating nonexistent items, amplifying bias, or leaking private
information. Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these
challenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or
alignment with user intent.
  This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation
challenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are
exacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new
risks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we
propose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments
and multi-metric checks-incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias
detection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so
researchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring
effective personalization and responsible deployment.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种生成自定义QBD搜索数据集的方法QBD-RankedDatagen，并比较了多种方法在成本、速度和与领域专家交互方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有QBD搜索方法中领域特定数据集创建成本高、耗时的问题。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）结合领域专家输入生成文档评分和排名，并优化BM25模型参数。

Result: 在TREC的QBD数据集上评估，显著减少了人工工作量并保留了足够的专家知识。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能高效生成定制领域数据集，优化检索模型性能。

Abstract: The Query-By-Document (QBD) problem is an information retrieval problem where
the query is a document, and the retrieved candidates are documents that match
the query document, often in a domain or query specific manner. This can be
crucial for tasks such as patent matching, legal or compliance case retrieval,
and academic literature review. Existing retrieval methods, including keyword
search and document embeddings, can be optimized with domain-specific datasets
to improve QBD search performance. However, creating these domain-specific
datasets is often costly and time-consuming. Our work introduces a process to
generate custom QBD-search datasets and compares a set of methods to use in
this problem, which we refer to as QBD-RankedDatagen. We provide a comparative
analysis of our proposed methods in terms of cost, speed, and the human
interface with the domain experts. The methods we compare leverage Large
Language Models (LLMs) which can incorporate domain expert input to produce
document scores and rankings, as well as explanations for human review. The
process and methods for it that we present can significantly reduce human
effort in dataset creation for custom domains while still obtaining sufficient
expert knowledge for tuning retrieval models. We evaluate our methods on QBD
datasets from the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and finetune the parameters
of the BM25 model -- which is used in many industrial-strength search engines
like OpenSearch -- using the generated data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献数量激增导致发现利用率低、重复工作和跨学科合作受限，需要高效工具辅助科学家处理信息。

Method: HiPerRAG结合Oreo（多模态文档解析模型）和ColTrast（查询感知编码器微调算法），利用对比学习和延迟交互技术优化检索。

Result: 在SciQ和PubMedQA基准测试中分别达到90%和76%的准确率，优于领域专用模型和商业LLM。

Conclusion: HiPerRAG通过高性能计算实现大规模科学知识整合，促进跨学科创新。

Abstract: The volume of scientific literature is growing exponentially, leading to
underutilized discoveries, duplicated efforts, and limited cross-disciplinary
collaboration. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a way to assist
scientists by improving the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
processing this influx of information. However, scaling RAG to handle millions
of articles introduces significant challenges, including the high computational
costs associated with parsing documents and embedding scientific knowledge, as
well as the algorithmic complexity of aligning these representations with the
nuanced semantics of scientific content. To address these issues, we introduce
HiPerRAG, a RAG workflow powered by high performance computing (HPC) to index
and retrieve knowledge from more than 3.6 million scientific articles. At its
core are Oreo, a high-throughput model for multimodal document parsing, and
ColTrast, a query-aware encoder fine-tuning algorithm that enhances retrieval
accuracy by using contrastive learning and late-interaction techniques.
HiPerRAG delivers robust performance on existing scientific question answering
benchmarks and two new benchmarks introduced in this work, achieving 90%
accuracy on SciQ and 76% on PubMedQA-outperforming both domain-specific models
like PubMedGPT and commercial LLMs such as GPT-4. Scaling to thousands of GPUs
on the Polaris, Sunspot, and Frontier supercomputers, HiPerRAG delivers million
document-scale RAG workflows for unifying scientific knowledge and fostering
interdisciplinary innovation.

*Mingruo Yuan,Ben Kao,Tien-Hsuan Wu*

Main category: cs.IR

TLDR: QBR方法通过问题库（QB）缩小法律知识检索中的技术鸿沟，提升检索的准确性、效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于法律知识的专业性和公众对其理解的不足，传统检索方法难以满足需求。

Method: 利用问题库（QB）生成训练样本，优化文档中知识单元的嵌入，实现细粒度知识检索。

Result: 实验表明QBR在准确性、效率和可解释性上优于传统方法，并能帮助公众解决日常法律问题。

Conclusion: QBR通过问题库有效提升法律知识检索的实用性和社会影响力。

Abstract: Retrieval of legal knowledge by the general public is a challenging problem
due to the technicality of the professional knowledge and the lack of
fundamental understanding by laypersons on the subject. Traditional information
retrieval techniques assume that users are capable of formulating succinct and
precise queries for effective document retrieval. In practice, however, the
wide gap between the highly technical contents and untrained users makes legal
knowledge retrieval very difficult. We propose a methodology, called QBR, which
employs a Questions Bank (QB) as an effective medium for bridging the knowledge
gap. We show how the QB is used to derive training samples to enhance the
embedding of knowledge units within documents, which leads to effective
fine-grained knowledge retrieval. We discuss and evaluate through experiments
various advantages of QBR over traditional methods. These include more
accurate, efficient, and explainable document retrieval, better comprehension
of retrieval results, and highly effective fine-grained knowledge retrieval. We
also present some case studies and show that QBR achieves social impact by
assisting citizens to resolve everyday legal concerns.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种结合传统推荐模型和LLM的混合框架，用于重排推荐结果，但实验表明LLM在重排和缓解位置偏差方面效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在推荐系统中的局限性，如上下文窗口限制、位置偏差问题，以及其在列表排序中的低效性。

Method: 提出混合框架，结合传统推荐模型和LLM，通过结构化提示对前k项进行重排，并评估用户历史重排序和指令提示的效果。

Result: 实验显示随机化用户历史可提升排序质量，但LLM重排未超越基础模型，且指令提示对缓解位置偏差无效。

Conclusion: LLM在建模排序上下文和缓解偏差方面存在局限性，需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for delivering personalized content across
digital platforms by modeling user preferences and behaviors. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to
their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training.
However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window
size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling
listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to
position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless
of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a
hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM
for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of
user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias.
Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves
ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model.
Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our
evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and
mitigate bias. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/aminul7506/LLMForReRanking.
