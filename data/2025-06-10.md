### [1] [TimeWak: Temporal Chained-Hashing Watermark for Time Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06407)
*Zhi Wen Soi,Chaoyi Zhu,Fouad Abiad,Aditya Shankar,Jeroen M. Galjaard,Huijuan Wang,Lydia Y. Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: TimeWak是一种针对多元时间序列扩散模型的水印算法，直接在真实时间-特征空间中嵌入水印，解决了现有方法在异构特征和时间依赖性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法基于同质潜在空间，而先进的时间序列生成器在真实空间操作，导致水印嵌入不兼容。TimeWak旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TimeWak通过时间链式哈希直接在真实时间-特征空间中嵌入水印，并采用ε-精确反转处理扩散过程的反转误差。

Result: TimeWak在数据质量、水印可检测性和鲁棒性上显著优于基线，提升了61.96%的context-FID分数和8.44%的相关性分数。

Conclusion: TimeWak是首个适用于多元时间序列扩散模型的水印算法，解决了真实空间水印嵌入的挑战，同时保持高检测性和数据质量。

Abstract: Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing
privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records. Key
criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to
verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent
spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in real space,
making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of
watermarking directly in real space while handling feature heterogeneity and
temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for
multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and
spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark
directly within the real temporal-feature space. The other unique feature is
the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction
error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to
detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time
series and further maintain high watermark detectability. We extensively
evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark
detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against 5
datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that
TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in
correlational scores against the state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining
consistently detectable.

### [2] [HeavyWater and SimplexWater: Watermarking Low-Entropy Text Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06409)
*Dor Tsur,Carol Xuan Long,Claudio Mayrink Verdun,Hsiang Hsu,Chen-Fu Chen,Haim Permuter,Sajani Vithana,Flavio P. Calmon*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种优化框架，设计了两种新水印（HeavyWater和SimplexWater），在低熵任务中高效平衡检测准确性和文本失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM水印在低熵任务（如代码生成）中的挑战，优化随机侧信息的使用以提高检测率并减少文本失真。

Method: 提出优化框架，设计两种可调水印（HeavyWater和SimplexWater），通过基准测试验证性能。

Result: 新水印在低熵任务中实现高检测准确性和低文本失真，并揭示了与编码理论的新联系。

Conclusion: HeavyWater和SimplexWater为LLM水印提供了高效解决方案，适用于各种LLM且不依赖特定侧信息生成方法。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text
provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI
systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions
output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random
side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens.
LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks -
such as coding - where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this
paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is
to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to
maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of
generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks:
HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully
trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be
applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine
the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks,
demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with
minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy
regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections
between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be
found in https://github.com/DorTsur/HeavyWater_SimplexWater

### [3] [Benchmarking Misuse Mitigation Against Covert Adversaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06414)
*Davis Brown,Mahdi Sabbaghi,Luze Sun,Alexander Robey,George J. Pappas,Eric Wong,Hamed Hassani*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种针对语言模型安全性的新攻击方式——分解攻击，并通过开发BSD基准测试工具评估防御措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全评估主要关注明显攻击和低风险任务，但攻击者可通过多次看似无害的查询组合完成危险任务，需要新的防御方法。

Method: 开发了BSD（Benchmarks for Stateful Defenses）数据生成管道，用于自动化评估隐蔽攻击及防御措施，并创建了两个新数据集。

Result: 分解攻击能有效促成滥用，而状态化防御是有效的应对措施。前沿模型能拒绝这些攻击，但较弱模型难以应对。

Conclusion: 分解攻击是一种隐蔽且有效的滥用手段，状态化防御是应对此类攻击的关键方向。

Abstract: Existing language model safety evaluations focus on overt attacks and
low-stakes tasks. Realistic attackers can subvert current safeguards by
requesting help on small, benign-seeming tasks across many independent queries.
Because individual queries do not appear harmful, the attack is hard to
{detect}. However, when combined, these fragments uplift misuse by helping the
attacker complete hard and dangerous tasks. Toward identifying defenses against
such strategies, we develop Benchmarks for Stateful Defenses (BSD), a data
generation pipeline that automates evaluations of covert attacks and
corresponding defenses. Using this pipeline, we curate two new datasets that
are consistently refused by frontier models and are too difficult for weaker
open-weight models. Our evaluations indicate that decomposition attacks are
effective misuse enablers, and highlight stateful defenses as a countermeasure.

### [4] [A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518)
*Neil Fendley,Edward W. Staley,Joshua Carney,William Redman,Marie Chau,Nathan Drenkow*

Main category: cs.CR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着预训练LLM的普及，其安全风险（如中毒攻击）引起关注。现有框架和术语源自分类中毒文献，不完全适用于生成式LLM。

Method: 系统回顾已发表的LLM中毒攻击文献，提出包含四种攻击规范和六种度量指标的威胁模型。

Result: 通过四个关键维度（概念毒药、隐蔽毒药、持久毒药和特定任务毒药）组织讨论，明确了当前安全风险格局。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为LLM中毒攻击提供了更清晰的分类和评估方法，有助于理解和管理相关安全风险。

Abstract: With the widespread availability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
and their training datasets, concerns about the security risks associated with
their usage has increased significantly. One of these security risks is the
threat of LLM poisoning attacks where an attacker modifies some part of the LLM
training process to cause the LLM to behave in a malicious way. As an emerging
area of research, the current frameworks and terminology for LLM poisoning
attacks are derived from earlier classification poisoning literature and are
not fully equipped for generative LLM settings. We conduct a systematic review
of published LLM poisoning attacks to clarify the security implications and
address inconsistencies in terminology across the literature. We propose a
comprehensive poisoning threat model applicable to categorize a wide range of
LLM poisoning attacks. The poisoning threat model includes four poisoning
attack specifications that define the logistics and manipulation strategies of
an attack as well as six poisoning metrics used to measure key characteristics
of an attack. Under our proposed framework, we organize our discussion of
published LLM poisoning literature along four critical dimensions of LLM
poisoning attacks: concept poisons, stealthy poisons, persistent poisons, and
poisons for unique tasks, to better understand the current landscape of
security risks.

### [5] [Breaking the Gaussian Barrier: Residual-PAC Privacy for Automatic Privatization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06530)
*Tao Zhang,Yevgeniy Vorobeychik*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的隐私保护框架Residual PAC Privacy，通过f-散度量化隐私剩余，并引入Stackelberg Residual-PAC机制，优化噪声分布，提高隐私预算利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PAC Privacy算法依赖高斯互信息上界，过于保守且效率低，需改进以适应更广泛的数据分布。

Method: 提出Residual PAC Privacy（基于f-散度）和Stackelberg Residual-PAC机制，通过凸双层优化选择最优噪声分布。

Result: SR-PAC在保证目标隐私预算的同时，显著提升了统计效率和实用性。

Conclusion: Residual PAC Privacy和SR-PAC机制为复杂数据驱动系统提供了更高效的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: The Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Privacy framework [1] provides a
powerful instance-based methodology for certifying privacy in complex
data-driven systems. However, existing PAC Privacy algorithms rely on a
Gaussian mutual information upper bound. We show that this is in general too
conservative: the upper bound obtained by these algorithms is tight if and only
if the perturbed mechanism output is jointly Gaussian with independent Gaussian
noise. To address the inefficiency inherent in the Gaussian-based approach, we
introduce Residual PAC Privacy, an f-divergence-based measure that quantifies
the privacy remaining after adversarial inference. When instantiated with
Kullback-Leibler divergence, Residual-PAC Privacy is governed by conditional
entropy. Moreover, we propose Stackelberg Residual-PAC (SR-PAC) privatization
mechanisms for RPAC Privacy, a game-theoretic framework that selects optimal
noise distributions through convex bilevel optimization. Our approach achieves
tight privacy budget utilization for arbitrary data distributions. Moreover, it
naturally composes under repeated mechanisms and provides provable privacy
guarantees with higher statistical efficiency. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that SR-PAC certifies the target privacy budget while consistently
improving utility compared to existing methods.

*Emilia Rivas,Sabrina Saika,Ahtesham Bakht,Aritran Piplai,Nathaniel D. Bastian,Ankit Shah*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种对抗性学习框架，通过红蓝双代理的持续对抗，提升网络入侵检测系统（NIDS）对未知攻击的适应性。实验表明，蓝代理仅需少量样本即可显著提升检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统签名式入侵检测方法难以应对不断演变的攻击模式，需要一种动态适应机制来提升NIDS的长期有效性。

Method: 设计红蓝双代理对抗环境：红代理通过扰动数据包规避检测，蓝代理利用漂移适应技术学习新防御策略。两者迭代适应。

Result: 实验显示，蓝代理仅需2-3次适应步骤和25-30个样本，即可将模型准确率提升30%。

Conclusion: 该框架为漂移适应技术提供了实用见解，显著提升了NIDS对未知攻击的检测能力。

Abstract: Evolving attacks are a critical challenge for the long-term success of
Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). The rise of these changing patterns
has exposed the limitations of traditional network security methods. While
signature-based methods are used to detect different types of attacks, they
often fail to detect unknown attacks. Moreover, the system requires frequent
updates with new signatures as the attackers are constantly changing their
tactics. In this paper, we design an environment where two agents improve their
policies over time. The adversarial agent, referred to as the red agent,
perturbs packets to evade the intrusion detection mechanism, whereas the blue
agent learns new defensive policies using drift adaptation techniques to
counter the attacks. Both agents adapt iteratively: the red agent responds to
the evolving NIDS, while the blue agent adjusts to emerging attack patterns. By
studying the model's learned policy, we offer concrete insights into drift
adaptation techniques with high utility. Experiments show that the blue agent
boosts model accuracy by 30% with just 2 to 3 adaptation steps using only 25 to
30 samples each.

### [8] [Cyber Security of Sensor Systems for State Sequence Estimation: an AI Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06572)
*Xubin Fang,Rick S. Blum,Ramesh Bharadwaj,Brian M. Sadler*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文开发了首个能准确识别/消除传感器数据攻击的方法，适用于序列估计/回归算法，无需假设传感器数据的统计模型形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器系统易受攻击且后果严重，但相关研究不足，亟需有效方法对抗传感器数据攻击。

Method: 提出两种方法：简单保护方法（针对不了解保护细节的攻击者）和额外处理方法（针对了解保护系统的攻击者）。

Result: 实验显示，简单方法性能接近已知攻击传感器的理想方法；额外处理方法能显著降低最坏情况下的性能退化。

Conclusion: 数学分析和实验表明，该方法能有效保护数据驱动和机器学习算法，且仅使用未受攻击的训练数据。

Abstract: Sensor systems are extremely popular today and vulnerable to sensor data
attacks. Due to possible devastating consequences, counteracting sensor data
attacks is an extremely important topic, which has not seen sufficient study.
This paper develops the first methods that accurately identify/eliminate only
the problematic attacked sensor data presented to a sequence
estimation/regression algorithm under a powerful attack model constructed based
on known/observed attacks. The approach does not assume a known form for the
statistical model of the sensor data, allowing data-driven and machine learning
sequence estimation/regression algorithms to be protected. A simple protection
approach for attackers not endowed with knowledge of the details of our
protection approach is first developed, followed by additional processing for
attacks based on protection system knowledge. In the cases tested for which it
was designed, experimental results show that the simple approach achieves
performance indistinguishable, to two decimal places, from that for an approach
which knows which sensors are attacked. For cases where the attacker has
knowledge of the protection approach, experimental results indicate the
additional processing can be configured so that the worst-case degradation
under the additional processing and a large number of sensors attacked can be
made significantly smaller than the worst-case degradation of the simple
approach, and close to an approach which knows which sensors are attacked, for
the same number of attacked sensors with just a slight degradation under no
attacks. Mathematical descriptions of the worst-case attacks are used to
demonstrate the additional processing will provide similar advantages for cases
for which we do not have numerical results. All the data-driven processing used
in our approaches employ only unattacked training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上训练的AI模型面临侧信道攻击的威胁，需要一种无需额外硬件或软件修改的防御方案。

Method: 在推理过程中引入随机化和可互换的模型配置。

Result: 实验表明侧信道泄漏减少，t分数增长放缓，模型准确率仅下降约1%。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于现有Edge TPU，是唯一无需额外修改的解决方案。

Abstract: The confidentiality of trained AI models on edge devices is at risk from
side-channel attacks exploiting power and electromagnetic emissions. This paper
proposes a novel training methodology to enhance resilience against such
threats by introducing randomized and interchangeable model configurations
during inference. Experimental results on Google Coral Edge TPU show a
reduction in side-channel leakage and a slower increase in t-scores over 20,000
traces, demonstrating robustness against adversarial observations. The defense
maintains high accuracy, with about 1% degradation in most configurations, and
requires no additional hardware or software changes, making it the only
applicable solution for existing Edge TPUs.

### [10] [Scoring the Unscorables: Cyber Risk Assessment Beyond Internet Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06604)
*Armin Sarabi,Manish Karir,Mingyan Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种利用新型数据类型（技术数字签名）进行网络风险量化的方法，通过爬取组织网站获取公开可用的技术签名，构建高精度的网络风险评估模型。该方法克服了传统基于IP扫描数据的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于IP扫描的网络风险评估方法存在数据不完整或缺失的问题，尤其对中小型企业（SMEs）不适用。技术数字签名数据更易获取且覆盖范围广，因此探索其与网络安全态势的关系具有实际意义。

Method: 通过爬取组织网站获取技术数字签名数据，构建网络风险评估模型，并与不同网络事件数据集进行交叉验证。

Result: 研究发现技术签名与组织的网络安全态势密切相关，模型在交叉验证中表现良好，并揭示了勒索软件攻击受害者与其他网络事件受害者的关键差异。

Conclusion: 技术数字签名是一种有效且可行的网络风险评估数据源，尤其适用于中小型企业，为网络风险管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper we present a study on using novel data types to perform cyber
risk quantification by estimating the likelihood of a data breach. We
demonstrate that it is feasible to build a highly accurate cyber risk
assessment model using public and readily available technology signatures
obtained from crawling an organization's website. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous similar approaches that relied on large-scale IP
address based scanning data, which suffers from incomplete/missing IP address
mappings as well as the lack of such data for large numbers of small and
medium-sized organizations (SMEs). In comparison to scan data, technology
digital signature data is more readily available for millions of SMEs. Our
study shows that there is a strong relationship between these technology
signatures and an organization's cybersecurity posture. In cross-validating our
model using different cyber incident datasets, we also highlight the key
differences between ransomware attack victims and the larger population of
cyber incident and data breach victims.

*Ayan Roy,Jeetkumar Patel,Rik Chakraborti,Shudip Datta*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出TrustConnect框架，用于评估车载网络中组件的可信度，以防止错误信息传播导致严重后果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代车辆通过远程通信服务与外部环境交互，但虚假信息可能破坏车辆性能，甚至引发灾难性后果。

Method: TrustConnect框架通过评估组件的信任级别、依赖关系、值相关性及远程注入漏洞，确定网络可靠性。

Result: 通过Python的Networkx包生成随机车载网络图进行模拟，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: TrustConnect能有效评估车载网络的可信度，防止错误信息传播。

Abstract: Modern vehicles are equipped with numerous in-vehicle components that
interact with the external environment through remote communications and
services, such as Bluetooth and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. These
components form a network, exchanging information to ensure the proper
functioning of the vehicle. However, the presence of false or fabricated
information can disrupt the vehicle's performance. Given that these components
are interconnected, erroneous data can propagate throughout the network,
potentially affecting other components and leading to catastrophic
consequences. To address this issue, we propose TrustConnect, a framework
designed to assess the trustworthiness of a vehicle's in-vehicle network by
evaluating the trust levels of individual components under various network
configurations. The proposed framework leverages the interdependency of all the
vehicle's components, along with the correlation of their values and their
vulnerability to remote injection based on the outside exposure of each
component, to determine the reliability of the in-vehicle network. The
effectiveness of the proposed framework has been validated through programming
simulations conducted across various scenarios using a random distribution of
an in-vehicle network graph generated with the Networkx package in Python.

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架在分散环境中检测率超过98%，精确率超过97%。

Conclusion: 该框架为EVSE安全提供了可扩展且隐私保护的解决方案，有效应对高级网络威胁。

Abstract: The rapid global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has established electric
vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) as a critical component of smart grid
infrastructure. While essential for ensuring reliable energy delivery and
accessibility, EVSE systems face significant cybersecurity challenges,
including network reconnaissance, backdoor intrusions, and distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These emerging threats, driven by the
interconnected and autonomous nature of EVSE, require innovative and adaptive
security mechanisms that go beyond traditional intrusion detection systems
(IDS). Existing approaches, whether network-based or host-based, often fail to
detect sophisticated and targeted attacks specifically crafted to exploit new
vulnerabilities in EVSE infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel intrusion
detection framework that leverages multimodal data sources, including network
traffic and kernel events, to identify complex attack patterns. The framework
employs a distributed learning approach, enabling collaborative intelligence
across EVSE stations while preserving data privacy through federated learning.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing solutions, achieving a detection rate above 98% and a precision rate
exceeding 97% in decentralized environments. This solution addresses the
evolving challenges of EVSE security, offering a scalable and privacypreserving
response to advanced cyber threats

Abstract: Smart contracts, integral to blockchain ecosystems, enable decentralized
applications to execute predefined operations without intermediaries. Their
ability to enforce trustless interactions has made them a core component of
platforms such as Ethereum. Vulnerabilities such as numerical overflows,
reentrancy attacks, and improper access permissions have led to the loss of
millions of dollars throughout the blockchain and smart contract sector.
Traditional smart contract auditing techniques such as manual code reviews and
formal verification face limitations in scalability, automation, and
adaptability to evolving development patterns. As a result, AI-based solutions
have emerged as a promising alternative, offering the ability to learn complex
patterns, detect subtle flaws, and provide scalable security assurances. This
paper examines novel AI-driven techniques for vulnerability detection in smart
contracts, focusing on machine learning, deep learning, graph neural networks,
and transformer-based models. This paper analyzes how each technique represents
code, processes semantic information, and responds to real world vulnerability
classes. We also compare their strengths and weaknesses in terms of accuracy,
interpretability, computational overhead, and real time applicability. Lastly,
it highlights open challenges and future opportunities for advancing this
domain.

### [14] [LADSG: Label-Anonymized Distillation and Similar Gradient Substitution for Label Privacy in Vertical Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06742)
*Zeyu Yan,Yifei Yao,Xuanbing Wen,Juli Zhang,Kai Fan*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为LADSG的统一防御框架，用于应对垂直联邦学习中的标签推断攻击，通过梯度替换、标签匿名化和异常检测来保护数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂直联邦学习中的数据隐私问题日益突出，尤其是标签推断攻击的威胁，现有防御方法无法应对混合攻击。

Method: 提出LADSG框架，结合梯度替换、标签匿名化和异常检测，以统一方式防御梯度泄露和标签泄露。

Result: 在六个真实数据集上的实验表明，LADSG将标签推断攻击成功率降低了30-60%，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: LADSG是一种轻量级且高效的防御框架，能够有效保护垂直联邦学习中的数据隐私。

Abstract: Vertical federated learning (VFL) has become a key paradigm for collaborative
machine learning, enabling multiple parties to train models over distributed
feature spaces while preserving data privacy. Despite security protocols that
defend against external attacks - such as gradient masking and encryption,
which prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data - recent label inference
attacks from within the system have emerged. These attacks exploit gradients
and semantic embeddings to reconstruct private labels, bypassing traditional
defenses. For example, the passive label inference attack can reconstruct tens
of thousands of participants' private data using just 40 auxiliary labels,
posing a significant security threat. Existing defenses address single leakage
pathways, such as gradient leakage or label exposure. As attack strategies
evolve, their limitations become clear, especially against hybrid attacks that
combine multiple vectors. To address this, we propose Label-Anonymized Defense
with Substitution Gradient (LADSG), a unified defense framework that integrates
gradient substitution, label anonymization, and anomaly detection. LADSG
mitigates both gradient and label leakage while maintaining the scalability and
efficiency of VFL. Experiments on six real-world datasets show that LADSG
reduces label inference attack success rates by 30-60%, with minimal
computational overhead, underscoring the importance of lightweight defenses in
securing VFL.

Motivation: API提供商可能秘密提供量化或微调的模型变体，影响性能和安全性，用户缺乏透明度和检测手段。

Method: 采用基于秩的均匀性测试，避免可检测的查询模式，对抗恶意提供商。

Result: 在量化、有害微调、越狱提示和完整模型替换等威胁场景下，该方法表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效验证黑盒LLM的行为一致性，具有高统计功效和查询效率。

Abstract: As API access becomes a primary interface to large language models (LLMs),
users often interact with black-box systems that offer little transparency into
the deployed model. To reduce costs or maliciously alter model behaviors, API
providers may discreetly serve quantized or fine-tuned variants, which can
degrade performance and compromise safety. Detecting such substitutions is
difficult, as users lack access to model weights and, in most cases, even
output logits. To tackle this problem, we propose a rank-based uniformity test
that can verify the behavioral equality of a black-box LLM to a locally
deployed authentic model. Our method is accurate, query-efficient, and avoids
detectable query patterns, making it robust to adversarial providers that
reroute or mix responses upon the detection of testing attempts. We evaluate
the approach across diverse threat scenarios, including quantization, harmful
fine-tuning, jailbreak prompts, and full model substitution, showing that it
consistently achieves superior statistical power over prior methods under
constrained query budgets.

TLDR: ModelForge是一个自动化工具，利用NLP和GenAI将自然语言协议规范翻译为CPSA的正式表示，简化了形式化方法的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形式化方法在验证安全协议时面临将自然语言规范转化为正式表示的复杂性，阻碍了其采用。

Method: 通过NLP和GenAI技术，ModelForge自动生成CPSA协议定义，并基于LLM进行微调以优化性能。

Result: ModelForge在语法准确性上表现优异，但在处理某些协议细节时仍需改进。

Conclusion: ModelForge的架构和概念验证为简化形式化方法在安全协议开发中的应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Formal methods can be used for verifying security protocols, but their
adoption can be hindered by the complexity of translating natural language
protocol specifications into formal representations. In this paper, we
introduce ModelForge, a novel tool that automates the translation of protocol
specifications for the Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer (CPSA). By
leveraging advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI
(GenAI), ModelForge processes protocol specifications and generates a CPSA
protocol definition. This approach reduces the manual effort required, making
formal analysis more accessible. We evaluate ModelForge by fine-tuning a large
language model (LLM) to generate protocol definitions for CPSA, comparing its
performance with other popular LLMs. The results from our evaluation show that
ModelForge consistently produces quality outputs, excelling in syntactic
accuracy, though some refinement is needed to handle certain protocol details.
The contributions of this work include the architecture and proof of concept
for a translating tool designed to simplify the adoption of formal methods in
the development of security protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在数学和推理任务中表现出色，但其推理能力的增强和内部推理过程的暴露引入了新的安全漏洞，尤其是当推理与有害性紧密关联时。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的模型也存在显著安全漏洞，并分析了不同模型、有害指令类型和输出模式。

Conclusion: 研究为大型推理模型的安全性提供了重要见解，揭示了其安全性与推理能力之间的权衡。

Abstract: Emerging Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) consistently excel in mathematical and
reasoning tasks, showcasing exceptional capabilities. However, the enhancement
of reasoning abilities and the exposure of their internal reasoning processes
introduce new safety vulnerabilities. One intriguing concern is: when reasoning
is strongly entangled with harmfulness, what safety-reasoning trade-off do LRMs
exhibit? To address this issue, we introduce HauntAttack, a novel and
general-purpose black-box attack framework that systematically embeds harmful
instructions into reasoning questions. Specifically, we treat reasoning
questions as carriers and substitute one of their original conditions with a
harmful instruction. This process creates a reasoning pathway in which the
model is guided step by step toward generating unsafe outputs. Based on
HauntAttack, we conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple LRMs. Our results
reveal that even the most advanced LRMs exhibit significant safety
vulnerabilities. Additionally, we perform a detailed analysis of different
models, various types of harmful instructions, and model output patterns,
providing valuable insights into the security of LRMs.

TLDR: Arm CCA扩展为三区模型，支持进程内轻量级隔离域，防止内核空间攻击，性能开销低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Arm CCA仅隔离整个CVM，无法应对进程内攻击（如Heartbleed）。

Method: 提出三区模型，支持进程内无限轻量级隔离域，并引入快速用户级CPI机制防止域切换滥用。

Result: 原型验证了对抗进程内和内核空间攻击的能力，性能开销约20%，保留95%吞吐量。

Conclusion: NanoZone在细粒度隔离下性能优异，适用于服务器应用、内存键值保护和数据隔离。

Abstract: Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA) currently isolates at the
granularity of an entire Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM), leaving intra-VM
bugs such as Heartbleed unmitigated. The state-of-the-art narrows this to the
process level, yet still cannot stop attacks that pivot within the same
process, and prior intra-enclave schemes are either too slow or incompatible
with CVM-style isolation. We extend CCA with a three-tier zone model that
spawns an unlimited number of lightweight isolation domains inside a single
process, while shielding them from kernel-space adversaries. To block
domain-switch abuse, we also add a fast user-level Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI)
mechanism. We developed two prototypes: a functional version on Arm's official
simulator to validate resistance against intra-process and kernel-space
adversaries, and a performance variant on Arm development boards evaluated for
session-key isolation within server applications, in-memory key-value
protection, and non-volatile-memory data isolation. NanoZone incurs roughly a
20% performance overhead while retaining 95% throughput compared to the system
without fine-grained isolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私（DP）在多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的应用存在计算开销大和模型性能下降的挑战，需要一种高效的方法来平衡隐私与性能。

Method: 提出Dual-Priv Pruning框架，包括视觉令牌剪枝（减少输入维度）和梯度更新剪枝（选择性修剪噪声梯度）。

Result: 实验显示该方法在性能退化最小的情况下表现优异，内存效率优于标准DP-SGD，并在H20 GPU上领先。

Conclusion: Dual-Priv Pruning是首个探索MLLMs中DP微调的方法，有效解决了隐私与性能的权衡问题。

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) is a widely adopted technique, valued for its
effectiveness in protecting the privacy of task-specific datasets, making it a
critical tool for large language models. However, its effectiveness in
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains uncertain. Applying
Differential Privacy (DP) inherently introduces substantial computation
overhead, a concern particularly relevant for MLLMs which process extensive
textual and visual data. Furthermore, a critical challenge of DP is that the
injected noise, necessary for privacy, scales with parameter dimensionality,
leading to pronounced model degradation; This trade-off between privacy and
utility complicates the application of Differential Privacy (DP) to complex
architectures like MLLMs. To address these, we propose Dual-Priv Pruning, a
framework that employs two complementary pruning mechanisms for DP fine-tuning
in MLLMs: (i) visual token pruning to reduce input dimensionality by removing
redundant visual information, and (ii) gradient-update pruning during the DP
optimization process. This second mechanism selectively prunes parameter
updates based on the magnitude of noisy gradients, aiming to mitigate noise
impact and improve utility. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
competitive results with minimal performance degradation. In terms of
computational efficiency, our approach consistently utilizes less memory than
standard DP-SGD. While requiring only 1.74% more memory than zeroth-order
methods which suffer from severe performance issues on A100 GPUs, our method
demonstrates leading memory efficiency on H20 GPUs. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to explore DP fine-tuning in MLLMs. Our code is
coming soon.

Result: 评估了四种流行代理，展示了九种攻击载荷，成功率80%-100%。

Conclusion: 提出了全面的缓解策略，包括监督机制和执行约束，为安全开发提供方向。

Abstract: Web-use agents are rapidly being deployed to automate complex web tasks,
operating with extensive browser capabilities including multi-tab navigation,
DOM manipulation, JavaScript execution and authenticated session access.
However, these powerful capabilities create a critical and previously
unexplored attack surface. This paper demonstrates how attackers can exploit
web-use agents' high-privilege capabilities by embedding malicious content in
web pages such as comments, reviews, or advertisements that agents encounter
during legitimate browsing tasks. In addition, we introduce the task-aligned
injection technique that frame malicious commands as helpful task guidance
rather than obvious attacks. This technique exploiting fundamental limitations
in LLMs' contextual reasoning: agents struggle in maintaining coherent
contextual awareness and fail to detect when seemingly helpful web content
contains steering attempts that deviate from their original task goal. Through
systematic evaluation of four popular agents (OpenAI Operator, Browser Use, Do
Browser, OpenOperator), we demonstrate nine payload types that compromise
confidentiality, integrity, and availability, including unauthorized camera
activation, user impersonation, local file exfiltration, password leakage, and
denial of service, with validation across multiple LLMs achieving success rates
of 80%-100%. These payloads succeed across agents with built-in safety
mechanisms, requiring only the ability to post content on public websites,
creating unprecedented risks given the ease of exploitation combined with
agents' high-privilege access. To address this attack, we propose comprehensive
mitigation strategies including oversight mechanisms, execution constraints,
and task-aware reasoning techniques, providing practical directions for secure
development and deployment.

Method: 开发模拟框架，支持可配置DRAM地址映射，重现现有缓解技术并评估其效果与性能开销。

Result: 框架能有效评估缓解能力和性能开销，适应不同DRAM地址映射。

Conclusion: 模拟框架为跨硬件配置的Inter-VM RowHammer缓解技术评估提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Inter-VM RowHammer is an attack that induces a bitflip beyond the boundaries
of virtual machines (VMs) to compromise a VM from another, and some
software-based techniques have been proposed to mitigate this attack.
Evaluating these mitigation techniques requires to confirm that they actually
mitigate inter-VM RowHammer in low overhead. A challenge in this evaluation
process is that both the mitigation ability and the overhead depend on the
underlying hardware whose DRAM address mappings are different from machine to
machine. This makes comprehensive evaluation prohibitively costly or even
implausible as no machine that has a specific DRAM address mapping might be
available. To tackle this challenge, we propose a simulation-based framework to
evaluate software-based inter-VM RowHammer mitigation techniques across
configurable DRAM address mappings. We demonstrate how to reproduce existing
mitigation techniques on our framework, and show that it can evaluate the
mitigation abilities and performance overhead of them with configurable DRAM
address mappings.

Motivation: 缓存时序攻击对现代系统构成严重威胁，但分析缓存结构的漏洞具有挑战性。现有的基于强化学习的方法因无用动作导致效率低下。

Method: 提出一种在训练中识别并惩罚无用动作的方法，以提高探索效率。

Result: 在17种缓存结构上实验显示，无用动作减少43.08%，训练时间减少28%（基准）和4.84%（几何平均）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了基于强化学习的缓存时序攻击漏洞探索效率。

Abstract: Cache-timing attacks exploit microarchitectural characteristics to leak
sensitive data, posing a severe threat to modern systems. Despite its severity,
analyzing the vulnerability of a given cache structure against cache-timing
attacks is challenging. To this end, a method based on Reinforcement Learning
(RL) has been proposed to automatically explore vulnerabilities for a given
cache structure. However, a naive RL-based approach suffers from inefficiencies
due to the agent performing actions that do not contribute to the exploration.
In this paper, we propose a method to identify these useless actions during
training and penalize them so that the agent avoids them and the exploration
efficiency is improved. Experiments on 17 cache structures show that our
training mechanism reduces the number of useless actions by up to 43.08%. This
resulted in the reduction of training time by 28\% in the base case and 4.84\%
in the geomean compared to a naive RL-based approach.

Motivation: 研究现代CPU中分支预测资源共享缺乏隔离和清理方法，可能导致跨软件上下文的安全漏洞。

Method: 分析BPU的基本组件，研究Bias-Free Branch Prediction和Branch History Speculation对分支历史缓冲区（BHB）更新的影响。

Result: 发现这些BPU特性可能引发恶意误预测，提出三种攻击原语（Spectre-BSE、Spectre-BHS和BiasScope），并展示漏洞利用。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了新的跨权限攻击面，提出了Chimera攻击演示器，展示了内核内存泄露能力。

Abstract: Modern out-of-order CPUs heavily rely on speculative execution for
performance optimization, with branch prediction serving as a cornerstone to
minimize stalls and maximize efficiency. Whenever shared branch prediction
resources lack proper isolation and sanitization methods, they may originate
security vulnerabilities that expose sensitive data across different software
contexts.
  This paper examines the fundamental components of modern Branch Prediction
Units (BPUs) and investigates how resource sharing and contention affect two
widely implemented but underdocumented features: Bias-Free Branch Prediction
and Branch History Speculation. Our analysis demonstrates that these BPU
features, while designed to enhance speculative execution efficiency through
more accurate branch histories, can also introduce significant security risks.
We show that these features can inadvertently modify the Branch History Buffer
(BHB) update behavior and create new primitives that trigger malicious
mis-speculations.
  This discovery exposes previously unknown cross-privilege attack surfaces for
Branch History Injection (BHI). Based on these findings, we present three novel
attack primitives: two Spectre attacks, namely Spectre-BSE and Spectre-BHS, and
a cross-privilege control flow side-channel attack called BiasScope. Our
research identifies corresponding patterns of vulnerable control flows and
demonstrates exploitation on multiple processors. Finally, Chimera is
presented: an attack demonstrator based on eBPF for a variant of Spectre-BHS
that is capable of leaking kernel memory contents at 24,628 bit/s.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread success in code generation
tasks for different scenarios, both everyday and professional. However current
LLMs, despite producing functional code, do not prioritize security and may
generate code with exploitable vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose
techniques for generating code that is more likely to be secure and introduce
SCGAgent, a proactive secure coding agent that implements our techniques. We
use security coding guidelines that articulate safe programming practices,
combined with LLM-generated unit tests to preserve functional correctness. In
our evaluation, we find that SCGAgent is able to preserve nearly 98% of the
functionality of the base Sonnet-3.7 LLM while achieving an approximately 25%
improvement in security. Moreover, SCGAgent is able to match or best the
performance of sophisticated reasoning LLMs using a non-reasoning model and an

Result: CBiGAN在多种数据集上表现优异，AUC值高，能有效区分良性和恶意文件。

Conclusion: 该方法在恶意软件检测中具有鲁棒性和高准确性，适用于多样化的恶意文件检测。

Abstract: Static analysis, a cornerstone technique in cybersecurity, offers a
noninvasive method for detecting malware by analyzing dormant software without
executing potentially harmful code. However, traditional static analysis often
relies on biased or outdated datasets, leading to gaps in detection
capabilities against emerging malware threats. To address this, our study
focuses on the binary content of files as key features for malware detection.
These binary contents are transformed and represented as images, which then
serve as inputs to deep learning models. This method takes into account the
visual patterns within the binary data, allowing the model to analyze potential
malware effectively. This paper introduces the application of the CBiGAN in the
domain of malware anomaly detection. Our approach leverages the CBiGAN for its
superior latent space mapping capabilities, critical for modeling complex
malware patterns by utilizing a reconstruction error-based anomaly detection
method. We utilized several datasets including both portable executable (PE)
files as well as Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) files. We then evaluated
our model against a diverse set of both PE and OLE files, including
self-collected malicious executables from 214 malware families. Our findings
demonstrate the robustness of this innovative approach, with the CBiGAN
achieving high Area Under the Curve (AUC) results with good generalizability,
thereby confirming its capability to distinguish between benign and diverse
malicious files with reasonably high accuracy.

<details>

Motivation: 无人机群网络的开放无线环境、动态拓扑和资源限制使其容易受到DoS攻击，传统静态或集中式防御机制无法应对这些动态分布式场景。

Method: 设计了三种轻量级协调的MTD机制（领导者切换、路由变异和频率跳变），并将防御问题建模为多智能体部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP），采用基于策略梯度的FMADRL算法进行分布式学习。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法显著优于现有基线，攻击缓解率提升34.6%，平均恢复时间减少94.6%，能耗和防御成本分别降低29.3%和98.3%。

Conclusion: 提出的FMADRL-MTD框架在多种DoS攻击策略下保持了强大的任务连续性，为无人机群网络提供了高效且低成本的防御解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms has enabled a wide
range of mission-critical applications, but also exposes UAV networks to severe
Denial-of-Service (DoS) threats due to their open wireless environment, dynamic
topology, and resource constraints. Traditional static or centralized defense
mechanisms are often inadequate for such dynamic and distributed scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework
for proactive and adaptive DoS mitigation in UAV swarm networks. Specifically,
we design three lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader
switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, that leverage the inherent
flexibility of UAV swarms to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network
resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the distributed,
resource-constrained, and uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV
is equipped with a local policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions
based on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy
gradient-based FMADRL algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their defense
policies via reward-weighted aggregation, enabling distributed learning without
sharing raw data and thus reducing communication overhead. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack
mitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and
decreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%,
respectively, while maintaining robust mission continuity under various DoS
attack strategies.

Result: 评估显示隐性危害在开源和黑盒LLMs中普遍存在，表明其现实风险亟需关注。

Conclusion: 呼吁扩展LLM安全性评估和校准，超越传统越狱攻击范式，以应对隐性危害。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, raising concerns about their security. While jailbreak attacks
highlight failures under overtly harmful queries, they overlook a critical
risk: incorrectly answering harmless-looking inputs can be dangerous and cause
real-world harm (Implicit Harm). We systematically reformulate the LLM risk
landscape through a structured quadrant perspective based on output factuality
and input harmlessness, uncovering an overlooked high-risk region. To
investigate this gap, we propose JailFlipBench, a benchmark aims to capture
implicit harm, spanning single-modal, multimodal, and factual extension
scenarios with diverse evaluation metrics. We further develop initial JailFlip
attack methodologies and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple
open-source and black-box LLMs, show that implicit harm present immediate and
urgent real-world risks, calling for broader LLM safety assessments and
alignment beyond conventional jailbreak paradigms.

Conclusion: CAW为水印嵌入提供了一种高效且质量友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in watermarking techniques have enabled the embedding of
secret messages into AI-generated text (AIGT), serving as an important
mechanism for AIGT detection. Existing methods typically interfere with the
generation processes of large language models (LLMs) to embed signals within
the generated text. However, these methods often rely on heuristic rules, which
can result in suboptimal token selection and a subsequent decline in the
quality of the generated content. In this paper, we introduce a plug-and-play
contextual generation states-aware watermarking framework (CAW) that
dynamically adjusts the embedding process. It can be seamlessly integrated with
various existing watermarking methods to enhance generation quality. First, CAW
incorporates a watermarking capacity evaluator, which can assess the impact of
embedding messages at different token positions by analyzing the contextual
generation states. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-branch pre-generation
mechanism to avoid the latency caused by the proposed watermarking strategy.
Building on this, CAW can dynamically adjust the watermarking process based on
the evaluated watermark capacity of each token, thereby minimizing potential
degradation in content quality. Extensive experiments conducted on datasets
across multiple domains have verified the effectiveness of our method,
demonstrating superior performance compared to various baselines in terms of
both detection rate and generation quality.

Conclusion: 该方案在某些情况下能够达到嵌入容量，并具有高鲁棒性，适用于复杂噪声攻击场景。

Abstract: Steganography is an information hiding technique for covert communication.
The core issue in steganography design is the rate-distortion coding problem.
Polar codes, which have been proven to achieve the rate-distortion bound for
any binary symmetric source, are utilized to design a steganographic scheme
that can reach the embedding capacity for the Distortion-Limited Sender problem
in certain cases. In adaptive steganography, for attack scenarios where each
noise element can have different intensities, existing steganographic coding
methods fail to resist such attacks. In this paper, we propose a
pixel-sensitive and robust steganographic scheme based on polar codes. Our
steganographic scheme not only matches the adaptive distortion well but is also
robust against sophisticated noise attacks. Futher, it is proven that our
scheme achieves the embedding capacity in certain cases. Experimentally, a
steganographic scheme can be designed and implemented with a secret message
error rate at the $10^{-5}$ level when the attack noise is known to both the
sender and the receiver. This demonstrates its significant robustness.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升检测性能并降低模型复杂度，适用于APT多阶段检测。

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a sophisticated and persistent
cy-bersecurity challenge, characterized by stealthy, multi-phase, and targeted
attacks aimed at compromising information systems over an extended period.
Develop-ing an effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of detecting
APTs at different phases relies on selecting network traffic features. However,
not all of these features are directly related to the phases of APTs. Some
network traffic features may be unrelated or have limited relevance to
identifying malicious ac-tivity. Therefore, it is important to carefully select
and analyze the most relevant features to improve the IDS performance. This
work proposes a feature selection and classification model that integrates two
prominent machine learning algo-rithms: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The aim is to develop lightweight IDS
based on a selected minimum number of influential features for detecting APTs
at various phases. The pro-posed method also specifies the relevant features
for each phase of APTs inde-pendently. Extensive experimental results on the
SCVIC-APT-2021 dataset indi-cated that our proposed approach has improved
performance compared to other standard techniques. Specifically, both the
macro-average F1-score and recall reached 94% and 93 %, respectively, while
reducing the complexity of the detec-tion model by selecting only 12 features
out of 77.

*Bikash Saha,Sandeep Kumar Shukla*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: MalGEN是一个多智能体框架，用于模拟对抗行为生成多样化恶意软件样本，以测试和加强网络安全防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的双重用途在网络安全中带来挑战，缺乏可控工具模拟其滥用行为。

Method: MalGEN通过多智能体协作模拟攻击者工作流程，生成恶意软件样本，并在受控环境中评估其规避能力。

Result: 生成的恶意软件样本成功绕过主流检测引擎，验证了MalGEN模拟复杂威胁的能力。

Conclusion: MalGEN为主动防御提供了工具，解决了数据稀缺问题，支持未来网络安全策略的开发。

Abstract: The dual use nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a growing
challenge in cybersecurity. While LLM enhances automation and reasoning for
defenders, they also introduce new risks, particularly their potential to be
misused for generating evasive, AI crafted malware. Despite this emerging
threat, the research community currently lacks controlled and extensible tools
that can simulate such behavior for testing and defense preparation. We present
MalGEN, a multi agent framework that simulates coordinated adversarial behavior
to generate diverse, activity driven malware samples. The agents work
collaboratively to emulate attacker workflows, including payload planning,
capability selection, and evasion strategies, within a controlled environment
built for ethical and defensive research. Using MalGEN, we synthesized ten
novel malware samples and evaluated them against leading antivirus and
behavioral detection engines. Several samples exhibited stealthy and evasive
characteristics that bypassed current defenses, validating MalGEN's ability to
model sophisticated and new threats. By transforming the threat of LLM misuse
into an opportunity for proactive defense, MalGEN offers a valuable framework
for evaluating and strengthening cybersecurity systems. The framework addresses
data scarcity, enables rigorous testing, and supports the development of
resilient and future ready detection strategies.

*Marco Di Gennaro,Giovanni De Lucia,Stefano Longari,Stefano Zanero,Michele Carminati*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: TimberStrike是一种针对横向联邦树模型的优化数据集重建攻击，通过利用决策树的离散特性，攻击者可以推断其他客户的敏感数据。实验表明，攻击在多个框架中成功重建了73.05%至95.63%的目标数据集。差分隐私虽能部分缓解攻击，但会显著降低模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中树模型的安全和隐私问题尚未充分研究，而现有研究主要集中在神经网络上。

Method: 提出TimberStrike攻击，利用决策树的分裂值和决策路径重建数据集，并在多个联邦梯度提升框架中验证其有效性。

Result: 攻击在公开的中风预测数据集上成功重建了73.05%至95.63%的目标数据，差分隐私虽能缓解攻击但损害模型性能。

Conclusion: 需要专门为树模型设计隐私保护机制，以平衡隐私和性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning has emerged as a privacy-oriented alternative to
centralized Machine Learning, enabling collaborative model training without
direct data sharing. While extensively studied for neural networks, the
security and privacy implications of tree-based models remain underexplored.
This work introduces TimberStrike, an optimization-based dataset reconstruction
attack targeting horizontally federated tree-based models. Our attack, carried
out by a single client, exploits the discrete nature of decision trees by using
split values and decision paths to infer sensitive training data from other
clients. We evaluate TimberStrike on State-of-the-Art federated gradient
boosting implementations across multiple frameworks, including Flower, NVFlare,
and FedTree, demonstrating their vulnerability to privacy breaches. On a
publicly available stroke prediction dataset, TimberStrike consistently
reconstructs between 73.05% and 95.63% of the target dataset across all
implementations. We further analyze Differential Privacy, showing that while it
partially mitigates the attack, it also significantly degrades model
performance. Our findings highlight the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms
specifically designed for tree-based Federated Learning systems, and we provide
preliminary insights into their design.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种通过早期充电阶段的电压行为识别电动汽车（EV）的框架，提高了识别速度和可靠性，同时揭示了充电数据隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车充电基础设施的安全需求日益增长，现有方法在充电后期才能检测攻击，导致能源浪费。早期识别能更有效地防止未经授权的充电。

Method: 通过提取早期充电阶段的电压特征，构建轻量级模型识别EV，测试了7408次充电数据，验证了方法的可行性。

Result: 在49辆EV的测试中，准确率达到0.86，仅需10个关键特征即可实现接近最优性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为EV认证提供了新方法，但也警示了充电数据隐私泄露的风险。

Abstract: Electric Vehicles (EVs) are rapidly gaining adoption as a sustainable
alternative to fuel-powered vehicles, making secure charging infrastructure
essential. Despite traditional authentication protocols, recent results showed
that attackers may steal energy through tailored relay attacks. One
countermeasure is leveraging the EV's fingerprint on the current exchanged
during charging. However, existing methods focus on the final charging stage,
allowing malicious actors to consume substantial energy before being detected
and repudiated. This underscores the need for earlier and more effective
authentication methods to prevent unauthorized charging. Meanwhile, profiling
raises privacy concerns, as uniquely identifying EVs through charging patterns
could enable user tracking.
  In this paper, we propose a framework for uniquely identifying EVs using
physical measurements from the early charging stages. We hypothesize that
voltage behavior early in the process exhibits similar characteristics to
current behavior in later stages. By extracting features from early voltage
measurements, we demonstrate the feasibility of EV profiling. Our approach
improves existing methods by enabling faster and more reliable vehicle
identification. We test our solution on a dataset of 7408 usable charges from
49 EVs, achieving up to 0.86 accuracy. Feature importance analysis shows that
near-optimal performance is possible with just 10 key features, improving
efficiency alongside our lightweight models. This research lays the foundation
for a novel authentication factor while exposing potential privacy risks from
unauthorized access to charging data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解npm生态系统中用户和机器人报告安全相关问题的现状及其挑战，填补此前研究的空白。

Method: 收集了45,466个npm包的GitHub仓库中的10,907,467个问题，通过人工分析和机器学习模型识别未标记的安全问题。

Result: 发现当前机器人工具不足以检测或协助解决安全问题，且许多用户报告的安全问题未被开发者处理。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了改进开源生态系统安全管理的必要性，需要更智能的工具和更好的协作。

Abstract: The npm (Node Package Manager) ecosystem is the most important package
manager for JavaScript development with millions of users. Consequently, a
plethora of earlier work investigated how vulnerability reporting, patch
propagation, and in general detection as well as resolution of security issues
in such ecosystems can be facilitated. However, understanding the ground
reality of security-related issue reporting by users (and bots) in npm-along
with the associated challenges has been relatively less explored at scale.
  In this work, we bridge this gap by collecting 10,907,467 issues reported
across GitHub repositories of 45,466 diverse npm packages. We found that the
tags associated with these issues indicate the existence of only 0.13%
security-related issues. However, our approach of manual analysis followed by
developing high accuracy machine learning models identify 1,617,738
security-related issues which are not tagged as security-related (14.8% of all
issues) as well as 4,461,934 comments made on these issues. We found that the
bots which are in wide use today might not be sufficient for either detecting
or offering assistance. Furthermore, our analysis of user-developer interaction
data hints that many user-reported security issues might not be addressed by
developers-they are not tagged as security-related issues and might be closed
without valid justification. Consequently, a correlation analysis hints that
the developers quickly handle security issues with known solutions (e.g.,
corresponding to CVE). However, security issues without such known solutions
(even with reproducible code) might not be resolved. Our findings offer
actionable insights for improving security management in open-source
ecosystems, highlighting the need for smarter tools and better collaboration.

TLDR: 本文探讨了用户空间rootkit的检测问题，挑战了传统认为用户空间工具可以有效检测的观点，并通过实验证明其局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户空间rootkit仍构成重大威胁，但普遍认为其易于被用户空间工具检测。本文旨在验证这种观点是否正确。

Method: 通过实验研究Linux系统中的进程隐藏技术，绕过流行的开源反rootkit工具。

Result: 实验证明用户空间rootkit无法仅通过用户空间工具检测，且检测结果需谨慎传达。

Conclusion: 用户空间rootkit检测需改进现有工具，并谨慎处理检测结果。

Abstract: The kind of malware designed to conceal malicious system resources (e.g.
processes, network connections, files, etc.) is commonly referred to as a
rootkit. This kind of malware represents a significant threat in contemporany
systems. Despite the existence of kernel-space rootkits (i.e. rootkits that
infect the operating system kernel), user-space rootkits (i.e. rootkits that
infect the user-space operating system tools, commands and libraries) continue
to pose a significant danger. However, kernel-space rootkits attract all the
attention, implicitly assuming that user-space rootkits (malware that is still
in existence) are easily detectable by well-known user-space tools that look
for anomalies. The primary objective of this work is to answer the following
question: Is detecting user-space rootkits with user-space tools futile?
Contrary to the prevailing view that considers it effective, we argue that the
detection of user-space rootkits cannot be done in user-space at all. Moreover,
the detection results must be communicated to the user with extreme caution. To
support this claim, we conducted different experiments focusing on process
concealing in Linux systems. In these experiments, we evade the detection
mechanisms widely accepted as the standard solution for this type of user-space
malware, bypassing the most popular open source anti-rootkit tool for process
hiding. This manuscript describes the classical approach to build user-space
library rootkits, the traditional detection mechanisms, and different evasion
techniques (it also includes understandable code snippets and examples). In
addition, it offers some guidelines to implement new detection tools and
improve the existing ones to the extent possible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT设备因资源限制和难以应用安全补丁而容易受到攻击，现有ML方法多关注攻击识别而忽略计算资源影响。

Method: 优化决策树、随机森林和Extra-Trees模型的超参数，基于能耗和性能（马修斯相关系数）进行权衡。

Result: 模型在保持高性能和检测准确性的同时，显著降低了功耗（瓦时）。

Conclusion: 基于ML的本地入侵检测系统适合IoT等资源受限设备。

Abstract: Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is widely employed, and its usage is
growing exponentially because it facilitates remote monitoring, predictive
maintenance, and data-driven decision making, especially in the healthcare and
industrial sectors. However, IoT devices remain vulnerable due to their
resource constraints and difficulty in applying security patches. Consequently,
various cybersecurity attacks are reported daily, such as Denial of Service,
particularly in IoT-driven solutions. Most attack detection methodologies are
based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques, which can detect attack patterns.
However, the focus is more on identification rather than considering the impact
of ML algorithms on computational resources. This paper proposes a green
methodology to identify IoT malware networking attacks based on flow
privacy-preserving statistical features. In particular, the hyperparameters of
three tree-based models -- Decision Trees, Random Forest and Extra-Trees -- are
optimized based on energy consumption and test-time performance in terms of
Matthew's Correlation Coefficient. Our results show that models maintain high
performance and detection accuracy while consistently reducing power usage in
terms of watt-hours (Wh). This suggests that on-premise ML-based Intrusion
Detection Systems are suitable for IoT and other resource-constrained devices.

TLDR: 本文研究了如何在无界差分隐私（DP）设置下保护程序免受时序攻击，克服了现有方法的局限性，并提出了高效转换方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无界DP设置下存在误差概率增加、计算效率降低等问题，本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过在不同计算模型（如随机RAM模型）中分析误差需求，提出高效转换方法，将上界DP程序转换为无界DP程序。

Result: 在随机RAM模型中，多项式小误差概率是必要且充分的；而在其他模型中，任意小的常数误差概率即可满足需求。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在不同计算模型下，无界JOT-DP的误差需求，并提供了高效转换方法。

Abstract: Recent works have started to theoretically investigate how we can protect
differentially private programs against timing attacks, by making the joint
distribution the output and the runtime differentially private (JOT-DP).
However, the existing approaches to JOT-DP have some limitations, particularly
in the setting of unbounded DP (which protects the size of the dataset and
applies to arbitrarily large datasets). First, the known conversion of pure DP
programs to pure JOT-DP programs in the unbounded setting (a) incurs a constant
additive increase in error probability (and thus does not provide vanishing
error as $n\to\infty$) (b) produces JOT-DP programs that fail to preserve the
computational efficiency of the original pure DP program and (c) is analyzed in
a toy computational model in which the runtime is defined to be the number of
coin flips. In this work, we overcome these limitations. Specifically, we show
that the error required for pure JOT-DP in the unbounded setting depends on the
model of computation. In a randomized RAM model where the dataset size $n$ is
given (or can be computed in constant time) and we can generate random numbers
(not just random bits) in constant time, polynomially small error probability
is necessary and sufficient. If $n$ is not given or we only have a random-bit
generator, an (arbitrarily small) constant error probability is necessary and
sufficient. The aforementioned positive results are proven by efficient
procedures to convert any pure JOT-DP program $P$ in the upper-bounded setting
to a pure JOT-DP program $P'$ in the unbounded setting, such that the output
distribution of $P'$ is $\gamma$-close in total variation distance to that of
$P$, where $\gamma$ is either an arbitrarily small constant or polynomially
small, depending on the model of computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NIDS生成大量警报，但深度学习模型的缺乏透明度降低了对其决策的信任，因此需要XAI来提升解释性。

Method: 使用真实NIDS数据集，开发LSTM模型进行警报分类，并比较四种XAI方法（LIME、SHAP、Integrated Gradients、DeepLIFT）。

Result: DeepLIFT在忠实性、复杂性、鲁棒性和可靠性上表现最优，且与分析师识别的关键特征高度一致。

Conclusion: XAI方法（尤其是DeepLIFT）能有效提升NIDS警报分类的透明度和实用性。

Abstract: A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) monitors networks for cyber
attacks and other unwanted activities. However, NIDS solutions often generate
an overwhelming number of alerts daily, making it challenging for analysts to
prioritize high-priority threats. While deep learning models promise to
automate the prioritization of NIDS alerts, the lack of transparency in these
models can undermine trust in their decision-making. This study highlights the
critical need for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in NIDS alert
classification to improve trust and interpretability. We employed a real-world
NIDS alert dataset from Security Operations Center (SOC) of TalTech (Tallinn
University Of Technology) in Estonia, developing a Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) model to prioritize alerts. To explain the LSTM model's alert
prioritization decisions, we implemented and compared four XAI methods: Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), SHapley Additive exPlanations
(SHAP), Integrated Gradients, and DeepLIFT. The quality of these XAI methods
was assessed using a comprehensive framework that evaluated faithfulness,
complexity, robustness, and reliability. Our results demonstrate that DeepLIFT
consistently outperformed the other XAI methods, providing explanations with
high faithfulness, low complexity, robust performance, and strong reliability.
In collaboration with SOC analysts, we identified key features essential for
effective alert classification. The strong alignment between these
analyst-identified features and those obtained by the XAI methods validates
their effectiveness and enhances the practical applicability of our approach.

Conclusion: 论文为数据重建攻击领域提供了系统评估框架和基准，推动了未来研究。

Abstract: Data reconstruction attacks, which aim to recover the training dataset of a
target model with limited access, have gained increasing attention in recent
years. However, there is currently no consensus on a formal definition of data
reconstruction attacks or appropriate evaluation metrics for measuring their
quality. This lack of rigorous definitions and universal metrics has hindered
further advancement in this field. In this paper, we address this issue in the
vision domain by proposing a unified attack taxonomy and formal definitions of
data reconstruction attacks. We first propose a set of quantitative evaluation
metrics that consider important criteria such as quantifiability, consistency,
precision, and diversity. Additionally, we leverage large language models
(LLMs) as a substitute for human judgment, enabling visual evaluation with an
emphasis on high-quality reconstructions. Using our proposed taxonomy and
metrics, we present a unified framework for systematically evaluating the
strengths and limitations of existing attacks and establishing a benchmark for
future research. Empirical results, primarily from a memorization perspective,
not only validate the effectiveness of our metrics but also offer valuable
insights for designing new attacks.

Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私保护方面面临梯度泄露攻击（如DLG）的威胁，现有防御方法（如DP和SMPC）会牺牲模型准确性，而同态加密虽能保护隐私但开销较大。

Method: 论文系统评估了多种分层HE方案，提出选择性加密策略以减少计算开销，并开发了一个完整的HE-based FL流程。

Conclusion: 同态加密是联邦学习中隐私保护的有效方案，选择性加密策略和分层HE方案可显著降低开销，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, making it a promising approach
for privacy-preserving machine learning in domains like Connected and
Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). However, recent studies have shown that exchanged
model gradients remain susceptible to inference attacks such as Deep Leakage
from Gradients (DLG), which can reconstruct private training data. While
existing defenses like Differential Privacy (DP) and Secure Multi-Party
Computation (SMPC) offer protection, they often compromise model accuracy. To
that end, Homomorphic Encryption (HE) offers a promising alternative by
enabling lossless computation directly on encrypted data, thereby preserving
both privacy and model utility. However, HE introduces significant
computational and communication overhead, which can hinder its practical
adoption. To address this, we systematically evaluate various leveled HE
schemes to identify the most suitable for FL in resource-constrained
environments due to its ability to support fixed-depth computations without
requiring costly bootstrapping. Our contributions in this paper include a
comprehensive evaluation of HE schemes for real-world FL applications, a
selective encryption strategy that targets only the most sensitive gradients to
minimize computational overhead, and the development of a full HE-based FL
pipeline that effectively mitigates DLG attacks while preserving model
accuracy. We open-source our implementation to encourage reproducibility and
facilitate adoption in safety-critical domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NFT的快速增长伴随着欺诈行为（如rug pulls）的兴起，这些行为利用智能合约中的隐藏后门欺骗用户。

Method: 使用Slither框架对49,940个已验证的NFT智能合约进行静态分析，开发风险评分模型分类合约风险等级。

Result: 研究发现恶意模式常被简单审查忽略，但可通过大规模静态分析发现，并揭示了高风险合约的常见特征。

Conclusion: 论文为开发者和审计者提供了检测和缓解NFT欺诈的实用方法，强调自动化分析的重要性。

Abstract: The explosive growth of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has revolutionized digital
ownership by enabling the creation, exchange, and monetization of unique assets
on blockchain networks. However, this surge in popularity has also given rise
to a disturbing trend: the emergence of rug pulls - fraudulent schemes where
developers exploit trust and smart contract privileges to drain user funds or
invalidate asset ownership. Central to many of these scams are hidden backdoors
embedded within NFT smart contracts. Unlike unintentional bugs, these backdoors
are deliberately coded and often obfuscated to bypass traditional audits and
exploit investor confidence. In this paper, we present a large-scale static
analysis of 49,940 verified NFT smart contracts using Slither, a static
analysis framework, to uncover latent vulnerabilities commonly linked to rug
pulls. We introduce a custom risk scoring model that classifies contracts into
high, medium, or low risk tiers based on the presence and severity of rug pull
indicators. Our dataset was derived from verified contracts on the Ethereum
mainnet, and we generate multiple visualizations to highlight red flag
clusters, issue prevalence, and co-occurrence of critical vulnerabilities.
While we do not perform live exploits, our results reveal how malicious
patterns often missed by simple reviews can be surfaced through static analysis
at scale. We conclude by offering mitigation strategies for developers,
marketplaces, and auditors to enhance smart contract security. By exposing how
hidden backdoors manifest in real-world smart contracts, this work contributes
a practical foundation for detecting and mitigating NFT rug pulls through
scalable automated analysis.

Conclusion: 提出拥堵感知费用调整、为低费用交易预留区块空间和改进gas不足漏洞处理，以提升公平性、验证者性能和可扩展性，促进以太坊去中心化。

Abstract: Ethereum's transaction pool (mempool) dynamics and fee market efficiency
critically affect transaction inclusion, validator workload, and overall
network performance. This research empirically analyzes gas price variations,
mempool clearance rates, and block finalization times in Ethereum's
proof-of-stake ecosystem using real-time data from Geth and Prysm nodes. We
observe that high-fee transactions are consistently prioritized, while low-fee
transactions face delays or exclusion despite EIP-1559's intended improvements.
Mempool congestion remains a key factor in validator efficiency and proposal
latency. We provide empirical evidence of persistent fee-based disparities and
show that extremely high fees do not always guarantee faster confirmation,
revealing inefficiencies in the current fee market. To address these issues, we
propose congestion-aware fee adjustments, reserved block slots for low-fee
transactions, and improved handling of out-of-gas vulnerabilities. By
mitigating prioritization bias and execution inefficiencies, our findings
support more equitable transaction inclusion, enhance validator performance,
and promote scalability. This work contributes to Ethereum's long-term
decentralization by reducing dependence on high transaction fees for network
participation.

Motivation: 洗钱犯罪对金融安全和社会稳定构成严重威胁，交易量增长需要自动化工具辅助执法机构检测此类犯罪活动。

Method: 提出Amatriciana方法，基于图神经网络，利用完整交易图（不分割为时间子图）和时间信息检测洗钱者。

Result: 模型在少量数据下学习有效，数据充足时优于现有方法，F1得分0.76，误报率降低55%。

Conclusion: Amatriciana是一种高效洗钱检测方法，尤其在减少误报方面表现突出。

Abstract: Money laundering is a financial crime that poses a serious threat to
financial integrity and social security. The growing number of transactions
makes it necessary to use automatic tools that help law enforcement agencies
detect such criminal activity. In this work, we present Amatriciana, a novel
approach based on Graph Neural Networks to detect money launderers inside a
graph of transactions by considering temporal information. Amatriciana uses the
whole graph of transactions without splitting it into several time-based
subgraphs, exploiting all relational information in the dataset. Our
experiments on a public dataset reveal that the model can learn from a limited
amount of data. Furthermore, when more data is available, the model outperforms
other State-of-the-art approaches; in particular, Amatriciana decreases the
number of False Positives (FPs) while detecting many launderers. In summary,
Amatriciana achieves an F1 score of 0.76. In addition, it lowers the FPs by 55%
with respect to other State-of-the-art models.

TLDR: CellCLIP是一种用于高内涵筛选（HCS）数据的跨模态对比学习框架，通过改进图像编码和扰动表示，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高内涵筛选（HCS）数据需要一种统一的方法来关联扰动与其形态效应，但现有方法因图像语义差异和扰动多样性而受限。

Method: CellCLIP结合预训练图像编码器、新型通道编码方案和自然语言编码器，以更好地表示扰动和图像关系。

Result: CellCLIP在跨模态检索和下游任务中表现最佳，同时显著减少计算时间。

Conclusion: CellCLIP为HCS数据提供了一种高效且性能优越的跨模态学习方法。

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy
techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells'
morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The
collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the
relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular
state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive
learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that
aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However,
the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to
substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to
natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of
perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent
space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a
cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages
pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to
better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image
embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing
perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models,
demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and
biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant
reductions in computation time.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于学习的方法，结合行为克隆和强化学习训练图神经网络，为混合整数线性规划提供高质量初始解，显著减少计算时间和方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合整数线性规划在大规模实时场景中计算时间长，限制了其广泛应用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持解质量和可行性的同时，减少了优化时间和方差。

Conclusion: 该方法为混合整数线性规划的高效求解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are essential tools for solving
planning and scheduling problems across critical industries such as
construction, manufacturing, and logistics. However, their widespread adoption
is limited by long computational times, especially in large-scale, real-time
scenarios. To address this, we present a learning-based framework that
leverages Behavior Cloning (BC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), producing high-quality initial solutions for
warm-starting MILP solvers in Multi-Agent Task Allocation and Scheduling
Problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces optimization
time and variance compared to traditional techniques while maintaining solution
quality and feasibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Mutual-Taught的自训练方法，通过迭代优化策略模型（PM）和奖励模型（RM），解决了大型语言模型（LLMs）偏好优化中的分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLMs的偏好优化过程中，新生成的模型样本与奖励模型训练数据之间的分布偏移会降低RM的有效性，进而影响PM的性能。

Method: Mutual-Taught方法模仿期望最大化（EM）算法，分为E步（更新PM）和M步（更新RM），无需额外人工标注。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型性能，8B策略模型在AlpacaEval-2上达到54.1%的胜率，8B奖励模型在RewardBench上与GPT-4o-2024-08-06表现相当。

Conclusion: Mutual-Taught通过迭代优化PM和RM，有效解决了分布偏移问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: During the preference optimization of large language models (LLMs),
distribution shifts may arise between newly generated model samples and the
data used to train the reward model (RM). This shift reduces the efficacy of
the RM, which in turn negatively impacts the performance of the policy model
(PM). To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training
method that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring
additional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the
current RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal
preference distribution. In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing
training data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update.
This process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution.
Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to
consistent improvements in both models. Specifically, our 8B policy model,
LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct-MT, achieves a length-controlled win rate of 54.1\% on
AlpacaEval-2, while our 8B reward model, FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-MT, performs on par
with GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on RewardBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银行信用评级对经济稳定和利益相关者决策至关重要，但隐私问题导致完整的银行间连接图难以获取，限制了图神经网络的应用。

Method: 利用持久同源性构建银行关系网络，并结合传统借贷网络形成异构图，通过HTGNN整合两类信息进行评级预测。

Result: 在真实全球数据集上的实验验证了HTGNN的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为投资者和监管机构提供了改进风险缓解和市场干预的工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: Agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's provide bank credit ratings
that influence economic stability and decision-making by stakeholders. Accurate
and timely predictions support informed decision-making, regulatory actions,
and investor protection. However, a complete interbank connection graph is
often unavailable due to privacy concerns, complicating the direct application
of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for rating prediction. our research utilizes
persistent homology to construct a network that captures relationships among
banks and combines this with a traditional lending network to create a
heterogeneous network that integrates information from both sources, leading to
improved predictions. Experiments on a global, real-world dataset validate the
effectiveness of HTGNN. This research has implications for investors and
regulatory bodies in enhancing proactive risk mitigation and the implementation
of effective market interventions.The code can be find at

Result: GLProtein在多个生物信息学任务中表现优于先前方法，如蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用预测和接触预测。

Conclusion: GLProtein通过整合全局和局部结构信息，为蛋白质功能预测提供了更全面的框架。

Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks
across all forms of life. Despite advancements in understanding protein
functions through protein sequence analysis, there remains potential for
further exploration in integrating protein structural information. We argue
that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D
information but also encompasses information from amino acid molecules (local
information) to protein-protein structure similarity (global information). To
address this, we propose \textbf{GLProtein}, the first framework in protein
pre-training that incorporates both global structural similarity and local
amino acid details to enhance prediction accuracy and functional insights.
GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure
similarity scoring, protein 3D distance encoding and substructure-based amino
acid molecule encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that GLProtein
outperforms previous methods in several bioinformatics tasks, including
predicting protein-protein interaction, contact prediction, and so on.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出了一种名为dLLM-Cache的缓存框架，用于降低基于扩散的大型语言模型（dLLMs）的高推理延迟，通过静态提示缓存和部分响应更新实现了显著的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs因其双向注意力机制导致传统加速技术不适用，且推理延迟高，因此需要一种新的解决方案。

Method: 提出dLLM-Cache框架，结合长间隔提示缓存和基于特征相似性的部分响应更新，实现计算重用。

Result: 在LLaDA 8B和Dream 7B等模型上，dLLM-Cache实现了最高9.1倍的加速，且不损失输出质量。

Conclusion: dLLM-Cache显著降低了dLLMs的推理延迟，使其接近ARMs的水平，为实际应用提供了可行性。

Abstract: Autoregressive Models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of Large
Language Models. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of
diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which generate text by
iteratively denoising masked segments. This approach has shown significant
advantages and potential. However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency.
Traditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are
incompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism. To
address this specific challenge, our work begins with a key observation that
dLLM inference involves a static prompt and a partially dynamic response, where
most tokens remain stable across adjacent denoising steps. Based on this, we
propose dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework that combines
long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature
similarity. This design enables efficient reuse of intermediate computations
without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on representative
dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B, show that dLLM-Cache achieves up to 9.1
x speedup over standard inference without compromising output quality. Notably,
our method brings dLLM inference latency close to that of ARMs under many
settings. Codes are provided in the supplementary material and will be released
publicly on GitHub.

Motivation: 探索如何通过多项式扩展和动态图卷积网络提升3D点云分类的性能和效率。

Method: 用可调单变量多项式扩展替换MLP层，结合DGCNN架构，避免深层结构，进行逐层比较。

Result: 在ModelNet40数据集上，Jacobi多项式KAN层在准确性和收敛速度上优于传统DGCNN，同时保持参数效率。

Conclusion: 高多项式阶数不一定提升性能，需进一步研究多项式基、阶数与图学习机制的相互作用。

Abstract: We introduce Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN, a framework that integrates Dynamic Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) with Jacobi Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KAN) for the classification of three-dimensional point clouds. This method
replaces Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers with adaptable univariate
polynomial expansions within a streamlined DGCNN architecture, circumventing
deep levels for both MLP and KAN to facilitate a layer-by-layer comparison. In
comparative experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset, KAN layers employing Jacobi
polynomials outperform the traditional linear layer-based DGCNN baseline in
terms of accuracy and convergence speed, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that higher polynomial degrees do not
automatically improve performance, highlighting the need for further
theoretical and empirical investigation to fully understand the interactions
between polynomial bases, degrees, and the mechanisms of graph-based learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院超声心动图检查调度面临患者不确定性（如爽约、到达时间）和资源不对称（胎儿与非胎儿患者）的挑战，需优化资源分配以提高效率。

Method: 通过预处理一周运营数据估计患者爽约概率和到达时间分布，构建SimPy仿真模型，结合Gymnasium库比较动态与预约分配策略，并应用强化学习优化策略。

Result: 动态分配策略在资源不对称（1:6胎儿与非胎儿房间，4:2超声技师）下表现更优，强化学习策略进一步提升了效率。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的动态资源分配策略能有效提升超声实验室效率，强化学习为优化调度提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Scheduling echocardiographic exams in a hospital presents significant
challenges due to non-deterministic factors (e.g., patient no-shows, patient
arrival times, diverse exam durations, etc.) and asymmetric resource
constraints between fetal and non-fetal patient streams. To address these
challenges, we first conducted extensive pre-processing on one week of
operational data from the Echo Laboratory at Stanford University's Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, to estimate patient no-show probabilities and
derive empirical distributions of arrival times and exam durations. Based on
these inputs, we developed a discrete-event stochastic simulation model using
SimPy, and integrate it with the open source Gymnasium Python library. As a
baseline for policy optimization, we developed a comparative framework to
evaluate on-the-fly versus reservation-based allocation strategies, in which
different proportions of resources are reserved in advance. Considering a
hospital configuration with a 1:6 ratio of fetal to non-fetal rooms and a 4:2
ratio of fetal to non-fetal sonographers, we show that on-the-fly allocation
generally yields better performance, more effectively adapting to patient
variability and resource constraints. Building on this foundation, we apply
reinforcement learning (RL) to derive an approximated optimal dynamic
allocation policy. This RL-based policy is benchmarked against the
best-performing rule-based strategies, allowing us to quantify their
differences and provide actionable insights for improving echo lab efficiency
through intelligent, data-driven resource management.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于多奖励函数分布的方法，以反映多样的人类偏好，避免多数信号压制少数观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的对齐方法假设存在单一理想行为，但人类偏好因用户、背景和文化而异，导致少数观点被忽视。

Method: 通过从成对偏好中学习奖励函数分布，无需标注者标识或预定义群体，将分歧视为软标签。核心标准是成对校准。

Result: 理论和实验表明，即使小规模的无异常集合也能准确表示多样偏好分布，校准效果显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法能更忠实地反映多元价值观，为对齐问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current alignment pipelines presume a single, universal notion of desirable
behavior. However, human preferences often diverge across users, contexts, and
cultures. As a result, disagreement collapses into the majority signal and
minority perspectives are discounted. To address this, we propose reflecting
diverse human preferences through a distribution over multiple reward
functions, each inducing a distinct aligned policy. The distribution is learned
directly from pairwise preference without annotator identifiers or predefined
groups. Instead, annotator disagreements are treated as informative soft
labels. Our central criterion is pairwise calibration: for every pair of
candidate responses, the proportion of reward functions preferring one response
matches the fraction of annotators with that preference. We prove that even a
small outlier-free ensemble can accurately represent diverse preference
distributions. Empirically, we introduce and validate a practical training
heuristic to learn such ensembles, and demonstrate its effectiveness through
improved calibration, implying a more faithful representation of pluralistic
values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs依赖密度拓扑描述，需手动插值且难以处理复杂几何，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 提出LT-PINNs框架，将拓扑边界曲线的控制变量参数化为可学习参数，并引入边界条件损失和拓扑损失函数。

Result: LT-PINNs在多种PDE问题中表现优异，相对L2误差显著降低，能处理任意边界条件并清晰推断复杂拓扑边界。

Conclusion: LT-PINNs为工程优化提供了更高效、精确的边界聚焦方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful meshless
tool for topology optimization, capable of simultaneously determining optimal
topologies and physical solutions. However, conventional PINNs rely on
density-based topology descriptions, which necessitate manual interpolation and
limit their applicability to complex geometries. To address this, we propose
Lagrangian topology-conscious PINNs (LT-PINNs), a novel framework for
boundary-focused engineering optimization. By parameterizing the control
variables of topology boundary curves as learnable parameters, LT-PINNs
eliminate the need for manual interpolation and enable precise boundary
determination. We further introduce specialized boundary condition loss
function and topology loss function to ensure sharp and accurate boundary
representations, even for intricate topologies. The accuracy and robustness of
LT-PINNs are validated via two types of partial differential equations (PDEs),
including elastic equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and Laplace's
equation with Neumann boundary conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate
effectiveness of LT-PINNs on more complex time-dependent and time-independent
flow problems without relying on measurement data, and showcase their
engineering application potential in flow velocity rearrangement, transforming
a uniform upstream velocity into a sine-shaped downstream profile. The results
demonstrate (1) LT-PINNs achieve substantial reductions in relative L2 errors
compared with the state-of-art density topology-oriented PINNs (DT-PINNs), (2)
LT-PINNs can handle arbitrary boundary conditions, making them suitable for a
wide range of PDEs, and (3) LT-PINNs can infer clear topology boundaries
without manual interpolation, especially for complex topologies.

Result: 在三个基准测试中，ICRL prompting显著优于基线方法，甚至在LLM自生成奖励信号时仍能提升性能。

Conclusion: ICRL prompting为LLM在推理时优化任务表现提供了新范式，具有扩展测试时计算的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a human-designed framework for solving
sequential decision making problems. In this work, we demonstrate that,
surprisingly, RL emerges in LLM's (Large Language Model) inference time -- a
phenomenon known as in-context RL (ICRL). Specifically, we propose a novel
multi-round prompting framework called ICRL prompting. The goal is to prompt
the LLM to complete a task. After the LLM generates a response at the current
round, we give numerical scalar feedbacks for the response, called the rewards.
At the next round, we prompt the LLM again with the same task and a context
consisting of all previous responses and rewards. We observe that the quality
of the LLM's response increases as the context grows. In other words, the LLM
is able to maximize the scalar reward signal in the inference time, just like
an RL algorithm. We evaluate ICRL prompting in three benchmarks (Game of 24,
creative writing, and ScienceWorld) and demonstrate significant performance
improvements over baseline methods such as Self-Refine and Reflexion.
Surprisingly, in some experiments the reward signals are generated by the LLM
itself, yet performance improvements are still observed from ICRL prompting,
offering a promising paradigm for scaling test-time compute.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 葡萄酒质量评估通常依赖主观的人工品尝，缺乏客观性和可重复性。本文旨在通过机器学习方法提供一种更准确和可重复的评估方案。

Method: 使用五种集成学习方法（Random Forest、Gradient Boosting、XGBoost、LightGBM、CatBoost），结合泄漏避免的工作流程、分层训练测试分割、特征选择和超参数优化。

Result: Gradient Boosting在加权F1分数上表现最佳（红葡萄酒0.693，白葡萄酒0.664），但Random Forest在效率和成本上更具优势。

Conclusion: 推荐Random Forest作为最具成本效益的生产模型，Gradient Boosting作为离线基准测试的准确率上限，同时提供了可复现的基线流程。

Abstract: Accurate and reproducible wine-quality assessment is critical for production
control yet remains dominated by subjective, labour-intensive tasting panels.
We present the first unified benchmark of five ensemble learners (Random
Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on the canonical Vinho
Verde red- and white-wine datasets (1,599 and 4,898 instances, 11
physicochemical attributes). Our leakage-free workflow employs an 80:20
stratified train-test split, five-fold StratifiedGroupKFold within the training
set, per-fold standardisation, SMOTE-Tomek resampling, inverse-frequency cost
weighting, Optuna hyper-parameter search (120-200 trials per model) and a
two-stage feature-selection refit. Final scores on untouched test sets are
reported with weighted F1 as the headline metric. Gradient Boosting achieves
the highest accuracy (weighted F1 0.693 +/- 0.028 for red and 0.664 +/- 0.016
for white), followed within three percentage points by Random Forest and
XGBoost. Limiting each model to its five top-ranked variables lowers
dimensionality by 55 percent while reducing weighted F1 by only 2.6 percentage
points for red and 3.0 percentage points for white, indicating that alcohol,
volatile acidity, sulphates, free SO2 and chlorides capture most predictive
signal. Runtime profiling on an EPYC 9K84/H20 node reveals a steep efficiency
gradient: Gradient Boosting averages 12 h per five-fold study, XGBoost and
LightGBM require 2-3 h, CatBoost 1 h, and Random Forest under 50 min. We
therefore recommend Random Forest as the most cost-effective production model,
XGBoost and LightGBM as GPU-efficient alternatives, and Gradient Boosting as
the accuracy ceiling for offline benchmarking. The fully documented pipeline
and metric set provide a reproducible baseline for future work on imbalanced
multi-class wine-quality prediction.

exists no standardized, reproducible framework for their comparative
evaluation, particularly in fairness-sensitive settings.
  We introduce ExplainBench, an open-source benchmarking suite for systematic
evaluation of local model explanations across ethically consequential datasets.
ExplainBench provides unified wrappers for popular explanation algorithms,
integrates end-to-end pipelines for model training and explanation generation,
and supports evaluation via fidelity, sparsity, and robustness metrics. The

  We demonstrate ExplainBench on datasets commonly used in fairness research,

reproducible, comparative analysis of local explanations, ExplainBench advances
the methodological foundations of interpretable machine learning and

Conclusion: AALpy的通用设计显著简化了状态合并算法的实现和扩展。

Abstract: AALpy is a well-established open-source automata learning library written in
Python with a focus on active learning of systems with IO behavior. It provides
a wide range of state-of-the-art algorithms for different automaton types
ranging from fully deterministic to probabilistic automata. In this work, we
present the recent addition of a generalized implementation of an important
method from the domain of passive automata learning: state-merging in the
red-blue framework. Using a common internal representation for different
automaton types allows for a general and highly configurable implementation of
the red-blue framework. We describe how to define and execute state-merging
algorithms using AALpy, which reduces the implementation effort for
state-merging algorithms mainly to the definition of compatibility criteria and
scoring. This aids the implementation of both existing and novel algorithms. In
particular, defining some existing state-merging algorithms from the literature
with AALpy only takes a few lines of code.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的联邦学习框架，优化客户端训练数据量以提升性能，同时保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中非独立同分布（non-IID）数据导致的性能下降问题，避免客户端过度共享数据。

Method: 利用DRL代理根据训练损失变化动态优化每个客户端的训练数据量，并在每轮聚合后调整类别权重。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准数据集和FL框架中表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了联邦学习性能，同时缓解了非IID数据的影响。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed framework for collaborative model
training over large-scale distributed data, enabling higher performance while
maintaining client data privacy. However, the nature of model aggregation at
the centralized server can result in a performance drop in the presence of
non-IID data across different clients. We remark that training a client locally
on more data than necessary does not benefit the overall performance of all
clients. In this paper, we devise a novel framework that leverages a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to select an optimized amount of data
necessary to train a client model without oversharing information with the
server. Starting without awareness of the client's performance, the DRL agent
utilizes the change in training loss as a reward signal and learns to optimize
the amount of training data necessary for improving the client's performance.
Specifically, after each aggregation round, the DRL algorithm considers the
local performance as the current state and outputs the optimized weights for
each class, in the training data, to be used during the next round of local
training. In doing so, the agent learns a policy that creates an optimized
partition of the local training dataset during the FL rounds. After FL, the
client utilizes the entire local training dataset to further enhance its
performance on its own data distribution, mitigating the non-IID effects of
aggregation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that training FL
clients through our algorithm results in superior performance on multiple
benchmark datasets and FL frameworks. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习在能源管理中面临泛化能力和异构数据整合的挑战，而Transformer和LLMs展现出更强的建模能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has long promised to improve energy management
in smart grids by enhancing situational awareness and supporting more effective
decision-making. While traditional machine learning has demonstrated notable
results in forecasting and optimization, it often struggles with
generalization, situational awareness, and heterogeneous data integration.
Recent advances in foundation models such as Transformer architecture and Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved capabilities in modelling
complex temporal and contextual relationships, as well as in multi-modal data
fusion which is essential for most AI applications in the energy sector. In
this review we synthesize the rapid expanding field of AI applications in the
energy domain focusing on Transformers and LLMs. We examine the architectural
foundations, domain-specific adaptations and practical implementations of
transformer models across various forecasting and grid management tasks. We
then explore the emerging role of LLMs in the field: adaptation and fine tuning
for the energy sector, the type of tasks they are suited for, and the new
challenges they introduce. Along the way, we highlight practical
implementations, innovations, and areas where the research frontier is rapidly
expanding. These recent developments reviewed underscore a broader trend:
Generative AI (GenAI) is beginning to augment decision-making not only in
high-level planning but also in day-to-day operations, from forecasting and
grid balancing to workforce training and asset onboarding. Building on these
developments, we introduce the concept of the Agentic Digital Twin, a
next-generation model that integrates LLMs to bring autonomy, proactivity, and
social interaction into digital twin-based energy management systems.

*Jingyi Gu,Xuan Zhang,Guiling Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 这篇论文综述了极端事件的合成数据生成方法，填补了现有研究的空白，并提供了评估框架和应用领域的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端事件（如市场崩溃、自然灾害和疫情）罕见但破坏性大，数据稀缺导致建模困难，需要合成数据生成技术来解决。

Method: 系统回顾生成建模技术和大型语言模型，结合统计理论和专门训练机制，提出评估框架（统计、依赖、视觉和任务导向指标）。

Result: 总结了基准数据集，分析了各指标在极端事件中的适用性，并识别了未充分探索的应用领域（如行为金融、野火等）。

Conclusion: 论文为极端事件的合成数据研究提供了结构化基础，并指出了未来挑战。

Abstract: Extreme events, such as market crashes, natural disasters, and pandemics, are
rare but catastrophic, often triggering cascading failures across
interconnected systems. Accurate prediction and early warning can help minimize
losses and improve preparedness. While data-driven methods offer powerful
capabilities for extreme event modeling, they require abundant training data,
yet extreme event data is inherently scarce, creating a fundamental challenge.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful solution. However, existing
surveys focus on general data with privacy preservation emphasis, rather than
extreme events' unique performance requirements. This survey provides the first
overview of synthetic data generation for extreme events. We systematically
review generative modeling techniques and large language models, particularly
those enhanced by statistical theory as well as specialized training and
sampling mechanisms to capture heavy-tailed distributions. We summarize
benchmark datasets and introduce a tailored evaluation framework covering
statistical, dependence, visual, and task-oriented metrics. A central
contribution is our in-depth analysis of each metric's applicability in
extremeness and domain-specific adaptations, providing actionable guidance for
model evaluation in extreme settings. We categorize key application domains and
identify underexplored areas like behavioral finance, wildfires, earthquakes,
windstorms, and infectious outbreaks. Finally, we outline open challenges,
providing a structured foundation for advancing synthetic rare-event research.

Method: 通过函数逼近定义表达能力，利用Rademacher复杂度建立泛化边界，提出基于正交函数（如小波和Legendre多项式）的新编码方法，并分析现有和提出编码的外推能力。

Result: 实验表明，基于正交变换的编码在泛化和外推方面优于传统的正弦编码。

Conclusion: 本文为Transformer模型的设计选择提供了理论支持，特别是在位置编码方法的优化上，对多种应用领域具有指导意义。

Abstract: Positional encodings are a core part of transformer-based models, enabling
processing of sequential data without recurrence. This paper presents a
theoretical framework to analyze how various positional encoding methods,
including sinusoidal, learned, relative, and bias-based methods like Attention
with Linear Biases (ALiBi), impact a transformer's expressiveness,
generalization ability, and extrapolation to longer sequences. Expressiveness
is defined via function approximation, generalization bounds are established
using Rademacher complexity, and new encoding methods based on orthogonal
functions, such as wavelets and Legendre polynomials, are proposed. The
extrapolation capacity of existing and proposed encodings is analyzed,
extending ALiBi's biasing approach to a unified theoretical context.
Experimental evaluation on synthetic sequence-to-sequence tasks shows that
orthogonal transform-based encodings outperform traditional sinusoidal
encodings in generalization and extrapolation. This work addresses a critical
gap in transformer theory, providing insights for design choices in natural
language processing, computer vision, and other transformer applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如NMF）未结合生存信息，限制了预测能力。

Method: 使用非负张量分解（NTF）构建加权协变量张量，结合Coxnet模型的生存概率指导张量化过程。

Result: CoxNTF的生存预测性能与原始协变量的Coxnet相当，同时提供了结构化和可解释的聚类框架，并能有效处理特征冗余。

Conclusion: CoxNTF是一种强大的工具，可用于生存分析中的联合聚类和预测。

Abstract: The interpretation of the results of survival analysis often benefits from
latent factor representations of baseline covariates. However, existing
methods, such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), do not incorporate
survival information, limiting their predictive power. We present CoxNTF, a
novel approach that uses non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) to derive
meaningful latent representations that are closely associated with survival
outcomes. CoxNTF constructs a weighted covariate tensor in which survival
probabilities derived from the Coxnet model are used to guide the tensorization
process. Our results show that CoxNTF achieves survival prediction performance
comparable to using Coxnet with the original covariates, while providing a
structured and interpretable clustering framework. In addition, the new
approach effectively handles feature redundancy, making it a powerful tool for
joint clustering and prediction in survival analysis.

TLDR: NeurNCD框架通过结合Embedding-NeRF模型和KL散度，解决了传统显式表示在开放世界新类发现中的局限性，实现了高效且无需密集标注的数据分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统显式表示（如3D分割图）存在离散、易噪和空洞问题，限制了新类发现的准确性。

Method: 采用Embedding-NeRF模型和KL散度替代传统3D分割图，结合特征查询、调制和聚类技术。

Result: 在NYUv2和Replica数据集上显著优于现有方法，无需密集标注或人工干预。

Conclusion: NeurNCD为开放世界新类发现提供了高效、数据友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Discovering novel classes in open-world settings is crucial for real-world
applications. Traditional explicit representations, such as object descriptors
or 3D segmentation maps, are constrained by their discrete, hole-prone, and
noisy nature, which hinders accurate novel class discovery. To address these
challenges, we introduce NeurNCD, the first versatile and data-efficient
framework for novel class discovery that employs the meticulously designed
Embedding-NeRF model combined with KL divergence as a substitute for
traditional explicit 3D segmentation maps to aggregate semantic embedding and
entropy in visual embedding space. NeurNCD also integrates several key
components, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering,
facilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between
the pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural
representations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation
performance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely
labelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate
sparse label supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the NYUv2 and Replica
datasets.

TLDR: 研究发现，分子编码器的中间层嵌入比最终层表现更好，优化后性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战仅依赖最终层嵌入的标准实践，探索分子编码器的全层表示潜力。

Method: 对五种分子编码器进行分层分析，测试22种ADMET属性预测任务。

Result: 中间层嵌入平均提升5.4%，微调后可达8.5%，部分任务提升40.8%。

Conclusion: 充分利用分子编码器的全层表示可显著提升性能与计算效率。

Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational
chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation.
However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for
downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we challenge
this convention by conducting a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of five
diverse molecular encoders across 22 ADMET property prediction tasks. Our
results demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers consistently
outperform final-layer representations. Specifically, using fixed embeddings
from the optimal intermediate layers improved downstream performance by an
average of 5.4%, reaching gains up to 28.6%. Furthermore, finetuning up to
these intermediate layers yielded even greater average improvements of 8.5%,
with performance increases as high as 40.8%, achieving new state-of-the-art
results on several benchmarks. Additionally, a strong positive correlation
between fixed embedding performance and finetuning outcomes supports an
efficient evaluate-then-finetune approach, enabling identification of optimal
layers with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance
of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve
substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code is

*Ruizhong Qiu,Gaotang Li,Tianxin Wei,Jingrui He,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的推理扩展方法SAFFRON，用于增强LLM的安全性，解决了传统方法在安全场景中的低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全保证方法易受越狱攻击，且推理扩展在安全领域的潜力未被探索。

Method: 提出SAFFRON框架，包括多叉奖励模型（MRM）、部分监督训练目标、保守探索约束和Trie缓存策略。

Result: 实验证明SAFFRON有效，并公开了模型和数据。

Conclusion: SAFFRON为LLM安全提供了高效解决方案，推动了相关研究。

Abstract: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase
alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have
exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.
Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning
capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.
Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and
effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional
inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform
poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like
Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified
challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high
computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)
evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference
scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our
approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that
significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To
operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision
training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to
prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value
caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree
search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.
Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model
(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)
to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列通常具有复杂的非线性动态，现有深度学习方法未能明确建模这些动态，因此需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: DeepEDM基于Takens定理，通过时间延迟嵌入学习潜在空间，并使用核回归近似动态，同时利用高效的softmax注意力机制实现预测。

Result: 实验表明，DeepEDM对输入噪声具有鲁棒性，并在预测准确性上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DeepEDM成功地将动态系统建模与深度学习结合，为时间序列预测提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world time series are often governed by complex nonlinear dynamics.
Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for precise future
prediction. While deep learning has achieved major success in time series
forecasting, many existing approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEDM, a framework that integrates nonlinear
dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks. Inspired by empirical
dynamic modeling (EDM) and rooted in Takens' theorem, DeepEDM presents a novel
deep model that learns a latent space from time-delayed embeddings, and employs
kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, while leveraging
efficient implementation of softmax attention and allowing for accurate
prediction of future time steps. To evaluate our method, we conduct
comprehensive experiments on synthetic data of nonlinear dynamical systems as
well as real-world time series across domains. Our results show that DeepEDM is
robust to input noise, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting
accuracy. Our code is available at: https://abrarmajeedi.github.io/deep_edm.

Result: WISCA与最可靠的个体方法一致，验证了共识策略在提升解释可靠性中的价值。

Conclusion: 共识策略（尤其是WISCA）能有效提高模型解释的可靠性，适用于需要高可信度的领域。

Abstract: While predictive accuracy is often prioritized in machine learning (ML)
models, interpretability remains essential in scientific and high-stakes
domains. However, diverse interpretability algorithms frequently yield
conflicting explanations, highlighting the need for consensus to harmonize
results. In this study, six ML models were trained on six synthetic datasets
with known ground truths, utilizing various model-agnostic interpretability
techniques. Consensus explanations were generated using established methods and
a novel approach: WISCA (Weighted Scaled Consensus Attributions), which
integrates class probability and normalized attributions. WISCA consistently
aligned with the most reliable individual method, underscoring the value of
robust consensus strategies in improving explanation reliability.

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法显著提高了婴儿睡眠质量，同时保持了理想的出行效率。

Conclusion: 提出的智能巡航控制框架有效平衡了婴儿睡眠质量和出行效率，为自动驾驶的个性化优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Automated driving (AD) has substantially improved vehicle safety and driving
comfort, but their impact on passenger well-being, particularly infant sleep,
is not sufficiently studied. Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp
maneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and
parental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the
integration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving
behavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In
particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to
varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively
synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM)
and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the
relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse
traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the
wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data
from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving
aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control
strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and
overtaking. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution
significantly improves infant sleep quality compared to baseline methods, while
preserving desirable travel efficiency.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is an essential task with wide real-world
applications across domains. While recent advances in deep learning have
enabled time-series forecasting models with accurate predictions, there remains
considerable debate over which architectures and design components, such as
series decomposition or normalization, are most effective under varying
conditions. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate models at a high level,
offering limited insight into why certain designs work better. To mitigate this
gap, we propose TimeRecipe, a unified benchmarking framework that
systematically evaluates time-series forecasting methods at the module level.
TimeRecipe conducts over 10,000 experiments to assess the effectiveness of
individual components across a diverse range of datasets, forecasting horizons,
and task settings. Our results reveal that exhaustive exploration of the design
space can yield models that outperform existing state-of-the-art methods and
uncover meaningful intuitions linking specific design choices to forecasting
scenarios. Furthermore, we release a practical toolkit within TimeRecipe that
recommends suitable model architectures based on these empirical insights. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据隐私法规的普及，从训练模型中删除私有或受版权保护信息的需求日益重要，但传统方法依赖完整训练数据集，实际中难以满足。

Method: 利用替代数据集近似源数据统计特性，通过控制噪声缩放实现数据删除，理论保证基于统计距离的精确知识，实践中通过近似实现。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性和可靠性，在隐私敏感场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为无需原始数据的认证遗忘提供了实用解决方案，平衡了隐私保护与模型效用。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of data privacy regulations, the ability to erase
private or copyrighted information from trained models has become a crucial
requirement. Traditional unlearning methods often assume access to the complete
training dataset, which is unrealistic in scenarios where the source data is no
longer available. To address this challenge, we propose a certified unlearning
framework that enables effective data removal \final{without access to the
original training data samples}. Our approach utilizes a surrogate dataset that
approximates the statistical properties of the source data, allowing for
controlled noise scaling based on the statistical distance between the two.
\updated{While our theoretical guarantees assume knowledge of the exact
statistical distance, practical implementations typically approximate this
distance, resulting in potentially weaker but still meaningful privacy
guarantees.} This ensures strong guarantees on the model's behavior
post-unlearning while maintaining its overall utility. We establish theoretical
bounds, introduce practical noise calibration techniques, and validate our
method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our approach in
privacy-sensitive settings.

Conclusion: 分位数回归攻击在类缺失情况下是一种更有效的成员推理攻击方法，并提供了理论模型分析其潜力与局限性。

Abstract: Shadow model attacks are the state-of-the-art approach for membership
inference attacks on machine learning models. However, these attacks typically
assume an adversary has access to a background (nonmember) data distribution
that matches the distribution the target model was trained on. We initiate a
study of membership inference attacks where the adversary or auditor cannot
access an entire subclass from the distribution -- a more extreme but realistic
version of distribution shift than has been studied previously. In this
setting, we first show that the performance of shadow model attacks degrades
catastrophically, and then demonstrate the promise of another approach,
quantile regression, that does not have the same limitations. We show that
quantile regression attacks consistently outperform shadow model attacks in the
class dropout setting -- for example, quantile regression attacks achieve up to
11$\times$ the TPR of shadow models on the unseen class on CIFAR-100, and
achieve nontrivial TPR on ImageNet even with 90% of training classes removed.
We also provide a theoretical model that illustrates the potential and
limitations of this approach.

Result: AGF量化了特征学习的顺序、时间和幅度，与实验一致，并在多种架构中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: AGF为理解神经网络特征学习提供了新视角，统一并扩展了现有理论。

Abstract: What features neural networks learn, and how, remains an open question. In
this paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic
framework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks
trained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in
this regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus
where neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons
rapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step
process: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a
cost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each
round, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and
a drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these
drops, matching experiments across architectures. We show that AGF unifies and
extends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks
and attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular
modes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we
prove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization.
Applying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give
the first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that
networks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude.
Altogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning
in neural networks.

Method: 基于7.5K种子数据集，通过质量-多样性算法生成2000万问题-解决方案对，并按难度和多样性筛选数据。

Result: 模型性能提升24%，高质量数据提升分布内性能，多样性数据增强分布外泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPARQ证明了合成数据生成的可扩展性，并揭示了数据质量和多样性对模型泛化的影响。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) driven synthetic data generation has emerged as a
powerful method for improving model reasoning capabilities. However, most
methods either distill large state-of-the-art models into small students or use
natural ground-truth problem statements to guarantee problem statement quality.
This limits the scalability of these approaches to more complex and diverse
problem domains. To address this, we present SPARQ: Synthetic Problem
Generation for Reasoning via Quality-Diversity Algorithms, a novel approach for
generating high-quality and diverse synthetic math problem and solution pairs
using only a single model by measuring a problem's solve-rate: a proxy for
problem difficulty. Starting from a seed dataset of 7.5K samples, we generate
over 20 million new problem-solution pairs. We show that filtering the
generated data by difficulty and then fine-tuning the same model on the
resulting data improves relative model performance by up to 24\%. Additionally,
we conduct ablations studying the impact of synthetic data quantity, quality
and diversity on model generalization. We find that higher quality, as measured
by problem difficulty, facilitates better in-distribution performance. Further,
while generating diverse synthetic data does not as strongly benefit
in-distribution performance, filtering for more diverse data facilitates more
robust OOD generalization. We also confirm the existence of model and data
scaling laws for synthetically generated problems, which positively benefit
downstream model generalization.

Result: 固定正则化强度实现了接近最优的收敛率O(log k / k)，而增加正则化强度的调度实现了最优收敛率O(1/k)。

Conclusion: 增加正则化系数或减少每任务步数的调度在理论上是最优的，尤其是在最坏情况下。

Abstract: We study realizable continual linear regression under random task orderings,
a common setting for developing continual learning theory. In this setup, the
worst-case expected loss after $k$ learning iterations admits a lower bound of
$\Omega(1/k)$. However, prior work using an unregularized scheme has only
established an upper bound of $O(1/k^{1/4})$, leaving a significant gap. Our
paper proves that this gap can be narrowed, or even closed, using two
frequently used regularization schemes: (1) explicit isotropic $\ell_2$
regularization, and (2) implicit regularization via finite step budgets. We
show that these approaches, which are used in practice to mitigate forgetting,
reduce to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on carefully defined surrogate
losses. Through this lens, we identify a fixed regularization strength that
yields a near-optimal rate of $O(\log k / k)$. Moreover, formalizing and
analyzing a generalized variant of SGD for time-varying functions, we derive an
increasing regularization strength schedule that provably achieves an optimal
rate of $O(1/k)$. This suggests that schedules that increase the regularization
coefficient or decrease the number of steps per task are beneficial, at least
in the worst case.

Conclusion: InstantFT实现了CNN对非平稳数据分布的实时适应，适用于物联网设备。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) requires significantly more computation
and memory than inference, making runtime adaptation of DNNs challenging on
resource-limited IoT platforms. We propose InstantFT, an FPGA-based method for
ultra-fast CNN fine-tuning on IoT devices, by optimizing the forward and
backward computations in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Experiments on
datasets with concept drift demonstrate that InstantFT fine-tunes a pre-trained
CNN 17.4x faster than existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-based approaches,
while achieving comparable accuracy. Our FPGA-based InstantFT reduces the
fine-tuning time to just 0.36s and improves energy-efficiency by 16.3x,
enabling on-the-fly adaptation of CNNs to non-stationary data distributions.

TLDR: 论文研究了在马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）中，基于间隙的遗憾界限问题，提出了一种名为Monotonic Value Propagation（MVP）的算法，并给出了其方差感知的遗憾上界和下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何更精确地量化MDP中的学习效率，特别是在考虑子最优间隙和方差的情况下。

Method: 采用了Monotonic Value Propagation（MVP）算法，并通过加权子最优间隙和方差的新颖分析，推导出遗憾上界。

Result: 结果显示MVP算法能够达到一个方差感知的遗憾上界，同时论文还建立了对应的下界，证明了方差依赖的必要性。

Conclusion: 结论表明，MVP算法在考虑子最优间隙和方差的情况下具有优越性能，且方差依赖是不可或缺的。

Abstract: We consider the gap-dependent regret bounds for episodic MDPs. We show that
the Monotonic Value Propagation (MVP) algorithm achieves a variance-aware
gap-dependent regret bound of $$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)>0}
\frac{H^2 \log K \land \mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_h(s,a)}
+\sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)=0}\frac{ H^2 \land
\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_{\mathrm{min}}} + SAH^4 (S \lor H)
\right) \log K\right),$$ where $H$ is the planning horizon, $S$ is the number
of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $K$ is the number of episodes.
Here, $\Delta_h(s,a) =V_h^* (a) - Q_h^* (s, a)$ represents the suboptimality
gap and $\Delta_{\mathrm{min}} := \min_{\Delta_h (s,a) > 0} \Delta_h(s,a)$. The
term $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$ denotes the maximum conditional total
variance, calculated as the maximum over all $(\pi, h, s)$ tuples of the
expected total variance under policy $\pi$ conditioned on trajectories visiting
state $s$ at step $h$. $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$ characterizes the
maximum randomness encountered when learning any $(h, s)$ pair. Our result
stems from a novel analysis of the weighted sum of the suboptimality gap and
can be potentially adapted for other algorithms. To complement the study, we
establish a lower bound of $$\Omega \left( \sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)>0} \frac{H^2
\land \mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_h(s,a)}\cdot \log K\right),$$
demonstrating the necessity of dependence on $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$
even when the maximum unconditional total variance (without conditioning on
$(h, s)$) approaches zero.

Conclusion: 基于LLM的知识驱动范式为下一代3D空中高速公路系统的开发提供了潜力。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted in various
real-world applications. However, the control and optimization of multi-UAV
systems remain a significant challenge, particularly in dynamic and constrained
environments. This work explores the joint motion and communication control of
multiple UAVs operating within integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial
networks that include high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). Specifically, we
consider an aerial highway scenario in which UAVs must accelerate, decelerate,
and change lanes to avoid collisions and maintain overall traffic flow.
Different from existing studies, we propose a novel hierarchical and
collaborative method based on large language models (LLMs). In our approach, an
LLM deployed on the HAPS performs UAV access control, while another LLM onboard
each UAV handles motion planning and control. This LLM-based framework
leverages the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained models to enable both
high-level strategic planning and low-level tactical decisions. This
knowledge-driven paradigm holds great potential for the development of
next-generation 3D aerial highway systems. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed collaborative LLM-based method achieves higher system
rewards, lower operational costs, and significantly reduced UAV collision rates
compared to baseline approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD中梯度裁剪阈值的设置对隐私与效用的平衡至关重要，现有方法未能考虑梯度坐标间的相关性。

Method: GeoClip在梯度分布的几何对齐基础上进行裁剪和扰动，自适应估计变换且不增加隐私成本。

Result: GeoClip在相同隐私预算下优于现有自适应裁剪方法，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: GeoClip通过几何感知优化梯度处理，显著提升了DP-SGD的性能。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most
widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy
guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient
clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy
and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting
this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system
and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We
propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients
in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution.
GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released
noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence
guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal
transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the
probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and
image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing
adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.

Abstract: As the development of autonomous and connected vehicles advances, the
complexity of modern vehicles increases, with numerous Electronic Control Units
(ECUs) integrated into the system. In an in-vehicle network, these ECUs
communicate with one another using an standard protocol called Controller Area
Network (CAN). Securing communication among ECUs plays a vital role in
maintaining the safety and security of the vehicle. This paper proposes a
robust SDN-based False Data Detection and Mitigation System (FDDMS) for
in-vehicle networks. Leveraging the unique capabilities of Software-Defined
Networking (SDN), FDDMS is designed to monitor and detect false data injection
attacks in real-time. Specifically, we focus on brake-related ECUs within an
SDN-enabled in-vehicle network. First, we decode raw CAN data to create an
attack model that illustrates how false data can be injected into the system.
Then, FDDMS, incorporating a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based detection
model, is used to identify false data injection attacks. We further propose an
effective variant of DeepFool attack to evaluate the model's robustness. To
countermeasure the impacts of four adversarial attacks including Fast gradient
descent method, Basic iterative method, DeepFool, and the DeepFool variant, we
further enhance a re-training technique method with a threshold based selection
strategy. Finally, a mitigation scheme is implemented to redirect attack
traffic by dynamically updating flow rules through SDN. Our experimental
results show that the proposed FDDMS is robust against adversarial attacks and
effectively detects and mitigates false data injection attacks in real-time.

Motivation: 解决数据驱动建模中物理对称性和约束的挑战，同时提升训练效率。

Method: 使用随机特征参数构建替代迭代优化算法（如Adam、RMSProp），训练Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN)。

Result: 在多种模拟中表现稳健，包括3维N体质量-弹簧系统，且无需重新训练即可泛化到4096节点系统。

Conclusion: 挑战了传统梯度下降优化算法在物理系统神经网络训练中的主导地位。

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems that respect physical symmetries and constraints
remains a fundamental challenge in data-driven modeling. Integrating physical
laws with graph neural networks facilitates principled modeling of complex
N-body dynamics and yields accurate and permutation-invariant models. However,
training graph neural networks with iterative, gradient-based optimization
algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, LBFGS) often leads to slow training,
especially for large, complex systems. In comparison to 15 different
optimizers, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) can be trained
up to 600x faster--but with comparable accuracy--by replacing iterative
optimization with random feature-based parameter construction. We show robust
performance in diverse simulations, including N-body mass-spring systems in up
to 3 dimensions with different geometries, while retaining essential physical
invariances with respect to permutation, rotation, and translation. We reveal
that even when trained on minimal 8-node systems, the model can generalize in a
zero-shot manner to systems as large as 4096 nodes without retraining. Our work
challenges the dominance of iterative gradient-descent-based optimization
algorithms for training neural network models for physical systems.

Result: SpectRe在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，增强图模型能力。

Conclusion: SpectRe是一种高效且稳定的拓扑描述符，适用于图表示学习。

Abstract: Including intricate topological information (e.g., cycles) provably enhances
the expressivity of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods
are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context,
recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and
edge features for improved expressivity. However, due to their dependence on
features, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural
information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor
for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably,
SpectRe is strictly more expressive than existing descriptors on graphs. We
also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing
descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments
on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe
and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant
learning tasks.

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括更快响应时间、基于任务复杂度的自适应模型选择，以及跨异构环境的可扩展部署，以提升语言模型系统的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Recent progress in Language Models (LMs) has dramatically advanced the field
of natural language processing (NLP), excelling at tasks like text generation,
summarization, and question answering. However, their inference remains
computationally expensive and energy intensive, especially in settings with
limited hardware, power, or bandwidth. This makes it difficult to deploy LMs in
mobile, edge, or cost sensitive environments. To address these challenges,
recent approaches have introduced multi LLM intelligent model selection
strategies that dynamically allocate computational resources based on query
complexity -- using lightweight models for simpler queries and escalating to
larger models only when necessary. This survey explores two complementary
strategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects the most
suitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical inference
(HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident
response is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using
lightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We
provide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance
metrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we
outline future research directions to enable faster response times, adaptive
model selection based on task complexity, and scalable deployment across
heterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems more efficient and
accessible for real world applications.

Abstract: Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
higher-order interactions in relational data. However, phenomena such as
oversquashing in topological message-passing remain understudied and lack
theoretical analysis. We propose a unifying axiomatic framework that bridges
graph and topological message-passing by viewing simplicial and cellular
complexes and their message-passing schemes through the lens of relational
structures. This approach extends graph-theoretic results and algorithms to
higher-order structures, facilitating the analysis and mitigation of
oversquashing in topological message-passing networks. Through theoretical
analysis and empirical studies on simplicial networks, we demonstrate the
potential of this framework to advance TDL.

Abstract: Learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) is a fundamental problem in machine
learning, with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and its popular
variant gradient EM being arguably the most widely used algorithms in practice.
In the exact-parameterized setting, where both the ground truth GMM and the
learning model have the same number of components $m$, a vast line of work has
aimed to establish rigorous recovery guarantees for EM. However, global
convergence has only been proven for the case of $m=2$, and EM is known to fail
to recover the ground truth when $m\geq 3$.
  In this paper, we consider the $\textit{over-parameterized}$ setting, where
the learning model uses $n>m$ components to fit an $m$-component ground truth
GMM. In contrast to the exact-parameterized case, we provide a rigorous global
convergence guarantee for gradient EM. Specifically, for any well separated
GMMs in general position, we prove that with only mild over-parameterization $n
= \Omega(m\log m)$, randomly initialized gradient EM converges globally to the
ground truth at a polynomial rate with polynomial samples. Our analysis
proceeds in two stages and introduces a suite of novel tools for Gaussian
Mixture analysis. We use Hermite polynomials to study the dynamics of gradient
EM and employ tensor decomposition to characterize the geometric landscape of
the likelihood loss. This is the first global convergence and recovery result
for EM or Gradient EM beyond the special case of $m=2$.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a promising uncertainty quantification framework
which works as a wrapper around a black-box classifier to construct prediction
sets (i.e., subset of candidate classes) with provable guarantees. However,
standard calibration methods for CP tend to produce large prediction sets which
makes them less useful in practice. This paper considers the problem of
integrating conformal principles into the training process of deep classifiers
to directly minimize the size of prediction sets. We formulate conformal
training as a bilevel optimization problem and propose the {\em Direct
Prediction Set Minimization (DPSM)} algorithm to solve it. The key insight
behind DPSM is to minimize a measure of the prediction set size (upper level)
that is conditioned on the learned quantile of conformity scores (lower level).
We analyze that DPSM has a learning bound of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ (with $n$ training
samples), while prior conformal training methods based on stochastic
approximation for the quantile has a bound of $\Omega(1/s)$ (with batch size
$s$ and typically $s \ll \sqrt{n}$). Experiments on various benchmark datasets
and deep models show that DPSM significantly outperforms the best prior
conformal training baseline with $20.46\%\downarrow$ in the prediction set size
and validates our theory.

Abstract: Several machine learning algorithms have been developed for the prediction of
Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) from spontaneous speech.
However, none of these algorithms have been translated for the prediction of
broader cognitive impairment (CI), which in some cases is a precursor and risk
factor of ADRD. In this paper, we evaluated several speech-based open-source
methods originally proposed for the prediction of ADRD, as well as methods from
multimodal sentiment analysis for the task of predicting CI from patient audio
recordings. Results demonstrated that multimodal methods outperformed unimodal
ones for CI prediction, and that acoustics-based approaches performed better
than linguistics-based ones. Specifically, interpretable acoustic features
relating to affect and prosody were found to significantly outperform
BERT-based linguistic features and interpretable linguistic features,
respectively. All the code developed for this study is available at

Abstract: While popular optimization methods such as SGD, AdamW, and Lion depend on
steepest descent updates in either $\ell_2$ or $\ell_\infty$ norms, there
remains a critical gap in handling the non-Euclidean structure observed in
modern deep networks training. In this work, we address this need by
introducing a new accelerated $\ell_p$ steepest descent algorithm, called
Stacey, which uses interpolated primal-dual iterate sequences to effectively
navigate non-Euclidean smooth optimization tasks. In addition to providing
novel theoretical guarantees for the foundations of our algorithm, we
empirically compare our approach against these popular methods on tasks
including image classification and language model (LLM) pretraining,
demonstrating both faster convergence and higher final accuracy. We further
evaluate different values of $p$ across various models and datasets,
underscoring the importance and efficiency of non-Euclidean approaches over
standard Euclidean methods. Code can be found at

Conclusion: E2H Reasoner是一种有效的方法，通过课程学习提升语言模型的推理能力，尤其适用于小型模型。

Abstract: We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via
reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1
have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks.
However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on
inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from
curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H),
allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H
Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important
initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in
preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for
E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive
finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately
decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer
total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show
that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs
(1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum machine learning have shown promise in
enhancing classical neural network architectures, particularly in domains
involving complex, high-dimensional data. Building upon prior work in temporal
sequence modeling, this paper introduces Vision-QRWKV, a hybrid
quantum-classical extension of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV)
architecture, applied for the first time to image classification tasks. By
integrating a variational quantum circuit (VQC) into the channel mixing
component of RWKV, our model aims to improve nonlinear feature transformation
and enhance the expressive capacity of visual representations.
  We evaluate both classical and quantum RWKV models on a diverse collection of
14 medical and standard image classification benchmarks, including MedMNIST
datasets, MNIST, and FashionMNIST. Our results demonstrate that the
quantum-enhanced model outperforms its classical counterpart on a majority of
datasets, particularly those with subtle or noisy class distinctions (e.g.,
ChestMNIST, RetinaMNIST, BloodMNIST). This study represents the first
systematic application of quantum-enhanced RWKV in the visual domain, offering
insights into the architectural trade-offs and future potential of quantum
models for lightweight and efficient vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于移动数据的隐私敏感性和数据孤岛问题，构建通用的移动性基础模型具有挑战性。

Method: MoveGCL采用生成式持续学习，通过冻结教师模型生成合成轨迹，并结合知识蒸馏和Mixture-of-Experts Transformer解决异构性问题。

Result: 在六个真实城市数据集上，MoveGCL性能接近联合训练，显著优于联邦学习基线，同时提供强隐私保护。

Conclusion: MoveGCL为移动性基础模型的发展提供了开放、可扩展且隐私保护的实用方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized fields such as natural language
processing and computer vision by enabling general-purpose learning across
diverse tasks and datasets. However, building analogous models for human
mobility remains challenging due to the privacy-sensitive nature of mobility
data and the resulting data silos across institutions. To bridge this gap, we
propose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training
mobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing
raw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by
replaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and
reinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that
mitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility
patterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a
mobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive
adaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates. Experiments on six
real-world urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance
comparable to joint training and significantly outperforms federated learning
baselines, while offering strong privacy protection. MoveGCL marks a crucial
step toward unlocking foundation models for mobility, offering a practical
blueprint for open, scalable, and privacy-preserving model development in the
era of foundation models.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) identifies the operating status and
energy consumption of each electrical device in the circuit by analyzing the
electrical signals at the bus, which is of great significance for smart power
management. However, the complex and changeable load combinations and
application environments lead to the challenges of poor feature robustness and
insufficient model generalization of traditional NILM methods. To this end,
this paper proposes a new non-intrusive load monitoring method that integrates
"image load signature" and continual learning. This method converts
multi-dimensional power signals such as current, voltage, and power factor into
visual image load feature signatures, and combines deep convolutional neural
networks to realize the identification and classification of multiple devices;
at the same time, self-supervised pre-training is introduced to improve feature
generalization, and continual online learning strategies are used to overcome
model forgetting to adapt to the emergence of new loads. This paper conducts a
large number of experiments on high-sampling rate load datasets, and compares a
variety of existing methods and model variants. The results show that the
proposed method has achieved significant improvements in recognition accuracy.

TLDR: Spark Transformer通过top-k掩码和统计top-k算法实现高激活稀疏性，保持模型质量的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有Transformer中激活稀疏性引入导致的模型质量下降、参数增加或训练复杂化问题。

Method: 采用top-k掩码和统计top-k算法控制稀疏性，并重新分配参数以低成本预测激活条目。

Result: 在Gemma-2预训练下，Spark Transformer在标准基准测试中表现优异，FFN神经元激活率仅8%，FLOPs减少2.5倍，解码速度提升1.79x（CPU）和1.40x（GPU）。

Conclusion: Spark Transformer在保持模型质量的同时，高效实现了激活稀疏性，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: The discovery of the lazy neuron phenomenon in trained Transformers, where
the vast majority of neurons in their feed-forward networks (FFN) are inactive
for each token, has spurred tremendous interests in activation sparsity for
enhancing large model efficiency. While notable progress has been made in
translating such sparsity to wall-time benefits, modern Transformers have moved
away from the ReLU activation function crucial to this phenomenon. Existing
efforts on re-introducing activation sparsity often degrade model quality,
increase parameter count, complicate or slow down training. Sparse attention,
the application of sparse activation to the attention mechanism, often faces
similar challenges.
  This paper introduces the Spark Transformer, a novel architecture that
achieves a high level of activation sparsity in both FFN and the attention
mechanism while maintaining model quality, parameter count, and standard
training procedures. Our method realizes sparsity via top-k masking for
explicit control over sparsity level. Crucially, we introduce statistical
top-k, a hardware-accelerator-friendly, linear-time approximate algorithm that
avoids costly sorting and mitigates significant training slowdown from standard
top-$k$ operators. Furthermore, Spark Transformer reallocates existing FFN
parameters and attention key embeddings to form a low-cost predictor for
identifying activated entries. This design not only mitigates quality loss from
enforced sparsity, but also enhances wall-time benefit. Pretrained with the
Gemma-2 recipe, Spark Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on
standard benchmarks while exhibiting significant sparsity: only 8% of FFN
neurons are activated, and each token attends to a maximum of 256 tokens. This
sparsity translates to a 2.5x reduction in FLOPs, leading to decoding wall-time
speedups of up to 1.79x on CPU and 1.40x on GPU.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 本文研究了高维稀疏线性回归在差分隐私（DP）下的问题，提出了两种方法（DP-IHT-H和DP-IHT-L），分别针对重尾数据和特定响应假设，改进了现有方法的误差界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DP线性回归方法主要针对常规数据分布或低维情况，无法有效处理高维稀疏数据和重尾响应。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 1. DP-IHT-H：结合Huber损失和私有迭代硬阈值技术，适用于重尾数据。
2. DP-IHT-L：在特定响应假设下进一步优化误差界。

Result: 1. DP-IHT-H的误差界为$\tilde{O}(s^{*1/2}(\log d/n)^{\zeta/(1+\zeta)}+s^{*\frac{1+2\zeta}{2+2\zeta}}(\log^2 d/n\varepsilon)^{\zeta/(1+\zeta)})$。
2. DP-IHT-L的误差界为$\tilde{O}((s^*)^{3/2}\log d/n\varepsilon)$，且与尾部参数无关。

Conclusion: 实验证明，本文方法在合成和真实数据集上优于传统DP算法，适用于高维稀疏和重尾数据场景。

Abstract: As a fundamental problem in machine learning and differential privacy (DP),
DP linear regression has been extensively studied. However, most existing
methods focus primarily on either regular data distributions or low-dimensional
cases with irregular data. To address these limitations, this paper provides a
comprehensive study of DP sparse linear regression with heavy-tailed responses
in high-dimensional settings. In the first part, we introduce the DP-IHT-H
method, which leverages the Huber loss and private iterative hard thresholding
to achieve an estimation error bound of \(
  \tilde{O}\biggl(
  s^{* \frac{1 }{2}}
  \cdot \biggl(\frac{\log d}{n}\biggr)^{\frac{\zeta}{1 + \zeta}}
  +
  s^{* \frac{1 + 2\zeta}{2 + 2\zeta}}
  \cdot \biggl(\frac{\log^2 d}{n \varepsilon}\biggr)^{\frac{\zeta}{1 + \zeta}}
  \biggr) \) under the $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP model, where $n$ is the
sample size, $d$ is the dimensionality, $s^*$ is the sparsity of the parameter,
and $\zeta \in (0, 1]$ characterizes the tail heaviness of the data. In the
second part, we propose DP-IHT-L, which further improves the error bound under
additional assumptions on the response and achieves \(
  \tilde{O}\Bigl(\frac{(s^*)^{3/2} \log d}{n \varepsilon}\Bigr). \) Compared to
the first result, this bound is independent of the tail parameter $\zeta$.
Finally, through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we
demonstrate that our methods outperform standard DP algorithms designed for
``regular'' data.

TLDR: SAFER是一个结合结构化电子健康记录和临床笔记的风险感知推荐框架，用于动态治疗策略（DTR），通过统计保证提供安全治疗建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DTR方法依赖临床黄金标准且未充分利用临床笔记，限制了治疗建议的可靠性。

Method: SAFER整合结构化数据和临床笔记，采用保形预测提供统计保证，处理标签不确定性。

Result: 在脓毒症数据集上，SAFER在推荐指标和反事实死亡率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAFER为高风险DTR应用提供了可信赖的理论基础解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) are critical to precision medicine,
optimizing long-term outcomes through personalized, real-time decision-making
in evolving clinical contexts, but require careful supervision for unsafe
treatment risks. Existing efforts rely primarily on clinician-prescribed gold
standards despite the absence of a known optimal strategy, and predominantly
using structured EHR data without extracting valuable insights from clinical
notes, limiting their reliability for treatment recommendations. In this work,
we introduce SAFER, a calibrated risk-aware tabular-language recommendation
framework for DTR that integrates both structured EHR and clinical notes,
enabling them to learn from each other, and addresses inherent label
uncertainty by assuming ambiguous optimal treatment solution for deceased
patients. Moreover, SAFER employs conformal prediction to provide statistical
guarantees, ensuring safe treatment recommendations while filtering out
uncertain predictions. Experiments on two publicly available sepsis datasets
demonstrate that SAFER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple
recommendation metrics and counterfactual mortality rate, while offering robust
formal assurances. These findings underscore SAFER potential as a trustworthy
and theoretically grounded solution for high-stakes DTR applications.

Motivation: 研究在上下文强化学习（ICRL）中，针对决策预训练变换器（DPT）的奖励中毒攻击的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 提出AT-DPT框架，同时训练攻击者通过毒化环境奖励最小化DPT的真实奖励，并训练DPT从毒化数据中推断最优动作。

Result: AT-DPT在强盗算法设置中显著优于基线方法，且在MDP设置中表现出类似的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AT-DPT能有效提升ICRL对奖励中毒攻击的鲁棒性，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: We study the corruption-robustness of in-context reinforcement learning
(ICRL), focusing on the Decision-Pretrained Transformer (DPT, Lee et al.,
2023). To address the challenge of reward poisoning attacks targeting the DPT,
we propose a novel adversarial training framework, called Adversarially Trained
Decision-Pretrained Transformer (AT-DPT). Our method simultaneously trains an
attacker to minimize the true reward of the DPT by poisoning environment
rewards, and a DPT model to infer optimal actions from the poisoned data. We
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach against standard bandit algorithms,
including robust baselines designed to handle reward contamination. Our results
show that the proposed method significantly outperforms these baselines in
bandit settings, under a learned attacker. We additionally evaluate AT-DPT on
an adaptive attacker, and observe similar results. Furthermore, we extend our
evaluation to the MDP setting, confirming that the robustness observed in
bandit scenarios generalizes to more complex environments.

Result: 实验表明RIF在真实数据集上预测效果优于IF，理论分析支持其改进。

Conclusion: RIF能有效检测IF无法识别的数据投毒攻击，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: How does the training data affect a model's behavior? This is the question we
seek to answer with data attribution. The leading practical approaches to data
attribution are based on influence functions (IF). IFs utilize a first-order
Taylor approximation to efficiently predict the effect of removing a set of
samples from the training set without retraining the model, and are used in a
wide variety of machine learning applications. However, especially in the
high-dimensional regime (# params $\geq \Omega($# samples$)$), they are often
imprecise and tend to underestimate the effect of sample removals, even for
simple models such as logistic regression. We present rescaled influence
functions (RIF), a new tool for data attribution which can be used as a drop-in
replacement for influence functions, with little computational overhead but
significant improvement in accuracy. We compare IF and RIF on a range of
real-world datasets, showing that RIFs offer significantly better predictions
in practice, and present a theoretical analysis explaining this improvement.
Finally, we present a simple class of data poisoning attacks that would fool
IF-based detections but would be detected by RIF.

Motivation: 解决传统线性边界传播方法在神经元耦合时过于宽松，而SDP方法因复杂度高难以扩展的问题。

Method: 提出SDP-CROWN框架，利用SDP原理推导新的线性边界，显式捕获神经元耦合，并保持可扩展性。

Result: 理论证明新边界比传统方法紧致√n倍，实践验证在大型模型上性能显著提升，接近SDP方法的紧致性。

Conclusion: SDP-CROWN在保持可扩展性的同时，显著提升了验证的紧致性，适用于大规模模型。

Abstract: Neural network verifiers based on linear bound propagation scale impressively
to massive models but can be surprisingly loose when neuron coupling is
crucial. Conversely, semidefinite programming (SDP) verifiers capture
inter-neuron coupling naturally, but their cubic complexity restricts them to
only small models. In this paper, we propose SDP-CROWN, a novel hybrid
verification framework that combines the tightness of SDP relaxations with the
scalability of bound-propagation verifiers. At the core of SDP-CROWN is a new
linear bound, derived via SDP principles, that explicitly captures
$\ell_{2}$-norm-based inter-neuron coupling while adding only one extra
parameter per layer. This bound can be integrated seamlessly into any linear
bound-propagation pipeline, preserving the inherent scalability of such methods
yet significantly improving tightness. In theory, we prove that our
inter-neuron bound can be up to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$ tighter than traditional
per-neuron bounds. In practice, when incorporated into the state-of-the-art
$\alpha$-CROWN verifier, we observe markedly improved verification performance
on large models with up to 65 thousand neurons and 2.47 million parameters,
achieving tightness that approaches that of costly SDP-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设查询成本对称，但实际中某些查询可能更昂贵（如触发额外审查的类别），需要更高效的算法。

Method: 提出不对称搜索（AS）和不对称梯度估计（AGREST），优化查询类型平衡以减少总成本。

Result: 在各种成本设置下，新方法总查询成本和扰动大小均优于现有方法，某些场景提升达40%。

Conclusion: 新框架能有效应对不对称查询成本问题，且易于集成到现有攻击方法中。

Abstract: Traditional decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on image classifiers
aim to generate adversarial examples by slightly modifying input images while
keeping the number of queries low, where each query involves sending an input
to the model and observing its output. Most existing methods assume that all
queries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric
costs; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may
trigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly
than others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,
effective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we
propose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query
costs, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core
components of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation
process. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative
variant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and
Asymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution
to favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total
attack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods
such as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)
queries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box
attacks with minimal changes. We perform both theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks. Across
various cost regimes, our method consistently achieves lower total query cost
and smaller perturbations than existing approaches, with improvements of up to
40% in some settings.

Abstract: Line-breaking passes (LBPs) are crucial tactical actions in football,
allowing teams to penetrate defensive lines and access high-value spaces. In
this study, we present an unsupervised, clustering-based framework for
detecting and analysing LBPs using synchronised event and tracking data from
elite matches. Our approach models opponent team shape through vertical spatial
segmentation and identifies passes that disrupt defensive lines within open
play. Beyond detection, we introduce several tactical metrics, including the
space build-up ratio (SBR) and two chain-based variants, LBPCh$^1$ and
LBPCh$^2$, which quantify the effectiveness of LBPs in generating immediate or
sustained attacking threats. We evaluate these metrics across teams and players
in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, revealing stylistic differences in vertical
progression and structural disruption. The proposed methodology is explainable,
scalable, and directly applicable to modern performance analysis and scouting
workflows.

Conclusion: HetCRF通过创新设计和策略，有效解决了异构图自监督学习中的关键问题，验证了其优越性。

Abstract: In graph self-supervised learning, masked autoencoders (MAE) and contrastive
learning (CL) are two prominent paradigms. MAE focuses on reconstructing masked
elements, while CL maximizes similarity between augmented graph views. Recent
studies highlight their complementarity: MAE excels at local feature capture,
and CL at global information extraction. Hybrid frameworks for homogeneous
graphs have been proposed, but face challenges in designing shared encoders to
meet the semantic requirements of both tasks. In semantically sparse scenarios,
CL struggles with view construction, and gradient imbalance between positive
and negative samples persists. This paper introduces HetCRF, a novel
dual-channel self-supervised learning framework for heterogeneous graphs.
HetCRF uses a two-stage aggregation strategy to adapt embedding semantics,
making it compatible with both MAE and CL. To address semantic sparsity, it
enhances encoder output for view construction instead of relying on raw
features, improving efficiency. Two positive sample augmentation strategies are
also proposed to balance gradient contributions. Node classification
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HetCRF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. On datasets with missing node
features, such as Aminer and Freebase, at a 40% label rate in node
classification, HetCRF improves the Macro-F1 score by 2.75% and 2.2%
respectively compared to the second-best baseline, validating its effectiveness
and superiority.

Abstract: We address the problem of machine unlearning, where the goal is to remove the
influence of specific training data from a model upon request, motivated by
privacy concerns and regulatory requirements such as the "right to be
forgotten." Unfortunately, existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions or
lack formal guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel method for certified
machine unlearning, leveraging the connection between unlearning and privacy
amplification by stochastic post-processing. Our method uses noisy fine-tuning
on the retain data, i.e., data that does not need to be removed, to ensure
provable unlearning guarantees. This approach requires no assumptions about the
underlying loss function, making it broadly applicable across diverse settings.
We analyze the theoretical trade-offs in efficiency and accuracy and
demonstrate empirically that our method not only achieves formal unlearning
guarantees but also performs effectively in practice, outperforming existing
baselines. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLMs能够拒绝恶意提示（如越狱攻击）是安全可靠使用的关键，但现有方法缺乏理论支持，导致安全性和实用性之间的权衡不足。

Method: AlphaSteer通过两个学习目标（实用性保留和安全性增强）优化激活引导，利用零空间约束和线性回归分别处理良性数据和恶意数据。

Result: 实验表明，AlphaSteer显著提升了LLMs的安全性，同时未损害其通用能力。

Conclusion: AlphaSteer为LLMs的安全性和实用性提供了理论支持的有效解决方案。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their
ability to refuse malicious prompts, especially jailbreak attacks, is essential
for safe and reliable use. Recently, activation steering has emerged as an
effective approach for enhancing LLM safety by adding a refusal direction
vector to internal activations of LLMs during inference, which will further
induce the refusal behaviors of LLMs. However, indiscriminately applying
activation steering fundamentally suffers from the trade-off between safety and
utility, since the same steering vector can also lead to over-refusal and
degraded performance on benign prompts. Although prior efforts, such as vector
calibration and conditional steering, have attempted to mitigate this
trade-off, their lack of theoretical grounding limits their robustness and
effectiveness. To better address the trade-off between safety and utility, we
present a theoretically grounded and empirically effective activation steering
method called AlphaSteer. Specifically, it considers activation steering as a
learnable process with two principled learning objectives: utility preservation
and safety enhancement. For utility preservation, it learns to construct a
nearly zero vector for steering benign data, with the null-space constraints.
For safety enhancement, it learns to construct a refusal direction vector for
steering malicious data, with the help of linear regression. Experiments across
multiple jailbreak attacks and utility benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
of AlphaSteer, which significantly improves the safety of LLMs without
compromising general capabilities. Our codes are available at

selection and ordering of demonstration examples. To address this, we present
MarginSel: Max-Margin Demonstration Selection for LLMs, a two-step method that
selects hard demonstration examples for the ICL prompt, adapting to each test
instance. Our approach achieves 2-7% absolute improvement in F1-score across
classification tasks, compared to a random selection of examples. We also
provide theoretical insights and empirical evidence showing that MarginSel
induces max-margin behavior in LLMs by effectively increasing the margin for
hard examples, analogous to support vectors, thereby shifting the decision
boundary in a beneficial direction.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种新的Transformer架构（SPT）和可解释AI技术（Sequence Score），用于高效预测蛋白质功能，并在两个数据集上取得了高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索蛋白质Transformer是否能捕捉蛋白质序列中的生物智能。

Method: 1. 引入Protein-FN数据集；2. 设计SPT架构；3. 开发Sequence Score技术。

Result: SPT-Tiny模型在AR和Protein-FN数据集上分别达到94.3%和99.6%的准确率。Sequence Score揭示了与生物学知识一致的序列模式。

Conclusion: SPT模型能高效预测蛋白质功能，且Sequence Score技术有助于解释其决策过程，验证了其生物智能捕捉能力。

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly Transformers, have been widely adopted for
predicting the functional properties of proteins. In this work, we focus on
exploring whether Protein Transformers can capture biological intelligence
among protein sequences. To achieve our goal, we first introduce a protein
function dataset, namely Protein-FN, providing over 9000 protein data with
meaningful labels. Second, we devise a new Transformer architecture, namely
Sequence Protein Transformers (SPT), for computationally efficient protein
function predictions. Third, we develop a novel Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) technique called Sequence Score, which can efficiently
interpret the decision-making processes of protein models, thereby overcoming
the difficulty of deciphering biological intelligence bided in Protein
Transformers. Remarkably, even our smallest SPT-Tiny model, which contains only
5.4M parameters, demonstrates impressive predictive accuracy, achieving 94.3%
on the Antibiotic Resistance (AR) dataset and 99.6% on the Protein-FN dataset,
all accomplished by training from scratch. Besides, our Sequence Score
technique helps reveal that our SPT models can discover several meaningful
patterns underlying the sequence structures of protein data, with these
patterns aligning closely with the domain knowledge in the biology community.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于Stein变分梯度下降（SVGD）的新方法SVH-MOL，用于在多目标学习中高效且多样地逼近Pareto集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在最大化超体积值的同时难以保证Pareto解的多样性，SVH-MOL旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用SVGD逼近Pareto集，通过功能梯度下降推动粒子集收敛并多样化；结合多样化梯度方向策略和退火调度以提升稳定性。

Result: 在多种多目标问题和多任务学习任务中验证了SVH-MOL的优越性能。

Conclusion: SVH-MOL是一种高效且稳定的方法，能够同时优化多样性和超体积值。

Abstract: Pareto Set Learning (PSL) is popular as an efficient approach to obtaining
the complete optimal solution in Multi-objective Learning (MOL). A set of
optimal solutions approximates the Pareto set, and its mapping is a set of
dense points in the Pareto front in objective space. However, some current
methods face a challenge: how to make the Pareto solution is diverse while
maximizing the hypervolume value. In this paper, we propose a novel method to
address this challenge, which employs Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)
to approximate the entire Pareto set. SVGD pushes a set of particles towards
the Pareto set by applying a form of functional gradient descent, which helps
to converge and diversify optimal solutions. Additionally, we employ diverse
gradient direction strategies to thoroughly investigate a unified framework for
SVGD in multi-objective optimization and adapt this framework with an annealing
schedule to promote stability. We introduce our method, SVH-MOL, and validate
its effectiveness through extensive experiments on multi-objective problems and
multi-task learning, demonstrating its superior performance.

*Adrià Molina Rodríguez,Oriol Ramos Terrades,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 本文提出了一种通过模型编辑技术增强低资源语言识别能力的方法，显著提升了模型在新字母表和跨域评估中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如古代手稿和非西方语言）在识别系统中代表性不足的问题，提升模型的泛化能力。

Method: 利用模型编辑技术，结合领域合并策略，优化稀疏数据分布下的学习效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在迁移学习和跨域评估中表现优异，尤其是在历史加密文本和非拉丁字母表上。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建能够快速适应低资源字母表的模型提供了新思路，扩展了文档识别的应用范围。

Abstract: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial
for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed,
low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages,
tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational
techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building
models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets,
faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage
of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of
unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art
meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse
distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall
distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact
training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in
\textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain
evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts
and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building
models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable
document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

TLDR: JavelinGuard是一套低成本、高性能的模型架构，用于检测大型语言模型（LLM）交互中的恶意意图，专为生产部署优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对LLM交互中的恶意意图检测需求，利用先进的Transformer架构设计高效、低成本的模型。

Method: 探索了五种逐步复杂的Transformer架构，包括Sharanga、Mahendra、Vaishnava、Ashwina和Raudra，并在九个对抗数据集上进行了基准测试。

Result: Raudra的多任务设计表现最稳健，但每种架构在速度、可解释性和资源需求上各有优劣。

Conclusion: 研究为实际LLM安全应用提供了模型选择的指导，平衡复杂性和效率。

Abstract: We present JavelinGuard, a suite of low-cost, high-performance model
architectures designed for detecting malicious intent in Large Language Model
(LLM) interactions, optimized specifically for production deployment. Recent
advances in transformer architectures, including compact BERT(Devlin et al.
2019) variants (e.g., ModernBERT (Warner et al. 2024)), allow us to build
highly accurate classifiers with as few as approximately 400M parameters that
achieve rapid inference speeds even on standard CPU hardware. We systematically
explore five progressively sophisticated transformer-based architectures:
Sharanga (baseline transformer classifier), Mahendra (enhanced
attention-weighted pooling with deeper heads), Vaishnava and Ashwina (hybrid
neural ensemble architectures), and Raudra (an advanced multi-task framework
with specialized loss functions). Our models are rigorously benchmarked across
nine diverse adversarial datasets, including popular sets like the NotInject
series, BIPIA, Garak, ImprovedLLM, ToxicChat, WildGuard, and our newly
introduced JavelinBench, specifically crafted to test generalization on
challenging borderline and hard-negative cases. Additionally, we compare our
architectures against leading open-source guardrail models as well as large
decoder-only LLMs such as gpt-4o, demonstrating superior cost-performance
trade-offs in terms of accuracy, and latency. Our findings reveal that while
Raudra's multi-task design offers the most robust performance overall, each
architecture presents unique trade-offs in speed, interpretability, and
resource requirements, guiding practitioners in selecting the optimal balance
of complexity and efficiency for real-world LLM security applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为FIND的方法，通过特征实例邻居发现解决深度神经网络在测试时分布变化下的性能下降问题，显著提升了动态场景下的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练和测试分布变化时性能下降，影响应用体验。现有测试时适应方法难以应对动态多分布场景。

Method: FIND包含三个关键组件：LFD（层间特征解耦）、FABN（特征感知批量归一化）和S-FABN（选择性FABN），分别用于稳定特征捕获、优化特征表示和提升推理效率。

Result: 实验表明，FIND在动态场景下准确率提升30%，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: FIND通过特征分组和自适应归一化策略，有效解决了测试时分布变化问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines
under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a
substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for applications. Existing
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test
distributions within batches. We observe that feature distributions across
different domains inherently cluster into distinct groups with varying means
and variances. This divergence reveals a critical limitation of previous global
normalization strategies in TTA, which inevitably distort the original data
characteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Feature-based Instance
Neighbor Discovery (FIND), which comprises three key components: Layer-wise
Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN) and
Selective FABN (S-FABN). LFD stably captures features with similar
distributions at each layer by constructing graph structures. While FABN
optimally combines source statistics with test-time distribution specific
statistics for robust feature representation. Finally, S-FABN determines which
layers require feature partitioning and which can remain unified, thereby
enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIND
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 30\% accuracy
improvement in dynamic scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消息传递图神经网络（MPGNNs）追求最大表达能力，但缺乏高效的聚合能力。本文旨在通过牺牲部分表达能力，实现更强且结构化的聚合。

Method: 引入了一种高效的聚合机制，通过广义的caterpillar图层次结构中的同态计数来严格表征表达能力，并设计了Caterpillar GNN。

Result: Caterpillar GNN在合成图任务中表现出色，同时在真实数据集上实现了可比的预测性能，并显著减少了计算图中隐藏层的节点数量。

Conclusion: 通过高效的聚合机制，Caterpillar GNN在保持性能的同时优化了计算效率，为图学习提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPGNNs) dominate modern graph
learning, typically prioritizing maximal expressive power. In contrast, we
introduce an \emph{efficient aggregation} mechanism, deliberately trading off
some expressivity for stronger and more structured aggregation capabilities.
Our approach allows seamless scaling between classical message-passing and
simpler methods based on colored or plain walks. We rigorously characterize the
expressive power at each intermediate step using homomorphism counts from a
hierarchy of generalized \emph{caterpillar graphs}. Based on this foundation,
we propose the \emph{Caterpillar GNN}, whose robust graph-level aggregation
enables it to successfully tackle synthetic graph-level task specifically
designed to be challenging for classical MPGNNs. Moreover, we demonstrate that,
on real-world datasets, the Caterpillar GNN achieves comparable predictive
performance while significantly reducing the number of nodes in the hidden
layers of the computational graph.

Conclusion: FuncGNN有效解决了电路表示中的结构异质性和信息丢失问题，显著提升了逻辑电路分析的性能与效率。

Abstract: As integrated circuit scale grows and design complexity rises, effective
circuit representation helps support logic synthesis, formal verification, and
other automated processes in electronic design automation. And-Inverter Graphs
(AIGs), as a compact and canonical structure, are widely adopted for
representing Boolean logic in these workflows. However, the increasing
complexity and integration density of modern circuits introduce structural
heterogeneity and global logic information loss in AIGs, posing significant
challenges to accurate circuit modeling. To address these issues, we propose
FuncGNN, which integrates hybrid feature aggregation to extract
multi-granularity topological patterns, thereby mitigating structural
heterogeneity and enhancing logic circuit representations. FuncGNN further
introduces gate-aware normalization that adapts to circuit-specific gate
distributions, improving robustness to structural heterogeneity. Finally,
FuncGNN employs multi-layer integration to merge intermediate features across
layers, effectively synthesizing local and global semantic information for
comprehensive logic representations. Experimental results on two logic-level
analysis tasks (i.e., signal probability prediction and truth-table distance
prediction) demonstrate that FuncGNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods, achieving improvements of 2.06% and 18.71%, respectively, while
reducing training time by approximately 50.6% and GPU memory usage by about
32.8%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示文本分类模型在标记化策略中的漏洞，这些漏洞可能被利用绕过保护机制，导致目标模型（如LLM或邮件接收者）仍受到攻击。

Method: 提出TokenBreak攻击方法，通过操纵输入文本使模型错误分类，同时分析模型家族以预测其脆弱性。

Result: TokenBreak成功绕过保护模型，展示了标记化策略的漏洞，并提出了一种无需重新训练防御模型的防护策略。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了文本分类模型在标记化策略中的安全隐患，并提供了防御方案，强调了模型架构与安全性的关联。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are used for text-related tasks such
as classification and generation. To complete these tasks, input data is first
tokenized from human-readable text into a format the model can understand,
enabling it to make inferences and understand context. Text classification
models can be implemented to guard against threats such as prompt injection
attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs), toxic input and cybersecurity
risks such as spam emails. In this paper, we introduce TokenBreak: a novel
attack that can bypass these protection models by taking advantage of the
tokenization strategy they use. This attack technique manipulates input text in
such a way that certain models give an incorrect classification. Importantly,
the end target (LLM or email recipient) can still understand and respond to the
manipulated text and therefore be vulnerable to the very attack the protection
model was put in place to prevent. The tokenizer is tied to model architecture,
meaning it is possible to predict whether or not a model is vulnerable to
attack based on family. We also present a defensive strategy as an added layer
of protection that can be implemented without having to retrain the defensive
model.

*Zixuan Dong,Yumi Omori,Keith Ross*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 本文提出两种简单的启发式方法替代基于最优传输（OT）的逆强化学习（IRL），证明其性能相当或更优，并指出OT的核心优势可能源于基本对齐而非复杂优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于OT的IRL方法存在算法复杂度高、超参数敏感等问题，本文挑战OT的必要性，提出更简单的方法。

Method: 提出两种启发式奖励函数：(1) 最小距离奖励；(2) 分段匹配奖励，避免优化且复杂度低。

Result: 在32个基准测试中，两种简单方法匹配或优于OT方法。

Conclusion: OT的核心优势可能来自基本对齐，未来IRL设计应重新评估复杂度。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function from
expert demonstrations. Recently, Optimal Transport (OT) methods have been
successfully deployed to align trajectories and infer rewards. While OT-based
methods have shown strong empirical results, they introduce algorithmic
complexity, hyperparameter sensitivity, and require solving the OT optimization
problems. In this work, we challenge the necessity of OT in IRL by proposing
two simple, heuristic alternatives: (1) Minimum-Distance Reward, which assigns
rewards based on the nearest expert state regardless of temporal order; and (2)
Segment-Matching Reward, which incorporates lightweight temporal alignment by
matching agent states to corresponding segments in the expert trajectory. These
methods avoid optimization, exhibit linear-time complexity, and are easy to
implement. Through extensive evaluations across 32 online and offline
benchmarks with three reinforcement learning algorithms, we show that our
simple rewards match or outperform recent OT-based approaches. Our findings
suggest that the core benefits of OT may arise from basic proximity alignment
rather than its optimal coupling formulation, advocating for reevaluation of
complexity in future IRL design.

Conclusion: 该工作为复杂图场景中的鲁棒表示学习提供了新思路，并探讨了生成式自监督学习在异构图中的未来方向。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have been increasingly applied to
diverse downstream tasks due to their superior generalization capabilities and
low annotation costs. However, most existing heterogeneous graph SSL models
convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones via meta-paths for training,
which only leverage information from nodes at both ends of meta-paths while
underutilizing the heterogeneous node information along the meta-paths. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework named IMPA-HGAE
to enhance target node embeddings by fully exploiting internal node information
along meta-paths. Experimental results validate that IMPA-HGAE achieves
superior performance on heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, this paper
introduce innovative masking strategies to strengthen the representational
capacity of generative SSL models on heterogeneous graph data. Additionally,
this paper discuss the interpretability of the proposed method and potential
future directions for generative self-supervised learning in heterogeneous
graphs. This work provides insights into leveraging meta-path-guided structural
semantics for robust representation learning in complex graph scenarios.

Result: 在2至1,247维任务中表现良好，但在15.9k参数的高维任务中探索能力不足。

Conclusion: 该方法在低维任务中表现优异，但在高维环境中需进一步改进适应性。

Abstract: We present an early investigation into the use of neural diffusion processes
for global optimisation, focusing on Zhang et al.'s Path Integral Sampler. One
can use the Boltzmann distribution to formulate optimization as solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge sampling problem, then apply Girsanov's theorem with a
simple (single-point) prior to frame it in stochastic control terms, and
compute the solution's integral terms via a neural approximation (a Fourier
MLP). We provide theoretical bounds for this optimiser, results on toy
optimisation tasks, and a summary of the stochastic theory motivating the
model. Ultimately, we found the optimiser to display promising per-step
performance at optimisation tasks between 2 and 1,247 dimensions, but struggle
to explore higher-dimensional spaces when faced with a 15.9k parameter model,
indicating a need for work on adaptation in such environments.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，CEMS在分布内和分布外场景中均优于现有方法，且计算开销小。

Conclusion: CEMS为回归任务提供了一种高效的数据增强方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models with a large number of parameters, often referred to as
over-parameterized models, have achieved exceptional performance across various
tasks. Despite concerns about overfitting, these models frequently generalize
well to unseen data, thanks to effective regularization techniques, with data
augmentation being among the most widely used. While data augmentation has
shown great success in classification tasks using label-preserving
transformations, its application in regression problems has received less
attention. Recently, a novel \emph{manifold learning} approach for generating
synthetic data was proposed, utilizing a first-order approximation of the data
manifold. Building on this foundation, we present a theoretical framework and
practical tools for approximating and sampling general data manifolds.
Furthermore, we introduce the Curvature-Enhanced Manifold Sampling (CEMS)
method for regression tasks. CEMS leverages a second-order representation of
the data manifold to enable efficient sampling and reconstruction of new data
points. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets and comparisons with
state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that CEMS delivers superior performance in
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, while introducing only
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

Conclusion: FA-INR为基于INR的替代模型在精度和紧凑性之间建立了新的前沿。

Abstract: Effective surrogate models are critical for accelerating scientific
simulations. Implicit neural representations (INRs) offer a compact and
continuous framework for modeling spatially structured data, but they often
struggle with complex scientific fields exhibiting localized, high-frequency
variations. Recent approaches address this by introducing additional features
along rigid geometric structures (e.g., grids), but at the cost of flexibility
and increased model size. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
alternative: Feature-Adaptive INR (FA-INR). FA-INR leverages cross-attention to
an augmented memory bank to learn flexible feature representations, enabling
adaptive allocation of model capacity based on data characteristics, rather
than rigid structural assumptions. To further improve scalability, we introduce
a coordinate-guided mixture of experts (MoE) that enhances the specialization
and efficiency of feature representations. Experiments on three large-scale
ensemble simulation datasets show that FA-INR achieves state-of-the-art
fidelity while significantly reducing model size, establishing a new trade-off
frontier between accuracy and compactness for INR-based surrogates.

Conclusion: SAFE方法通过同时优化稀疏性和平坦性，显著提升了稀疏网络的性能，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: Sparsifying neural networks often suffers from seemingly inevitable
performance degradation, and it remains challenging to restore the original
performance despite much recent progress. Motivated by recent studies in robust
optimization, we aim to tackle this problem by finding subnetworks that are
both sparse and flat at the same time. Specifically, we formulate pruning as a
sparsity-constrained optimization problem where flatness is encouraged as an
objective. We solve it explicitly via an augmented Lagrange dual approach and
extend it further by proposing a generalized projection operation, resulting in
novel pruning methods called SAFE and its extension, SAFE$^+$. Extensive
evaluations on standard image classification and language modeling tasks reveal
that SAFE consistently yields sparse networks with improved generalization
performance, which compares competitively to well-established baselines. In
addition, SAFE demonstrates resilience to noisy data, making it well-suited for
real-world conditions.

Abstract: Off-policy learning and evaluation leverage logged bandit feedback datasets,
which contain context, action, propensity score, and feedback for each data
point. These scenarios face significant challenges due to high variance and
poor performance with low-quality propensity scores and heavy-tailed reward
distributions. We address these issues by introducing a novel estimator based
on the log-sum-exponential (LSE) operator, which outperforms traditional
inverse propensity score estimators. Our LSE estimator demonstrates variance
reduction and robustness under heavy-tailed conditions. For off-policy
evaluation, we derive upper bounds on the estimator's bias and variance. In the
off-policy learning scenario, we establish bounds on the regret -- the
performance gap between our LSE estimator and the optimal policy -- assuming
bounded $(1+\epsilon)$-th moment of weighted reward. Notably, we achieve a
convergence rate of $O(n^{-\epsilon/(1+ \epsilon)})$ for the regret bounds,
where $\epsilon \in [0,1]$ and $n$ is the size of logged bandit feedback
dataset. Theoretical analysis is complemented by comprehensive empirical
evaluations in both off-policy learning and evaluation scenarios, confirming
the practical advantages of our approach. The code for our estimator is

*Divya Jyoti Bajpai,Manjesh Kumar Hanawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为FREE的方法，通过对抗训练在GAN框架中优化视觉语言模型的早期退出策略，以提高推理速度并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在性能提升的同时，其大尺寸导致推理延迟问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用对抗训练方法（FREE），每个退出点包含一个Transformer层和分类器，通过生成与最终层相似的特征表示来优化推理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将推理速度提升1.51倍以上，同时保持性能，并缓解了过度思考和中间危机现象。

Conclusion: FREE方法有效提升了VLMs的推理效率和鲁棒性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
performance improvements in Vision-Language tasks. However, their large size
poses challenges for real-world applications where inference latency is a
concern. To tackle this issue, we propose employing Early Exit (EE) strategies
in VLMs. However, training exit classifiers in VLMs is challenging,
particularly with limited labeled training data. To address this, we introduce
FREE, an adversarial training approach within a GAN-based framework. Here, each
exit consists of a transformer layer and a classifier. The transformer layer is
adversarially trained to produce feature representations similar to the final
layer, while a feature classifier serves as the discriminator. Our method
focuses on performing input-adaptive inference that increases inference speed
with minimal drop in performance. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing accuracy and model robustness by
mitigating overthinking and the phenomenon of mid-crisis that we highlight. We
experimentally validate that our method speeds up the inference process by more
than 1.51x while retaining comparable performance. The source code is available

*Jihao Andreas Lin,Sebastian Ament,Maximilian Balandat,David Eriksson,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Eytan Bakshy*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出一种利用潜在Kronecker结构的方法，解决高斯过程在大规模数据集上的计算瓶颈，优于现有稀疏和变分方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯过程在大数据集上的计算可扩展性受限，现有Kronecker结构方法因缺失数据或非网格输入而失效。

Method: 通过将观测值核矩阵表示为潜在Kronecker积的投影，结合迭代线性系统求解器和路径条件，实现高效计算。

Result: 在多达五百万样本的真实数据集（如机器人、自动机器学习和气候应用）上，性能优于现有稀疏和变分高斯过程方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模高斯过程推断提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Applying Gaussian processes (GPs) to very large datasets remains a challenge
due to limited computational scalability. Matrix structures, such as the
Kronecker product, can accelerate operations significantly, but their
application commonly entails approximations or unrealistic assumptions. In
particular, the most common path to creating a Kronecker-structured kernel
matrix is by evaluating a product kernel on gridded inputs that can be
expressed as a Cartesian product. However, this structure is lost if any
observation is missing, breaking the Cartesian product structure, which
frequently occurs in real-world data such as time series. To address this
limitation, we propose leveraging latent Kronecker structure, by expressing the
kernel matrix of observed values as the projection of a latent Kronecker
product. In combination with iterative linear system solvers and pathwise
conditioning, our method facilitates inference of exact GPs while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than standard iterative methods. We
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art sparse and variational
GPs on real-world datasets with up to five million examples, including
robotics, automated machine learning, and climate applications.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在分布外检测任务中优于现有方法，能够有效捕捉空间和时间的不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法为图数据中的不确定性估计提供了一种新思路，尤其在标签信息丰富度不同的情况下表现优越。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have achieved impressive results across diverse network
modeling tasks, but accurately estimating uncertainty on graphs remains
difficult, especially under distributional shifts. Unlike traditional
uncertainty estimation, graph-based uncertainty must account for randomness
arising from both the graph's structure and its label distribution, which adds
complexity. In this paper, making an analogy between the evolution of a
stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by Matern Gaussian
Process and message passing using GNN layers, we present a principled way to
design a novel message passing scheme that incorporates spatial-temporal noises
motivated by the Gaussian Process approach to SPDE. Our method simultaneously
captures uncertainty across space and time and allows explicit control over the
covariance kernel smoothness, thereby enhancing uncertainty estimates on graphs
with both low and high label informativeness. Our extensive experiments on
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection on graph datasets with varying label
informativeness demonstrate the soundness and superiority of our model to
existing approaches.

Conclusion: GraPhy的设计有效提升了空气质量建模的精度和分辨率，尤其适用于监测数据稀疏的区域。

Abstract: This work introduces GraPhy, a graph-based, physics-guided learning framework
for high-resolution and accurate air quality modeling in urban areas with
limited monitoring data. Fine-grained air quality monitoring information is
essential for reducing public exposure to pollutants. However, monitoring
networks are often sparse in socioeconomically disadvantaged regions, limiting
the accuracy and resolution of air quality modeling. To address this, we
propose a physics-guided graph neural network architecture called GraPhy with
layers and edge features designed specifically for low-resolution monitoring
data. Experiments using data from California's socioeconomically disadvantaged
San Joaquin Valley show that GraPhy achieves the overall best performance
evaluated by mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-square
value (R2), improving the performance by 9%-56% compared to various baseline
models. Moreover, GraPhy consistently outperforms baselines across different
spatial heterogeneity levels, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model
design.

Abstract: Dealing with tabular data is challenging due to partial information, noise,
and heterogeneous structure. Existing techniques often struggle to
simultaneously address key aspects of tabular data such as textual information,
a variable number of columns, and unseen data without metadata besides column
names. We propose a novel architecture, \textit{basis transformers},
specifically designed to tackle these challenges while respecting inherent
invariances in tabular data, including hierarchical structure and the
representation of numeric values. We evaluate our design on a multi-task
tabular regression benchmark, achieving an improvement of 0.338 in the median
$R^2$ score and the lowest standard deviation across 34 tasks from the
OpenML-CTR23 benchmark. Furthermore, our model has five times fewer parameters
than the best-performing baseline and surpasses pretrained large language model
baselines -- even when initialized from randomized weights.

Conclusion: 研究提供了对神经网络训练中锐化动态的深入理解，强调了深度、训练数据和优化器之间的相互作用。

Abstract: When training deep neural networks with gradient descent, sharpness often
increases -- a phenomenon known as progressive sharpening -- before saturating
at the edge of stability. Although commonly observed in practice, the
underlying mechanisms behind progressive sharpening remain poorly understood.
In this work, we study this phenomenon using a minimalist model: a deep linear
network with a single neuron per layer. We show that this simple model
effectively captures the sharpness dynamics observed in recent empirical
studies, offering a simple testbed to better understand neural network
training. Moreover, we theoretically analyze how dataset properties, network
depth, stochasticity of optimizers, and step size affect the degree of
progressive sharpening in the minimalist model. We then empirically demonstrate
how these theoretical insights extend to practical scenarios. This study offers
a deeper understanding of sharpness dynamics in neural network training,
highlighting the interplay between depth, training data, and optimizers.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于分位数和CVaR的风险正则化强化学习算法，解决了传统RL方法在随机环境中的高估偏差和安全约束问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流RL算法在高方差随机环境中存在高估偏差，导致策略不佳，且现有方法难以满足安全约束。

Method: 结合分位数回归和CVaR，提出风险正则化算法，并证明其在Wasserstein空间中的收敛性。

Result: 仿真实验表明，该方法在动态任务中实现了更高的目标成功率、更少的碰撞和更好的安全性能权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了RL中的高估偏差和安全约束问题，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Mainstream approximate action-value iteration reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms suffer from overestimation bias, leading to suboptimal policies in
high-variance stochastic environments. Quantile-based action-value iteration
methods reduce this bias by learning a distribution of the expected cost-to-go
using quantile regression. However, ensuring that the learned policy satisfies
safety constraints remains a challenge when these constraints are not
explicitly integrated into the RL framework. Existing methods often require
complex neural architectures or manual tradeoffs due to combined cost
functions. To address this, we propose a risk-regularized quantile-based
algorithm integrating Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to enforce safety
without complex architectures. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the
contraction properties of the risk-sensitive distributional Bellman operator in
Wasserstein space, ensuring convergence to a unique cost distribution.
Simulations of a mobile robot in a dynamic reach-avoid task show that our
approach leads to more goal successes, fewer collisions, and better
safety-performance trade-offs compared to risk-neutral methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床预测中患者数据分布变化导致模型性能下降，且缺乏明确的领域标签和医学知识整合，亟需一种新方法解决这些问题。

Method: 利用ICD-9-CM层次结构分组疾病，提出UdonCare框架，通过迭代修剪细粒度领域、编码领域信息，并采用Siamese推理机制分离领域信号与患者特征。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上，UdonCare在领域差异显著时表现优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: UdonCare展示了医学知识在提升领域泛化能力方面的潜力，为实际医疗应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Domain generalization has become a critical challenge in clinical prediction,
where patient cohorts often exhibit shifting data distributions that degrade
model performance. Typical domain generalization approaches struggle in
real-world healthcare settings for two main reasons: (1) patient-specific
domain labels are typically unavailable, making domain discovery especially
difficult; (2) purely data-driven approaches overlook key clinical insights,
leading to a gap in medical knowledge integration. To address these problems,
we leverage hierarchical medical ontologies like the ICD-9-CM hierarchy to
group diseases into higher-level categories and discover more flexible latent
domains. In this paper, we introduce UdonCare, a hierarchy-guided framework
that iteratively prunes fine-grained domains, encodes these refined domains,
and applies a Siamese-type inference mechanism to separate domain-related
signals from patient-level features. Experimental results on clinical datasets
(MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) show that the proposed model achieves higher
performance compared to other domain generalization baselines when substantial
domain gaps presents, highlighting the untapped potential of medical knowledge
for enhancing domain generalization in practical healthcare applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献中关于1-identification问题的非渐近分析尚未明确，作者旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了新算法Sequential-Exploration-Exploitation (SEE)，并从非渐近角度进行理论分析。

Result: 算法SEE在拉动复杂度上实现了接近最优的上下界匹配，差距仅为多项式对数因子。数值结果也表明其优于现有基准。

Conclusion: SEE算法在非渐近分析中表现出色，填补了现有文献的空白，并提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Motivated by an open direction in existing literature, we study the
1-identification problem, a fundamental multi-armed bandit formulation on pure
exploration. The goal is to determine whether there exists an arm whose mean
reward is at least a known threshold $\mu_0$, or to output None if it believes
such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct
with probability at least $1-\delta$. Degenne & Koolen 2019 has established the
asymptotically tight sample complexity for the 1-identification problem, but
they commented that the non-asymptotic analysis remains unclear. We design a
new algorithm Sequential-Exploration-Exploitation (SEE), and conduct
theoretical analysis from the non-asymptotic perspective. Novel to the
literature, we achieve near optimality, in the sense of matching upper and
lower bounds on the pulling complexity. The gap between the upper and lower
bounds is up to a polynomial logarithmic factor. The numerical result also
indicates the effectiveness of our algorithm, compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: MoXGATE在多组学癌症亚型分类中表现出色，具有高性能和生物通用性。

Abstract: Cancer subtype classification is crucial for personalized treatment and
prognostic assessment. However, effectively integrating multi-omic data remains
challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of genomic, epigenomic, and
transcriptomic features. In this work, we propose Modality-Aware
Cross-Attention MoXGATE, a novel deep-learning framework that leverages
cross-attention and learnable modality weights to enhance feature fusion across
multiple omics sources. Our approach effectively captures inter-modality
dependencies, ensuring robust and interpretable integration. Through
experiments on Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinoma (GIAC) and Breast Cancer (BRCA)
datasets from TCGA, we demonstrate that MoXGATE outperforms existing methods,
achieving 95\% classification accuracy. Ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of cross-attention over simple concatenation and highlight the
importance of different omics modalities. Moreover, our model generalizes well
to unseen cancer types e.g., breast cancer, underscoring its adaptability. Key
contributions include (1) a cross-attention-based multi-omic integration
framework, (2) modality-weighted fusion for enhanced interpretability, (3)
application of focal loss to mitigate data imbalance, and (4) validation across
multiple cancer subtypes. Our results indicate that MoXGATE is a promising
approach for multi-omic cancer subtype classification, offering improved
performance and biological generalizability.

Result: 在WBC和MNIST数据集上实现了高预测性能，显著降低了模型复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维大数据集提供了一种透明且高效的替代方案，适用于需要信任和清晰度的领域。

Abstract: Building on existing work with Hyperblocks, which classify data using minimum
and maximum bounds for each attribute, we focus on enhancing interpretability,
decreasing training time, and reducing model complexity without sacrificing
accuracy. This system allows subject matter experts (SMEs) to directly inspect
and understand the model's decision logic without requiring extensive machine
learning expertise. To reduce Hyperblock complexity while retaining
performance, we introduce a suite of algorithms for Hyperblock simplification.
These include removing redundant attributes, removing redundant blocks through
overlap analysis, and creating disjunctive units. These methods eliminate
unnecessary parameters, dramatically reducing model size without harming
classification power. We increase robustness by introducing an interpretable
fallback mechanism using k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers for points not
covered by any block, ensuring complete data coverage while preserving model
transparency. Our results demonstrate that interpretable models can scale to
high-dimensional, large-volume datasets while maintaining competitive accuracy.
On benchmark datasets such as WBC (9-D), we achieve strong predictive
performance with significantly reduced complexity. On MNIST (784-D), our method
continues to improve through tuning and simplification, showing promise as a
transparent alternative to black-box models in domains where trust, clarity,
and control are crucial.

Result: 数值实验表明，改进方法能提供更优的局部解，降低聚类损失。

Conclusion: 改进后的K-means算法在局部最优性上表现更优，且计算效率不变。

Abstract: The K-means algorithm is one of the most widely studied clustering algorithms
in machine learning. While extensive research has focused on its ability to
achieve a globally optimal solution, there still lacks a rigorous analysis of
its local optimality guarantees. In this paper, we first present conditions
under which the K-means algorithm converges to a locally optimal solution.
Based on this, we propose simple modifications to the K-means algorithm which
ensure local optimality in both the continuous and discrete sense, with the
same computational complexity as the original K-means algorithm. As the
dissimilarity measure, we consider a general Bregman divergence, which is an
extension of the squared Euclidean distance often used in the K-means
algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm that the K-means algorithm does not
always find a locally optimal solution in practice, while our proposed methods
provide improved locally optimal solutions with reduced clustering loss. Our
code is available at https://github.com/lmingyi/LO-K-means.

Result: 在海上和城市数据集上验证，模型在异常检测和轨迹生成方面具有更高准确性和更低误差率。

Conclusion: 物理信息扩散模型能有效检测异常轨迹，为遏制非法活动提供技术支持。

Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined
threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS
spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb
illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and
illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI
generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories)
and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification.
Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection
using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider
fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting
in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a
physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to
identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results
on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed
framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate
for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our
implementation is available at

Conclusion: ProbHardE2E是一个通用且灵活的概率预测框架，能够有效结合硬约束和不确定性量化，适用于多种领域。

Abstract: We present a general purpose probabilistic forecasting framework,
ProbHardE2E, to learn systems that can incorporate operational/physical
constraints as hard requirements. ProbHardE2E enforces hard constraints by
exploiting variance information in a novel way; and thus it is also capable of
performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the model. Our methodology uses a
novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL) that can be combined
with a wide range of neural network architectures. This DPPL allows the model
to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where
the constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at
inference. In addition, ProbHardE2E can optimize a strictly proper scoring
rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which
enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing
approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are
heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it
can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of
modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E to problems in learning partial
differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic
time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general setup
that connects these seemingly disparate domains.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness detection (DDD) prevents road accidents caused by driver
fatigue. Vehicle dynamics-based DDD has been proposed as a method that is both
economical and high performance. However, there are concerns about the
reliability of performance metrics and the reproducibility of many of the
existing methods. For instance, some previous studies seem to have a data
leakage issue among training and test datasets, and many do not openly provide
the datasets they used. To this end, this paper aims to compare the performance
of representative vehicle dynamics-based DDD methods under a transparent and
fair framework that uses a public dataset. We first develop a framework for
extracting features from an open dataset by Aygun et al. and performing DDD
with lightweight ML models; the framework is carefully designed to support a
variety of onfigurations. Second, we implement three existing representative
methods and a concise random forest (RF)-based method in the framework.
Finally, we report the results of experiments to verify the reproducibility and
clarify the performance of DDD based on common metrics. Among the evaluated
methods, the RF-based method achieved the highest accuracy of 88 %. Our
findings imply the issues inherent in DDD methods developed in a non-standard
manner, and demonstrate a high performance method implemented appropriately.

Abstract: Tabular data serve as a fundamental and ubiquitous representation of
structured information in numerous real-world applications, e.g., finance and
urban planning. In the realm of tabular imbalanced applications, data imbalance
has been investigated in classification tasks with insufficient instances in
certain labels, causing the model's ineffective generalizability. However, the
imbalance issue of tabular regression tasks is underexplored, and yet is
critical due to unclear boundaries for continuous labels and simplifying
assumptions in existing imbalance regression work, which often rely on known
and balanced test distributions. Such assumptions may not hold in practice and
can lead to performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose MATI:
Mixture Experts with Test-Time Self-Supervised Aggregation for Tabular
Imbalance Regression, featuring two key innovations: (i) the Region-Aware
Mixture Expert, which adopts a Gaussian Mixture Model to capture the underlying
related regions. The statistical information of each Gaussian component is then
used to synthesize and train region-specific experts to capture the unique
characteristics of their respective regions. (ii) Test-Time Self-Supervised
Expert Aggregation, which dynamically adjusts region expert weights based on
test data features to reinforce expert adaptation across varying test
distributions. We evaluated MATI on four real-world tabular imbalance
regression datasets, including house pricing, bike sharing, and age prediction.
To reflect realistic deployment scenarios, we adopted three types of test
distributions: a balanced distribution with uniform target frequencies, a
normal distribution that follows the training data, and an inverse distribution
that emphasizes rare target regions. On average across these three test
distributions, MATI achieved a 7.1% improvement in MAE compared to existing
methods.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present the first $Q$-learning and actor-critic algorithms for robust
average reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with non-asymptotic convergence
under contamination, TV distance and Wasserstein distance uncertainty sets. We
show that the robust $Q$ Bellman operator is a strict contractive mapping with
respect to a carefully constructed semi-norm with constant functions being
quotiented out. This property supports a stochastic approximation update, that
learns the optimal robust $Q$ function in $\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples.
We also show that the same idea can be used for robust $Q$ function estimation,
which can be further used for critic estimation. Coupling it with theories in
robust policy mirror descent update, we present a natural actor-critic
algorithm that attains an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy in
$\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-3})$ samples. These results advance the theory of
distributionally robust reinforcement learning in the average reward setting.

Conclusion: FairPFN为复杂公平问题提供了更易用的因果公平解决方案，推动了未来研究。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are utilized in critical sectors, such as
healthcare, law enforcement, and finance. However, these systems are often
trained on historical data that contains demographic biases, leading to ML
decisions that perpetuate or exacerbate existing social inequalities. Causal
fairness provides a transparent, human-in-the-loop framework to mitigate
algorithmic discrimination, aligning closely with legal doctrines of direct and
indirect discrimination. However, current causal fairness frameworks hold a key
limitation in that they assume prior knowledge of the correct causal model,
restricting their applicability in complex fairness scenarios where causal
models are unknown or difficult to identify. To bridge this gap, we propose
FairPFN, a tabular foundation model pre-trained on synthetic causal fairness
data to identify and mitigate the causal effects of protected attributes in its
predictions. FairPFN's key contribution is that it requires no knowledge of the
causal model and still demonstrates strong performance in identifying and
removing protected causal effects across a diverse set of hand-crafted and
real-world scenarios relative to robust baseline methods. FairPFN paves the way
for promising future research, making causal fairness more accessible to a
wider variety of complex fairness problems.

Conclusion: PGTS通过树搜索提升策略梯度方法的全局优化能力，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Classical policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently
converge to suboptimal local optima, a challenge exacerbated in large or
complex environments. This work investigates Policy Gradient with Tree Search
(PGTS), an approach that integrates an $m$-step lookahead mechanism to enhance
policy optimization. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that
increasing the tree search depth $m$-monotonically reduces the set of
undesirable stationary points and, consequently, improves the worst-case
performance of any resulting stationary policy. Critically, our analysis
accommodates practical scenarios where policy updates are restricted to states
visited by the current policy, rather than requiring updates across the entire
state space. Empirical evaluations on diverse MDP structures, including Ladder,
Tightrope, and Gridworld environments, illustrate PGTS's ability to exhibit
"farsightedness," navigate challenging reward landscapes, escape local traps
where standard PG fails, and achieve superior solutions.

Motivation: 语音基础模型在真实场景中因声学域偏移（如背景噪声和口音）性能下降，现有测试时间适应方法要么内存消耗大，要么准确性低。

Method: E-BATS通过轻量级提示适应、多尺度损失和测试时指数移动平均机制，实现高效且稳定的适应。

Result: 在四个噪声语音数据集上的实验表明，E-BATS比无反向传播基线准确率提高4.1%-13.5%，比基于反向传播的方法节省2.0-6.4倍GPU内存。

Conclusion: E-BATS为实际语音处理系统在声学变化下的高效适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Speech Foundation Models encounter significant performance degradation when
deployed in real-world scenarios involving acoustic domain shifts, such as
background noise and speaker accents. Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently
emerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time
without requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA
approaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are
memory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and
resource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer
improved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy. This is because they
are predominantly developed for vision tasks, which fundamentally differ from
speech task formulations, noise characteristics, and model architecture, posing
unique transferability challenges. In this paper, we introduce E-BATS, the
first Efficient BAckpropagation-free TTA framework designed explicitly for
speech foundation models. E-BATS achieves a balance between adaptation
effectiveness and memory efficiency through three key components: (i)
lightweight prompt adaptation for a forward-pass-based feature alignment, (ii)
a multi-scale loss to capture both global (utterance-level) and local
distribution shifts (token-level) and (iii) a test-time exponential moving
average mechanism for stable adaptation across utterances. Experiments
conducted on four noisy speech datasets spanning sixteen acoustic conditions
demonstrate consistent improvements, with 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over
backpropagation-free baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings compared to
backpropagation-based methods. By enabling scalable and robust adaptation under
acoustic variability, this work paves the way for developing more efficient
adaptation approaches for practical speech processing systems in real-world
environments.

Motivation: 状态熵正则化在强化学习中表现出更好的探索性和样本效率，但其理论保证尚未被充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，并分析其在面对常见但被忽视的结构化扰动时的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，对比状态熵正则化和策略熵正则化在不同扰动条件下的表现，并探讨其鲁棒性优势的敏感性。

Result: 状态熵正则化在结构化扰动下表现更优，但其鲁棒性优势对策略评估中使用的样本数量更敏感。

Conclusion: 状态熵正则化在特定条件下具有显著的鲁棒性优势，但实际应用中需注意其对样本数量的敏感性。

Abstract: State entropy regularization has empirically shown better exploration and
sample complexity in reinforcement learning (RL). However, its theoretical
guarantees have not been studied. In this paper, we show that state entropy
regularization improves robustness to structured and spatially correlated
perturbations. These types of variation are common in transfer learning but
often overlooked by standard robust RL methods, which typically focus on small,
uncorrelated changes. We provide a comprehensive characterization of these
robustness properties, including formal guarantees under reward and transition
uncertainty, as well as settings where the method performs poorly. Much of our
analysis contrasts state entropy with the widely used policy entropy
regularization, highlighting their different benefits. Finally, from a
practical standpoint, we illustrate that compared with policy entropy, the
robustness advantages of state entropy are more sensitive to the number of
rollouts used for policy evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法是经典MLE渐近置信区间的非渐近推广，适用于非线性预测器（如神经网络）。

Abstract: We consider a high-probability non-asymptotic confidence estimation in the
$\ell^2$-regularized non-linear least-squares setting with fixed design. In
particular, we study confidence estimation for local minimizers of the
regularized training loss. We show a pointwise confidence bound, meaning that
it holds for the prediction on any given fixed test input $x$. Importantly, the
proposed confidence bound scales with similarity of the test input to the
training data in the implicit feature space of the predictor (for instance,
becoming very large when the test input lies far outside of the training data).
This desirable last feature is captured by the weighted norm involving the
inverse-Hessian matrix of the objective function, which is a generalized
version of its counterpart in the linear setting, $x^{\top} \text{Cov}^{-1} x$.
Our generalized result can be regarded as a non-asymptotic counterpart of the
classical confidence interval based on asymptotic normality of the MLE
estimator. We propose an efficient method for computing the weighted norm,
which only mildly exceeds the cost of a gradient computation of the loss
function. Finally, we complement our analysis with empirical evidence showing
that the proposed confidence bound provides better coverage/width trade-off
compared to a confidence estimation by bootstrapping, which is a gold-standard
method in many applications involving non-linear predictors such as neural
networks.

Conclusion: 提出的DPSC方法在性能和效率上均有显著提升，为临床决策支持提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Patient similarity computation (PSC) is a fundamental problem in healthcare
informatics. The aim of the patient similarity computation is to measure the
similarity among patients according to their historical clinical records, which
helps to improve clinical decision support. This paper presents a novel
distributed patient similarity computation (DPSC) technique based on data
transformation (DT) methods, utilizing an effective combination of time series
and static data. Time series data are sensor-collected patients' information,
including metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, Oxygen saturation,
respiration, etc. The static data are mainly patient background and demographic
data, including age, weight, height, gender, etc. Static data has been used for
clustering the patients. Before feeding the static data to the machine learning
model adaptive Weight-of-Evidence (aWOE) and Z-score data transformation (DT)
methods have been performed, which improve the prediction performances. In
aWOE-based patient similarity models, sensitive patient information has been
processed using aWOE which preserves the data privacy of the trained models. We
used the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach, which is robust and very popular,
for time series similarity. However, DTW is not suitable for big data due to
the significant computational run-time. To overcome this problem, distributed
DTW computation is used in this study. For Coronary Artery Disease, our DT
based approach boosts prediction performance by as much as 11.4%, 10.20%, and
12.6% in terms of AUC, accuracy, and F-measure, respectively. In the case of
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), our proposed method achieves performance
enhancement up to 15.9%, 10.5%, and 21.9% for the same measures, respectively.
The proposed method reduces the computation time by as high as 40%.

Conclusion: CoFILL通过创新架构解决了时空数据填补中的关键问题，为实际应用提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Missing data in spatiotemporal systems presents a significant challenge for
modern applications, ranging from environmental monitoring to urban traffic
management. The integrity of spatiotemporal data often deteriorates due to
hardware malfunctions and software failures in real-world deployments. Current
approaches based on machine learning and deep learning struggle to model the
intricate interdependencies between spatial and temporal dimensions effectively
and, more importantly, suffer from cumulative errors during the data imputation
process, which propagate and amplify through iterations. To address these
limitations, we propose CoFILL, a novel Conditional Diffusion Model for
spatiotemporal data imputation. CoFILL builds on the inherent advantages of
diffusion models to generate high-quality imputations without relying on
potentially error-prone prior estimates. It incorporates an innovative
dual-stream architecture that processes temporal and frequency domain features
in parallel. By fusing these complementary features, CoFILL captures both rapid
fluctuations and underlying patterns in the data, which enables more robust
imputation. The extensive experiments reveal that CoFILL's noise prediction
network successfully transforms random noise into meaningful values that align
with the true data distribution. The results also show that CoFILL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy. The source code is publicly

Result: 实验验证了所提方法的通用性和有效性，表明语言模型先验与学习字符串嵌入空间可以突破传统BBO的障碍。

Conclusion: 通过结合语言模型先验和学习字符串嵌入空间，论文为通用BBO算法的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: The pursuit of universal black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms is a
longstanding goal. However, unlike domains such as language or vision, where
scaling structured data has driven generalization, progress in offline BBO
remains hindered by the lack of unified representations for heterogeneous
numerical spaces. Thus, existing offline BBO approaches are constrained to
single-task and fixed-dimensional settings, failing to achieve cross-domain
universal optimization. Recent advances in language models (LMs) offer a
promising path forward: their embeddings capture latent relationships in a
unifying way, enabling universal optimization across different data types
possible. In this paper, we discuss multiple potential approaches, including an
end-to-end learning framework in the form of next-token prediction, as well as
prioritizing the learning of latent spaces with strong representational
capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of these methods, we collect
offline BBO tasks and data from open-source academic works for training.
Experiments demonstrate the universality and effectiveness of our proposed
methods. Our findings suggest that unifying language model priors and learning
string embedding space can overcome traditional barriers in universal BBO,
paving the way for general-purpose BBO algorithms. The code is provided at

Result: 实验表明，QDRT生成的攻击在多样性和有效性上均优于现有方法，适用于多种目标LLM。

Conclusion: QDRT为LLM安全提供了一种系统且有效的自动化红队方法，支持LLM的负责任部署。

Abstract: Ensuring safety of large language models (LLMs) is important. Red teaming--a
systematic approach to identifying adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
responses from target LLMs--has emerged as a crucial safety evaluation method.
Within this framework, the diversity of adversarial prompts is essential for
comprehensive safety assessments. We find that previous approaches to
red-teaming may suffer from two key limitations. First, they often pursue
diversity through simplistic metrics like word frequency or sentence embedding
similarity, which may not capture meaningful variation in attack strategies.
Second, the common practice of training a single attacker model restricts
coverage across potential attack styles and risk categories. This paper
introduces Quality-Diversity Red-Teaming (QDRT), a new framework designed to
address these limitations. QDRT achieves goal-driven diversity through
behavior-conditioned training and implements a behavioral replay buffer in an
open-ended manner. Additionally, it trains multiple specialized attackers
capable of generating high-quality attacks across diverse styles and risk
categories. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that QDRT generates attacks
that are both more diverse and more effective against a wide range of target
LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5. This work advances the
field of LLM safety by providing a systematic and effective approach to
automated red-teaming, ultimately supporting the responsible deployment of
LLMs.

Result: RPI不仅保证了单调性，其值估计还下界真实回报，且在经典控制任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RPI是首个在函数逼近下具有单调性和收敛性保证的算法，可无缝集成到主流模型无关策略迭代实现中。

Abstract: Despite decades of research, it remains challenging to correctly use
Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms with function approximation. A prime
example is policy iteration, whose fundamental guarantee of monotonic
improvement collapses even under linear function approximation. To address this
issue, we introduce Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI). It replaces the common
projection or Bellman-error minimization during policy evaluation with a
Bellman-based constrained optimization. We prove that not only does RPI confer
textbook monotonicity on its value estimates but these estimates also lower
bound the true return. Also, their limit partially satisfies the unprojected
Bellman equation, emphasizing RPI's natural fit within RL. RPI is the first
algorithm with such monotonicity and convergence guarantees under function
approximation. For practical use, we provide a model-free variant of RPI that
amounts to a novel critic. It can be readily integrated into primary model-free
PI implementations such as DQN and DDPG. In classical control tasks, such
RPI-enhanced variants consistently maintain their lower-bound guarantee while
matching or surpassing the performance of all baseline methods.

Abstract: Existing multi-objective preference alignment methods for large language
models (LLMs) face limitations: (1) the inability to effectively balance
various preference dimensions, and (2) reliance on auxiliary reward/reference
models introduces computational complexity. To address these challenges, we
propose Adaptive Multi-objective Preference Optimization (AMoPO), a novel
framework that achieves dynamic balance across preference dimensions. By
introducing the multi-objective optimization paradigm to use the
dimension-aware generation metrics as implicit rewards, AMoPO aligns LLMs with
diverse preferences without additional reward models or reference models. We
introduce an adaptive weight assignment mechanism that models the generation
space as a Gaussian distribution, allowing dynamic prioritization of preference
dimensions. Empirical results demonstrate that AMoPO outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 28.5%, and the experiments on 7B, 14B, and 32B
models reveal the scaling ability of AMoPO. Moreover, additional analysis of
multiple dimensions verifies its adaptability and effectiveness. These findings
validate AMoPO's capability to achieve dimension-aware preference alignment,
highlighting its superiority. Our codes and datasets are available at

Abstract: In the realm of Text-attributed Graphs (TAGs), traditional graph neural
networks (GNNs) often fall short due to the complex textual information
associated with each node. Recent methods have improved node representations by
leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance node text features, but
these approaches typically require extensive annotations or fine-tuning across
all nodes, which is both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GAGA, an efficient framework for TAG representation
learning. GAGA reduces annotation time and cost by focusing on annotating only
representative nodes and edges. It constructs an annotation graph that captures
the topological relationships among these annotations. Furthermore, GAGA
employs a two-level alignment module to effectively integrate the annotation
graph with the TAG, aligning their underlying structures. Experiments show that
GAGA achieves classification accuracies on par with or surpassing
state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 1% of the data to be annotated,
demonstrating its high efficiency.

Conclusion: RAGL通过正则化和高效计算，显著提升了交通预测的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a critical task in spatial-temporal forecasting with
broad applications in travel planning and urban management. Adaptive graph
convolution networks have emerged as mainstream solutions due to their ability
to learn node embeddings in a data-driven manner and capture complex latent
dependencies. However, existing adaptive graph learning methods for traffic
forecasting often either ignore the regularization of node embeddings, which
account for a significant proportion of model parameters, or face scalability
issues from expensive graph convolution operations. To address these
challenges, we propose a Regularized Adaptive Graph Learning (RAGL) model.
First, we introduce a regularized adaptive graph learning framework that
synergizes Stochastic Shared Embedding (SSE) and adaptive graph convolution via
a residual difference mechanism, achieving both embedding regularization and
noise suppression. Second, to ensure scalability on large road networks, we
develop the Efficient Cosine Operator (ECO), which performs graph convolution
based on the cosine similarity of regularized embeddings with linear time
complexity. Extensive experiments on four large-scale real-world traffic
datasets show that RAGL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of prediction accuracy and exhibits competitive computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel learning approach based on Neurovectors, an
innovative paradigm that structures information through interconnected nodes
and vector relationships for tabular data processing. Unlike traditional
artificial neural networks that rely on weight adjustment through
backpropagation, Neurovectors encode information by structuring data in vector
spaces where energy propagation, rather than traditional weight updates, drives
the learning process, enabling a more adaptable and explainable learning
process. Our method generates dynamic representations of knowledge through
neurovectors, thereby improving both the interpretability and efficiency of the
predictive model. Experimental results using datasets from well-established
repositories such as the UCI machine learning repository and Kaggle are
reported both for classification and regression. To evaluate its performance,
we compare our approach with standard machine learning and deep learning
models, showing that Neurovectors achieve competitive accuracy.

Abstract: This study employs a robust analytical framework to uncover patterns in
survival outcomes among breast cancer patients from diverse racial and
geographical backgrounds. This research uses the SEER 2021 dataset to analyze
breast cancer survival outcomes to identify and comprehend dissimilarities. Our
approach integrates exploratory data analysis (EDA), through this we identify
key variables that influence survival rates and employ survival analysis
techniques, including the Kaplan-Meier estimator and log-rank test and the
advanced modeling Cox Proportional Hazards model to determine how survival
rates vary across racial groups and countries. Model validation and
interpretation are undertaken to ensure the reliability of our findings, which
are documented comprehensively to inform policymakers and healthcare
professionals. The outcome of this paper is a detailed version of statistical
analysis that not just highlights disparities in breast cancer treatment and
care but also serves as a foundational tool for developing targeted
interventions to address the inequalities effectively. Through this research,
our aim is to contribute to the global efforts to improve breast cancer
outcomes and reduce treatment disparities.

Motivation: 由于欧几里得几何在捕捉指数复杂度方面的局限性，生成具有层次结构的图仍是一个挑战。

Method: GGBall结合了双曲向量量化自编码器（HVQVAE）和基于闭式测地线的黎曼流匹配先验，并开发了双曲GNN和Transformer层。

Result: 在Community-Small和Ego-Small数据集上，GGBall分别减少了75%和40%的度MMD，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为复杂、结构化且层次化的数据生成提供了强大基础。

Abstract: Generating graphs with hierarchical structures remains a fundamental
challenge due to the limitations of Euclidean geometry in capturing exponential
complexity. Here we introduce \textbf{GGBall}, a novel hyperbolic framework for
graph generation that integrates geometric inductive biases with modern
generative paradigms. GGBall combines a Hyperbolic Vector-Quantized Autoencoder
(HVQVAE) with a Riemannian flow matching prior defined via closed-form
geodesics. This design enables flow-based priors to model complex latent
distributions, while vector quantization helps preserve the curvature-aware
structure of the hyperbolic space. We further develop a suite of hyperbolic GNN
and Transformer layers that operate entirely within the manifold, ensuring
stability and scalability. Empirically, our model reduces degree MMD by over
75\% on Community-Small and over 40\% on Ego-Small compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating an improved ability to preserve topological
hierarchies. These results highlight the potential of hyperbolic geometry as a
powerful foundation for the generative modeling of complex, structured, and
hierarchical data domains. Our code is available at

Method: 提出Perception-R1，通过视觉感知奖励激励模型准确感知视觉内容，并利用标注的视觉参考和评判LLM进行奖励分配。

Result: 在多个多模态推理基准测试中，Perception-R1仅用1,442训练数据即达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Perception-R1有效提升了MLLMs的感知与推理能力，为多模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in
the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the
reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the
enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a
core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning.
Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively
enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their
further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we
propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that
explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby
can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning
capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from
the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual
references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM
to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses
generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these
consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.

Motivation: 显式结构化推理技术在测试时表现出强大的扩展性，但推理长度对答案质量有重要影响。过短可能无法捕捉任务复杂性，过长可能导致过度思考和性能下降。

Method: 1. 展示LLMs如何编码推理进度，并引入交互式进度条可视化；2. 在推理过程中操纵内部进度编码以减少冗余步骤，生成更简洁的思维链。

Result: 实验结果表明，“超频”方法有效减少过度思考，提高答案准确性，并降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: 通过调节推理长度，可以优化LLMs的显式推理过程，提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Recently, techniques such as explicit structured reasoning have demonstrated
strong test-time scaling behavior by enforcing a separation between the model's
internal "thinking" process and the final response. A key factor influencing
answer quality in this setting is the length of the thinking stage. When the
reasoning is too short, the model may fail to capture the complexity of the
task. Conversely, when it is too long, the model may overthink, leading to
unnecessary computation and degraded performance. This paper explores and
exploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the
length of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show
that LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an
interactive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights
on the model's planning dynamics. Second, we manipulate the internal progress
encoding during inference to reduce unnecessary steps and generate a more
concise and decisive chain of thoughts. Our empirical results demonstrate that
this "overclocking" method mitigates overthinking, improves answer accuracy,
and reduces inference latency. Our code is publicly available.

connects the distributional population loss with the approximate posterior,
motivating a practical dual optimization procedure that enforces distributional

against various baseline methods using the VTAB-1K benchmark and the common

Result: SPlus在验证性能上比Adam节省44%的梯度步骤和62%的墙钟时间。

Conclusion: SPlus在稳定性和效率上显著改进，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: In this work, we take an experimentally grounded look at neural network
optimization. Building on the Shampoo family of algorithms, we identify and
alleviate three key issues, resulting in the proposed SPlus method. First, we
find that naive Shampoo is prone to divergence when matrix-inverses are cached
for long periods. We introduce an alternate bounded update combining a
historical eigenbasis with instantaneous normalization, resulting in
across-the-board stability and significantly lower computational requirements.
Second, we adapt a shape-aware scaling to enable learning rate transfer across
network width. Third, we find that high learning rates result in large
parameter noise, and propose a simple iterate-averaging scheme which unblocks
faster learning. To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed
Transformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language
modelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different
stages of training. On average, SPlus is able to reach the validation
performance of Adam within 44% of the gradient steps and 62% of the wallclock
time.

Motivation: 现有基于数据量的奖励机制易被操纵，代理人可能提交虚假或低质量数据。

Conclusion: 新机制在理论和实践中均能有效激励真实数据共享，放宽了先前工作的限制。

Abstract: Modern data marketplaces and data sharing consortia increasingly rely on
incentive mechanisms to encourage agents to contribute data. However, schemes
that reward agents based on the quantity of submitted data are vulnerable to
manipulation, as agents may submit fabricated or low-quality data to inflate
their rewards. Prior work has proposed comparing each agent's data against
others' to promote honesty: when others contribute genuine data, the best way
to minimize discrepancy is to do the same. Yet prior implementations of this
idea rely on very strong assumptions about the data distribution (e.g.
Gaussian), limiting their applicability. In this work, we develop reward
mechanisms based on a novel, two-sample test inspired by the Cram\'er-von Mises
statistic. Our methods strictly incentivize agents to submit more genuine data,
while disincentivizing data fabrication and other types of untruthful
reporting. We establish that truthful reporting constitutes a (possibly
approximate) Nash equilibrium in both Bayesian and prior-agnostic settings. We
theoretically instantiate our method in three canonical data sharing problems
and show that it relaxes key assumptions made by prior work. Empirically, we
demonstrate that our mechanism incentivizes truthful data sharing via
simulations and on real-world language and image data.

Motivation: 传统cMAB算法需要大样本且可能忽略心理因素，因此结合LLM以提升个性化干预的效果。

Method: 采用cMAB选择干预类型，LLM个性化消息内容，评估四种干预模型（cMAB、LLM、cMABxLLM、RCT）的效果。

Result: 通过7天实验，结合cMAB和LLM的模型在提升步数和消息接受度上表现更优。

Conclusion: LLM和cMAB的互补作用为个性化行为干预提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine learning approaches, such as contextual multi-armed bandit (cMAB)
algorithms, offer a promising strategy to reduce sedentary behavior by
delivering personalized interventions to encourage physical activity. However,
cMAB algorithms typically require large participant samples to learn
effectively and may overlook key psychological factors that are not explicitly
encoded in the model. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach that combines
cMAB for selecting intervention types with large language models (LLMs) to
personalize message content. We evaluate four intervention types: behavioral
self-monitoring, gain-framed, loss-framed, and social comparison, each
delivered as a motivational message aimed at increasing motivation for physical
activity and daily step count. Message content is further personalized using
dynamic contextual factors including daily fluctuations in self-efficacy,
social influence, and regulatory focus. Over a seven-day trial, participants
receive daily messages assigned by one of four models: cMAB alone, LLM alone,
combined cMAB with LLM personalization (cMABxLLM), or equal randomization
(RCT). Outcomes include daily step count and message acceptance, assessed via
ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). We apply a causal inference framework
to evaluate the effects of each model. Our findings offer new insights into the
complementary roles of LLM-based personalization and cMAB adaptation in
promoting physical activity through personalized behavioral messaging.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce the tokenized linear bandit (TLB) and multi-armed bandit (TMAB),
variants of linear and stochastic multi-armed bandit problems inspired by LLM
decoding and alignment. In these problems, at each round $t \in [T]$, a user
submits a query (context), and the decision maker (DM) sequentially selects a
token irrevocably from a token set. Once the sequence is complete, the DM
observes a random utility from the user, whose expectation is presented by a
sequence function mapping the chosen token sequence to a nonnegative real value
that depends on the query.
  In both problems, we first show that learning is impossible without any
structure on the sequence function. We introduce a natural assumption,
diminishing distance with more commons (DDMC), and propose algorithms with
regret $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T^{2/3}})$ for TLB and
TMAB, respectively. As a side product, we obtain an (almost) optimality of the
greedy decoding for LLM decoding algorithm under DDMC, which justifies the
unresaonable effectiveness of greedy decoding in several tasks. This also has
an immediate application to decoding-time LLM alignment, when the misaligned
utility can be represented as the frozen LLM's utility and a linearly
realizable latent function. We finally validate our algorithm's performance
empirically as well as verify our assumptions using synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Conclusion: EVINET证明了不确定性估计和逻辑推理的必要性，为开放世界图学习铺平了道路。

Abstract: Graph learning has been crucial to many real-world tasks, but they are often
studied with a closed-world assumption, with all possible labels of data known
a priori. To enable effective graph learning in an open and noisy environment,
it is critical to inform the model users when the model makes a wrong
prediction to in-distribution data of a known class, i.e., misclassification
detection or when the model encounters out-of-distribution from novel classes,
i.e., out-of-distribution detection. This paper introduces Evidential Reasoning
Network (EVINET), a framework that addresses these two challenges by
integrating Beta embedding within a subjective logic framework. EVINET includes
two key modules: Dissonance Reasoning for misclassification detection and
Vacuity Reasoning for out-of-distribution detection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVINET outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple
metrics in the tasks of in-distribution classification, misclassification
detection, and out-of-distribution detection. EVINET demonstrates the necessity
of uncertainty estimation and logical reasoning for misclassification detection
and out-of-distribution detection and paves the way for open-world graph
learning. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/SSSKJ/EviNET.

Conclusion: PASS是一种有效且通用的隐私保护方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: The growing Machine Learning (ML) services require extensive collections of
user data, which may inadvertently include people's private information
irrelevant to the services. Various studies have been proposed to protect
private attributes by removing them from the data while maintaining the
utilities of the data for downstream tasks. Nevertheless, as we theoretically
and empirically show in the paper, these methods reveal severe vulnerability
because of a common weakness rooted in their adversarial training based
strategies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach, PASS,
designed to stochastically substitute the original sample with another one
according to certain probabilities, which is trained with a novel loss function
soundly derived from information-theoretic objective defined for
utility-preserving private attributes protection. The comprehensive evaluation
of PASS on various datasets of different modalities, including facial images,

PASS's effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: 该方法为未来长上下文模型部署提供了高效解决方案，并开源了完整实现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter severe memory inefficiencies during
long-context inference due to conventional handling of key-value (KV) caches.
In this work, we introduce a novel integration of PagedAttention with PyTorch's
FlexAttention, addressing internal fragmentation and inefficiencies associated
with monolithic KV cache allocations. Implemented within IBM's Foundation Model
Stack (FMS), our fused attention kernel efficiently gathers scattered KV data.
Our benchmarks on an NVIDIA L4 GPU (24GB) demonstrate significantly reduced
inference latency, growing only linearly (~2x) with sequence length from 128 to
2048 tokens when utilizing a global KV cache, compared to exponential latency
increases without caching. While peak memory usage remains largely unchanged
for single-step evaluations (dominated by model weights and activations), paged
attention causes minimal incremental memory usage, observable only at sequence
lengths exceeding 2048 tokens due to its power-of-two cache allocations. We
open-source the full implementation and discuss its implications for future
long-context model deployment.

Abstract: Many security and network applications require having large datasets to train
the machine learning models. Limited data access is a well-known problem in the
security domain. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer models
to enlarge the size of data by synthesizing new samples, but the synthesized
samples don't improve the models over the real data. To address this issue, we
design an efficient transformer-based model as a generative framework to
generate time-series data, that can be used to boost the performance of
existing and new ML workflows. Our new transformer model achieves the SOTA
results. We style our model to be generalizable and work across different
datasets, and produce high-quality samples.

Abstract: We present DEF (\textbf{\ul{D}}iffusion-augmented \textbf{\ul{E}}nsemble
\textbf{\ul{F}}orecasting), a novel approach for generating initial condition
perturbations. Modern approaches to initial condition perturbations are
primarily designed for numerical weather prediction (NWP) solvers, limiting
their applicability in the rapidly growing field of machine learning for
weather prediction. Consequently, stochastic models in this domain are often
developed on a case-by-case basis. We demonstrate that a simple conditional
diffusion model can (1) generate meaningful structured perturbations, (2) be
applied iteratively, and (3) utilize a guidance term to intuitivey control the
level of perturbation. This method enables the transformation of any
deterministic neural forecasting system into a stochastic one. With our
stochastic extended systems, we show that the model accumulates less error over
long-term forecasts while producing meaningful forecast distributions. We
validate our approach on the 5.625$^\circ$ ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which
comprises atmospheric and surface variables over a discretized global grid,
spanning from the 1960s to the present. On this dataset, our method
demonstrates improved predictive performance along with reasonable spread

Conclusion: MADS有效优化了AFL在移动环境中的性能，理论分析和实验结果验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) enables distributed model training
across multiple mobile devices, allowing each device to independently update
its local model without waiting for others. However, device mobility introduces
intermittent connectivity, which necessitates gradient sparsification and leads
to model staleness, jointly affecting AFL convergence. This paper develops a
theoretical model to characterize the interplay among sparsification, model
staleness and mobility-induced contact patterns, and their joint impact on AFL
convergence. Based on the analysis, we propose a mobility-aware dynamic
sparsification (MADS) algorithm that optimizes the sparsification degree based
on contact time and model staleness. Closed-form solutions are derived, showing
that under low-speed conditions, MADS increases the sparsification degree to
enhance convergence, while under high-speed conditions, it reduces the
sparsification degree to guarantee reliable uploads within limited contact
time. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings. Compared with the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, the MADS algorithm increases the image
classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by 8.76% and reduces the
average displacement error in the Argoverse trajectory prediction dataset by
9.46%.

*Haoyu Wang,Peihao Wang,Mufei Li,Shikun Liu,Siqi Miao,Zhangyang Wang,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: Graph-KV通过利用KV缓存和结构归纳偏置，克服了大型语言模型（LLM）在处理结构化数据时的序列化限制，显著提升了检索增强生成（RAG）和图结构数据的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型（LLM）在处理结构化数据时，由于输入被序列化为扁平序列，无法有效利用结构依赖关系。Graph-KV旨在解决这一问题，尤其是在检索增强生成（RAG）和图结构数据推理任务中。

Method: Graph-KV利用文本段的KV缓存作为压缩表示，并通过结构归纳偏置控制它们的交互。目标段仅选择性关注其指定的源段，而非序列中的所有前驱段，从而引入图结构块掩码和消息传递机制。此外，通过策略性分配位置编码，减少了位置偏置和上下文窗口消耗。

Result: Graph-KV在多个任务中表现优异，包括七种RAG基准测试、Arxiv-QA（基于科学论文引用图的问答任务）和论文主题分类任务，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Graph-KV通过减少位置偏置并利用结构归纳偏置，有效提升了LLM在处理结构化数据时的性能，为相关任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are inherently auto-regressive, requiring
input to be serialized into flat sequences regardless of their structural
dependencies. This serialization hinders the model's ability to leverage
structural inductive biases, especially in tasks such as retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and reasoning on data with native graph structures, where
inter-segment dependencies are crucial. We introduce Graph-KV with the
potential to overcome this limitation. Graph-KV leverages the KV-cache of text
segments as condensed representations and governs their interaction through
structural inductive biases. In this framework, 'target' segments selectively
attend only to the KV-caches of their designated 'source' segments, rather than
all preceding segments in a serialized sequence. This approach induces a
graph-structured block mask, sparsifying attention and enabling a
message-passing-like step within the LLM. Furthermore, strategically allocated
positional encodings for source and target segments reduce positional bias and
context window consumption. We evaluate Graph-KV across three scenarios: (1)
seven RAG benchmarks spanning direct inference, multi-hop reasoning, and
long-document understanding; (2) Arxiv-QA, a novel academic paper QA task with
full-text scientific papers structured as citation ego-graphs; and (3) paper
topic classification within a citation network. By effectively reducing
positional bias and harnessing structural inductive biases, Graph-KV
substantially outperforms baselines, including standard costly sequential
encoding, across various settings. Code and the Graph-KV data are publicly
available.

TLDR: SALT是一种轻量级模型适应框架，适用于封闭环境中的拆分计算，通过客户端可训练适配器实现用户特定适应，无需修改原始模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在封闭环境中，传统适应方法因无法访问模型参数或架构而不可行，SALT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 在客户端引入紧凑、可训练的适配器，优化头部网络的潜在特征。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上验证，SALT提高了准确性且训练延迟更低，同时支持在丢包网络中的鲁棒推理。

Conclusion: SALT为边缘AI系统提供了一种在严格约束下实现个性化推理的实用解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SALT (Split-Adaptive Lightweight Tuning), a lightweight model
adaptation framework for Split Computing under closed constraints, where the
head and tail networks are proprietary and inaccessible to users. In such
closed environments, conventional adaptation methods are infeasible since they
require access to model parameters or architectures. SALT addresses this
challenge by introducing a compact, trainable adapter on the client side to
refine latent features from the head network, enabling user-specific adaptation
without modifying the original models or increasing communication overhead. We
evaluate SALT on user-specific classification tasks with CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100, demonstrating improved accuracy with lower training latency compared
to fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, SALT facilitates model adaptation for
robust inference over lossy networks, a common challenge in edge-cloud
environments. With minimal deployment overhead, SALT offers a practical
solution for personalized inference in edge AI systems under strict system
constraints.

TLDR: MoE-GPS框架通过量化预测策略对系统性能的影响，优化多GPU MoE网络的负载均衡，提出Distribution-Only Prediction策略，显著提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多GPU MoE网络中专家负载不均衡问题，传统预测方法开销大，需优化预测策略以提升系统性能。

Method: 提出MoE-GPS框架，量化预测策略对系统性能的影响，推荐Distribution-Only Prediction策略以减少开销。

Result: 在Mixtral 8x7B MMLU数据集上，Distribution-Only Prediction比传统方法提升推理性能23%以上。

Conclusion: MoE-GPS通过优化预测策略，显著提升多GPU MoE网络的推理性能，Distribution-Only Prediction是高效选择。

Abstract: In multi-GPU Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network, experts are distributed across
different GPUs, which creates load imbalance as each expert processes different
number of tokens. Recent works improve MoE inference load balance by
dynamically duplicating popular experts to more GPUs to process excessive
tokens, which requires predicting the distribution before routing. In this
paper, we discuss the tradeoff of prediction strategies, accuracies, overhead,
and end-to-end system performance. We propose MoE-GPS, a framework that guides
the selection of the optimal predictor design under various system
configurations, by quantifying the performance impact to system-level model
runtime. Specifically, we advocate for Distribution-Only Prediction, a
prediction strategy that only predicts overall token distribution which
significantly reduces overhead compared to the traditional Token-to-Expert
Prediction. On Mixtral 8x7B MMLU dataset, MoE-GPS suggests Distribution-Only
Prediction which improves end-to-end inference performance by more than 23%
compared with Token-to-Expert Prediction.

Result: CMA在实验中优于经验风险最小化和现有先进算法。

Conclusion: 矩对齐为域泛化提供了统一的理论框架，CMA算法高效且性能优越。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks to develop models that generalize well to
unseen target domains, addressing the prevalent issue of distribution shifts in
real-world applications. One line of research in DG focuses on aligning
domain-level gradients and Hessians to enhance generalization. However,
existing methods are computationally inefficient and the underlying principles
of these approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we develop the
theory of moment alignment for DG. Grounded in \textit{transfer measure}, a
principled framework for quantifying generalizability between two domains, we
first extend the definition of transfer measure to domain generalization that
includes multiple source domains and establish a target error bound. Then, we
prove that aligning derivatives across domains improves transfer measure both
when the feature extractor induces an invariant optimal predictor across
domains and when it does not. Notably, moment alignment provides a unifying
understanding of Invariant Risk Minimization, gradient matching, and Hessian
matching, three previously disconnected approaches to DG. We further connect
feature moments and derivatives of the classifier head, and establish the
duality between feature learning and classifier fitting. Building upon our
theory, we introduce \textbf{C}losed-Form \textbf{M}oment \textbf{A}lignment
(CMA), a novel DG algorithm that aligns domain-level gradients and Hessians in
closed-form. Our method overcomes the computational inefficiencies of existing
gradient and Hessian-based techniques by eliminating the need for repeated
backpropagation or sampling-based Hessian estimation. We validate the efficacy
of our approach through two sets of experiments: linear probing and full
fine-tuning. CMA demonstrates superior performance in both settings compared to
Empirical Risk Minimization and state-of-the-art algorithms.

Method: 利用度量张量、切空间和内积等几何结构，通过并行传输连接离散位置；减少参数并引入显式机制增强局部性。

Result: 实验显示模块性能显著优于基线，未来将在视觉和大语言模型上进一步验证。

Conclusion: 几何框架和局部增强机制有效提升了Transformer的性能，具有进一步扩展潜力。

Abstract: This research endeavors to offer insights into unlocking the further
potential of transformer-based architectures. One of the primary motivations is
to offer a geometric interpretation for the attention mechanism in
transformers. In our framework, the attention mainly involves metric tensors,
tangent spaces, inner product, and how they relate to each other. These
quantities and structures at discrete positions are intricately interconnected
via the parallel transport of tangent vectors. To make the learning process
more efficient, we reduce the number of parameters through ingenious predefined
configurations. Moreover, we introduce an explicit mechanism to highlight a
neighborhood by attenuating the remote values, given that transformers
inherently neglect local inductive bias. Experimental results demonstrate that
our modules deliver significant performance improvements relative to the
baseline. More evaluation experiments on visual and large language models will
be launched successively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型（LLMs）的内部表示是解释性研究的核心挑战，现有方法依赖的强假设在实践中可能不成立。

Method: 提出InverseScope框架，通过定义目标激活的输入分布并分析其编码特征，采用条件生成架构提高采样效率。

Result: InverseScope能够扩展到更大模型和实际任务，支持对LLMs内部表示的系统化和定量分析。

Conclusion: InverseScope为解释神经激活提供了一种高效且可扩展的方法，推动了LLMs解释性研究的发展。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) is
a central challenge in interpretability research. Existing feature
interpretability methods often rely on strong assumptions about the structure
of representations that may not hold in practice. In this work, we introduce
InverseScope, an assumption-light and scalable framework for interpreting
neural activations via input inversion. Given a target activation, we define a
distribution over inputs that generate similar activations and analyze this
distribution to infer the encoded features. To address the inefficiency of
sampling in high-dimensional spaces, we propose a novel conditional generation
architecture that significantly improves sample efficiency compared to previous
methods. We further introduce a quantitative evaluation protocol that tests
interpretability hypotheses using feature consistency rate computed over the
sampled inputs. InverseScope scales inversion-based interpretability methods to
larger models and practical tasks, enabling systematic and quantitative
analysis of internal representations in real-world LLMs.

Abstract: With the rapid development of multi-cloud environments, it is increasingly
important to ensure the security and reliability of intelligent monitoring
systems. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection and early warning
mechanism for intelligent monitoring system in multi-cloud environment based on
Large-Scale Language Model (LLM). On the basis of the existing monitoring
framework, the proposed model innovatively introduces a multi-level feature
extraction method, which combines the natural language processing ability of
LLM with traditional machine learning methods to enhance the accuracy of
anomaly detection and improve the real-time response efficiency. By introducing
the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs, the model dynamically adapts
to different cloud service providers and environments, so as to more
effectively detect abnormal patterns and predict potential failures.
Experimental results show that the proposed model is significantly better than
the traditional anomaly detection system in terms of detection accuracy and
latency, and significantly improves the resilience and active management
ability of cloud infrastructure.

Motivation: 分数阶微分具有独特特性，可优化神经网络算法，但缺乏与自动微分技术兼容的分数阶矩阵微分方法。

Method: 通过定义分数阶雅可比矩阵（${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$），实现基于矩阵的分数阶链式法则，并设计分数阶Autograd技术。

Result: 实验表明，${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$在训练集、验证集和测试集上表现优越，是一种优秀的分数阶梯度下降方法。

Conclusion: ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$显著提升了分数阶微分在深度学习中的实用性。

Abstract: Fractional-order differentiation has many characteristics different from
integer-order differentiation. These characteristics can be applied to the
optimization algorithms of artificial neural networks to obtain better results.
However, due to insufficient theoretical research, at present, there is no
fractional-order matrix differentiation method that is perfectly compatible
with automatic differentiation (Autograd) technology. Therefore, we propose a
fractional-order matrix differentiation calculation method. This method is
introduced by the definition of the integer-order Jacobian matrix. We denote it
as fractional-order Jacobian matrix differentiation (${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$).
Through ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$, we can carry out the matrix-based
fractional-order chain rule. Based on the Linear module and the
fractional-order differentiation, we design the fractional-order Autograd
technology to enable the use of fractional-order differentiation in hidden
layers, thereby enhancing the practicality of fractional-order differentiation
in deep learning. In the experiment, according to the PyTorch framework, we
design fractional-order Linear (FLinear) and replace nn.Linear in the
multilayer perceptron with FLinear. Through the qualitative analysis of the
training set and validation set $Loss$, the quantitative analysis of the test
set indicators, and the analysis of time consumption and GPU memory usage
during model training, we verify the superior performance of ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha
}$ and prove that it is an excellent fractional-order gradient descent method
in the field of deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法存在嵌入分布无显式调控和过度依赖大批量负样本的问题，限制了其性能。

Method: VarCon将监督对比学习重新表述为对潜在类变量的变分推断，最大化后验加权的ELBO，实现高效的类感知匹配和类内分散控制。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，ImageNet-1K Top-1准确率79.36%，CIFAR-100达78.29%，并表现出更好的语义组织和少样本学习能力。

Conclusion: VarCon通过变分推断优化对比学习，显著提升了性能和鲁棒性，为嵌入空间控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in
shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar
samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key
limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding
distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart
unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance
on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization.
To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive
Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as
variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a
posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive
pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants
fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space.
Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art
performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while
converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision
boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by
KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning
assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning
than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation
strategies.

Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient Vision-Language Model (VLM) pipeline
specifically optimized for deployment on embedded devices, such as those used

computational overhead by jointly leveraging patch selection to filter
irrelevant camera views, a token selection module to reduce input sequence
length for the LLM, and speculative decoding to accelerate token generation.
Evaluation on the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor platform for automonous driving
application, our pipeline achieves $2.5\times$ end-to-end latency reduction
without compromising task accuracy. The speed-up further increases to
$3.2\times$ when applying FP8 post-training quantization. These results
demonstrate our pipeline as a viable solution for enabling real-time VLM
deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<details>

Motivation: 动态图中的OOD检测在安全敏感领域受到关注，但现有方法主要针对静态图，存在单点估计偏差和分数同质化问题。

Method: 采用证据深度学习方法，设计后验Dirichlet分布解释输入随机性，并通过频谱感知增强模块生成OOD近似样本。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证了EviSEC能有效检测动态图中的OOD样本。

Conclusion: EviSEC通过结合证据深度学习和频谱感知对比学习，显著提升了动态图OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Recently, Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in dynamic graphs, which aims
to identify whether incoming data deviates from the distribution of the
in-distribution (ID) training set, has garnered considerable attention in
security-sensitive fields. Current OOD detection paradigms primarily focus on
static graphs and confront two critical challenges: i) high bias and high
variance caused by single-point estimation, which makes the predictions
sensitive to randomness in the data; ii) score homogenization resulting from
the lack of OOD training data, where the model only learns ID-specific
patterns, resulting in overall low OOD scores and a narrow score gap between ID
and OOD data. To tackle these issues, we first investigate OOD detection in
dynamic graphs through the lens of Evidential Deep Learning (EDL).
Specifically, we propose EviSEC, an innovative and effective OOD detector via
Evidential Spectrum-awarE Contrastive Learning. We design an evidential neural
network to redefine the output as the posterior Dirichlet distribution,
explaining the randomness of inputs through the uncertainty of distribution,
which is overlooked by single-point estimation. Moreover, spectrum-aware
augmentation module generates OOD approximations to identify patterns with high
OOD scores, thereby widening the score gap between ID and OOD data and
mitigating score homogenization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that EviSAC effectively detects OOD samples in dynamic graphs.

Motivation: 解决上下文学习（ICL）因高质量示例稀缺（隐私、标注成本、分布差异）而受限的问题。

Method: 提出联邦上下文学习（Fed-ICL），通过多轮迭代协作优化回答质量，无需传输模型参数。

Result: 理论证明Fed-ICL收敛性，实验显示其在标准问答基准上表现优异且通信成本低。

Conclusion: Fed-ICL是一种高效且低成本的解决方案，适用于隐私敏感和数据分布不均的场景。

Abstract: For question-answering (QA) tasks, in-context learning (ICL) enables language
models to generate responses without modifying their parameters by leveraging
examples provided in the input. However, the effectiveness of ICL heavily
depends on the availability of high-quality examples, which are often scarce
due to data privacy constraints, annotation costs, and distribution
disparities. A natural solution is to utilize examples stored on client
devices, but existing approaches either require transmitting model parameters -
incurring significant communication overhead - or fail to fully exploit local
datasets, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose
Federated In-Context Learning (Fed-ICL), a general framework that enhances ICL
through an iterative, collaborative process. Fed-ICL progressively refines
responses by leveraging multi-round interactions between clients and a central
server, improving answer quality without the need to transmit model parameters.
We establish theoretical guarantees for the convergence of Fed-ICL and conduct
extensive experiments on standard QA benchmarks, demonstrating that our
proposed approach achieves strong performance while maintaining low
communication costs.

Motivation: 当前LLM部署中缺乏系统区分和应对不确定性来源的工具，导致保守策略（如拒绝高不确定性输出）成为主流。

Method: 采用贝叶斯实验建模框架，为不确定性提供一致的理论基础，并支持主动解决措施（如请求澄清、检索外部信息等）。

Result: 该框架使LLM及其用户能够采取情境适当的步骤，提高系统的可靠性和透明度。

Conclusion: 通过主动解决不确定性，该框架为高风险现实场景中更可靠、广泛适用的LLM系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are highly interactive and extendable,
current approaches to ensure reliability in deployments remain mostly limited
to rejecting outputs with high uncertainty in order to avoid misinformation.
This conservative strategy reflects the current lack of tools to systematically
distinguish and respond to different sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we
advocate for the adoption of Bayesian Modeling of Experiments -- a framework
that provides a coherent foundation to reason about uncertainty and clarify the
reducibility of uncertainty -- for managing and proactively addressing
uncertainty that arises in LLM deployments. This framework enables LLMs and
their users to take contextually appropriate steps, such as requesting
clarification, retrieving external information, or refining inputs. By
supporting active resolution rather than passive avoidance, it opens the door
to more reliable, transparent, and broadly applicable LLM systems, particularly
in high-stakes, real-world settings.

Motivation: 理解风格模式是否会影响LLM的安全性，以及如何通过风格对齐增加模型脆弱性，并提出缓解方法。

Method: 评估32个LLM在七个越狱基准测试中的表现，分析风格模式长度和注意力相关性，提出SafeStyle防御策略。

Result: 风格模式显著提高了攻击成功率，且与风格长度和模型注意力相关；SafeStyle在保持模型安全性方面优于基线。

Conclusion: 风格模式确实会威胁LLM安全性，SafeStyle是一种有效的防御方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g.,
formatting responses as lists), including in jailbreak queries. Although these
style patterns are semantically unrelated to the malicious intents behind
jailbreak queries, their safety impact remains unclear. In this work, we seek
to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial
style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these
risks during alignment. We evaluate 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks,
and find that malicious queries with style patterns inflate the attack success
rate (ASR) for nearly all models. Notably, ASR inflation correlates with both
the length of style patterns and the relative attention an LLM exhibits on
them. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that
fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of
those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that
incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the
distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs and
five fine-tuning style settings, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines
in maintaining LLM safety.

Result: ProteinZero在结构准确性、可设计性、热力学稳定性和序列多样性上均优于现有方法，设计失败率降低36%-48%。

Conclusion: ProteinZero为蛋白质设计提供了持续自我改进的新范式，拓展了蛋白质设计空间的可能性。

Abstract: Protein generative models have shown remarkable promise in protein design but
still face limitations in success rate, due to the scarcity of high-quality
protein datasets for supervised pretraining. We present ProteinZero, a novel
framework that enables scalable, automated, and continuous self-improvement of
the inverse folding model through online reinforcement learning. To achieve
computationally tractable online feedback, we introduce efficient proxy reward
models based on ESM-fold and a novel rapid ddG predictor that significantly
accelerates evaluation speed. ProteinZero employs a general RL framework
balancing multi-reward maximization, KL-divergence from a reference model, and
a novel protein-embedding level diversity regularization that prevents mode
collapse while promoting higher sequence diversity. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ProteinZero substantially outperforms existing
methods across every key metric in protein design, achieving significant
improvements in structural accuracy, designability, thermodynamic stability,
and sequence diversity. Most impressively, ProteinZero reduces design failure
rates by approximately 36% - 48% compared to widely-used methods like
ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF and InstructPLM, consistently achieving success rates
exceeding 90% across diverse and complex protein folds. Notably, the entire RL
run on CATH-4.3 can be done with a single 8 X GPU node in under 3 days,
including reward computation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for protein
design where models evolve continuously from their own generated outputs,
opening new possibilities for exploring the vast protein design space.

*Jie Peng,Hongwei Yang,Jing Zhao,Hengji Dong,Hui He,Weizhe Zhang,Haoyu He*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出了一种名为TSC的新型后门净化防御方法，适用于多种学习范式，仅需少量干净样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法通常需要标记数据或特定训练流程，限制了其在监督学习之外的适用性。

Method: 利用神经网络的排列不变性和二次模式连接性，TSC放大中毒样本的损失，同时保持干净样本的准确率。

Result: 实验表明，TSC在监督学习场景中表现优异，并能推广至自监督学习框架（如SimCLR和CLIP）。

Conclusion: TSC是一种高效且通用的后门净化防御方法，适用于多种学习范式。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious
behaviors are implanted during training. While existing defenses can
effectively purify compromised models, they typically require labeled data or
specific training procedures, making them difficult to apply beyond supervised
learning settings. Notably, recent studies have shown successful backdoor
attacks across various learning paradigms, highlighting a critical security
concern. To address this gap, we propose Two-stage Symmetry Connectivity (TSC),
a novel backdoor purification defense that operates independently of data
format and requires only a small fraction of clean samples. Through theoretical
analysis, we prove that by leveraging permutation invariance in neural networks
and quadratic mode connectivity, TSC amplifies the loss on poisoned samples
while maintaining bounded clean accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that TSC
achieves robust performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in
supervised learning scenarios. Furthermore, TSC generalizes to self-supervised
learning frameworks, such as SimCLR and CLIP, maintaining its strong defense
capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiePeng104/TSC.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Self-RedTeam的在线自博弈强化学习算法，通过攻击者和防御者的持续互动实现动态安全对齐，取代传统的静态防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型安全对齐采用静态防御和被动修补的方式，导致防御滞后于威胁。Self-RedTeam旨在通过动态博弈解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两玩家零和博弈框架，模型在攻击者和防御者角色间切换，通过强化学习实现动态适应，并引入隐藏思维链提升多样性。

Result: 实验表明，Self-RedTeam能发现更多样化的攻击（+21.8% SBERT），并在安全基准测试中表现更优（如WildJailBreak上+65.5%）。

Conclusion: 研究提倡从被动修补转向主动协同进化，通过多智能体强化学习实现语言模型的自主、可扩展和鲁棒的安全改进。

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive,
disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive
fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates
a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders
perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose
Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an
attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast
safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates
between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and
safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This
enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of
zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the
design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the
defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.
Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared
to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on
safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained
against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing
agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces
over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive
co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust
self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Lean证明助手日益流行，但仍缺乏高效的自动化工具（hammer），阻碍了验证工作流程的效率。

Method: 提出基于神经前提选择的系统，动态适应用户上下文，并结合符号证明搜索与重建。

Result: LeanHammer比现有前提选择器多解决21%的目标，并能泛化到多样领域。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了神经检索与符号推理间的空白，使形式验证更易用。

Abstract: Neural methods are transforming automated reasoning for proof assistants, yet
integrating these advances into practical verification workflows remains
challenging. Hammers are tools that interface with external automatic theorem
provers to automate tedious reasoning steps. They have dramatically improved
productivity in proof assistants, but the Lean proof assistant still does not
have a hammer despite its growing popularity. We present LeanHammer, the first
end-to-end domain-general hammer for Lean, built on a novel neural premise
selection system for a hammer in dependent type theory. Unlike existing Lean
premise selectors, our approach dynamically adapts to user-specific contexts
and combines with symbolic proof search and reconstruction to create a
practical hammer. With comprehensive evaluations, we show that our premise
selector enables LeanHammer to solve 21\% more goals relative to existing
premise selectors, and generalize well to diverse domains. Our work bridges the
gap between neural retrieval and symbolic reasoning, making formal verification
more accessible to researchers and practitioners.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的偏好优化框架EXPO，绕过了DPO方法中的隐式奖励问题，通过显式正则化避免了DPO的潜在缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DPO的方法虽然简化了RLHF流程，但仍存在次优正则化和反直觉插值行为的问题，需要更透明和直观的优化框架。

Method: 提出EXPO框架，通过显式设计正则化因子，避免DPO的隐式奖励问题，无需复杂的重新参数化。

Result: 实验证明EXPO在正则化需求上优于DPO变体，展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: EXPO提供了一种更透明和直观的偏好优化方法，解决了DPO的潜在问题，并在实验中表现优异。

Abstract: The generated responses of large language models (LLMs) are often fine-tuned
to human preferences through a process called reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). As RLHF relies on a challenging training sequence, whereby a
separate reward model is independently learned and then later applied to LLM
policy updates, ongoing research effort has targeted more straightforward
alternatives. In this regard, direct preference optimization (DPO) and its many
offshoots circumvent the need for a separate reward training step. Instead,
through the judicious use of a reparameterization trick that induces an
\textit{implicit} reward, DPO and related methods consolidate learning to the
minimization of a single loss function. And yet despite demonstrable success in
some real-world settings, we prove that DPO-based objectives are nonetheless
subject to sub-optimal regularization and counter-intuitive interpolation
behaviors, underappreciated artifacts of the reparameterizations upon which
they are based. To this end, we introduce an \textit{explicit} preference
optimization framework termed EXPO that requires no analogous
reparameterization to achieve an implicit reward. Quite differently, we merely
posit intuitively-appealing regularization factors from scratch that
transparently avoid the potential pitfalls of key DPO variants, provably
satisfying regularization desiderata that prior methods do not. Empirical
results serve to corroborate our analyses and showcase the efficacy of EXPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络在计算和能耗方面的高需求促使研究者寻找更高效的解决方案，而LGNs在训练时间长和离散化差距方面存在问题。

Method: 在训练过程中注入Gumbel噪声并使用直通估计器，通过隐式Hessian正则化改善LGNs的收敛性。

Result: 训练速度提升4.5倍，离散化差距减少98%，未使用门数量减少100%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LGNs的训练效率和实际部署的可行性。

Abstract: Modern neural networks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on numerous
existing benchmarks; however, their high computational requirements and energy
consumption prompt researchers to seek more efficient solutions for real-world
deployment. Logic gate networks (LGNs) learns a large network of logic gates
for efficient image classification. However, learning a network that can solve
a simple problem like CIFAR-10 can take days to weeks to train. Even then,
almost half of the network remains unused, causing a discretization gap. This
discretization gap hinders real-world deployment of LGNs, as the performance
drop between training and inference negatively impacts accuracy. We inject
Gumbel noise with a straight-through estimator during training to significantly
speed up training, improve neuron utilization, and decrease the discretization
gap. We theoretically show that this results from implicit Hessian
regularization, which improves the convergence properties of LGNs. We train
networks $4.5 \times$ faster in wall-clock time, reduce the discretization gap
by $98\%$, and reduce the number of unused gates by $100\%$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决链式模型中因因果掩码导致的长距离依赖丢失问题，提升模型对全局上下文的理解能力。

Method: 将隐式令牌表示映射为可微分稀疏因果邻接矩阵，结合因果掩码注意力和因果-MoE，通过干预一致性损失和自演化门实现动态平衡。

Result: GoCE在多个公开数据集上表现优于基线模型，显著提升了长距离因果依赖捕捉能力和自演化能力。

Conclusion: GoCE不仅超越了CoM的设计，还为因果学习和持续自适应改进的未来研究提供了经验。

Abstract: In view of the problem that each subchain in the chain-of-model (CoM) relies
only on the information of the previous subchain and may lose long-range
dependencies due to the causal mask blocking the global context flow between
multi-level subchains, this work proposes a graph of causal evolution (GoCE).
Its core principle is to map the implicit token representation into a
differentiable and sparse causal adjacency matrix, then permeate causal
constraints through each layer of calculation using causal-masked attention and
causal-MoE. By combining intervention consistency loss test and self-evolution
gate, the dynamic balance between causal structure learning and adaptive
updating of transformer architecture is realized. The researcher built
experimental environments in sandboxes built with Claude Sonnet 4,
o4-mini-high, and DeepSeek R1 respectively with the transformer variant
architecture introduced in GoCE. It is evaluated on publicly available datasets
including CLUTRR, CLADDER, EX-FEVER, and CausalQA and compared with the
baseline LLMs. The finding proves that GoCE strengthens the transformer's
ability to capture long-range causal dependencies, while the ability to
self-evolve is improved. It not only surpasses the design of CoM in terms of
design principles, but also provides experience for future research on causal
learning and continuous adaptive improvement.

Motivation: 模仿学习目标可能损害长期性能，因此需要一种更有效利用先验数据的方法。

Method: 通过向策略添加噪声，利用先验数据指导探索，避免显式行为克隆约束。

Result: 在七个模拟连续控制任务中，性能比现有方法提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: DGN方法通过优化探索策略，显著提高了样本效率，且避免了模仿学习的局限性。

Abstract: We study the problem of sample efficient reinforcement learning, where prior
data such as demonstrations are provided for initialization in lieu of a dense
reward signal. A natural approach is to incorporate an imitation learning
objective, either as regularization during training or to acquire a reference
policy. However, imitation learning objectives can ultimately degrade long-term
performance, as it does not directly align with reward maximization. In this
work, we propose to use prior data solely for guiding exploration via noise
added to the policy, sidestepping the need for explicit behavior cloning
constraints. The key insight in our framework, Data-Guided Noise (DGN), is that
demonstrations are most useful for identifying which actions should be
explored, rather than forcing the policy to take certain actions. Our approach
achieves up to 2-3x improvement over prior reinforcement learning from offline
data methods across seven simulated continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Recommendation systems (RS) aim to provide personalized content, but they
face a challenge in unbiased learning due to selection bias, where users only
interact with items they prefer. This bias leads to a distorted representation
of user preferences, which hinders the accuracy and fairness of
recommendations. To address the issue, various methods such as error imputation
based, inverse propensity scoring, and doubly robust techniques have been
developed. Despite the progress, from the structural causal model perspective,
previous debiasing methods in RS assume the independence of the exogenous
variables. In this paper, we release this assumption and propose a learning
algorithm based on likelihood maximization to learn a prediction model. We
first discuss the correlation and difference between unmeasured confounding and
our scenario, then we propose a unified method that effectively handles latent
exogenous variables. Specifically, our method models the data generation
process with latent exogenous variables under mild normality assumptions. We
then develop a Monte Carlo algorithm to numerically estimate the likelihood
function. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and three real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is at

Motivation: 机器学习中许多应用涉及概率分布数据，需要设计新的梯度流方法来处理这类无限维对象。

Method: 将每个类别表示为特征的条件分布，数据集建模为这些类别上的混合分布，并引入WoW距离和微分结构，定义WoW梯度流。

Result: 通过WoW梯度流和基于Sliced-Wasserstein核的最大均值差异函数，成功应用于迁移学习和数据集蒸馏任务。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为处理概率分布数据提供了新的工具，并在实际应用中展示了有效性。

Abstract: Many applications in machine learning involve data represented as probability
distributions. The emergence of such data requires radically novel techniques
to design tractable gradient flows on probability distributions over this type
of (infinite-dimensional) objects. For instance, being able to flow labeled
datasets is a core task for applications ranging from domain adaptation to
transfer learning or dataset distillation. In this setting, we propose to
represent each class by the associated conditional distribution of features,
and to model the dataset as a mixture distribution supported on these classes
(which are themselves probability distributions), meaning that labeled datasets
can be seen as probability distributions over probability distributions. We
endow this space with a metric structure from optimal transport, namely the
Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance, derive a differential structure on
this space, and define WoW gradient flows. The latter enables to design
dynamics over this space that decrease a given objective functional. We apply
our framework to transfer learning and dataset distillation tasks, leveraging
our gradient flow construction as well as novel tractable functionals that take
the form of Maximum Mean Discrepancies with Sliced-Wasserstein based kernels
between probability distributions.

Motivation: KANs虽然高效且可解释，但参数过多导致内存和训练成本高。

Method: 提出MetaKANs，通过元学习器生成KANs权重，端到端训练。

Result: 在多项任务中表现优异，显著提升参数效率和内存使用。

Conclusion: MetaKANs缩小了KANs与MLPs的训练成本差距，增强了可扩展性。

Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs offer a novel
framework for function approximation by replacing traditional neural network
weights with learnable univariate functions. This design demonstrates
significant potential as an efficient and interpretable alternative to
traditional MLPs. However, KANs are characterized by a substantially larger
number of trainable parameters, leading to challenges in memory efficiency and
higher training costs compared to MLPs. To address this limitation, we propose
to generate weights for KANs via a smaller meta-learner, called MetaKANs. By
training KANs and MetaKANs in an end-to-end differentiable manner, MetaKANs
achieve comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters and maintaining promising interpretability.
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark tasks, including symbolic
regression, partial differential equation solving, and image classification,
demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaKANs in improving parameter efficiency and
memory usage. The proposed method provides an alternative technique for
training KANs, that allows for greater scalability and extensibility, and
narrows the training cost gap with MLPs stated in the original paper of KANs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising

synergistically integrates 137 external chemical tools created ranging from

curation pipeline to generate the dataset ChemToolBench that facilitates both
effective tool selection and precise parameter filling during fine-tuning and

execution. By leveraging self-generated data, our approach supports step-level

Motivation: 解决动态概率模型推理中因枚举全状态空间导致的计算效率低和噪声传播问题。

Method: 仅使用累积概率为p的最可能状态（top-p状态）进行推理，减少计算量。

Result: 实验表明，计算速度提升至少一个数量级，总变差距离误差低于0.09。

Conclusion: top-p状态方法在保证误差可控的前提下，显著提高了动态概率模型推理的效率。

Abstract: Inference in dynamic probabilistic models is a complex task involving
expensive operations. In particular, for Hidden Markov Models, the whole state
space has to be enumerated for advancing in time. Even states with negligible
probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and
increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose
to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states,
i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the
error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called
minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical
evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of
magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，分类准确率提升4.2%，同时减少41.8%的设备调度。

Conclusion: FedCGD算法有效优化联邦学习性能，灵活平衡WEMD和采样方差。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for multiple devices to
cooperatively train a model. When applied in wireless networks, two issues
consistently affect the performance of FL, i.e., data heterogeneity of devices
and limited bandwidth. Many papers have investigated device scheduling
strategies considering the two issues. However, most of them recognize data
heterogeneity as a property of individual devices. In this paper, we prove that
the convergence speed of FL is affected by the sum of device-level and
sample-level collective gradient divergence (CGD). The device-level CGD refers
to the gradient divergence of the scheduled device group, instead of the sum of
the individual device divergence. The sample-level CGD is statistically upper
bounded by sampling variance, which is inversely proportional to the total
number of samples scheduled for local update. To derive a tractable form of the
device-level CGD, we further consider a classification problem and transform it
into the weighted earth moving distance (WEMD) between the group distribution
and the global distribution. Then we propose FedCGD algorithm to minimize the
sum of multi-level CGDs by balancing WEMD and sampling variance, within
polynomial time. Simulation shows that the proposed strategy increases
classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by up to 4.2\% while scheduling
41.8\% fewer devices, and flexibly switches between reducing WEMD and reducing
sampling variance.

Result: 在大规模医疗数据上预训练后，MIRA在分布内外场景中平均减少预测误差10%和7%。

Abstract: A unified foundation model for medical time series -- pretrained on open
access and ethics board-approved medical corpora -- offers the potential to
reduce annotation burdens, minimize model customization, and enable robust
transfer across clinical institutions, modalities, and tasks, particularly in
data-scarce or privacy-constrained environments. However, existing generalist
time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due
to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous
sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical
time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional
Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a
frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across
latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a
Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the
continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at
arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical
corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available
datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10%
and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when
compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a
comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks,
establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.

sufficient and balanced. In this work, we propose a novel framework called
ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework,
a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory
dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned
latent space. The converted dataset in the latent space is projected into
reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data
points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from
the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original
dimension, and they are decoded with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Several
experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new,
high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the
results of several baselines.

Motivation: PEFT方法虽能减少训练参数，但其设计空间庞大，不当配置会导致性能不佳，传统搜索方法又带来额外开销。

Result: 该方法显著降低了计算负担，优化了微调配置，提升了效率。

Conclusion: PrunePEFT为大规模预训练模型的高效微调提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as effective and
promising approaches for fine-tuning pre-trained language models. Compared with
Full parameter Fine-Tuning (FFT), PEFT achieved comparable task performance
with a substantial reduction of trainable parameters, which largely saved the
training and storage costs. However, using the PEFT method requires considering
a vast design space, such as the type of PEFT modules and their insertion
layers. Inadequate configurations can lead to sub-optimal results. Conventional
solutions such as architectural search techniques, while effective, tend to
introduce substantial additional overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach, PrunePEFT, which formulates the PEFT strategy search as a pruning
problem and introduces a hybrid pruning strategy that capitalizes on the
sensitivity of pruning methods to different PEFT modules. This method extends
traditional pruning techniques by iteratively removing redundant or conflicting
PEFT modules, thereby optimizing the fine-tuned configuration. By efficiently
identifying the most relevant modules, our approach significantly reduces the
computational burden typically associated with architectural search processes,
making it a more scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large
pre-trained models.

Motivation: 现有方法在强凸损失下遗憾界为$d_{\max} \ln T$，可能劣于$\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}$，需改进。

Method: 提出改进的跟随正则化领导者算法，适应延迟和缺失观测，并扩展在线牛顿步算法处理延迟。

Result: 实现了$\min\{\sigma_{\max}\ln T, \sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$和$\min\{d_{\max} n\ln T, \sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 算法在实验中表现优于现有方法，首次为指数凹损失提供此类遗憾界。

Abstract: In this work, we study the online convex optimization problem with curved
losses and delayed feedback. When losses are strongly convex, existing
approaches obtain regret bounds of order $d_{\max} \ln T$, where $d_{\max}$ is
the maximum delay and $T$ is the time horizon. However, in many cases, this
guarantee can be much worse than $\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}$ as obtained by a
delayed version of online gradient descent, where $d_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is the
total delay. We bridge this gap by proposing a variant of
follow-the-regularized-leader that obtains regret of order
$\min\{\sigma_{\max}\ln T, \sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$, where $\sigma_{\max}$ is
the maximum number of missing observations. We then consider exp-concave losses
and extend the Online Newton Step algorithm to handle delays with an adaptive
learning rate tuning, achieving regret $\min\{d_{\max} n\ln T,
\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$ where $n$ is the dimension. To our knowledge, this
is the first algorithm to achieve such a regret bound for exp-concave losses.
We further consider the problem of unconstrained online linear regression and
achieve a similar guarantee by designing a variant of the Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth
forecaster with a clipping trick. Finally, we implement our algorithms and
conduct experiments under various types of delay and losses, showing an
improved performance over existing methods.

Result: 实验表明，TwinBreak在16种LLMs上成功率达到89%至98%，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: TwinBreak提供了一种高效且低成本的方法，揭示了LLMs安全机制的脆弱性。

Abstract: Machine learning is advancing rapidly, with applications bringing notable
benefits, such as improvements in translation and code generation. Models like
ChatGPT, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly integrated
into daily life. However, alongside these benefits, LLMs also introduce social
risks. Malicious users can exploit LLMs by submitting harmful prompts, such as
requesting instructions for illegal activities. To mitigate this, models often
include a security mechanism that automatically rejects such harmful prompts.
However, they can be bypassed through LLM jailbreaks. Current jailbreaks often
require significant manual effort, high computational costs, or result in
excessive model modifications that may degrade regular utility.
  We introduce TwinBreak, an innovative safety alignment removal method.
Building on the idea that the safety mechanism operates like an embedded
backdoor, TwinBreak identifies and prunes parameters responsible for this
functionality. By focusing on the most relevant model layers, TwinBreak
performs fine-grained analysis of parameters essential to model utility and
safety. TwinBreak is the first method to analyze intermediate outputs from
prompts with high structural and content similarity to isolate safety
parameters. We present the TwinPrompt dataset containing 100 such twin prompts.
Experiments confirm TwinBreak's effectiveness, achieving 89% to 98% success
rates with minimal computational requirements across 16 LLMs from five vendors.

Conclusion: FuXi-Air为智能城市管理提供了高效预测工具，展示了多模态数据融合在空气质量预测中的潜力。

Abstract: Air pollution has emerged as a major public health challenge in megacities.
Numerical simulations and single-site machine learning approaches have been
widely applied in air quality forecasting tasks. However, these methods face
multiple limitations, including high computational costs, low operational
efficiency, and limited integration with observational data. With the rapid
advancement of artificial intelligence, there is an urgent need to develop a
low-cost, efficient air quality forecasting model for smart urban management.
An air quality forecasting model, named FuXi-Air, has been constructed in this
study based on multimodal data fusion to support high-precision air quality
forecasting and operated in typical megacities. The model integrates
meteorological forecasts, emission inventories, and pollutant monitoring data
under the guidance of air pollution mechanism. By combining an autoregressive
prediction framework with a frame interpolation strategy, the model
successfully completes 72-hour forecasts for six major air pollutants at an
hourly resolution across multiple monitoring sites within 25-30 seconds. In
terms of both computational efficiency and forecasting accuracy, it outperforms
the mainstream numerical air quality models in operational forecasting work.
Ablation experiments concerning key influencing factors show that although
meteorological data contribute more to model accuracy than emission inventories
do, the integration of multimodal data significantly improves forecasting
precision and ensures that reliable predictions are obtained under differing
pollution mechanisms across megacities. This study provides both a technical
reference and a practical example for applying multimodal data-driven models to
air quality forecasting and offers new insights into building hybrid
forecasting systems to support air pollution risk warning in smart city
management.

Abstract: Machine learning has promised to change the landscape of laboratory
chemistry, with impressive results in molecular property prediction and
reaction retro-synthesis. However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to
the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough
understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever
transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200
process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our
experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process
conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on
solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically
and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking
for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering,
and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement
and sustainable manufacturing.

Motivation: MPNNs和Graph Transformers在长距离依赖建模上存在局限性，而ChebNet可能提供更好的解决方案。

Method: 重新评估ChebNet的性能，发现其不稳定性后，提出Stable-ChebNet作为改进版本。

Result: Stable-ChebNet在长距离基准测试中表现优异，接近最先进水平。

Conclusion: ChebNet及其改进版本Stable-ChebNet为长距离节点交互建模提供了高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: ChebNet, one of the earliest spectral GNNs, has largely been overshadowed by
Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), which gained popularity for their
simplicity and effectiveness in capturing local graph structure. Despite their
success, MPNNs are limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies
between nodes. This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make
use of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that
characterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically
disregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original
introduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant
node interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive
advantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while
maintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials. However, we
uncover that this polynomial expansion leads ChebNet to an unstable regime
during training. To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and
non-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet. Our
Stable-ChebNet model allows for stable information propagation, and has
controllable dynamics which do not require the use of eigendecompositions,
positional encodings, or graph rewiring. Across several benchmarks,
Stable-ChebNet achieves near state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 理论解释了过参数化模型避免过拟合的原因，并与实际训练方法（如SGD）结合，提供统一理解。

Abstract: A fundamental question in modern machine learning is why large,
over-parameterized models, such as deep neural networks and transformers, tend
to generalize well, even when their number of parameters far exceeds the number
of training samples.
  We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of information theory,
grounded in universal learning theory. Specifically, we study a Bayesian
mixture learner with log-loss and (almost) uniform prior over an expansive
hypothesis class.
  Our key result shows that the learner's regret is not determined by the
overall size of the hypothesis class, but rather by the cumulative probability
of all models that are close, in Kullback-Leibler divergence distance, to the
true data-generating process. We refer to this cumulative probability as the
weight of the hypothesis.
  This leads to a natural notion of model simplicity: simple models are those
with large weight and thus require fewer samples to generalize, while complex
models have small weight and need more data. This perspective provides a
rigorous and intuitive explanation for why over-parameterized models often
avoid overfitting: the presence of simple hypotheses allows the posterior to
concentrate on them when supported by the data.
  We further bridge theory and practice by recalling that stochastic gradient
descent with Langevin dynamics samples from the correct posterior distribution,
enabling our theoretical learner to be approximated using standard machine
learning methods combined with ensemble learning.
  Our analysis yields non-uniform regret bounds and aligns with key practical
concepts such as flat minima and model distillation. The results apply broadly
across online, batch, and supervised learning settings, offering a unified and
principled understanding of the generalization behavior of modern AI systems.

Result: 随机采样学生网络效果不佳，需改进采样机制。

Conclusion: ProARD为高效训练多样化学生网络提供了新思路，但需优化采样策略。

Abstract: Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has emerged as an effective method
to enhance the robustness of lightweight deep neural networks against
adversarial attacks. Current ARD approaches have leveraged a large robust
teacher network to train one robust lightweight student. However, due to the
diverse range of edge devices and resource constraints, current approaches
require training a new student network from scratch to meet specific
constraints, leading to substantial computational costs and increased CO2
emissions. This paper proposes Progressive Adversarial Robustness Distillation
(ProARD), enabling the efficient one-time training of a dynamic network that
supports a diverse range of accurate and robust student networks without
requiring retraining. We first make a dynamic deep neural network based on
dynamic layers by encompassing variations in width, depth, and expansion in
each design stage to support a wide range of architectures. Then, we consider
the student network with the largest size as the dynamic teacher network.
ProARD trains this dynamic network using a weight-sharing mechanism to jointly
optimize the dynamic teacher network and its internal student networks.
However, due to the high computational cost of calculating exact gradients for
all the students within the dynamic network, a sampling mechanism is required
to select a subset of students. We show that random student sampling in each
iteration fails to produce accurate and robust students.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) evaluation is increasingly costly, prompting
interest in methods that speed up evaluation by shrinking benchmark datasets.
Benchmark prediction (also called efficient LLM evaluation) aims to select a
small subset of evaluation points and predict overall benchmark performance
from that subset. In this paper, we systematically assess the strengths and
limitations of 11 benchmark prediction methods across 19 diverse benchmarks.
First, we identify a highly competitive baseline: Take a random sample and fit
a regression model on the sample to predict missing entries. Outperforming most
existing methods, this baseline challenges the assumption that careful subset
selection is necessary for benchmark prediction. Second, we discover that all
existing methods crucially depend on model similarity. They work best when
interpolating scores among similar models. The effectiveness of benchmark
prediction sharply declines when new models have higher accuracy than
previously seen models. In this setting of extrapolation, none of the previous
methods consistently beat a simple average over random samples. To improve over
the sample average, we introduce a new method inspired by augmented inverse
propensity weighting. This method consistently outperforms the random sample
average even for extrapolation. However, its performance still relies on model
similarity and the gains are modest in general. This shows that benchmark
prediction fails just when it is most needed: at the evaluation frontier, where
the goal is to evaluate new models of unknown capabilities.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks, including image generation and video synthesis. However, they
generally lack robustness, a limitation that remains not fully explored in
current research. In this paper, we propose several methods to address this
gap. First, we hypothesize that the robustness of LDMs primarily should be
measured without their text encoder, because if we take and explore the whole
architecture, the problems of image generator and text encoders wll be fused.
Second, we introduce novel data augmentation techniques designed to reveal
robustness shortcomings in LDMs when processing diverse textual prompts. We
then fine-tune Stable Diffusion 3 and Stable Diffusion XL models using
Dreambooth, incorporating these proposed augmentation methods across multiple
tasks. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation pipeline specifically tailored to
assess the robustness of LDMs fine-tuned via Dreambooth.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Representation Learning aims to transform network models
into feature representations for predicting network attributes, playing a
crucial role in deploying and designing networks for real-world applications.
Recently, inspired by the success of transformers, transformer-based models
integrated with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress
in representation learning. However, current methods still have some
limitations. First, existing methods overlook hardware attribute information,
which conflicts with the current trend of diversified deep learning hardware
and limits the practical applicability of models. Second, current encoding
approaches rely on static adjacency matrices to represent topological
structures, failing to capture the structural differences between computational
nodes, which ultimately compromises encoding effectiveness. In this paper, we
introduce LeDG-Former, an innovative framework that addresses these limitations
through the synergistic integration of language-based semantic embedding and
dynamic graph representation learning. Specifically, inspired by large language
models (LLMs), we propose a language embedding framework where both neural
architectures and hardware platform specifications are projected into a unified
semantic space through tokenization and LLM processing, enabling zero-shot
prediction across different hardware platforms for the first time. Then, we
propose a dynamic graph-based transformer for modeling neural architectures,
resulting in improved neural architecture modeling performance. On the NNLQP
benchmark, LeDG-Former surpasses previous methods, establishing a new SOTA
while demonstrating the first successful cross-hardware latency prediction
capability. Furthermore, our framework achieves superior performance on the
cell-structured NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 datasets.

Conclusion: GAS通过图辅助缝合和TE指标，显著提升了离线分层强化学习的性能和效率。

Abstract: Existing offline hierarchical reinforcement learning methods rely on
high-level policy learning to generate subgoal sequences. However, their
efficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective
strategies for stitching useful state transitions across different
trajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that
formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an
explicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance
Representation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from
different trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition
stitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal
sequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the
subgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE)
metric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly
enhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across
locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most
stitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing
the previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0. Our source code is available at:

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first practical algorithms with provable
guarantees for the problem of inferring the topics assigned to each document in
an LDA topic model. This is the primary inference problem for many applications
of topic models in social science, data exploration, and causal inference
settings. We obtain this result by showing a novel non-gradient-based,
combinatorial approach to estimating topic models. This yields algorithms that
converge to near-optimal posterior probability in logarithmic parallel
computation time (adaptivity) -- exponentially faster than any known LDA
algorithm. We also show that our approach can provide interpretability
guarantees such that each learned topic is formally associated with a known
keyword. Finally, we show that unlike alternatives, our approach can maintain
the independence assumptions necessary to use the learned topic model for
downstream causal inference methods that allow researchers to study topics as
treatments. In terms of practical performance, our approach consistently
returns solutions of higher semantic quality than solutions from
state-of-the-art LDA algorithms, neural topic models, and LLM-based topic
models across a diverse range of text datasets and evaluation parameters.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used framework for machine learning in
distributed data environments where clients hold data that cannot be easily
centralised, such as for data protection reasons. FL, however, is known to be
vulnerable to non-IID data. Clustered FL addresses this issue by finding more
homogeneous clusters of clients. We propose a novel one-shot clustering method,
EMD-CFL, using the Earth Mover's distance (EMD) between data distributions in
embedding space. We theoretically motivate the use of EMDs using results from
the domain adaptation literature and demonstrate empirically superior
clustering performance in extensive comparisons against 16 baselines and on a
range of challenging datasets.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于Conformal Prediction的对抗攻击方法OPSA和防御策略OPSA-AT，旨在提高深度学习模型的鲁棒性和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在高风险应用中的部署需要更强的对抗防御和性能保证，仅靠准确性不足以保证可靠性。

Method: 开发了OPSA攻击方法，最大化模型不确定性；提出OPSA-AT防御策略，结合Conformal Prediction进行训练。

Result: OPSA攻击比基线方法更能增加不确定性；OPSA-AT显著提升模型鲁棒性，并保持可靠预测。

Conclusion: 该方法为安全关键领域开发可信赖的深度学习模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in high-risk applications,
robust defenses against adversarial attacks and reliable performance guarantees
become paramount. Moreover, accuracy alone does not provide sufficient
assurance or reliable uncertainty estimates for these models. This study
advances adversarial training by leveraging principles from Conformal
Prediction. Specifically, we develop an adversarial attack method, termed OPSA
(OPtimal Size Attack), designed to reduce the efficiency of conformal
prediction at any significance level by maximizing model uncertainty without
requiring coverage guarantees. Correspondingly, we introduce OPSA-AT
(Adversarial Training), a defense strategy that integrates OPSA within a novel
conformal training paradigm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our OPSA
attack method induces greater uncertainty compared to baseline approaches for
various defenses. Conversely, our OPSA-AT defensive model significantly
enhances robustness not only against OPSA but also other adversarial attacks,
and maintains reliable prediction. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
this integrated approach for developing trustworthy and resilient deep learning
models for safety-critical domains. Our code is available at

Abstract: Modular object-centric representations are essential for *human-like

to occlusions and view ambiguities*. However, addressing challenges presents
both theoretical and practical difficulties. We introduce a novel multi-view
probabilistic approach that aggregates view-specific slots to capture

approach resolves spatial ambiguities, provides theoretical guarantees for
identifiability, and requires *no viewpoint annotations*. Extensive experiments
on standard benchmarks and novel complex datasets validate our method's
robustness and scalability.

Result: 在Gym MuJoCo基准测试和长时规划任务中，性能提升8.7%，推理速度提升142倍。

Conclusion: 新方法在保持高性能的同时显著提升了推理速度，简化了训练过程。

Abstract: Although diffusion models have achieved strong results in decision-making
tasks, their slow inference speed remains a key limitation. While the
consistency model offers a potential solution, its applications to
decision-making often struggle with suboptimal demonstrations or rely on
complex concurrent training of multiple networks. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning
that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process.
Our method enables single-step generation while maintaining higher performance
and simpler training. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo benchmarks and
long horizon planning demonstrate that our approach can achieve an 8.7%
improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup
over diffusion counterparts in inference time.

Result: 符号知识显著加速了DMARL的学习过程。

Conclusion: 符号知识能有效解决DMARL中的独特挑战，并提升学习效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a
single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems
require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For
example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of
a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL
(DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at
execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local
policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this
paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help
address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints,
communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend
the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the
team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in
more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge
about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly
expedite the learning process in DMARL.

Result: 实验表明，CAFT在文本摘要和蛋白质设计等任务中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: CAFT首次将多令牌预测引入训练后阶段，为研究社区提供了更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become the cornerstone of modern AI.
However, the existing paradigm of next-token prediction fundamentally limits
their ability to form coherent, high-level concepts, making it a critical
barrier to human-like understanding and reasoning. Take the phrase "ribonucleic
acid" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,
artificial text fragments ("rib", "on", ...), then learn each token
sequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic
entity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding
and, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we
introduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method
that redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences
that span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.
Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional
next-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional
applications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo
protein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the
prohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first
to bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively
democratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and
researchers. Finally, the unexpected effectiveness of our proposed method
suggests wider implications for the machine learning research community. All

Method: 通过理论分析Jarzynski重加权技术，并应用于流式扩散模型和受限玻尔兹曼机，研究核选择对模型性能的影响。

Result: Jarzynski重加权能减少离散化误差、提高样本质量，并纠正对比散度的偏差。

Conclusion: Jarzynski重加权是一种有潜力的生成学习工具，核选择对模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: Energy-Based Models (EBMs) provide a flexible framework for generative
modeling, but their training remains theoretically challenging due to the need
to approximate normalization constants and efficiently sample from complex,
multi-modal distributions. Traditional methods, such as contrastive divergence
and score matching, introduce biases that can hinder accurate learning. In this
work, we present a theoretical analysis of Jarzynski reweighting, a technique
from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and its implications for training
EBMs. We focus on the role of the choice of the kernel and we illustrate these
theoretical considerations in two key generative frameworks: (i) flow-based
diffusion models, where we reinterpret Jarzynski reweighting in the context of
stochastic interpolants to mitigate discretization errors and improve sample
quality, and (ii) Restricted Boltzmann Machines, where we analyze its role in
correcting the biases of contrastive divergence. Our results provide insights
into the interplay between kernel choice and model performance, highlighting
the potential of Jarzynski reweighting as a principled tool for generative
learning.

Result: 在15个真实图数据任务中，RR-GNN在保持覆盖性的同时，显著提升了预测效率。

Conclusion: RR-GNN为高风险的图数据任务提供了一种可靠且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling relational data but face
significant challenges in high-stakes domains due to unquantified uncertainty.
Conformal prediction (CP) offers statistical coverage guarantees, but existing
methods often produce overly conservative prediction intervals that fail to
account for graph heteroscedasticity and structural biases. While residual
reweighting CP variants address some of these limitations, they neglect graph
topology, cluster-specific uncertainties, and risk data leakage by reusing
training sets. To address these issues, we propose Residual Reweighted GNN
(RR-GNN), a framework designed to generate minimal prediction sets with
provable marginal coverage guarantees.
  RR-GNN introduces three major innovations to enhance prediction performance.
First, it employs Graph-Structured Mondrian CP to partition nodes or edges into
communities based on topological features, ensuring cluster-conditional
coverage that reflects heterogeneity. Second, it uses Residual-Adaptive
Nonconformity Scores by training a secondary GNN on a held-out calibration set
to estimate task-specific residuals, dynamically adjusting prediction intervals
according to node or edge uncertainty. Third, it adopts a Cross-Training
Protocol, which alternates the optimization of the primary GNN and the residual
predictor to prevent information leakage while maintaining graph dependencies.
We validate RR-GNN on 15 real-world graphs across diverse tasks, including node
classification, regression, and edge weight prediction. Compared to CP
baselines, RR-GNN achieves improved efficiency over state-of-the-art methods,
with no loss of coverage.

Result: 实证结果验证了所提界限的紧致性和实际相关性。

Conclusion: 该框架为设计提升公平性泛化的算法提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in promoting fairness in high-stake applications
using machine learning models, existing methods often modify the training
process, such as through regularizers or other interventions, but lack formal
guarantees that fairness achieved during training will generalize to unseen
data. Although overfitting with respect to prediction performance has been
extensively studied, overfitting in terms of fairness loss has received far
less attention. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing
fairness generalization error through an information-theoretic lens. Our novel
bounding technique is based on Efron-Stein inequality, which allows us to
derive tight information-theoretic fairness generalization bounds with both
Mutual Information (MI) and Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). Our empirical
results validate the tightness and practical relevance of these bounds across
diverse fairness-aware learning algorithms. Our framework offers valuable
insights to guide the design of algorithms improving fairness generalization.

Abstract: Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects millions worldwide, requiring continuous
monitoring to prevent severe hypo- and hyperglycemic events. While continuous
glucose monitoring has improved blood glucose management, deploying predictive
models on wearable devices remains challenging due to computational and memory
constraints. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight Sequential
Transformer model designed for blood glucose prediction in T1D. By integrating
the strengths of Transformers' attention mechanisms and the sequential
processing of recurrent neural networks, our architecture captures long-term
dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The model is optimized
for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices and incorporates a balanced
loss function to handle the inherent data imbalance in hypo- and hyperglycemic
events. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, OhioT1DM and DiaTrend,
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
predicting glucose levels and detecting adverse events. This work fills the gap
between high-performance modeling and practical deployment, providing a
reliable and efficient T1D management solution.

Result: 在HAN、3D-CNN和DistilBERT模型上的实验表明，Hessian指标能更有效地定位不稳定性和故障源。

Conclusion: Hessian指标可显著改善复杂神经架构的故障诊断，提升软件调试实践。

Abstract: As attention-based deep learning models scale in size and complexity,
diagnosing their faults becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we
conduct an empirical study to evaluate the potential of Hessian-based analysis
for diagnosing faults in attention-based models. Specifically, we use
Hessian-derived insights to identify fragile regions (via curvature analysis)
and parameter interdependencies (via parameter interaction analysis) within
attention mechanisms. Through experiments on three diverse models (HAN, 3D-CNN,
DistilBERT), we show that Hessian-based metrics can localize instability and
pinpoint fault sources more effectively than gradients alone. Our empirical
findings suggest that these metrics could significantly improve fault diagnosis
in complex neural architectures, potentially improving software debugging
practices.

Conclusion: 扩散模型为反事实图像编辑提供了新思路，实现了高质量和语义控制的平衡。

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation presents significant challenges, including
preserving identity, maintaining perceptual quality, and ensuring faithfulness
to an underlying causal model. While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit
semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they
struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models
present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having
demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and
representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of
diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic
and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic
representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to
edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is
the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for
diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables
principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity
preservation.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling -- particularly diffusion models and
flow matching -- have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing discrete data
such as images and videos. However, adapting these models to physical
applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous
functions governed by complex physical laws. Here, we introduce
$\textbf{FunDiff}$, a novel framework for generative modeling in function
spaces. FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder
architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate
continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly
incorporate physical priors. These priors are enforced through architectural
constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples
satisfy fundamental physical laws. We theoretically establish minimax
optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that
diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable
regularity conditions. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff
across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Empirical
results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high
fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and
low-resolution data. Code and datasets are publicly available at

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态数据生成提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
unimodal data across various tasks, including image, video, and text
generation. On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through
diffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing
approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers
and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a
unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of
encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited
data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building
multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native
generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an
innovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both
unconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model
simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation
and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves
competitive performance.

Abstract: Memory and long-range temporal processing are core requirements for sequence
modeling tasks across natural language processing, time-series forecasting,
speech recognition, and control. While nonlinear recurrence has long been
viewed as essential for enabling such mechanisms, recent work suggests that
linear dynamics may often suffice. In this study, we go beyond performance
comparisons to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in
recurrent networks--identifying both when it is computationally necessary, and
what mechanisms it enables. We use Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks
(AL-RNNs), which allow fine-grained control over nonlinearity, as both a
flexible modeling tool and a probe into the internal mechanisms of memory.
Across a range of classic sequence modeling tasks and a real-world stimulus
selection task, we find that minimal nonlinearity is not only sufficient but
often optimal, yielding models that are simpler, more robust, and more
interpretable than their fully nonlinear or linear counterparts. Our results
provide a principled framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity,
bridging dynamical systems theory with the functional demands of long-range
memory and structured computation in recurrent neural networks, with
implications for both artificial and biological neural systems.

Abstract: Causal effect estimation from observational data is fundamental across
various applications. However, selecting an appropriate estimator from dozens
of specialized methods demands substantial manual effort and domain expertise.
We present CausalPFN, a single transformer that amortizes this workflow:
trained once on a large library of simulated data-generating processes that
satisfy ignorability, it infers causal effects for new observational datasets
out-of-the-box. CausalPFN combines ideas from Bayesian causal inference with
the large-scale training protocol of prior-fitted networks (PFNs), learning to
map raw observations directly to causal effects without any task-specific
adjustment. Our approach achieves superior average performance on heterogeneous
and average treatment effect estimation benchmarks (IHDP, Lalonde, ACIC).
Moreover, it shows competitive performance for real-world policy making on
uplift modeling tasks. CausalPFN provides calibrated uncertainty estimates to
support reliable decision-making based on Bayesian principles. This
ready-to-use model does not require any further training or tuning and takes a
step toward automated causal inference (https://github.com/vdblm/CausalPFN).

build on the SaFARi framework and existing WaLRUS SSMs to introduce a new
variant, W4S4 (WaLRUS for S4), a new class of SSMs constructed from redundant
wavelet frames. WaLRUS admits a stable diagonalization and supports fast kernel
computation without requiring low-rank approximations, making it both
theoretically grounded and computationally efficient. We show that WaLRUS
retains information over long horizons significantly better than HiPPO-based
SSMs, both in isolation and when integrated into deep architectures such as S4.
Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across delay reconstruction
tasks, classification benchmarks, and long-range sequence modeling, confirming
that high-quality, structured initialization enabled by wavelet-based state
dynamic offers substantial advantages over existing alternatives. WaLRUS
provides a scalable and versatile foundation for the next generation of deep
SSM-based models.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的强化学习方法PIESMC，用于构建具有代表性的驾驶循环，显著降低了计算成本并提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确构建驾驶循环对车辆设计、燃油经济性分析和环境影响评估至关重要。

Method: 采用物理信息强化学习框架结合蒙特卡洛采样（PIESMC），捕捉瞬态动力学、加减速、怠速和坡度变化。

Result: 实验表明，PIESMC在关键运动学和能量指标上表现优异，比MTB方法减少57.3%的累积误差，比MCB方法减少10.5%，且计算速度快一个数量级。

Conclusion: PIESMC能高效构建驾驶循环，准确复现实验数据的中心趋势和变异性。

Abstract: Accurate driving cycle construction is crucial for vehicle design, fuel
economy analysis, and environmental impact assessments. A generative
Physics-Informed Expected SARSA-Monte Carlo (PIESMC) approach that constructs
representative driving cycles by capturing transient dynamics, acceleration,
deceleration, idling, and road grade transitions while ensuring model fidelity
is introduced. Leveraging a physics-informed reinforcement learning framework
with Monte Carlo sampling, PIESMC delivers efficient cycle construction with
reduced computational cost. Experimental evaluations on two real-world datasets
demonstrate that PIESMC replicates key kinematic and energy metrics, achieving
up to a 57.3% reduction in cumulative kinematic fragment errors compared to the
Micro-trip-based (MTB) method and a 10.5% reduction relative to the
Markov-chain-based (MCB) method. Moreover, it is nearly an order of magnitude
faster than conventional techniques. Analyses of vehicle-specific power
distributions and wavelet-transformed frequency content further confirm its
ability to reproduce experimental central tendencies and variability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生存分析面临数据截尾和传统集成模型预测不稳定的问题，需要更稳健的方法。

Method: SurvBESA结合Beran估计器和自注意力机制，通过调整生存函数的相似性来平滑噪声。

Result: 数值实验表明SurvBESA优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SurvBESA是一种有效的生存分析模型，代码已公开。

Abstract: Survival analysis predicts the time until an event of interest, such as
failure or death, but faces challenges due to censored data, where some events
remain unobserved. Ensemble-based models, like random survival forests and
gradient boosting, are widely used but can produce unstable predictions due to
variations in bootstrap samples. To address this, we propose SurvBESA (Survival
Beran Estimators Self-Attended), a novel ensemble model that combines Beran
estimators with a self-attention mechanism. Unlike traditional methods,
SurvBESA applies self-attention to predicted survival functions, smoothing out
noise by adjusting each survival function based on its similarity to
neighboring survival functions. We also explore a special case using Huber's
contamination model to define attention weights, simplifying training to a
quadratic or linear optimization problem. Numerical experiments show that
SurvBESA outperforms state-of-the-art models. The implementation of SurvBESA is
publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法充分评估LLM的能力，存在封闭性问题或主观性不足。

Method: 引入HeuriGym框架，允许LLM提出启发式算法并通过代码执行反馈迭代优化。

Result: 测试了9个先进模型，发现其在工具使用、规划和适应性推理方面存在局限，QYI得分最高仅0.6。

Conclusion: HeuriGym为LLM在科学和工程领域的实际应用提供了更有效的评估基准。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements
in reasoning and agent-based problem-solving, current evaluation methodologies
fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely
on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective
comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce
HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms
generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by
clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers
LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and
iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on
nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology,
exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning.
To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric
that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like
GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below
the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the
development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in
scientific and engineering domains.

Result: 在合成和真实数据上的实验表明，尤其在任务样本难度差异大的情况下，新策略能以更低预算实现与标准方法相同的估计精度。

Conclusion: 论文提出的策略能显著降低标注成本，尤其适用于样本难度差异大的任务。

Abstract: The development lifecycle of generative AI systems requires continual
evaluation, data acquisition, and annotation, which is costly in both resources
and time. In practice, rapid iteration often makes it necessary to rely on
synthetic annotation data because of the low cost, despite the potential for
substantial bias. In this paper, we develop novel, cost-aware methods for
actively balancing the use of a cheap, but often inaccurate, weak rater -- such
as a model-based autorater that is designed to automatically assess the quality
of generated content -- with a more expensive, but also more accurate, strong
rater alternative such as a human. More specifically, the goal of our approach
is to produce a low variance, unbiased estimate of the mean of the target
"strong" rating, subject to some total annotation budget. Building on recent
work in active and prediction-powered statistical inference, we derive a family
of cost-optimal policies for allocating a given annotation budget between weak
and strong raters so as to maximize statistical efficiency. Using synthetic and
real-world data, we empirically characterize the conditions under which these
policies yield improvements over prior methods. We find that, especially in
tasks where there is high variability in the difficulty of examples, our
policies can achieve the same estimation precision at a far lower total
annotation budget than standard evaluation methods.

remains one of the field's most significant challenges. To address this
challenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that
uses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically,
POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a
fixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral
properties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function
with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that
make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of POET in

Motivation: cPIKANs在求解PDEs中表现出潜力，但其训练动态和收敛行为缺乏理论支持，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用NTK理论分析cPIKANs，研究核结构在梯度训练中的演变及其对学习效率的影响，并扩展到物理信息背景。

Result: 研究发现cPIKANs的NTK行为可控，揭示了标准PINNs无法捕捉的学习动态，并明确了域分解对训练的改善条件。

Conclusion: 这是首次对cPIKANs进行的系统性NTK研究，为理解其性能提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs), and in particular their
Chebyshev-based variants (cPIKANs), have recently emerged as promising models
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their training
dynamics and convergence behavior remain largely unexplored both theoretically
and numerically. In this work, we aim to advance the theoretical understanding
of cPIKANs by analyzing them using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. Our
objective is to discern the evolution of kernel structure throughout
gradient-based training and its subsequent impact on learning efficiency. We
first derive the NTK of standard cKANs in a supervised setting, and then extend
the analysis to the physics-informed context. We analyze the spectral
properties of NTK matrices, specifically their eigenvalue distributions and
spectral bias, for four representative PDEs: the steady-state Helmholtz
equation, transient diffusion and Allen-Cahn equations, and forced vibrations
governed by the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. We also conduct an investigation
into the impact of various optimization strategies, e.g., first-order,
second-order, and hybrid approaches, on the evolution of the NTK and the
resulting learning dynamics. Results indicate a tractable behavior for NTK in
the context of cPIKANs, which exposes learning dynamics that standard
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) cannot capture. Spectral trends also
reveal when domain decomposition improves training, directly linking kernel
behavior to convergence rates under different setups. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first systematic NTK study of cPIKANs, providing
theoretical insight that clarifies and predicts their empirical performance.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注低速流体流动，而高速流动（接近或超过音速）会出现激波等突变现象，需要自适应时间步长方法以平衡计算成本和分辨率。

Result: 论文生成了两个超音速流动数据集，并公开了代码。

Conclusion: ShockCast是首个学习高速流动的框架，为相关研究提供了新工具和数据支持。

Abstract: We consider the problem of modeling high-speed flows using machine learning
methods. While most prior studies focus on low-speed fluid flows in which
uniform time-stepping is practical, flows approaching and exceeding the speed
of sound exhibit sudden changes such as shock waves. In such cases, it is
essential to use adaptive time-stepping methods to allow a temporal resolution
sufficient to resolve these phenomena while simultaneously balancing
computational costs. Here, we propose a two-phase machine learning method,
known as ShockCast, to model high-speed flows with adaptive time-stepping. In
the first phase, we propose to employ a machine learning model to predict the
timestep size. In the second phase, the predicted timestep is used as an input
along with the current fluid fields to advance the system state by the
predicted timestep. We explore several physically-motivated components for
timestep prediction and introduce timestep conditioning strategies inspired by
neural ODE and Mixture of Experts. As ShockCast is the first framework for
learning high-speed flows, we evaluate our methods by generating two supersonic
flow datasets, available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/divelab. Our code
is publicly available as part of the AIRS library
(https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).

Result: 在固定训练预算和目标剪枝比例下，LSH能高效找到性能更优的剪枝模型，甚至超越密集网络的性能。

Conclusion: LSH框架为网络剪枝提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: A variety of pruning methods have been introduced for over-parameterized
Recurrent Neural Networks to improve efficiency in terms of power consumption
and storage utilization. These advances motivate a new paradigm, termed
`hyperpruning', which seeks to identify the most suitable pruning strategy for
a given network architecture and application. Unlike conventional
hyperparameter search, where the optimal configuration's accuracy remains
uncertain, in the context of network pruning, the accuracy of the dense model
sets the target for the accuracy of the pruned one. The goal, therefore, is to
discover pruned variants that match or even surpass this established accuracy.
However, exhaustive search over pruning configurations is computationally
expensive and lacks early performance guarantees. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel Lyapunov Spectrum (LS)-based distance metric that enables early
comparison between pruned and dense networks, allowing accurate prediction of
post-training performance. By integrating this LS-based distance with standard
hyperparameter optimization algorithms, we introduce an efficient hyperpruning
framework, termed LS-based Hyperpruning (LSH). LSH reduces search time by an
order of magnitude compared to conventional approaches relying on full
training. Experiments on stacked LSTM and RHN architectures using the Penn
Treebank dataset, and on AWD-LSTM-MoS using WikiText-2, demonstrate that under
fixed training budgets and target pruning ratios, LSH consistently identifies
superior pruned models. Remarkably, these pruned variants not only outperform
those selected by loss-based baseline but also exceed the performance of their
dense counterpart.

Method: 提出了TTI（测试时间交互），一种基于课程的在线强化学习方法，通过自适应调整代理的交互长度来训练代理。

Result: TTI在WebVoyager和WebArena基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并能自适应平衡探索与利用。

Conclusion: 交互扩展是计算扩展的有力补充，为训练自适应代理提供了新途径。

Abstract: The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning
traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that
require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before
acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new
information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this
work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of
test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable
running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic
re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling
dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even
prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task
success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI
(Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL)
approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths.
Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data
web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI
enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results
establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling
per-step compute, offering new avenues for training adaptive agents.

Abstract: Realistic urban traffic simulation is essential for sustainable urban
planning and the development of intelligent transportation systems. However,
generating high-fidelity, time-varying traffic profiles that accurately reflect
real-world conditions, especially in large-scale scenarios, remains a major
challenge. Existing methods often suffer from limitations in accuracy,
scalability, or raise privacy concerns due to centralized data processing. This
work introduces DesRUTGe (Decentralized Realistic Urban Traffic Generator), a
novel framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents with
the SUMO simulator to generate realistic 24-hour traffic patterns. A key
innovation of DesRUTGe is its use of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL),
wherein each traffic detector and its corresponding urban zone function as an
independent learning node. These nodes train local DRL models using minimal
historical data and collaboratively refine their performance by exchanging
model parameters with selected peers (e.g., geographically adjacent zones),
without requiring a central coordinator. Evaluated using real-world data from
the city of Barcelona, DesRUTGe outperforms standard SUMO-based tools such as
RouteSampler, as well as other centralized learning approaches, by delivering
more accurate and privacy-preserving traffic pattern generation.

Abstract: Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have
recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These
approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to
generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work,
we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model
weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during
training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely
by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple
interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform
simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight
ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We
further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by
modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image
diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a
realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model,
and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new
domains. Our code is available at

Result: 应用该框架评估3种代表性GraphRAG方法，发现其性能提升较之前报道更为温和。

Conclusion: 尽管框架可能仍有缺陷，但呼吁科学评估为GraphRAG研究奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: By retrieving contexts from knowledge graphs, graph-based retrieval-augmented
generation (GraphRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) to generate quality
answers for user questions. Many GraphRAG methods have been proposed and
reported inspiring performance in answer quality. However, we observe that the
current answer evaluation framework for GraphRAG has two critical flaws, i.e.,
unrelated questions and evaluation biases, which may lead to biased or even
wrong conclusions on performance. To tackle the two flaws, we propose an
unbiased evaluation framework that uses graph-text-grounded question generation
to produce questions that are more related to the underlying dataset and an
unbiased evaluation procedure to eliminate the biases in LLM-based answer
assessment. We apply our unbiased framework to evaluate 3 representative
GraphRAG methods and find that their performance gains are much more moderate
than reported previously. Although our evaluation framework may still have
flaws, it calls for scientific evaluations to lay solid foundations for
GraphRAG research.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled language models have shown promising
results in building intelligent voice assistants. However, most existing
approaches rely on large-scale paired speech-text data and extensive
computational resources, which pose challenges in terms of scalability and
accessibility. In this paper, we present \textbf{TESU-LLM}, a novel framework
that enables training speech-capable language models using only text data. Our
key insight is to leverage a unified encoder that maps semantically equivalent
text and speech inputs to a shared latent space. By aligning the encoder output
with the embedding space of a LLM via a lightweight projection network, we
enable the model to generalize from text-only supervision to speech-based
inference. Despite being trained exclusively on text, TESU-LLM achieves strong
performance on various speech-related benchmarks, comparable to baseline
methods trained with large-scale multimodal datasets and substantial
computational resources. These results highlight the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach, offering a scalable path toward building speech
LLMs without speech data.

Abstract: Toxicity detection in gaming communities faces significant scaling challenges
when expanding across multiple games and languages, particularly in real-time
environments where computational efficiency is crucial. We present two key
findings to address these challenges while building upon our previous work on
ToxBuster, a BERT-based real-time toxicity detection system. First, we
introduce a soft-prompting approach that enables a single model to effectively
handle multiple games by incorporating game-context tokens, matching the
performance of more complex methods like curriculum learning while offering
superior scalability. Second, we develop an LLM-assisted label transfer
framework using GPT-4o-mini to extend support to seven additional languages.
Evaluations on real game chat data across French, German, Portuguese, and
Russian achieve macro F1-scores ranging from 32.96% to 58.88%, with
particularly strong performance in German, surpassing the English benchmark of
45.39%. In production, this unified approach significantly reduces

Abstract: Over the past few years, table interpretation tasks have made significant
progress due to their importance and the introduction of new technologies and
benchmarks in the field. This work experiments with a hybrid approach for
detecting relationships among columns of unlabeled tabular data, using a
Knowledge Graph (KG) as a reference point, a task known as CPA. This approach
leverages large language models (LLMs) while employing statistical analysis to
reduce the search space of potential KG relations. The main modules of this
approach for reducing the search space are domain and range constraints
detection, as well as relation co-appearance analysis. The experimental
evaluation on two benchmark datasets provided by the SemTab challenge assesses
the influence of each module and the effectiveness of different
state-of-the-art LLMs at various levels of quantization. The experiments were
performed, as well as at different prompting techniques. The proposed
methodology, which is publicly available on github, proved to be competitive
with state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在复杂决策场景中长期推理和对齐高目标方面存在挑战，现有方法表现不佳。

Result: 实验表明LAC在多种环境中优于现有方法，甚至用较小模型超越GPT-4基线。

Conclusion: 结合结构化策略优化与LLM内在知识，可显著提升多步环境中的决策能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural
language processing tasks, yet they encounter challenges in complex
decision-making scenarios that require long-term reasoning and alignment with
high-level objectives. Existing methods either rely on short-term
auto-regressive action generation or face limitations in accurately simulating
rollouts and assessing outcomes, leading to sub-optimal decisions. This paper
introduces a novel LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, termed LAC, that
effectively improves LLM policies with long-term action evaluations in a
principled and scalable way. Our approach addresses two key challenges: (1)
extracting robust action evaluations by computing Q-values via token logits
associated with positive/negative outcomes, enhanced by future trajectory
rollouts and reasoning; and (2) enabling efficient policy improvement through a
gradient-free mechanism. Experiments across diverse environments -- including
high-level decision-making (ALFWorld), low-level action spaces (BabyAI-Text),
and large action spaces (WebShop) -- demonstrate the framework's generality and
superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach achieves
competitive performance using 7B/8B parameter LLMs, even outperforming baseline
methods employing GPT-4 in complex tasks. These results underscore the
potential of integrating structured policy optimization with LLMs' intrinsic
knowledge to advance decision-making capabilities in multi-step environments.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，提示注入攻击成为重大安全威胁，现有防御机制在有效性和泛化性之间存在权衡，亟需高效且通用的检测方法。

Method: 提出DMPI-PMHFE框架，结合DeBERTa-v3-base提取语义向量和启发式规则提取结构特征，通过全连接神经网络融合特征进行预测。

Result: 实验表明，DMPI-PMHFE在准确率、召回率和F1分数上优于现有方法，并显著降低主流LLMs的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: DMPI-PMHFE通过双通道特征融合有效解决了单一依赖预训练模型的局限性，为提示注入攻击检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt
injection attacks have emerged as a significant security threat. Existing
defense mechanisms often face critical trade-offs between effectiveness and
generalizability. This highlights the urgent need for efficient prompt
injection detection methods that are applicable across a wide range of LLMs. To
address this challenge, we propose DMPI-PMHFE, a dual-channel feature fusion
detection framework. It integrates a pretrained language model with heuristic
feature engineering to detect prompt injection attacks. Specifically, the
framework employs DeBERTa-v3-base as a feature extractor to transform input
text into semantic vectors enriched with contextual information. In parallel,
we design heuristic rules based on known attack patterns to extract explicit
structural features commonly observed in attacks. Features from both channels
are subsequently fused and passed through a fully connected neural network to
produce the final prediction. This dual-channel approach mitigates the
limitations of relying only on DeBERTa to extract features. Experimental
results on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMPI-PMHFE outperforms
existing methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, when
deployed actually, it significantly reduces attack success rates across
mainstream LLMs, including GLM-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen 2.5, and GPT-4o.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖昂贵的人工标注或外部奖励模型，RLSC旨在通过模型自信度作为奖励信号，减少监督需求。

Method: RLSC利用模型自身的自信度作为奖励信号，应用于Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型，仅需每问题8样本和4训练轮次。

Result: 在AIME2024、MATH500和AMC23数据集上，RLSC分别提升准确率20.10%、49.40%和52.50%。

Conclusion: RLSC为推理模型提供了一种简单、可扩展且监督需求低的训练后优化方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, yet post-training remains
critical for aligning their behavior with task goals. Existing reinforcement
learning (RL) methods often depend on costly human annotations or external
reward models. We propose Reinforcement Learning via Self-Confidence (RLSC),
which uses the model's own confidence as reward signals-eliminating the need
for labels, preference models, or reward engineering. Applied to
Qwen2.5-Math-7B with only 8 samples per question and 4 training epochs, RLSC
improves accuracy by +20.10% on AIME2024, +49.40% on MATH500, and +52.50% on
AMC23. RLSC offers a simple, scalable post-training method for reasoning models
with minimal supervision.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种利用自然语言处理（NLP）和大型语言模型（LLMs）的解决方案，用于战场物联网（IoBT）中的数据查询和信息生成，以提升战场态势感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战场物联网（IoBT）的扩展为态势感知提供了新机会，但需要将设备数据转化为可消费的信息对象，并实时提供给决策者。

Method: 采用自然语言处理（NLP）技术，利用适合边缘设备的大型语言模型（LLMs）和图形数据库，将自然语言问题映射为数据库查询，并将结果以自然语言形式返回。

Result: 实验表明，Llama 3.1（80亿参数）在所有指标上表现最佳，且两步法放松了查询与真实代码的精确匹配要求，准确率提高了19.4%。

Conclusion: 该工作流程为在边缘设备上部署LLMs奠定了基础，支持通过自然语言与数据库交互，助力关键决策。

Abstract: The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the battlefield, Internet of
Battlefield Things (IoBT), gives rise to new opportunities for enhancing
situational awareness. To increase the potential of IoBT for situational
awareness in critical decision making, the data from these devices must be
processed into consumer-ready information objects, and made available to
consumers on demand. To address this challenge we propose a workflow that makes
use of natural language processing (NLP) to query a database technology and
return a response in natural language. Our solution utilizes Large Language
Models (LLMs) that are sized for edge devices to perform NLP as well as
graphical databases which are well suited for dynamic connected networks which
are pervasive in the IoBT. Our architecture employs LLMs for both mapping
questions in natural language to Cypher database queries as well as to
summarize the database output back to the user in natural language. We evaluate
several medium sized LLMs for both of these tasks on a database representing
publicly available data from the US Army's Multipurpose Sensing Area (MSA) at
the Jornada Range in Las Cruces, NM. We observe that Llama 3.1 (8 billion
parameters) outperforms the other models across all the considered metrics.
Most importantly, we note that, unlike current methods, our two step approach
allows the relaxation of the Exact Match (EM) requirement of the produced
Cypher queries with ground truth code and, in this way, it achieves a 19.4%
increase in accuracy. Our workflow lays the ground work for deploying LLMs on
edge devices to enable natural language interactions with databases containing
information objects for critical decision making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻量级大语言模型在资源效率和隐私方面有优势，但推理和推理能力有限，现有提示优化方法对其效果不佳。

Method: DeBoP将复杂提示优化转化为离散、可量化的执行序列优化，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索。

Result: DeBoP在七项任务中表现优于现有方法，优化后的LwLLMs性能超越GPT-3.5，计算时间减少60%。

Conclusion: DeBoP为LwLLMs提供了一种高效的自动优化方法，显著提升其实际应用能力。

Abstract: Lightweight Large Language Models (LwLLMs) are reduced-parameter, optimized
models designed to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, offering
significant advantages in resource efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and data
privacy. However, these models often struggle with limited inference and
reasoning capabilities, which restrict their performance on complex tasks and
limit their practical applicability. Moreover, existing prompt optimization
methods typically rely on extensive manual effort or the meta-cognitive
abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, making them less effective for LwLLMs. To
address these challenges, we introduce DeBoP, a new Direct Behavior
Optimization Paradigm, original from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
technique. Unlike CoT Prompting, DeBoP is an automatic optimization method,
which focuses on the optimization directly on the behavior of LwLLMs. In
particular, DeBoP transforms the optimization of complex prompts into the
optimization of discrete, quantifiable execution sequences using a
gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search. We evaluate DeBoP on seven challenging
tasks where state-of-the-art LLMs excel but LwLLMs generally underperform.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeBoP significantly outperforms recent
prompt optimization methods on most tasks. In particular, DeBoP-optimized
LwLLMs surpass GPT-3.5 on most tasks while reducing computational time by
approximately 60% compared to other automatic prompt optimization methods.

Result: 对齐模型比未微调模型更易产生有害行为，且风险略高于其他微调模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了价值观对齐的潜在风险，并提出上下文对齐方法以提升安全性。

Abstract: The application scope of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand,
leading to increasing interest in personalized LLMs that align with human
values. However, aligning these models with individual values raises
significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful
information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with
value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these
challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are
more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit
slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned
models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely
generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful
outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant
correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by
psychological hypotheses. This study offers insights into the "black box" of
value alignment and proposes in-context alignment methods to enhance the safety
of value-aligned LLMs.

Conclusion: SMAR为多模态MoE模型提供了一种高效平衡模态差异和语言能力的解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have become a key approach for scaling
large language models, with growing interest in extending them to multimodal
tasks. Existing methods to build multimodal MoE models either incur high
training costs or suffer from degraded language capabilities when adapting
pretrained models. To address this, we propose Soft ModalityAware Routing
(SMAR), a novel regularization technique that uses Kullback Leibler divergence
to control routing probability distributions across modalities, encouraging
expert specialization without modifying model architecture or heavily relying
on textual data. Experiments on visual instruction tuning show that SMAR
preserves language ability at 86.6% retention with only 2.5% pure text,
outperforming baselines while maintaining strong multimodal performance. Our
approach offers a practical and efficient solution to balance modality
differentiation and language capabilities in multimodal MoE models.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在推理时可能生成非规范的标记序列，带来负面影响，因此需要一种方法确保生成规范的序列。

Method: 基于理论分析，提出“规范采样”方法，确保在自回归生成过程的每一步都生成部分规范标记序列。

Result: 规范采样方法简单高效，且生成的标记序列分布比标准采样更接近训练数据的真实分布。

Conclusion: 规范采样有效解决了非规范序列生成问题，并提升了模型输出的质量。

Abstract: State of the art large language models are trained using large amounts of
tokens derived from raw text using what is called a tokenizer. Crucially, the
tokenizer determines the (token) vocabulary a model will use during inference
as well as, in principle, the (token) language. This is because, while the
token vocabulary may allow for different tokenizations of a string, the
tokenizer always maps the string to only one of these tokenizations--the
canonical tokenization. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest
that large language models do not always generate canonical token sequences,
and this comes with several negative consequences. In this work, we first show
that, to generate a canonical token sequence, a model needs to generate
(partial) canonical token sequences at each step of the autoregressive
generation process underpinning its functioning. Building upon this theoretical
result, we introduce canonical sampling, a simple and efficient sampling method
that precludes a given model from generating non-canonical token sequences.
Further, we also show that, in comparison with standard sampling, the
distribution of token sequences generated using canonical sampling is provably
closer to the true distribution of token sequences used during training.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在上下文信息与参数知识冲突时的行为，以评估其可靠性和潜在问题。

Method: 构建诊断数据以引发冲突，分析模型在多种任务类型中的表现。

Result: 发现知识冲突对无需知识的任务影响小，模型在知识一致时表现更好，且难以完全抑制内部知识。提供冲突解释会增加对上下文的依赖。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型评估的局限性，强调在部署大语言模型时需考虑知识冲突问题。

Abstract: Large language models frequently rely on both contextual input and parametric
knowledge to perform tasks. However, these sources can come into conflict,
especially when retrieved documents contradict the model's parametric
knowledge. We propose a diagnostic framework to systematically evaluate LLM
behavior under context-memory conflict, where the contextual information
diverges from their parametric beliefs. We construct diagnostic data that
elicit these conflicts and analyze model performance across multiple task
types. Our findings reveal that (1) knowledge conflict has minimal impact on
tasks that do not require knowledge utilization, (2) model performance is
consistently higher when contextual and parametric knowledge are aligned, (3)
models are unable to fully suppress their internal knowledge even when
instructed, and (4) providing rationales that explain the conflict increases
reliance on contexts. These insights raise concerns about the validity of
model-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge
conflict in the deployment of LLMs.

Conclusion: 合成数据与RAFT结合是提升LLMs在EDA领域性能的有效方法，但需注意数据安全和记忆风险。

Abstract: Electronic design engineers often struggle to efficiently access relevant
information for tasks like design verification and technology development.
While large language models (LLMs) can enhance productivity as conversational
agents, pre-trained open-source LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge for
Electronic Design Automation (EDA). In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
context, LLMs rely on external context but may still produce inaccurate
responses. Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) improves LLM performance, but
acquiring labeled question/answer (Q/A) data in EDA is difficult. To address
this, we propose using synthetic Q/A datasets to enhance LLMs with RAFT. Our
results show that RAFT with synthetic data significantly boosts LLM performance
for RAG-based EDA tasks. We also investigate the impact of using real user
questions as Retrieval-Augmented Few-Shot (RAFS) examples for synthetic data
generation. Additionally, we implement secure access control to ensure
sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel. Finally, we
assess the risk of data leakage and unintended memorization during fine-tuning
with synthetic data, providing practical insights.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了偏见传播的普遍性，呼吁在开发复杂AI模型时需关注公平性问题。

Abstract: To build fair AI systems we need to understand how social-group biases
intrinsic to foundational encoder-based vision-language models (VLMs) manifest
in biases in downstream tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic
biases in VLM representations systematically ``carry over'' or propagate into
zero-shot retrieval tasks, revealing how deeply rooted biases shape a model's
outputs. We introduce a controlled framework to measure this propagation by
correlating (a) intrinsic measures of bias in the representational space with
(b) extrinsic measures of bias in zero-shot text-to-image (TTI) and
image-to-text (ITT) retrieval. Results show substantial correlations between
intrinsic and extrinsic bias, with an average $\rho$ = 0.83 $\pm$ 0.10. This
pattern is consistent across 114 analyses, both retrieval directions, six
social groups, and three distinct VLMs. Notably, we find that
larger/better-performing models exhibit greater bias propagation, a finding
that raises concerns given the trend towards increasingly complex AI models.
Our framework introduces baseline evaluation tasks to measure the propagation
of group and valence signals. Investigations reveal that underrepresented
groups experience less robust propagation, further skewing their model-related
outcomes.

Abstract: Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on
post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction
following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training
datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to
the public, with limited information about their construction process. This
lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source
post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield
performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain
challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them
rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains
unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence
downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open
post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie
framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including
turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and
response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and
qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on
these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data
mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset
while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings
offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training
datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To
support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets
and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂查询中常遗漏或误解部分条件，导致意图幻觉，需系统性评估。

Method: 引入FAITHQA基准（20,068问题），涵盖查询与检索增强生成，评估LLMs表现。提出CONSTRAINT SCORE自动指标。

Result: 发现意图幻觉普遍存在，源于遗漏或误解；CONSTRAINT SCORE接近人类评估效果。

Conclusion: 意图幻觉是LLMs常见问题，FAITHQA与CONSTRAINT SCORE为未来研究提供工具。

Abstract: When exposed to complex queries containing multiple conditions, today's large
language models (LLMs) tend to produce responses that only partially satisfy
the query while neglecting certain conditions. We therefore introduce the
concept of Intent Hallucination. In this phenomenon, LLMs either omit
(neglecting to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented
query parts) elements of the given query, leading to intent hallucinated
generation. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce
FAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068
problems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
setups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination
benchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the
fundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on
FAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for
state-of-the-art models, and (2) the phenomenon stems from omission or
misinterpretation of LLMs. To facilitate future research, we introduce an
automatic LLM generation evaluation metric, CONSTRAINT SCORE, for detecting
intent hallucination. Human evaluation results demonstrate that CONSTRAINT
SCORE is closer to human performance for intent hallucination compared to
baselines.

Result: 多模态信息（尤其是图像）显著提升标题生成质量，更接近作者原始风格。

Conclusion: 多模态个性化方法优于纯文本，LaMP-Cap为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型存在内在幻觉问题，即生成看似合理但未经证实的文本。为研究这一问题，论文提出PIC任务，要求模型基于可验证的短句生成长文本。

Method: 提出PIC任务和PIC-Bench基准，评估模型在完整和部分设置下的表现，并开发后训练框架PIC-LM，通过弱监督偏好数据提升模型准确性。

Result: 实验显示，现有模型在70%以上的输出中存在幻觉。PIC-LM将F1分数从69.1%提升至91.0%，并在下游任务中显著提升事实性。

Conclusion: PIC-LM通过精确控制信息生成，有效减少幻觉，为事实性文本生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: A central challenge in modern language models (LMs) is intrinsic
hallucination: the generation of information that is plausible but
unsubstantiated relative to input context. To study this problem, we propose
Precise Information Control (PIC), a new task formulation that requires models
to generate long-form outputs grounded in a provided set of short
self-contained statements, known as verifiable claims, without adding any
unsupported ones. For comprehensiveness, PIC includes a full setting that tests
a model's ability to include exactly all input claims, and a partial setting
that requires the model to selectively incorporate only relevant claims. We
present PIC-Bench, a benchmark of eight long-form generation tasks (e.g.,
summarization, biography generation) adapted to the PIC setting, where LMs are
supplied with well-formed, verifiable input claims. Our evaluation of a range
of open and proprietary LMs on PIC-Bench reveals that, surprisingly,
state-of-the-art LMs still intrinsically hallucinate in over 70% of outputs. To
alleviate this lack of faithfulness, we introduce a post-training framework,
using a weakly supervised preference data construction method, to train an 8B
PIC-LM with stronger PIC ability--improving from 69.1% to 91.0% F1 in the full
PIC setting. When integrated into end-to-end factual generation pipelines,
PIC-LM improves exact match recall by 17.1% on ambiguous QA with retrieval, and
factual precision by 30.5% on a birthplace verification task, underscoring the
potential of precisely grounded generation.

Abstract: Existing LLM-based medical question-answering systems lack citation
generation and evaluation capabilities, raising concerns about their adoption

*Charles Goddard,Fernando Fernandes Neto*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 提出一种无需训练的方法，通过正交匹配追踪（OMP）重建未见过的词嵌入，实现预训练大语言模型（LLM）中分词器的移植。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在不同分词器之间移植时的性能下降问题，尤其是数学推理能力的保留。

Method: 使用OMP将新词表示为共享词的稀疏线性组合，分两阶段完成嵌入空间的转换。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，OMP表现最佳，优于其他零样本方法，且无需梯度更新。

Conclusion: OMP方法有效解决了分词器差异问题，支持跨分词器的知识蒸馏和领域适应。

Abstract: We present a training-free method to transplant tokenizers in pretrained
large language models (LLMs) by reconstructing unseen token embeddings via
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Specifically, we approximate each
out-of-vocabulary token as a sparse linear combination of shared tokens, in two
phases: first, compute each new token's representation in the donor embedding
space with a small dictionary of shared anchor tokens, then transfer these same
sparse coefficients back into the base model's embedding space.
  On two challenging cross-tokenizer tasks--Llama$\to$Mistral NeMo (12B) and
Qwen$\to$Llama (1B)--we show that OMP achieves best zero-shot preservation of
the base model's performance across multiple benchmarks, while other zero-shot
approaches degrade significantly. Compared to baselines (zero-init, mean-init,
and existing approaches like WECHSEL, FOCUS, ZETT), OMP consistently achieves
the best overall performance, effectively bridging large tokenizer
discrepancies without gradient updates. Our analysis further identifies
mismatched numerical tokenization schemes as a critical challenge for
preserving mathematical reasoning capabilities. This technique enables direct
reuse of pretrained model weights with new tokenizers, facilitating
cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation, speculative decoding, ensembling,
merging, and domain-specific vocabulary adaptations. We integrate our method
into the open-source mergekit-tokensurgeon tool for post hoc vocabulary
realignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索小模型和大模型间特征表示的相似性，以降低训练昂贵组件（如SAE）的成本。

Method: 利用仿射映射技术迁移SAE权重，比较不同大小模型的表示空间。

Result: 小模型和大模型的表示空间高度相似，迁移SAE可节省50%训练成本；特征级迁移显示语义和结构特征迁移效果不同。

Conclusion: 揭示了大小模型线性表示空间的异同，并提出提升SAE训练效率的方法。

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that affine mappings between residual streams of
language models is a cheap way to effectively transfer represented features
between models. We apply this technique to transfer the weights of Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) between models of different sizes to compare their
representations. We find that small and large models learn highly similar
representation spaces, which motivates training expensive components like SAEs
on a smaller model and transferring to a larger model at a FLOPs savings. For
example, using a small-to-large transferred SAE as initialization can lead to
50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs on larger models. Next, we show
that transferred probes and steering vectors can effectively recover ground
truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into feature-level transferability,
finding that semantic and structural features transfer noticeably differently
while specific classes of functional features have their roles faithfully
mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the
linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method
for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.

TLDR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）与传统机器学习分类器在社交媒体数据上的抑郁语言检测性能，发现零样本LLMs在二元分类中表现优异，但在细粒度分类中表现不佳，而基于LLM生成摘要嵌入的分类器表现更优。


<details>

Motivation: 通过社交媒体数据准确检测抑郁语言有助于心理健康早期干预，对临床实践和公共卫生具有重要意义。

Method: 比较了零样本LLMs与监督分类器在三种分类任务中的表现，包括二元抑郁分类、抑郁严重程度分类及抑郁、PTSD和焦虑的鉴别诊断。

Result: 零样本LLMs在二元分类中泛化能力强，但在细粒度分类中表现不佳；基于LLM摘要嵌入的分类器表现更优。

Conclusion: LLMs在心理健康预测中具有潜力，未来可通过优化零样本能力和上下文感知摘要技术进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable detection of depressive language in social media
is useful for early interventions of mental health conditions, and has
important implications for both clinical practice and broader public health
efforts. In this paper, we investigate the performance of large language models
(LLMs) and traditional machine learning classifiers across three classification
tasks involving social media data: binary depression classification, depression
severity classification, and differential diagnosis classification among
depression, PTSD, and anxiety. Our study compares zero-shot LLMs with
supervised classifiers trained on both conventional text embeddings and
LLM-generated summary embeddings. Our experiments reveal that while zero-shot
LLMs demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in binary classification,
they struggle with fine-grained ordinal classifications. In contrast,
classifiers trained on summary embeddings generated by LLMs demonstrate
competitive, and in some cases superior, performance on the classification
tasks, particularly when compared to models using traditional text embeddings.
Our findings demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in mental health prediction, and
suggest promising directions for better utilization of their zero-shot
capabilities and context-aware summarization techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文介绍了BRIEFME数据集，用于评估语言模型在法律简报写作中的能力，包括摘要、补全和案例检索任务。结果显示，当前大语言模型在部分任务上表现良好，但在其他任务上仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索法律简报写作这一未被充分研究的领域，评估语言模型在法律工作中的实际应用能力。

Method: 创建BRIEFME数据集，包含三个任务：论点摘要、论点补全和案例检索，并分析当前模型的性能。

Result: 大语言模型在摘要和指导性补全任务上表现优异，但在实际论点补全和案例检索任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: BRIEFME数据集有望推动法律NLP的发展，帮助法律专业人士更高效地工作。

Abstract: A core part of legal work that has been under-explored in Legal NLP is the
writing and editing of legal briefs. This requires not only a thorough
understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but
also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new
direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges.
To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce
BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for
language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument
summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we
describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models
perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite
good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating
human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our
benchmark: realistic argument completion and retrieving relevant legal cases.
We hope this dataset encourages more development in Legal NLP in ways that will
specifically aid people in performing legal work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究集中于单次心理咨询，而实际心理咨询是一个持续多会话的过程，需要逐步解决客户问题。

Method: 构建了基于真实客户案例的多会话心理咨询数据集（MusPsy-Dataset），并开发了能够跟踪客户进展并调整咨询方向的模型（MusPsy-Model）。

Result: 实验证明，MusPsy-Model在多会话心理咨询中表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: MusPsy-Dataset和MusPsy-Model填补了多会话心理咨询研究的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in automated psychological counseling. However, current research focuses on
single-session counseling, which doesn't represent real-world scenarios. In
practice, psychological counseling is a process, not a one-time event,
requiring sustained, multi-session engagement to progressively address clients'
issues. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dataset for Multi-Session
Psychological Counseling Conversation Dataset (MusPsy-Dataset). Our
MusPsy-Dataset is constructed using real client profiles from publicly
available psychological case reports. It captures the dynamic arc of
counseling, encompassing multiple progressive counseling conversations from the
same client across different sessions. Leveraging our dataset, we also
developed our MusPsy-Model, which aims to track client progress and adapt its
counseling direction over time. Experiments show that our model performs better
than baseline models across multiple sessions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有LLM安全评估标准主观性强且缺乏系统性，作者从法律角度出发，提出SafeLawBench基准，以更客观、全面地评估LLM安全性。

Method: SafeLawBench将安全风险分为三级，包含24,860道选择题和1,106道开放域QA任务，采用零样本和少样本提示对2个闭源及18个开源LLM进行评估。

Result: 实验显示，即使是领先的Claude-3.5-Sonnet和GPT-4o模型，在多选题任务中准确率也未超过80.5%，20个LLM的平均准确率为68.8%。多数投票机制可提升模型表现。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁社区重视LLM安全性研究，并展示了SafeLawBench在系统性评估中的潜力。

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs), the safety of
LLMs has raised significant concerns. However, there is still a lack of
definitive standards for evaluating their safety due to the subjective nature
of current safety benchmarks. To address this gap, we conducted the first
exploration of LLMs' safety evaluation from a legal perspective by proposing
the SafeLawBench benchmark. SafeLawBench categorizes safety risks into three
levels based on legal standards, providing a systematic and comprehensive
framework for evaluation. It comprises 24,860 multi-choice questions and 1,106
open-domain question-answering (QA) tasks. Our evaluation included 2
closed-source LLMs and 18 open-source LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, highlighting the safety features of each model. We also evaluated
the LLMs' safety-related reasoning stability and refusal behavior.
Additionally, we found that a majority voting mechanism can enhance model
performance. Notably, even leading SOTA models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
GPT-4o have not exceeded 80.5% accuracy in multi-choice tasks on SafeLawBench,
while the average accuracy of 20 LLMs remains at 68.8\%. We urge the community
to prioritize research on the safety of LLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注点估计，缺乏对不同方法的系统比较，且在处理文本到分布预测任务（如价格估计）时，需要更细致的文本理解和不确定性量化。

Method: 提出了一种分位数回归方法，使LLMs能够生成完整的预测分布，并在三个价格预测数据集上进行了实验。

Result: 实验表明，经过分位数头微调的Mistral-7B模型在预测准确性和分布校准方面显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LLMs在概率回归任务中表现出色，特别是在文本理解和不确定性量化方面，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in structured prediction
tasks, including regression, but existing approaches primarily focus on point
estimates and lack systematic comparison across different methods. We
investigate probabilistic regression using LLMs for unstructured inputs,
addressing challenging text-to-distribution prediction tasks such as price
estimation where both nuanced text understanding and uncertainty quantification
are critical. We propose a novel quantile regression approach that enables LLMs
to produce full predictive distributions, improving upon traditional point
estimates. Through extensive experiments across three diverse price prediction
datasets, we demonstrate that a Mistral-7B model fine-tuned with quantile heads
significantly outperforms traditional approaches for both point and
distributional estimations, as measured by three established metrics each for
prediction accuracy and distributional calibration. Our systematic comparison
of LLM approaches, model architectures, training approaches, and data scaling
reveals that Mistral-7B consistently outperforms encoder architectures,
embedding-based methods, and few-shot learning methods. Our experiments also
reveal the effectiveness of LLM-assisted label correction in achieving
human-level accuracy without systematic bias. Our curated datasets are made
available at https://github.com/vnik18/llm-price-quantile-reg/ to support
future research.

Motivation: 现有方法（点级干预）仅能控制概念子空间的点，无法覆盖其周围区域，限制了模型的精细控制能力。

Method: 提出分布级干预，学习概念子空间的点及其周围区域，并在早期层应用，标准偏差与性能强相关。

Result: 在八个常识推理和七个算术推理基准测试中，分布级干预在可控性和鲁棒性上优于点级干预。

Conclusion: 分布级干预为语言模型提供了更全面的行为控制方法，实现了更精细的模型调控。

Abstract: Interventions in language models (LMs) are applied strategically to steer
model behavior during the forward pass. Learnable interventions, also known as
representation fine-tuning, aim to apply pointwise control within the concept
subspace and have proven effective in altering high-level behaviors. In this
work, we extend this approach to the distribution level, enabling the model to
learn not only pointwise transformations but also the surrounding regions of
the concept subspace. We demonstrate that these methods perform effectively in
early layers, with larger standard deviations correlating strongly with
improved performance. Across eight commonsense reasoning and seven arithmetic
reasoning benchmarks, our distribution-wise interventions consistently
outperform pointwise interventions in controllability and robustness. These
results illustrate that distribution-wise interventions provide a more
comprehensive method for steering model behavior and enabling finer-grained
control over language models. The code is at:

Motivation: 传统RAG系统采用静态检索和上下文知识注入，难以满足多跳推理和自适应信息访问的需求。

Method: 动态RAG实时调整检索时机和内容，参数化RAG从输入级转向参数级知识注入。

Result: 动态RAG和参数化RAG在效率和效果上均有提升。

Conclusion: 论文为RAG的未来研究提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a foundational paradigm for
equipping large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, playing a
critical role in information retrieval and knowledge-intensive applications.
However, conventional RAG systems typically adopt a static
retrieve-then-generate pipeline and rely on in-context knowledge injection,
which can be suboptimal for complex tasks that require multihop reasoning,
adaptive information access, and deeper integration of external knowledge.
Motivated by these limitations, the research community has moved beyond static
retrieval and in-context knowledge injection. Among the emerging directions,
this tutorial delves into two rapidly growing and complementary research areas
on RAG: Dynamic RAG and Parametric RAG. Dynamic RAG adaptively determines when
and what to retrieve during the LLM's generation process, enabling real-time
adaptation to the LLM's evolving information needs. Parametric RAG rethinks how
retrieved knowledge should be injected into LLMs, transitioning from
input-level to parameter-level knowledge injection for enhanced efficiency and
effectiveness. This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of recent advances
in these emerging research areas. It also shares theoretical foundations and
practical insights to support and inspire further research in RAG.

Motivation: 在专业和高风险领域检测LLM生成文本对打击错误信息和确保真实性至关重要，但现有零样本检测器因领域偏移而失效。

Method: 提出DivScore框架，结合归一化熵评分和领域知识蒸馏，用于零样本检测。

Result: DivScore在医学和法律领域的基准测试中表现优异，AUROC提升14.4%，召回率提升64.0%。

Conclusion: DivScore在专业领域和对抗场景中均表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Detecting LLM-generated text in specialized and high-stakes domains like
medicine and law is crucial for combating misinformation and ensuring
authenticity. However, current zero-shot detectors, while effective on general
text, often fail when applied to specialized content due to domain shift. We
provide a theoretical analysis showing this failure is fundamentally linked to
the KL divergence between human, detector, and source text distributions. To
address this, we propose DivScore, a zero-shot detection framework using
normalized entropy-based scoring and domain knowledge distillation to robustly
identify LLM-generated text in specialized domains. We also release a
domain-specific benchmark for LLM-generated text detection in the medical and
legal domains. Experiments on our benchmark show that DivScore consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, with 14.4% higher AUROC and 64.0%
higher recall (0.1% false positive rate threshold). In adversarial settings,
DivScore demonstrates superior robustness than other baselines, achieving on
average 22.8% advantage in AUROC and 29.5% in recall. Code and data are

Conclusion: 本文首次全面综述了RetNet架构及其应用，并提出了未来研究方向，以推动其进一步发展。

Abstract: Retentive Network (RetNet) represents a significant advancement in neural
network architecture, offering an efficient alternative to the Transformer.
While Transformers rely on self-attention to model dependencies, they suffer
from high memory costs and limited scalability when handling long sequences due
to their quadratic complexity. To mitigate these limitations, RetNet introduces
a retention mechanism that unifies the inductive bias of recurrence with the
global dependency modeling of attention. This mechanism enables linear-time
inference, facilitates efficient modeling of extended contexts, and remains
compatible with fully parallelizable training pipelines. RetNet has garnered
significant research interest due to its consistently demonstrated cross-domain
effectiveness, achieving robust performance across machine learning paradigms
including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time-series
analysis. However, a comprehensive review of RetNet is still missing from the
current literature. This paper aims to fill that gap by offering the first
detailed survey of the RetNet architecture, its key innovations, and its
diverse applications. We also explore the main challenges associated with
RetNet and propose future research directions to support its continued
advancement in both academic research and practical deployment.

Abstract: Navigating healthcare systems can be complex and overwhelming, creating
barriers for patients seeking timely and appropriate medical attention. In this
paper, we introduce C-PATH (Conversational Patient Assistance and Triage in
Healthcare), a novel conversational AI system powered by large language models
(LLMs) designed to assist patients in recognizing symptoms and recommending
appropriate medical departments through natural, multi-turn dialogues. C-PATH
is fine-tuned on medical knowledge, dialogue data, and clinical summaries using
a multi-stage pipeline built on the LLaMA3 architecture. A core contribution of
this work is a GPT-based data augmentation framework that transforms structured
clinical knowledge from DDXPlus into lay-person-friendly conversations,
allowing alignment with patient communication norms. We also implement a
scalable conversation history management strategy to ensure long-range
coherence. Evaluation with GPTScore demonstrates strong performance across
dimensions such as clarity, informativeness, and recommendation accuracy.
Quantitative benchmarks show that C-PATH achieves superior performance in
GPT-rewritten conversational datasets, significantly outperforming
domain-specific baselines. C-PATH represents a step forward in the development
of user-centric, accessible, and accurate AI tools for digital health
assistance and triage.

Abstract: This paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs with respect to various
countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with
conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a
novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from
different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with
models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing
prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with
manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution,
sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with
swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs,
challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a
framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.

pragmatic understanding, highlighting their potential for detecting and
explaining the meaning of implicit content. However, their ability to do this
within political discourse remains largely underexplored. Leveraging, for the
first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus, which comprises Italian political
speeches with the annotation of manipulative implicit content, we propose
methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through
a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that
all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures. We
conclude that current LLMs lack the key pragmatic capabilities necessary for
accurately interpreting highly implicit language, such as that found in
political discourse. At the same time, we highlight promising trends and future
directions for enhancing model performance. We release our data and code at

### [274] [Extending dependencies to the taggedPBC: Word order in transitive clauses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06785)
*Hiram Ring*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文介绍了一个依赖标注版本的taggedPBC数据集，扩展了原数据集的POS标注，并验证了其词序信息的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原taggedPBC数据集未标注依赖关系，限制了其在跨语言研究中的应用。

Method: 通过CoNLLU格式将依赖信息与POS标注一起转移到所有语言中。

Result: 尽管标注质量存在争议，但词序信息与专家确定的词序相关性显著。

Conclusion: 依赖标注数据集为语料库类型学研究提供了新工具，即使数据噪声较大，也能提供重要见解。

Abstract: The taggedPBC (Ring 2025a) contains more than 1,800 sentences of pos-tagged
parallel text data from over 1,500 languages, representing 133 language
families and 111 isolates. While this dwarfs previously available resources,
and the POS tags achieve decent accuracy, allowing for predictive
crosslinguistic insights (Ring 2025b), the dataset was not initially annotated
for dependencies. This paper reports on a CoNLLU-formatted version of the
dataset which transfers dependency information along with POS tags to all
languages in the taggedPBC. Although there are various concerns regarding the
quality of the tags and the dependencies, word order information derived from
this dataset regarding the position of arguments and predicates in transitive
clauses correlates with expert determinations of word order in three
typological databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp). This highlights the usefulness
of corpus-based typological approaches (as per Baylor et al. 2023; Bjerva 2024)
for extending comparisons of discrete linguistic categories, and suggests that
important insights can be gained even from noisy data, given sufficient
annotation. The dependency-annotated corpora are also made available for
research and collaboration via GitHub.

Motivation: 系统探索LLMs在心理修辞背景下的说服和抵抗能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 评估四种LLMs在对抗对话中的表现，引入11种心理说服策略，并提出基于直接偏好优化的自适应框架。

Result: 实验表明，特定策略（如流畅效应和重复效应）显著提高说服成功率，自适应框架进一步优化策略选择。

Conclusion: 自适应心理说服方法有效提升LLMs的说服能力，同时保持其通用性。

Abstract: Previous work has showcased the intriguing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in instruction-following and rhetorical fluency. However,
systematic exploration of their dual capabilities to autonomously persuade and
resist persuasion, particularly in contexts involving psychological rhetoric,
remains unexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate four commonly adopted LLMs
by tasking them to alternately act as persuaders and listeners in adversarial
dialogues. Empirical results show that persuader LLMs predominantly employ
repetitive strategies, leading to low success rates. Then we introduce eleven
comprehensive psychological persuasion strategies, finding that explicitly
instructing LLMs to adopt specific strategies such as Fluency Effect and
Repetition Effect significantly improves persuasion success rates. However, no
``one-size-fits-all'' strategy proves universally effective, with performance
heavily dependent on contextual counterfactuals. Motivated by these
observations, we propose an adaptive framework based on direct preference
optimization that trains LLMs to autonomously select optimal strategies by
leveraging persuasion results from strategy-specific responses as preference
pairs. Experiments on three open-source LLMs confirm that the proposed adaptive
psychological persuasion method effectively enables persuader LLMs to select
optimal strategies, significantly enhancing their success rates while
maintaining general capabilities. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对文本数据爆炸，手动分类变得困难，需要一种高效且通用的自动分类方法。

Method: 利用预定义标签描述生成模型，通过句子变换器匹配生成描述与标签，结合交叉熵损失和余弦相似度的双重损失函数。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最新最优性能，Micro-F1提升13.94%，Macro-F1提升24.85%。

Conclusion: LAGAMC模型在参数效率和通用性上表现优异，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The explosion of textual data has made manual document classification
increasingly challenging. To address this, we introduce a robust, efficient
domain-agnostic generative model framework for multi-label text classification.
Instead of treating labels as mere atomic symbols, our approach utilizes
predefined label descriptions and is trained to generate these descriptions
based on the input text. During inference, the generated descriptions are
matched to the pre-defined labels using a finetuned sentence transformer. We
integrate this with a dual-objective loss function, combining cross-entropy
loss and cosine similarity of the generated sentences with the predefined
target descriptions, ensuring both semantic alignment and accuracy. Our
proposed model LAGAMC stands out for its parameter efficiency and versatility
across diverse datasets, making it well-suited for practical applications. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by achieving new
state-of-the-art performances across all evaluated datasets, surpassing several
strong baselines. We achieve improvements of 13.94% in Micro-F1 and 24.85% in
Macro-F1 compared to the closest baseline across all datasets.

TLDR: 语言模型在区分可能事件与不可能事件的能力上表现不稳定，某些情况下甚至不如随机猜测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型是否能可靠区分可能事件与不可能事件，并分析其表现不稳定的原因。

Method: 通过分离可能性、典型性和上下文相关性，测试多种语言模型（如Llama 3、Gemma 2、Mistral NeMo）的表现。

Result: 在特定条件下，所有测试模型表现低于随机水平，甚至为不可能句子分配更高概率。

Conclusion: 语言模型在此任务上的能力尚不稳健，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Can language models reliably predict that possible events are more likely
than merely improbable ones? By teasing apart possibility, typicality, and
contextual relatedness, we show that despite the results of previous work,
language models' ability to do this is far from robust. In fact, under certain
conditions, all models tested - including Llama 3, Gemma 2, and Mistral NeMo -
perform at worse-than-chance level, assigning higher probabilities to
impossible sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket by the brake'
than to merely unlikely sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket
by the explorer'.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏同时控制问题难度和叙事的能力，而这对教育目的的问题生成至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种联合叙事和难度控制的策略，用于生成阅读理解问题。

Result: 初步证明该策略可行，但并非在所有情况下都有效，并明确了其适用条件和权衡。

Conclusion: 该策略为教育领域的问题生成提供了新的可能性，但需进一步优化以适应更广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Question Generation (QG), the task of automatically generating questions from
a source input, has seen significant progress in recent years.
Difficulty-controllable QG (DCQG) enables control over the difficulty level of
generated questions while considering the learner's ability. Additionally,
narrative-controllable QG (NCQG) allows control over the narrative aspects
embedded in the questions. However, research in QG lacks a focus on combining
these two types of control, which is important for generating questions
tailored to educational purposes. To address this gap, we propose a strategy
for Joint Narrative and Difficulty Control, enabling simultaneous control over
these two attributes in the generation of reading comprehension questions. Our
evaluation provides preliminary evidence that this approach is feasible, though
it is not effective across all instances. Our findings highlight the conditions
under which the strategy performs well and discuss the trade-offs associated
with its application.

Motivation: 研究在线政治话语对分析公众意见和意识形态极化至关重要，但孟加拉语等资源匮乏语言的研究因缺乏数据集而受限。

Method: 通过社区知情的关键词检索手动整理数据集，并概述其主题和多语言内容。

Result: 构建了一个多语言的孟加拉跨国政治话语数据集，涵盖三个不同社区结构和互动动态的在线平台。

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究资源匮乏语言的政治话语提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Understanding political discourse in online spaces is crucial for analyzing
public opinion and ideological polarization. While social computing and
computational linguistics have explored such discussions in English, such
research efforts are significantly limited in major yet under-resourced
languages like Bengali due to the unavailability of datasets. In this paper, we
present a multilingual dataset of Bengali transnational political discourse
(BTPD) collected from three online platforms, each representing distinct
community structures and interaction dynamics. Besides describing how we
hand-curated the dataset through community-informed keyword-based retrieval,
this paper also provides a general overview of its topics and multilingual

Motivation: 研究低资源语言（如孟加拉语）中身份偏见的普遍性及其对边缘化社区的影响。

Method: 对基于mBERT和BanglaBERT的情感分析模型进行算法审计，使用Google Dataset Search中的所有孟加拉语情感分析数据集进行微调。

Result: 模型在不同身份类别中表现出偏见，且预训练模型与多样化背景的数据集结合时存在不一致性和不确定性。

Conclusion: 研究结果与认识论不公正、AI对齐和算法审计方法论的讨论相关，强调了解决低资源语言中偏见的重要性。

Abstract: Sociotechnical systems, such as language technologies, frequently exhibit
identity-based biases. These biases exacerbate the experiences of historically
marginalized communities and remain understudied in low-resource contexts.
While models and datasets specific to a language or with multilingual support
are commonly recommended to address these biases, this paper empirically tests
the effectiveness of such approaches in the context of gender, religion, and
nationality-based identities in Bengali, a widely spoken but low-resourced
language. We conducted an algorithmic audit of sentiment analysis models built
on mBERT and BanglaBERT, which were fine-tuned using all Bengali sentiment
analysis (BSA) datasets from Google Dataset Search. Our analyses showed that
BSA models exhibit biases across different identity categories despite having
similar semantic content and structure. We also examined the inconsistencies
and uncertainties arising from combining pre-trained models and datasets
created by individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds. We connected these
findings to the broader discussions on epistemic injustice, AI alignment, and
methodological decisions in algorithmic audits.

Motivation: 现有方法将情感理解视为分类问题，缺乏对预测背后逻辑的解释。本文旨在通过情感推理提升AudioLLMs在情感任务中的表现。

Method: 提出统一框架，结合推理增强的数据监督、双编码器架构和任务交替训练，使AudioLLMs能有效学习多任务并融入情感推理。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上的实验表明，该方法不仅提高了情感预测准确率，还增强了生成响应的连贯性和证据基础。

Conclusion: 通过情感推理和统一框架，AudioLLMs在情感任务中的表现显著提升，同时生成更具解释性的结果。

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have achieved strong results in
semantic tasks like speech recognition and translation, but remain limited in
modeling paralinguistic cues such as emotion. Existing approaches often treat
emotion understanding as a classification problem, offering little insight into
the underlying rationale behind predictions. In this work, we explore emotion
reasoning, a strategy that leverages the generative capabilities of AudioLLMs
to enhance emotion recognition by producing semantically aligned,
evidence-grounded explanations. To support this in multitask AudioLLMs, we
introduce a unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision,
dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training. This approach enables
AudioLLMs to effectively learn different tasks while incorporating emotional
reasoning. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our approach not only
improves emotion prediction accuracy but also enhances the coherence and
evidential grounding of the generated responses.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在代码检查和调试中的潜力，特别是在竞争级编程（CP）中生成测试用例生成器的能力。

Method: 提出TCGBench基准测试，包含两项任务：生成有效测试用例生成器和针对性暴露代码缺陷的生成器，并构建高质量数据集。

Result: LLMs能生成有效测试用例生成器，但在针对性任务中表现不佳，即使高级推理模型也远逊于人类。使用数据集可通过提示和微调提升性能。

Conclusion: LLMs在代码检查中具有潜力，但针对性任务仍需改进，高质量数据集有助于提升性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However,
the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through
test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem
from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose
TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This
benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in
(1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further
(2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written
code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can
generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to
generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively.
Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly
short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators.
Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of
instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the
performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both
prompting and fine-tuning.

Motivation: 心理学研究表明，了解说服谬误有助于检测虚假信息，因此作者尝试利用大语言模型（LLMs）验证说服知识是否能增强虚假信息检测。

Method: 提出了Persuasion-Augmented Chain of Thought (PCoT)方法，结合说服知识改进零样本分类中的虚假信息检测，并在多个数据集上进行了评估。

Result: PCoT在五个LLMs和五个数据集上的平均表现优于竞争方法15%，并发布了两个新的虚假信息数据集EUDisinfo和MultiDis。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，说服知识对提升零样本虚假信息检测具有重要价值。

Abstract: Disinformation detection is a key aspect of media literacy. Psychological
studies have shown that knowledge of persuasive fallacies helps individuals
detect disinformation. Inspired by these findings, we experimented with large
language models (LLMs) to test whether infusing persuasion knowledge enhances
disinformation detection. As a result, we introduce the Persuasion-Augmented
Chain of Thought (PCoT), a novel approach that leverages persuasion to improve
disinformation detection in zero-shot classification. We extensively evaluate
PCoT on online news and social media posts. Moreover, we publish two novel,
up-to-date disinformation datasets: EUDisinfo and MultiDis. These datasets
enable the evaluation of PCoT on content entirely unseen by the LLMs used in
our experiments, as the content was published after the models' knowledge
cutoffs. We show that, on average, PCoT outperforms competitive methods by 15%
across five LLMs and five datasets. These findings highlight the value of
persuasion in strengthening zero-shot disinformation detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型更新后，PEFT模块性能显著下降，重新调整这些模块计算成本高。

Method: 分析基础模型更新的变化，发现持续训练主要影响FFN中的任务特定知识，而对注意力机制中的任务特定模式影响较小。基于此，提出Trans-PEFT方法。

Result: 在7个基础模型和12个数据集上的实验表明，Trans-PEFT模块无需重新调整即可在更新的基础模型上保持性能。

Conclusion: Trans-PEFT显著减少了实际应用中的维护开销。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a common method for
fine-tuning large language models, where a base model can serve multiple users
through PEFT module switching. To enhance user experience, base models require
periodic updates. However, once updated, PEFT modules fine-tuned on previous
versions often suffer substantial performance degradation on newer versions.
Re-tuning these numerous modules to restore performance would incur significant
computational costs. Through a comprehensive analysis of the changes that occur
during base model updates, we uncover an interesting phenomenon: continual
training primarily affects task-specific knowledge stored in Feed-Forward
Networks (FFN), while having less impact on the task-specific pattern in the
Attention mechanism. Based on these findings, we introduce Trans-PEFT, a novel
approach that enhances the PEFT module by focusing on the task-specific pattern
while reducing its dependence on certain knowledge in the base model. Further
theoretical analysis supports our approach. Extensive experiments across 7 base
models and 12 datasets demonstrate that Trans-PEFT trained modules can maintain
performance on updated base models without re-tuning, significantly reducing
maintenance overhead in real-world applications.

Conclusion: ParaStepVerifier为评估和训练LLMs的真实数学推理能力提供了更可靠的路径。

Abstract: Outcome-rewarded Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in mathematical problem-solving. However, this success often masks a
critical issue: models frequently achieve correct answers through fundamentally
unsound reasoning processes, a phenomenon indicative of reward hacking. We
introduce MathOlympiadEval, a new dataset with fine-grained annotations, which
reveals a significant gap between LLMs' answer correctness and their low
process correctness. Existing automated methods like LLM-as-a-judge struggle to
reliably detect these reasoning flaws. To address this, we propose
ParaStepVerifier, a novel methodology for meticulous, step-by-step verification
of mathematical solutions. ParaStepVerifier identifies incorrect reasoning
steps. Empirical results demonstrate that ParaStepVerifier substantially
improves the accuracy of identifying flawed solutions compared to baselines,
especially for complex, multi-step problems. This offers a more robust path
towards evaluating and training LLMs with genuine mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: 动态混合方法有效结合小模型和LLM的优势，节省资源并提升性能。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), the Chinese Spelling Check (CSC)
task has seen various LLM methods developed, yet their performance remains
unsatisfactory. In contrast, fine-tuned BERT-based models, relying on
high-quality in-domain data, show excellent performance but suffer from edit
pattern overfitting. This paper proposes a novel dynamic mixture approach that
effectively combines the probability distributions of small models and LLMs
during the beam search decoding phase, achieving a balanced enhancement of
precise corrections from small models and the fluency of LLMs. This approach
also eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs, saving significant time and
resources, and facilitating domain adaptation. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that our mixture approach significantly boosts error correction
capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets. Our

Motivation: ASR模型在处理AAE的语音、音系和形态句法特征时表现不佳，研究旨在量化CCR和ING缩减对ASR错误率的影响，并分析LM对系统表现的作用。

Method: 使用CORAAL语料库，通过wav2vec 2.0（有/无LM）进行转录，利用Montreal Forced Aligner（MFA）检测CCR和ING缩减。

Result: CCR和ING缩减对词错误率（WER）有显著但较小的影响；无LM的ASR系统更受词汇邻域效应影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AAE特征对ASR性能的具体影响，并强调了LM在减少词汇邻域效应中的作用。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often struggle with the phonetic,
phonological, and morphosyntactic features found in African American English
(AAE). This study focuses on two key AAE variables: Consonant Cluster Reduction
(CCR) and ING-reduction. It examines whether the presence of CCR and
ING-reduction increases ASR misrecognition. Subsequently, it investigates
whether end-to-end ASR systems without an external Language Model (LM) are more
influenced by lexical neighborhood effect and less by contextual predictability
compared to systems with an LM. The Corpus of Regional African American
Language (CORAAL) was transcribed using wav2vec 2.0 with and without an LM. CCR
and ING-reduction were detected using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) with
pronunciation expansion. The analysis reveals a small but significant effect of
CCR and ING on Word Error Rate (WER) and indicates a stronger presence of
lexical neighborhood effect in ASR systems without LMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in text summarization have predominantly leveraged large

do not maintain long-term discourse structure, especially in news articles,
where organizational flow significantly influences reader engagement. We
introduce a novel approach to integrating discourse structure into
summarization processes, focusing specifically on news articles across various
media. We present a novel summarization dataset where news articles are
summarized multiple times in different ways across different social media
platforms (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.). We develop a novel news discourse
schema to describe summarization structures and a novel algorithm, DiscoSum,
which employs beam search technique for structure-aware summarization, enabling
the transformation of news stories to meet different stylistic and structural
demands. Both human and automatic evaluation results demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in maintaining narrative fidelity and meeting structural

Method: 对150多篇提示相关论文进行元分析，提出一个包含21个属性的六维框架，并实证研究多属性提示增强的效果。

Result: 发现单属性增强效果最显著，且基于属性增强提示的指令调优能提升推理模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究为提示评估和优化奠定了基础，填补了人机交互的空白，并开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have progressed towards more human-like and
human--AI communications have become prevalent, prompting has emerged as a
decisive component. However, there is limited conceptual consensus on what
exactly quantifies natural language prompts. We attempt to address this
question by conducting a meta-analysis surveying more than 150
prompting-related papers from leading NLP and AI conferences from 2022 to 2025
and blogs. We propose a property- and human-centric framework for evaluating
prompt quality, encompassing 21 properties categorized into six dimensions. We
then examine how existing studies assess their impact on LLMs, revealing their
imbalanced support across models and tasks, and substantial research gaps.
Further, we analyze correlations among properties in high-quality natural
language prompts, deriving prompting recommendations. We then empirically
explore multi-property prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks, observing that
single-property enhancements often have the greatest impact. Finally, we
discover that instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts can result in
better reasoning models. Our findings establish a foundation for
property-centric prompt evaluation and optimization, bridging the gaps between
human--AI communication and opening new prompting research directions.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: BIS Reasoning 1.0是首个针对大型语言模型（LLMs）设计的日本三段论推理数据集，专注于评估信念不一致推理，揭示了LLMs在逻辑有效但与信念冲突的输入中的弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集如NeuBAROCO和JFLD主要关注通用或信念一致的推理，而BIS Reasoning 1.0旨在填补信念不一致推理的空白，以揭示LLMs的推理偏差。

Method: 通过设计逻辑有效但信念不一致的三段论问题，对包括GPT、Claude和日本领先LLMs在内的模型进行基准测试。

Result: GPT-4o表现最佳，准确率为79.54%，但所有模型在处理信念冲突输入时均表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLMs在高风险领域（如法律、医疗和科学文献）中处理逻辑与信念冲突的重要性，以确保其完整性和安全性。

Abstract: We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of
syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate
belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior
datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned
reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent
syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned
corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude
models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in
performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies
critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but
belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific
literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and
safety.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务中的鲁棒性，通过引入语义忠实但对抗性结构的提示扰动，发现模型对表面级提示动态敏感，性能变化显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正具备推理能力，还是仅依赖浅层统计模式。

Method: 引入语义忠实但对抗性结构的提示扰动，评估700个扰动后的代码生成任务。

Result: 某些扰动导致性能显著下降（准确率下降高达42.1%），而其他扰动则意外提升准确率（高达35.3%）。

Conclusion: 当前推理系统脆弱且不可预测，需更原则性的方法来提升推理对齐和提示鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks
requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem
solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens
and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models
truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this
paper, we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by
introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured
prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations
derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as
storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering,
and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely
degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly
improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to
semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the
fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the
need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting
robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to
promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QA代理在回答自然语言问题时缺乏主动澄清问题的能力，限制了其性能。

Method: 通过模拟包含澄清问题的对话，利用离线RL目标（类似奖励加权的SFT）优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在优化奖励和语言质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 离线RL目标是一种高效且直接的优化方式，显著提升了QA代理的性能。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) agents automatically answer questions posed in
natural language. In this work, we learn to ask clarifying questions in QA
agents. The key idea in our method is to simulate conversations that contain
clarifying questions and learn from them using reinforcement learning (RL). To
make RL practical, we propose and analyze offline RL objectives that can be
viewed as reward-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and easily optimized in
large language models. Our work stands in a stark contrast to recently proposed
methods, based on SFT and direct preference optimization, which have additional
hyper-parameters and do not directly optimize rewards. We compare to these
methods empirically and report gains in both optimized rewards and language
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究事件终结性和完成性的跨语言分析，填补现有理论空白。

Method: 框架分为名词域和动词域两部分：名词域建模名词短语的有界性及其与子类型、限定数量和形容词修饰的关系；动词域定义依赖事件演算，建模终结事件和完成事件，并考虑副词修饰。

Result: 框架基于Martin-Löf依赖类型理论扩展，并在Agda证明助手中形式化。

Conclusion: 该框架为事件分析提供了新的理论工具，适用于跨语言研究。

Abstract: We present a dependently-typed cross-linguistic framework for analyzing the
telicity and culminativity of events, accompanied by examples of using our
framework to model English sentences. Our framework consists of two parts. In
the nominal domain, we model the boundedness of noun phrases and its
relationship to subtyping, delimited quantities, and adjectival modification.
In the verbal domain we define a dependent event calculus, modeling telic
events as those whose undergoer is bounded, culminating events as telic events
that achieve their inherent endpoint, and consider adverbial modification. In
both domains we pay particular attention to associated entailments. Our
framework is defined as an extension of intensional Martin-L\"of dependent type
theory, and the rules and examples in this paper have been formalized in the
Agda proof assistant.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于认知负荷理论的模块化推理方法，通过技能链模式提升模型对科学表格声明的验证能力，并在少量数据下超越GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文本的复杂性和高信息密度可能导致非专家误解，现有模型在细粒度推理上表现不足。

Method: 提出技能链模式，通过模块化、可重用的原子技能降低认知负荷，提升推理能力。

Result: 在SciAtomicBench基准上，仅用350个微调样本，模型表现优于GPT-4o的链式思维方法。

Conclusion: 模块化推理方法能有效提升科学声明验证的准确性和泛化能力，减少训练数据需求。

Abstract: Scientific texts often convey authority due to their technical language and
complex data. However, this complexity can sometimes lead to the spread of
misinformation. Non-experts are particularly susceptible to misleading claims
based on scientific tables due to their high information density and perceived
credibility. Existing table claim verification models, including
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), often struggle with precise
fine-grained reasoning, resulting in errors and a lack of precision in
verifying scientific claims. Inspired by Cognitive Load Theory, we propose that
enhancing a model's ability to interpret table-based claims involves reducing
cognitive load by developing modular, reusable reasoning components (i.e.,
atomic skills). We introduce a skill-chaining schema that dynamically composes
these skills to facilitate more accurate and generalizable reasoning with a
reduced cognitive load. To evaluate this, we create SciAtomicBench, a
cross-domain benchmark with fine-grained reasoning annotations. With only 350
fine-tuning examples, our model trained by atomic reasoning outperforms
GPT-4o's chain-of-thought method, achieving state-of-the-art results with far
less training data.

Result: 实验表明，CoM优于竞争基线，展示了无训练提示方法在复杂推理任务中的潜力。

Conclusion: CoM通过人类方法论见解，缩小了与人类水平推理的差距，为复杂任务提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due
to insufficient in-depth insights in their training data, which are typically
absent in publicly available documents. This paper introduces the Chain of
Methodologies (CoM), an innovative and intuitive prompting framework that
enhances structured thinking by integrating human methodological insights,
enabling LLMs to tackle complex tasks with extended reasoning. CoM leverages
the metacognitive abilities of advanced LLMs, activating systematic reasoning
throught user-defined methodologies without explicit fine-tuning. Experiments
show that CoM surpasses competitive baselines, demonstrating the potential of
training-free prompting methods as robust solutions for complex reasoning tasks
and bridging the gap toward human-level reasoning through human-like
methodological insights.

Motivation: 现有隐喻处理研究多基于英语数据，存在文化偏见，影响模型性能评估。多模态隐喻的文化偏见影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建MultiMM数据集（8,461对中英文广告文本-图像），提出SEMD模型，整合情感嵌入以提升跨文化隐喻理解。

Result: 实验验证SEMD在隐喻检测和情感分析任务上的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究提升了对NLP文化偏见的认识，有助于开发更公平、包容的语言模型。

Abstract: Metaphors are pervasive in communication, making them crucial for natural
language processing (NLP). Previous research on automatic metaphor processing
predominantly relies on training data consisting of English samples, which
often reflect Western European or North American biases. This cultural skew can
lead to an overestimation of model performance and contributions to NLP
progress. However, the impact of cultural bias on metaphor processing,
particularly in multimodal contexts, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce MultiMM, a Multicultural Multimodal Metaphor dataset
designed for cross-cultural studies of metaphor in Chinese and English. MultiMM
consists of 8,461 text-image advertisement pairs, each accompanied by
fine-grained annotations, providing a deeper understanding of multimodal
metaphors beyond a single cultural domain. Additionally, we propose
Sentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection (SEMD), a baseline model that integrates
sentiment embeddings to enhance metaphor comprehension across cultural
backgrounds. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of SEMD on
metaphor detection and sentiment analysis tasks. We hope this work increases
awareness of cultural bias in NLP research and contributes to the development
of fairer and more inclusive language models. Our dataset and code are
available at https://github.com/DUTIR-YSQ/MultiMM.

TLDR: 论文提出FoReaL-Decoding方法，通过快速-慢速协作解码减少大型推理模型的冗余计算，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）推理过程冗长且易陷入过度思考，需优化其效率。

Method: 提出FoReaL-Decoding，结合强弱模型协作解码，利用随机门平滑切换。

Result: 在四个数学推理基准测试中，FLOPs减少30-50%，推理长度缩短40%，性能保持86-100%。

Conclusion: FoReaL-Decoding为推理任务提供了一种简单可控的成本-质量权衡方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong reasoning performance by
emitting long chains of thought. Yet, these verbose traces slow down inference
and often drift into unnecessary detail, known as the overthinking phenomenon.
To better understand LRMs' behavior, we systematically analyze the token-level
misalignment between reasoning and non-reasoning models. While it is expected
that their primary difference lies in the stylistic "thinking cues", LRMs
uniquely exhibit two pivotal, previously under-explored phenomena: a Global
Misalignment Rebound, where their divergence from non-reasoning models persists
or even grows as response length increases, and more critically, a Local
Misalignment Diminish, where the misalignment concentrates at the "thinking
cues" each sentence starts with but rapidly declines in the remaining of the
sentence. Motivated by the Local Misalignment Diminish, we propose
FoReaL-Decoding, a collaborative fast-slow thinking decoding method for
cost-quality trade-off. In FoReaL-Decoding, a Leading model leads the first few
tokens for each sentence, and then a weaker draft model completes the following
tokens to the end of each sentence. FoReaL-Decoding adopts a stochastic gate to
smoothly interpolate between the small and the large model. On four popular
math-reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, GPQA-Diamond, MATH500, AMC23),
FoReaL-Decoding reduces theoretical FLOPs by 30 to 50% and trims CoT length by
up to 40%, while preserving 86 to 100% of model performance. These results
establish FoReaL-Decoding as a simple, plug-and-play route to controllable
cost-quality trade-offs in reasoning-centric tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Adversarial Paraphrasing的攻击框架，通过利用现成的指令遵循LLM，优化AI生成文本以绕过检测系统，实验表明其高效性和广泛适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力的提升，AI生成文本的滥用问题日益严重，现有检测器对简单攻击（如改写）的鲁棒性不足，需要更有效的攻击方法来揭示检测器的脆弱性。

Method: 提出了一种无需训练的对抗性改写框架，利用现成的指令遵循LLM，在AI文本检测器的指导下生成优化的对抗样本。

Result: 实验显示，该方法显著降低了多种检测器的检测率（如RADAR和Fast-DetectGPT），平均T@1%F降低87.88%，同时文本质量仅轻微下降。

Conclusion: 研究强调了面对日益复杂的规避技术，需要开发更鲁棒和弹性的检测策略。

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised
concerns about their misuse in AI-generated plagiarism and social engineering.
While various AI-generated text detectors have been proposed to mitigate these
risks, many remain vulnerable to simple evasion techniques such as
paraphrasing. However, recent detectors have shown greater robustness against
such basic attacks. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a
training-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text
to evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf
instruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance
of an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically
optimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is
both broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection
systems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which,
ironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57%
on RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on
Fast-DetectGPT. Across a diverse set of detectors--including neural
network-based, watermark-based, and zero-shot approaches--our attack achieves
an average T@1%F reduction of 87.88% under the guidance of
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large. We also analyze the tradeoff between text quality and
attack success to find that our method can significantly reduce detection
rates, with mostly a slight degradation in text quality. Our adversarial setup
highlights the need for more robust and resilient detection strategies in the
light of increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法在实际应用中效果有限，主要因为其对训练样本形式的依赖性（Form-Dependent Bias），无法泛化到知识的不同表达形式。

Method: 论文提出了一种名为Rank-one Concept Redirection (ROCR)的无训练方法，通过重定向模型对特定概念的感知来实现遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，ROCR显著提升了遗忘效果，且生成的输出更自然。

Conclusion: LLM遗忘应具备形式无关性，ROCR为解决这一问题提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to erase or suppress undesirable
knowledge within the model, offering promise for controlling harmful or private
information to prevent misuse. However, recent studies highlight its limited
efficacy in real-world scenarios, hindering practical adoption. In this study,
we identify a pervasive issue underlying many downstream failures: the
effectiveness of existing unlearning methods heavily depends on the form of
training samples and frequently fails to generalize to alternate expressions of
the same knowledge. We formally characterize this problem as Form-Dependent
Bias and systematically investigate its specific manifestation patterns across
various downstream tasks. To quantify its prevalence and support future
research, we introduce ORT, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness of unlearning methods against variations in knowledge expression.
Results reveal that Form-Dependent Bias is both widespread and severe among
current techniques.
  We argue that LLM unlearning should be form-independent to address the
endless forms of downstream tasks encountered in real-world security-critical
scenarios. Towards this goal, we introduce Rank-one Concept Redirection (ROCR),
a novel training-free method, as a promising solution path. ROCR performs
unlearning by targeting the invariants in downstream tasks, specifically the
activated dangerous concepts. It is capable of modifying model parameters
within seconds to redirect the model's perception of a specific unlearning
target concept to another harmless concept. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that ROCR significantly improves unlearning effectiveness compared to
traditional methods while generating highly natural outputs.

Conclusion: ViMUL-Bench及ViMUL模型将促进多语言视频LMM的发展，提升文化及语言包容性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their
effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most
existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore
multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the
English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be
investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video
LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to
evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource
languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian,
Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is
designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight
culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods
and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities.
ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice
questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k
samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we
also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising
1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL,
that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource
languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual
video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help
ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive
multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data
will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.

Abstract: There are many types of standards in the field of communication. The
traditional consulting model has a long cycle and relies on the knowledge and
experience of experts, making it difficult to meet the rapidly developing
technological demands. This paper combines the fine-tuning of large language
models with the construction of knowledge graphs to implement an intelligent
consultation and question-answering system for communication standards. The
experimental results show that after LoRA tuning on the constructed dataset of
6,587 questions and answers in the field of communication standards,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrates outstanding professional capabilities in the
field of communication standards on the test set. BLEU-4 rose from 18.8564 to
66.8993, and evaluation indicators such as ROUGE also increased significantly,
outperforming the fine-tuning effect of the comparison model
Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Based on the ontology framework containing 6 entity
attributes and 10 relation attributes, a knowledge graph of the communication
standard domain containing 13,906 entities and 13,524 relations was
constructed, showing a relatively good query accuracy rate. The intelligent
consultation and question-answering system enables the fine-tuned model on the
server side to access the locally constructed knowledge graph and conduct
graphical retrieval of key information first, which is conducive to improving
the question-answering effect. The evaluation using DeepSeek as the Judge on
the test set shows that our RAG framework enables the fine-tuned model to
improve the scores at all five angles, with an average score increase of 2.26%.
And combined with web services and API interfaces, it has achieved very good
results in terms of interaction experience and back-end access, and has very
good practical application value.

Motivation: 手动构建历史事件的计算表示成本高，且现有RDF/OWL推理器功能有限，无法支持更深层次的时空和语义分析。

Method: 使用多种LLM（GPT-4、Claude、Llama 3.2）结合三种增强策略（基础生成、知识图谱增强、RAG），并评估其在Thucydides文本上的表现。

Result: 不同策略优化不同性能：基础生成在覆盖范围上表现最佳，RAG提升精度。模型架构影响增强效果，大模型表现稳健，Llama 3.2表现波动大。

Conclusion: 通过将RDF转换为Coq规范，实现了高阶推理，验证了RAG提取的事件类型的语义合法性。

Abstract: Extracting structured computational representations of historical events from
narrative text remains computationally expensive when constructed manually.
While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to
fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic
analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic
historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama
3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph
enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted
comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings
reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions
rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical
breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4
extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement
improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture
fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate
robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2
shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We
then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF
representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order
reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification,
temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical
causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types
represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than
ontological violations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学MLLMs在医学应用中存在知识覆盖不足、易产生幻觉和缺乏复杂推理能力的问题，需要改进。

Conclusion: Lingshu通过改进数据和训练策略，显著提升了医学MLLMs的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their
large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their
effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent
discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the
general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical
limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)
heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation
processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical
scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data
curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data
not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and
general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual
question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a
multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the
curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu
undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its
task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the
potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm
to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop
MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal
and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model
assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical
tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results
show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal
models on most tasks ...

TLDR: 论文提出了一个名为Com$^2$的基准，专注于复杂常识推理，填补了现有研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在简单常识推理上表现优异，但在复杂和隐含的常识推理上表现不佳，而后者对人类更为重要。

Method: 结合因果事件图作为结构化复杂常识，利用因果理论（如干预）修改因果图生成不同场景，并通过LLM的慢思考合成示例。

Result: 实验表明LLMs在推理深度和广度上存在困难，但后训练和慢思考可以缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: Com$^2$基准为复杂常识推理提供了新的研究方向，并展示了改进LLMs推理能力的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have mastered abundant simple and explicit
commonsense knowledge through pre-training, enabling them to achieve human-like
performance in simple commonsense reasoning. Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to
reason with complex and implicit commonsense knowledge that is derived from
simple ones (such as understanding the long-term effects of certain events), an
aspect humans tend to focus on more. Existing works focus on complex tasks like
math and code, while complex commonsense reasoning remains underexplored due to
its uncertainty and lack of structure. To fill this gap and align with
real-world concerns, we propose a benchmark Com$^2$ focusing on complex
commonsense reasoning. We first incorporate causal event graphs to serve as
structured complex commonsense. Then we adopt causal theory~(e.g.,
intervention) to modify the causal event graphs and obtain different scenarios
that meet human concerns. Finally, an LLM is employed to synthesize examples
with slow thinking, which is guided by the logical relationships in the
modified causal graphs. Furthermore, we use detective stories to construct a
more challenging subset. Experiments show that LLMs struggle in reasoning depth
and breadth, while post-training and slow thinking can alleviate this. The code
and data are available at https://github.com/Waste-Wood/Com2.

Result: 在三个情感计算任务中表现优异，超越现有基线方法和最先进模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态情感计算中的复杂性和冲突问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal affective computing aims to automatically recognize and interpret
human attitudes from diverse data sources such as images and text, thereby
enhancing human-computer interaction and emotion understanding. Existing
approaches typically rely on unimodal analysis or straightforward fusion of
cross-modal information that fail to capture complex and conflicting evidence
presented across different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel
LLM-based approach for affective computing that explicitly deconstructs visual
and textual representations into shared (modality-invariant) and
modality-specific components. Specifically, our approach firstly encodes and
aligns input modalities using pre-trained multi-modal encoders, then employs a
representation decomposition framework to separate common emotional content
from unique cues, and finally integrates these decomposed signals via an
attention mechanism to form a dynamic soft prompt for a multi-modal LLM.
Extensive experiments on three representative tasks for affective computing,
namely, multi-modal aspect-based sentiment analysis, multi-modal emotion
analysis, and hateful meme detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which consistently outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art
models.

Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型在推理过程中存在冗余和低效问题，导致高推理成本，而现有评估方法不一致，难以衡量效率提升。

Method: 提出推理效率前沿和REG指标，并设计REO-RL算法，通过强化学习在稀疏的token预算下优化推理效率。

Result: 实验表明，REO-RL能显著降低REG（≥50%），并在16K token预算下接近Qwen3-4B/8B的效率前沿，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了当前方法在效率与准确性之间的权衡问题，并表明完全对齐效率前沿仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving
capabilities through extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning but often
produce excessively verbose and redundant reasoning traces. This inefficiency
incurs high inference costs and limits practical deployment. While existing
fine-tuning methods aim to improve reasoning efficiency, assessing their
efficiency gains remains challenging due to inconsistent evaluations. In this
work, we introduce the reasoning efficiency frontiers, empirical upper bounds
derived from fine-tuning base LRMs across diverse approaches and training
configurations. Based on these frontiers, we propose the Reasoning Efficiency
Gap (REG), a unified metric quantifying deviations of any fine-tuned LRMs from
these frontiers. Systematic evaluation on challenging mathematical benchmarks
reveals significant gaps in current methods: they either sacrifice accuracy for
short length or still remain inefficient under tight token budgets. To reduce
the efficiency gap, we propose REO-RL, a class of Reinforcement Learning
algorithms that minimizes REG by targeting a sparse set of token budgets.
Leveraging numerical integration over strategically selected budgets, REO-RL
approximates the full efficiency objective with low error using a small set of
token budgets. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate that our
efficiency metric, REG, effectively captures the accuracy-length trade-off,
with low-REG methods reducing length while maintaining accuracy. Our approach,
REO-RL, consistently reduces REG by >=50 across all evaluated LRMs and matching
Qwen3-4B/8B efficiency frontiers under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy
loss. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our exponential token
budget strategy. Finally, our findings highlight that fine-tuning LRMs to
perfectly align with the efficiency frontiers remains an open challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示技术（如Chain-of-Thought）缺乏逻辑结构和内部一致性评估机制，导致推理过程脆弱且难以解释。

Method: ToTh框架通过三个代理（溯因、演绎和归纳）生成推理轨迹，构建形式化推理图，并利用贝叶斯信念传播和自然语言推理评估一致性。

Result: 在符号和数值推理任务中，ToTh表现优于Chain-of-Thought等方法，并生成可解释的逻辑推理链。

Conclusion: ToTh为构建更稳健且受认知启发的LLM推理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural
language reasoning tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain brittle and
difficult to interpret. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating
multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure
and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a
novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel
agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and
inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a
formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief
propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence
scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final
answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith)
reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT,
Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing
interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a
promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM
reasoning. The implementation is available at

Result: CoT对非推理模型有小幅提升但可能引入错误，对推理模型效果有限且增加时间和成本。

Conclusion: CoT的效果因模型和任务而异，需权衡其潜在收益与额外成本。

Abstract: This is the second in a series of short reports that seek to help business,
education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with
AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting, a technique that encourages a large language model (LLM) to
"think step by step" (Wei et al., 2022). CoT is a widely adopted method for
improving reasoning tasks, however, our findings reveal a more nuanced picture
of its effectiveness. We demonstrate two things:
  - The effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting can vary greatly depending
on the type of task and model. For non-reasoning models, CoT generally improves
average performance by a small amount, particularly if the model does not
inherently engage in step-by-step processing by default. However, CoT can
introduce more variability in answers, sometimes triggering occasional errors
in questions the model would otherwise get right. We also found that many
recent models perform some form of CoT reasoning even if not asked; for these
models, a request to perform CoT had little impact. Performing CoT generally
requires far more tokens (increasing cost and time) than direct answers.
  - For models designed with explicit reasoning capabilities, CoT prompting
often results in only marginal, if any, gains in answer accuracy. However, it
significantly increases the time and tokens needed to generate a response.

Motivation: 在低资源场景中，数据稀缺限制了模型性能。现有研究通过手工设计提示引导LLM进行数据增强，但缺乏语义一致性和多样性。

Method: 设计了结构化提示模板，利用LLM生成预定义内容，并通过后处理技术确保语义一致性。此外，提出置信度加权微调策略以提升预测准确性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，该方法优于所有基线模型，取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据增强和置信度加权微调，显著提升了模型在低资源场景下的性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) is an effective approach to addressing data
scarcity in low-resource scenarios. Recent existing research designs
hand-crafted prompts to guide LLM for data augmentation. We introduce a data
augmentation strategy for the aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) task
that preserves the original sentence semantics and has linguistic diversity,
specifically by providing a structured prompt template for an LLM to generate
predefined content. In addition, we employ a post-processing technique to
further ensure semantic consistency between the generated sentence and the
original sentence. The augmented data increases the semantic coverage of the
training distribution, enabling the model better to understand the relationship
between aspect categories and sentiment polarities, enhancing its inference
capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-weighted fine-tuning
strategy to encourage the model to generate more confident and accurate
sentiment polarity predictions. Compared with powerful and recent works, our
method consistently achieves the best performance on four benchmark datasets
over all baselines.

Motivation: 控制语言模型生成文本的句法结构对于需要清晰性、风格一致性或可解释性的应用至关重要，但目前仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用序贯蒙特卡洛估计后验分布，并结合句法标注器确保生成的每个标记与目标句法结构对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法在句法控制上表现出色，为需要精确句法控制的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling the syntactic structure of text generated by language models is
valuable for applications requiring clarity, stylistic consistency, or
interpretability, yet it remains a challenging task. In this paper, we argue
that sampling algorithms based on the posterior inference can effectively
enforce a target constituency structure during generation. Our approach
combines sequential Monte Carlo, which estimates the posterior distribution by
sampling from a proposal distribution, with a syntactic tagger that ensures
that each generated token aligns with the desired syntactic structure. Our
experiments with GPT2 and Llama3-8B models show that with an appropriate
proposal distribution, we can improve syntactic accuracy, increasing the F1
score from $12.31$ (GPT2-large) and $35.33$ (Llama3-8B) to about $93$ in both
cases without compromising the language model's fluency. These results
underscore both the complexity of syntactic control and the effectiveness of
sampling algorithms, offering a promising approach for applications where
precise control over syntax is essential.

Result: GeometryZero在多个基准测试中平均提升4.29%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GCPO框架有效提升几何推理性能，为小型模型提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning,
amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary
construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve
suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring
massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training
smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust
geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning
presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional
rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary
constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy
Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive
or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual
utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains.
Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size
geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary
construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric
benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models
consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement
of 4.29% across all benchmarks.

Abstract: Progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been dictated by the rule
of more: more data, more computing power and more complexity, best exemplified
by the Large Language Models. However, training (or fine-tuning) large dense
models for specific applications usually requires significant amounts of
computing resources. This \textbf{Ph.D. dissertation} focuses on an
under-investi\-gated NLP data engineering technique, whose potential is
enormous in the current scenario known as Instance Selection (IS). The IS goal
is to reduce the training set size by removing noisy or redundant instances
while maintaining the effectiveness of the trained models and reducing the
training process cost. We provide a comprehensive and scientifically sound
comparison of IS methods applied to an essential NLP task -- Automatic Text
Classification (ATC), considering several classification solutions and many
datasets. Our findings reveal a significant untapped potential for IS
solutions. We also propose two novel IS solutions that are noise-oriented and
redundancy-aware, specifically designed for large datasets and transformer
architectures. Our final solution achieved an average reduction of 41\% in
training sets, while maintaining the same levels of effectiveness in all
datasets. Importantly, our solutions demonstrated speedup improvements of 1.67x
(up to 2.46x), making them scalable for datasets with hundreds of thousands of

Motivation: 由于大语言模型训练数据中可能包含敏感、受版权保护或非法内容，如何选择性遗忘这些信息而不影响模型整体性能成为重要研究方向。

Method: 提出Reinforcement UnLearning (RULE)框架，将遗忘问题转化为拒绝边界优化问题，使用少量遗忘数据和合成边界查询进行训练，并通过可验证的奖励函数实现安全拒绝。

Result: 实验表明，RULE仅需12%的遗忘数据和8%的合成边界数据，就能在遗忘质量和响应自然度上优于现有基线，同时保持模型实用性。

Conclusion: RULE不仅实现了目标遗忘，还提升了模型输出的自然性和训练效率，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive,
uncurated corpora has raised growing concerns about the inclusion of sensitive,
copyrighted, or illegal content. This has led to increasing interest in LLM
unlearning: the task of selectively removing specific information from a model
without retraining from scratch or degrading overall utility. However, existing
methods often rely on large-scale forget and retain datasets, and suffer from
unnatural responses, poor generalization, or catastrophic utility loss. In this
work, we propose Reinforcement UnLearning (RULE), an efficient framework that
formulates unlearning as a refusal boundary optimization problem. RULE is
trained with a small portion of the forget set and synthesized boundary
queries, using a verifiable reward function that encourages safe refusal on
forget--related queries while preserving helpful responses on permissible
inputs. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating the
effectiveness of RULE in achieving targeted unlearning without compromising
model utility. Experimental results show that, with only $12%$ forget set and
$8%$ synthesized boundary data, RULE outperforms existing baselines by up to
$17.5%$ forget quality and $16.3%$ naturalness response while maintaining
general utility, achieving forget--retain Pareto optimality. Remarkably, we
further observe that RULE improves the naturalness of model outputs, enhances
training efficiency, and exhibits strong generalization ability, generalizing
refusal behavior to semantically related but unseen queries.

Motivation: 视频大语言模型在现实应用中的可靠性至关重要，但其倾向于迎合用户输入（即使与视觉证据矛盾）的行为（即顺从性）影响了其可信度。目前缺乏针对视频语言领域的系统性评估。

Method: 提出VISE基准，通过多样化问题格式、提示偏见和视觉推理任务评估Video-LLMs的顺从行为，并结合关键帧选择作为缓解策略。

Conclusion: VISE为理解和缓解Video-LLMs的顺从行为提供了系统工具，关键帧选择展示了无训练缓解策略的潜力。

Abstract: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated
into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning,
ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance.
However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even
when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in
such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific
manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of
systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs
respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE
(Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first dedicated
benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art
Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on
sycophancy into the visual domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across
multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. In addition, we explore
key-frame selection as an interpretable, training-free mitigation strategy,
which reveals potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias by strengthening
visual grounding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态预处理数据库信息，限制了模型对数据的动态理解能力。

Method: 提出SDE-SQL框架，通过生成和执行SQL探针，使模型能主动检索数据库信息并迭代更新理解。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，SDE-SQL比基线模型提升了8.02%的执行准确率，且无需监督微调或模型集成。

Conclusion: SDE-SQL通过动态探索数据库显著提升了性能，且监督微调可进一步优化结果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task. However, prior approaches
typically rely on static, pre-processed database information provided at
inference time, which limits the model's ability to fully understand the
database contents. Without dynamic interaction, LLMs are constrained to fixed,
human-provided context and cannot autonomously explore the underlying data. To
address this limitation, we propose SDE-SQL, a framework that enables large
language models to perform self-driven exploration of databases during
inference. This is accomplished by generating and executing SQL probes, which
allow the model to actively retrieve information from the database and
iteratively update its understanding of the data. Unlike prior methods, SDE-SQL
operates in a zero-shot setting, without relying on any question-SQL pairs as
in-context demonstrations. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, SDE-SQL achieves an 8.02% relative improvement in
execution accuracy over the vanilla Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct baseline, establishing
a new state-of-the-art among methods based on open-source models without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or model ensembling. Moreover, with SFT, the
performance of SDE-SQL can be further enhanced, yielding an additional 0.52%
improvement.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于TF-IDF的句子排序方法，用于长文档分类，显著减少输入大小和推理延迟，同时保持接近全文本的分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长文档分类因Transformer模型的计算限制（如BERT的固定输入长度和二次注意力复杂度）以及文档冗余性而面临挑战。

Method: 采用TF-IDF句子排序方法，结合固定数量或百分比选择句子，并改进评分策略（归一化TF-IDF分数和句子长度）。

Result: 在MahaNews LDC数据集上表现优于基线方法，输入大小减少50%以上，推理延迟降低43%，分类精度仅下降0.33%。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在不牺牲性能的情况下显著减少上下文的可能性，适用于实际长文档分类任务。

Abstract: Long document classification poses challenges due to the computational
limitations of transformer-based models, particularly BERT, which are
constrained by fixed input lengths and quadratic attention complexity.
Moreover, using the full document for classification is often redundant, as
only a subset of sentences typically carries the necessary information. To
address this, we propose a TF-IDF-based sentence ranking method that improves
efficiency by selecting the most informative content. Our approach explores
fixed-count and percentage-based sentence selection, along with an enhanced
scoring strategy combining normalized TF-IDF scores and sentence length.
Evaluated on the MahaNews LDC dataset of long Marathi news articles, the method
consistently outperforms baselines such as first, last, and random sentence
selection. With MahaBERT-v2, we achieve near-identical classification accuracy
with just a 0.33 percent drop compared to the full-context baseline, while
reducing input size by over 50 percent and inference latency by 43 percent.
This demonstrates that significant context reduction is possible without
sacrificing performance, making the method practical for real-world long

TLDR: 论文研究了语言模型在处理菲律宾语时的偏见来源，发现与英语模型不同，菲律宾语模型的偏见更多与人、物体和关系相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索非英语语言（尤其是菲律宾语）模型中偏见的来源，并与英语模型进行对比。

Method: 采用信息论的偏见归因评分方法，并将其适配到菲律宾语模型和多语言模型上。

Result: 菲律宾语模型的偏见主要与人、物体和关系相关，而英语模型则更偏向行为主题（如犯罪、性和亲社会行为）。

Conclusion: 英语和非英语模型在处理与社会人口群体相关的输入时存在差异，表明语言特性影响偏见的形成。

Abstract: Emerging research on bias attribution and interpretability have revealed how
tokens contribute to biased behavior in language models processing English
texts. We build on this line of inquiry by adapting the information-theoretic
bias attribution score metric for implementation on models handling
agglutinative languages, particularly Filipino. We then demonstrate the
effectiveness of our adapted method by using it on a purely Filipino model and
on three multilingual models: one trained on languages worldwide and two on
Southeast Asian data. Our results show that Filipino models are driven towards
bias by words pertaining to people, objects, and relationships, entity-based
themes that stand in contrast to the action-heavy nature of bias-contributing
themes in English (i.e., criminal, sexual, and prosocial behaviors). These
findings point to differences in how English and non-English models process
inputs linked to sociodemographic groups and bias.

*Atahan Özer,Çağatay Yıldız*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理随时间变化的文本语料时的局限性，并提出了一个轻量级框架来解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的知识受限于预训练数据，而现实世界信息不断变化。传统方法（如重新训练或上下文学习）成本高且不实用。

Method: 引入两个新基准（Temporal Wiki和Unified Clark），并提出一个轻量级框架，通过外部记忆增量构建结构化知识。

Result: 该方法在复杂推理或冲突事实整合问题上优于基线方法（如ICL和RAG）。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效帮助LLMs处理动态信息，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in question
answering and reasoning thanks to their extensive parametric memory. However,
their knowledge is inherently limited by the scope of their pre-training data,
while real-world information evolves continuously. Updating this knowledge
typically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning
(ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of
modern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs
perform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect
evolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a
player's "current team" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new
benchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical
Wikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news
articles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be
misled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context. To address these
issues, we propose a lightweight, agentic framework that incrementally builds a
structured, external memory from source documents without requiring
re-training. This knowledge organization strategy enables models to retrieve
and reason over temporally filtered, relevant information at inference time.
Empirically, our method outperforms ICL and RAG baselines across both
benchmarks, especially on questions requiring more complex reasoning or
integration of conflicting facts.

TLDR: 论文提出BiLingua Parser，一种基于LLM的标注工具，用于处理低资源语言中的代码切换文本，显著提升了句法分析的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言环境中代码切换文本的句法分析难题，尤其是现有解析器在多语言混合输入中的泛化能力不足。

Method: 开发基于提示的框架，结合少量样本LLM提示和专家评审，生成西班牙语-英语和西班牙语-瓜拉尼语的UD标注数据集。

Result: BiLingua Parser在专家修订后达到95.29%的LAS，显著优于现有基线模型和多语言解析器。

Conclusion: 研究表明，经过精心引导的LLM可以作为实用工具，在低资源代码切换环境中快速构建句法资源。

Abstract: Code-switching presents a complex challenge for syntactic analysis,
especially in low-resource language settings where annotated data is scarce.
While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for
sequence-level tagging, few approaches systematically investigate how well
these models capture syntactic structure in code-switched contexts. Moreover,
existing parsers trained on monolingual treebanks often fail to generalize to
multilingual and mixed-language input. To address this gap, we introduce the
BiLingua Parser, an LLM-based annotation pipeline designed to produce Universal
Dependencies (UD) annotations for code-switched text. First, we develop a
prompt-based framework for Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaran\'i data,
combining few-shot LLM prompting with expert review. Second, we release two
annotated datasets, including the first Spanish-Guaran\'i UD-parsed corpus.
Third, we conduct a detailed syntactic analysis of switch points across
language pairs and communicative contexts. Experimental results show that
BiLingua Parser achieves up to 95.29% LAS after expert revision, significantly
outperforming prior baselines and multilingual parsers. These results show that
LLMs, when carefully guided, can serve as practical tools for bootstrapping
syntactic resources in under-resourced, code-switched environments. Data and
source code are available at https://github.com/N3mika/ParsingProject

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解低资源机器翻译的实际需求，填补现有调查和小样本研究的不足。

Method: 对Tetun翻译服务tetun.org的10万条翻译请求进行观察性分析。

Result: 用户多为学生，倾向于从高资源语言翻译到Tetun，涉及科学、医疗等多元领域，与现有新闻主导的语料库形成对比。

Conclusion: 低资源机器翻译应关注教育相关领域的准确性，观察性研究可为技术开发提供实用指导。

Abstract: Low-resource machine translation (MT) presents a diversity of community needs
and application challenges that remain poorly understood. To complement surveys
and focus groups, which tend to rely on small samples of respondents, we
propose an observational study on actual usage patterns of tetun$.$org, a
specialized MT service for the Tetun language, which is the lingua franca in
Timor-Leste. Our analysis of 100,000 translation requests reveals patterns that
challenge assumptions based on existing corpora. We find that users, many of
them students on mobile devices, typically translate text from a high-resource
language into Tetun across diverse domains including science, healthcare, and
daily life. This contrasts sharply with available Tetun corpora, which are
dominated by news articles covering government and social issues. Our results
suggest that MT systems for institutionalized minority languages like Tetun
should prioritize accuracy on domains relevant to educational contexts, in the
high-resource to low-resource direction. More broadly, this study demonstrates
how observational analysis can inform low-resource language technology
development, by grounding research in practical community needs.

TLDR: 本文研究了采样温度对大型语言模型性能的影响，并提出了一种基于BERT的温度选择器以优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战Stochastic Parrots类比，证明LLMs能理解语义而非仅记忆数据，并探讨温度在模型推理中的关键作用。

Method: 系统评估温度（0-2）对不同能力数据集的影响，分析三种规模模型（小、中、大），并提出BERT温度选择器。

Result: 温度对模型性能有技能特异性影响，BERT选择器显著提升中小模型在SuperGLUE的表现，温度效应在FP16和4位量化模型中一致。

Conclusion: 温度选择复杂且模型规模相关，BERT选择器为实用解决方案，Mutation Temperature随模型规模增加。

Abstract: The sampling temperature, a critical hyperparameter in large language models
(LLMs), modifies the logits before the softmax layer, thereby reshaping the
distribution of output tokens. Recent studies have challenged the Stochastic
Parrots analogy by demonstrating that LLMs are capable of understanding
semantics rather than merely memorizing data and that randomness, modulated by
sampling temperature, plays a crucial role in model inference. In this study,
we systematically evaluated the impact of temperature in the range of 0 to 2 on
data sets designed to assess six different capabilities, conducting statistical
analyses on open source models of three different sizes: small (1B--4B), medium
(6B--13B), and large (40B--80B). Our findings reveal distinct skill-specific
effects of temperature on model performance, highlighting the complexity of
optimal temperature selection in practical applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a BERT-based temperature selector that takes advantage of
these observed effects to identify the optimal temperature for a given prompt.
We demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve the performance of
small and medium models in the SuperGLUE datasets. Furthermore, our study
extends to FP16 precision inference, revealing that temperature effects are
consistent with those observed in 4-bit quantized models. By evaluating
temperature effects up to 4.0 in three quantized models, we find that the
Mutation Temperature -- the point at which significant performance changes
occur -- increases with model size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 桥接标注的主观性导致标注一致性难以达成，需探索其在不同层面的表现。

Method: 在GUM语料库测试集上进行标注实验，提出新的桥接子类型分类系统，并与现有方案对比。

Result: 发现现有资源可能标注不足，桥接子类型标注一致性中等，但桥接实例识别一致性低。

Conclusion: 桥接标注的主观性显著，需改进标注方法和分类系统以提高一致性。

Abstract: Bridging refers to the associative relationship between inferable entities in
a discourse and the antecedents which allow us to understand them, such as
understanding what "the door" means with respect to an aforementioned "house".
As identifying associative relations between entities is an inherently
subjective task, it is difficult to achieve consistent agreement in the
annotation of bridging anaphora and their antecedents. In this paper, we
explore the subjectivity involved in the annotation of bridging instances at
three levels: anaphor recognition, antecedent resolution, and bridging subtype
selection. To do this, we conduct an annotation pilot on the test set of the
existing GUM corpus, and propose a newly developed classification system for
bridging subtypes, which we compare to previously proposed schemes. Our results
suggest that some previous resources are likely to be severely under-annotated.
We also find that while agreement on the bridging subtype category was
moderate, annotator overlap for exhaustively identifying instances of bridging
is low, and that many disagreements resulted from subjective understanding of
the entities involved.

Motivation: 解决LLM在生成事实性陈述时的幻觉问题。

Result: 幻觉率降至5%以下，准确率提升至95%以上，外部检索减少30%。

Conclusion: ConfQA和Dual Neural Knowledge框架有效减少幻觉并提升性能。

Abstract: Can we teach Large Language Models (LLMs) to refrain from hallucinating
factual statements? In this paper we present a fine-tuning strategy that we
call ConfQA, which can reduce hallucination rate from 20-40% to under 5% across
multiple factuality benchmarks. The core idea is simple: when the LLM answers a
question correctly, it is trained to continue with the answer; otherwise, it is
trained to admit "I am unsure". But there are two key factors that make the
training highly effective. First, we introduce a dampening prompt "answer only
if you are confident" to explicitly guide the behavior, without which
hallucination remains high as 15%-25%. Second, we leverage simple factual
statements, specifically attribute values from knowledge graphs, to help LLMs
calibrate the confidence, resulting in robust generalization across domains and
question types. Building on this insight, we propose the Dual Neural Knowledge
framework, which seamlessly select between internally parameterized neural
knowledge and externally recorded symbolic knowledge based on ConfQA's
confidence. The framework enables potential accuracy gains to beyond 95%, while
reducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%.

Result: 发现模型间存在显著异质性、评分不对称性、对提示框架的敏感性以及高频词过估值，并揭示了潜在的偏见问题。

Conclusion: 奖励模型的可互换性和作为复杂人类价值观代理的适用性受到挑战，需警惕其潜在偏见对下游模型的影响。

Abstract: Reward modeling has emerged as a crucial component in aligning large language
models with human values. Significant attention has focused on using reward
models as a means for fine-tuning generative models. However, the reward models
themselves -- which directly encode human value judgments by turning
prompt-response pairs into scalar rewards -- remain relatively understudied. We
present a novel approach to reward model interpretability through exhaustive
analysis of their responses across their entire vocabulary space. By examining
how different reward models score every possible single-token response to
value-laden prompts, we uncover several striking findings: (i) substantial
heterogeneity between models trained on similar objectives, (ii) systematic
asymmetries in how models encode high- vs low-scoring tokens, (iii) significant
sensitivity to prompt framing that mirrors human cognitive biases, and (iv)
overvaluation of more frequent tokens. We demonstrate these effects across ten
recent open-source reward models of varying parameter counts and architectures.
Our results challenge assumptions about the interchangeability of reward
models, as well as their suitability as proxies of complex and
context-dependent human values. We find that these models can encode concerning
biases toward certain identity groups, which may emerge as unintended
consequences of harmlessness training -- distortions that risk propagating
through the downstream large language models now deployed to millions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖提示工程，缺乏稳定性和可解释性，因此需要一种更可控的方法来增强模型的角色扮演能力。

Method: SRPS框架提取角色扮演提示的潜在表示，基于激活模式选择最相关特征，并构建可注入模型残差流的控制向量。

Result: 实验表明，SRPS在多个推理基准测试中显著提升了模型性能，例如Llama3.1-8B在CSQA上的准确率从31.86%提升到39.80%。

Conclusion: SRPS不仅提升了模型的推理能力，还提供了比传统提示方法更好的可解释性和稳定性。

Abstract: Role-playing has emerged as an effective technique for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing
methods primarily rely on prompt engineering, which often lacks stability and
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder Role-Playing
Steering (SRPS), a novel framework that identifies and manipulates internal
model features associated with role-playing behavior. Our approach extracts
latent representations from role-play prompts, selects the most relevant
features based on activation patterns, and constructs a steering vector that
can be injected into the model's residual stream with controllable intensity.
Our method enables fine-grained control over role-specific behavior and offers
insights into how role information influences internal model activations.
Extensive experiments across various reasoning benchmarks and model sizes
demonstrate consistent performance gains. Notably, in the zero-shot
chain-of-thought (CoT) setting, the accuracy of Llama3.1-8B on CSQA improves
from 31.86% to 39.80%, while Gemma2-9B on SVAMP increases from 37.50% to
45.10%. These results highlight the potential of SRPS to enhance reasoning
ability in LLMs, providing better interpretability and stability compared to
traditional prompt-based role-playing.

Motivation: 现有Finetuning-as-a-Service易因用户数据中的有害提示导致LLM安全对齐退化，需探索从用户数据中过滤有害内容的方法。

Method: 利用安全对齐LLM的拒绝特征区分有害与无害提示，训练ReFT模型作为教师模型，过滤有害提示并蒸馏对齐知识至基础模型。

Result: 实验表明，ReFT策略能有效减少有害输出，同时提升用户特定任务的微调准确性。

Conclusion: ReFT为Finetuning-as-a-Service提供了一种安全可靠的LLM部署方案。

Abstract: Recently, major AI service providers such as Google and OpenAI have
introduced Finetuning-as-a-Service, which enables users to customize Large
Language Models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks using their own data.
However, this service is vulnerable to degradation of LLM safety-alignment when
user data contains harmful prompts. While some prior works address this issue,
fundamentally filtering harmful data from user data remains unexplored.
Motivated by our observation that a directional representation reflecting
refusal behavior (called the refusal feature) obtained from safety-aligned LLMs
can inherently distinguish between harmful and harmless prompts, we propose the
Refusal-Feature-guided Teacher (ReFT). Our ReFT model is trained to identify
harmful prompts based on the similarity between input prompt features and its
refusal feature. During finetuning, the ReFT model serves as a teacher that
filters harmful prompts from user data and distills alignment knowledge into
the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReFT-based
finetuning strategy effectively minimizes harmful outputs and enhances
finetuning accuracy for user-specific tasks, offering a practical solution for
secure and reliable deployment of LLMs in Finetuning-as-a-Service.

Motivation: BIRD数据集假设用户具备专业知识和领域知识，与文本到SQL的初衷矛盾，且人工生成证据存在缺陷。

Method: 提出SEED系统，通过分析数据库模式、描述文件和值自动生成证据。

Result: SEED在BIRD和Spider数据集上显著提高了无证据场景下的SQL生成准确性，甚至在某些情况下优于提供BIRD证据的设置。

Conclusion: SEED生成的证据不仅弥合了研究与实际部署之间的差距，还提升了文本到SQL模型的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables non-experts to retrieve data from databases by converting
natural language queries into SQL. However, state-of-the-art text-to-SQL
studies rely on the BIRD dataset, which assumes that evidence is provided along
with questions. Although BIRD facilitates research advancements, it assumes
that users have expertise and domain knowledge, contradicting the fundamental
goal of text-to-SQL. In addition, human-generated evidence in BIRD contains
defects, including missing or erroneous evidence, which affects model
performance. To address this issue, we propose SEED (System for Evidence
Extraction and Domain knowledge generation), an approach that automatically
generates evidence to improve performance and practical usability in real-world
scenarios. SEED systematically analyzes database schema, description files, and
values to extract relevant information. We evaluated SEED on BIRD and Spider,
demonstrating that it significantly improves SQL generation accuracy in the
no-evidence scenario, and in some cases, even outperforms the setting where
BIRD evidence is provided. Our results highlight that SEED-generated evidence
not only bridges the gap between research and real-world deployment but also
improves the adaptability and robustness of text-to-SQL models. Our code is

Result: PiFi在多种自然语言处理任务中表现优异，提升了泛化能力和语言能力迁移。

Conclusion: PiFi成功结合了LLM和SLM的优势，为资源受限环境提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are renowned for their extensive linguistic
knowledge and strong generalization capabilities, but their high computational
demands make them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments. In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) are computationally efficient but often
lack the broad generalization capacity of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose
PiFi, a novel framework that combines the strengths of both LLMs and SLMs to
achieve high performance while maintaining efficiency. PiFi integrates a single
frozen layer from an LLM into a SLM and fine-tunes the combined model for
specific tasks, boosting performance without a significant increase in
computational cost. We show that PiFi delivers consistent performance
improvements across a range of natural language processing tasks, including
both natural language understanding and generation. Moreover, our findings
demonstrate PiFi's ability to effectively leverage LLM knowledge, enhancing
generalization to unseen domains and facilitating the transfer of linguistic
abilities.

Method: 将Magri的第一谜题置于其原始理论框架中，进行概念分析，探讨集体或并发解释如何导致间接语境矛盾。

Result: 发现不自然源于集体/并发解释产生的间接语境矛盾，并指出标量隐含的语用机制超出基于穷尽化的语法许可解释。

Conclusion: 标量隐含的语用机制比现有理论更复杂，需进一步探索集体解释与语境更新的互动。

Abstract: Magri (2016) investigates two puzzles arising from conjunction. Although
Magri has proposed a solution to the second puzzle, the first remains
unresolved. This first puzzle reveals a hidden interaction among
quantification, collective/concurrent interpretation, and contextual updating
dimensions that have yet to be explored. In essence, the problem is that
certain forms of sentences like "Some Italians come from a warm country," when
conjoined as in "(Only) Some Italians come from a warm country and are blond,"
sound infelicitous, even though no obvious alternative triggers a conflicting
scalar implicature. In this paper, we offer a conceptual analysis of Magri's
first puzzle by situating it within its original theoretical framework. We
argue that the oddness arises from the collective or concurrent reading of the
conjunctive predicate: in examples such as "(Only) Some Italians come from a
warm country and are blond," this interpretation generates an indirect
contextual contradiction. Moreover, we suggest that the pragmatic mechanisms
governing scalar implicature generation extend beyond what is captured by
exhaustification-based grammatical licensing accounts.

Result: 实验表明WSD框架优于基线方法，且避免了对下游任务的负面影响。

Conclusion: WSD框架有效提升了模型的对齐能力，同时保持了任务性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require alignment with human preferences to
avoid generating offensive, false, or meaningless content. Recently,
low-resource methods for LLM alignment have been popular, while still facing
challenges in obtaining both high-quality and aligned content. Motivated by the
observation that the difficulty of generating aligned responses is concentrated
at the beginning of decoding, we propose a novel framework, Weak-to-Strong
Decoding (WSD), to enhance the alignment ability of base models by the guidance
of a small aligned model. The small model first drafts well-aligned beginnings,
followed by the large base model to continue the rest, controlled by a
well-designed auto-switch mechanism. We also collect a new dataset, GenerAlign,
to fine-tune a small-sized Pilot-3B as the draft model, which effectively
enhances different base models under the WSD framework to outperform all
baseline methods, while avoiding degradation on downstream tasks, termed as the
alignment tax. Extensive experiments are further conducted to examine the
impact of different settings and time efficiency, as well as analyses on the
intrinsic mechanisms of WSD in depth.

Conclusion: 结合上下文提示、软监督和自适应采样，可高效生成高质量通用嵌入。

Abstract: This report presents a unified instruction-based framework for learning
generalized text embeddings optimized for both information retrieval (IR) and
non-IR tasks. Built upon a decoder-only large language model (Mistral-7B), our
approach combines in-context learning, soft supervision, and adaptive
hard-negative mining to generate context-aware embeddings without task-specific
fine-tuning. Structured instructions and few-shot examples are used to guide
the model across diverse tasks, enabling strong performance on classification,
semantic similarity, clustering, and reranking benchmarks. To improve semantic
discrimination, we employ a soft labeling framework where continuous relevance
scores, distilled from a high-performance dense retriever and reranker, serve
as fine-grained supervision signals. In addition, we introduce adaptive
margin-based hard-negative mining, which filters out semantically ambiguous
negatives based on their similarity to positive examples, thereby enhancing
training stability and retrieval robustness. Our model is evaluated on the
newly introduced MTEB (English, v2) benchmark, covering 41 tasks across seven
categories. Results show that our method achieves strong generalization and
ranks among the top-performing models by Borda score, outperforming several
larger or fully fine-tuned baselines. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining in-context prompting, soft supervision, and adaptive

TLDR: DALTA框架通过领域适应解决低资源主题建模问题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题建模模型在低资源环境下表现不稳定且不连贯，需改进。

Method: 提出DALTA框架，使用共享编码器、专用解码器和对抗对齐实现领域适应。

Result: DALTA在主题一致性、稳定性和可迁移性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DALTA为低资源主题建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Topic modeling plays a vital role in uncovering hidden semantic structures
within text corpora, but existing models struggle in low-resource settings
where limited target-domain data leads to unstable and incoherent topic
inference. We address this challenge by formally introducing domain adaptation
for low-resource topic modeling, where a high-resource source domain informs a
low-resource target domain without overwhelming it with irrelevant content. We
establish a finite-sample generalization bound showing that effective knowledge
transfer depends on robust performance in both domains, minimizing latent-space
discrepancy, and preventing overfitting to the data. Guided by these insights,
we propose DALTA (Domain-Aligned Latent Topic Adaptation), a new framework that
employs a shared encoder for domain-invariant features, specialized decoders
for domain-specific nuances, and adversarial alignment to selectively transfer
relevant information. Experiments on diverse low-resource datasets demonstrate
that DALTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of topic
coherence, stability, and transferability.

*Yuxin Xiao,Shan Chen,Jack Gallifant,Danielle Bitterman,Thomas Hartvigsen,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了KScope框架，用于分类和评估大型语言模型（LLM）的知识状态，并通过实验验证了上下文对知识更新的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在知识冲突下的行为，但未能全面评估模型对问题的知识掌握程度。

Method: 提出五类知识状态的分类法，并设计KScope框架，通过分层统计测试逐步细化假设，将LLM知识归类为五种状态之一。

Result: 实验表明，上下文支持缩小了模型间的知识差距；难度、相关性和熟悉度等上下文特征影响知识更新；不同LLM在部分正确或冲突时表现相似，但在完全错误时差异显著。

Conclusion: 通过上下文特征分析和增强可信度，可以进一步提高知识更新的效果，且该方法具有跨模型的通用性。

Abstract: Characterizing a large language model's (LLM's) knowledge of a given question
is challenging. As a result, prior work has primarily examined LLM behavior
under knowledge conflicts, where the model's internal parametric memory
contradicts information in the external context. However, this does not fully
reflect how well the model knows the answer to the question. In this paper, we
first introduce a taxonomy of five knowledge statuses based on the consistency
and correctness of LLM knowledge modes. We then propose KScope, a hierarchical
framework of statistical tests that progressively refines hypotheses about
knowledge modes and characterizes LLM knowledge into one of these five
statuses. We apply KScope to nine LLMs across four datasets and systematically
establish: (1) Supporting context narrows knowledge gaps across models. (2)
Context features related to difficulty, relevance, and familiarity drive
successful knowledge updates. (3) LLMs exhibit similar feature preferences when
partially correct or conflicted, but diverge sharply when consistently wrong.
(4) Context summarization constrained by our feature analysis, together with
enhanced credibility, further improves update effectiveness and generalizes
across LLMs.

TLDR: 当前LLM不确定性量化方法存在生态效度低、仅关注认知不确定性及优化指标不实用等问题，需转向以用户为中心的研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升LLM在现实任务中的可靠性，优化人机协作中的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 分析40种LLM不确定性量化方法，识别三大问题并提出用户导向的改进方向。

Result: 发现当前方法在生态效度、不确定性类型和指标优化上存在不足。

Conclusion: 建议采用更以用户为中心的不确定性量化方法，提升LLM的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly assisting users in the real
world, yet their reliability remains a concern. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
has been heralded as a tool to enhance human-LLM collaboration by enabling
users to know when to trust LLM predictions. We argue that current practices
for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are not optimal for developing useful UQ
for human users making decisions in real-world tasks. Through an analysis of 40
LLM UQ methods, we identify three prevalent practices hindering the community's
progress toward its goal of benefiting downstream users: 1) evaluating on
benchmarks with low ecological validity; 2) considering only epistemic
uncertainty; and 3) optimizing metrics that are not necessarily indicative of
downstream utility. For each issue, we propose concrete user-centric practices
and research directions that LLM UQ researchers should consider. Instead of
hill-climbing on unrepresentative tasks using imperfect metrics, we argue that
the community should adopt a more human-centered approach to LLM uncertainty
quantification.

TLDR: CCI4.0是一个大规模双语预训练数据集，包含高质量数据和多样化的人类推理轨迹，通过创新的数据处理流程显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练数据集质量参差不齐，且缺乏多样化的人类推理模式，限制了大型语言模型（LLM）的性能提升。

Method: 提出两阶段去重、多分类器质量评分和领域感知流畅性过滤的数据处理流程，并提取45亿条链式思维（CoT）模板。

Result: 实验表明，基于CCI4.0预训练的LLM在数学和代码反射任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 严格的数据筛选和人类思维模板对提升LLM性能至关重要，为自动处理预训练语料提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce CCI4.0, a large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset engineered
for superior data quality and diverse human-like reasoning trajectory. CCI4.0
occupies roughly $35$ TB of disk space and comprises two sub-datasets:
CCI4.0-M2-Base and CCI4.0-M2-CoT. CCI4.0-M2-Base combines a $5.2$ TB carefully
curated Chinese web corpus, a $22.5$ TB English subset from Nemotron-CC, and
diverse sources from math, wiki, arxiv, and code. Although these data are
mostly sourced from well-processed datasets, the quality standards of various
domains are dynamic and require extensive expert experience and labor to
process. So, we propose a novel pipeline justifying data quality mainly based
on models through two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and
domain-aware fluency filtering. We extract $4.5$ billion pieces of
CoT(Chain-of-Thought) templates, named CCI4.0-M2-CoT. Differing from the
distillation of CoT from larger models, our proposed staged CoT extraction
exemplifies diverse reasoning patterns and significantly decreases the
possibility of hallucination. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs
pre-trained in CCI4.0 benefit from cleaner, more reliable training signals,
yielding consistent improvements in downstream tasks, especially in math and
code reflection tasks. Our results underscore the critical role of rigorous
data curation and human thinking templates in advancing LLM performance,
shedding some light on automatically processing pretraining corpora.

TLDR: FairPO是一种多文档摘要（MDS）中的公平性优化方法，同时关注摘要级和语料库级公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多文档摘要中的公平性对决策至关重要，避免因偏见误导用户。

Method: 通过扰动文档集生成偏好对以提升摘要级公平性，动态调整偏好对权重以提升语料库级公平性。

Result: 实验表明FairPO优于基线方法，同时保持摘要质量。

Conclusion: FairPO有效平衡了多文档摘要中的公平性与摘要质量。

Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) is crucial for providing
comprehensive views across documents with diverse social attribute values,
which can significantly impact decision-making. For example, a summarization
system that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead
customers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in
MDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness
focuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of
summaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose
FairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and
corpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to
generate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level
fairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting
the weights of preference pairs. Our experiments show that FairPO outperforms
strong baselines while maintaining the critical qualities of summaries. The
code is available at https://github.com/leehaoyuan/coverage_fairnes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合遗传算法的结构优化能力与大语言模型的领域知识和创造力，以在约束条件下生成高质量的结构化输出。

Method: 将输出视为基因，利用语言模型指导选择、交叉和变异等进化操作，迭代改进解决方案。

Result: 在行程规划、学术大纲和商业报告等任务中表现优异，生成结构良好且满足需求的结果。

Conclusion: GA LLM通过结合两种技术的优势，比单独使用语言模型更能满足约束条件并生成更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: GA LLM is a hybrid framework that combines Genetic Algorithms with Large
Language Models to handle structured generation tasks under strict constraints.
Each output, such as a plan or report, is treated as a gene, and evolutionary
operations like selection, crossover, and mutation are guided by the language
model to iteratively improve solutions. The language model provides domain
knowledge and creative variation, while the genetic algorithm ensures
structural integrity and global optimization. GA LLM has proven effective in
tasks such as itinerary planning, academic outlining, and business reporting,
consistently producing well structured and requirement satisfying results. Its
modular design also makes it easy to adapt to new tasks. Compared to using a
language model alone, GA LLM achieves better constraint satisfaction and higher
quality solutions by combining the strengths of both components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音消歧（DTS）研究不足，缺乏高质量数据集，DEBATE填补了这一空白。

Method: 收集1001个歧义语句，由10位母语者录制，分析语音线索（发音、停顿、重音、语调）对消歧的作用，并评估现有模型。

Result: 现有模型在语音消歧任务上表现明显低于人类水平。

Conclusion: DEBATE为跨语言和文化的DTS研究提供了基础，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on textual and visual disambiguation,
disambiguation through speech (DTS) remains underexplored. This is largely due
to the lack of high-quality datasets that pair spoken sentences with richly
ambiguous text. To address this gap, we present DEBATE, a unique public Chinese
speech-text dataset designed to study how speech cues and
patterns-pronunciation, pause, stress and intonation-can help resolve textual
ambiguity and reveal a speaker's true intent. DEBATE contains 1,001 carefully
selected ambiguous utterances, each recorded by 10 native speakers, capturing
diverse linguistic ambiguities and their disambiguation through speech. We
detail the data collection pipeline and provide rigorous quality analysis.
Additionally, we benchmark three state-of-the-art large speech and
audio-language models, illustrating clear and huge performance gaps between
machine and human understanding of spoken intent. DEBATE represents the first
effort of its kind and offers a foundation for building similar DTS datasets
across languages and cultures. The dataset and associated code are available

Motivation: 了解印尼本地语言社区对语言技术的实际需求，以指导NLP发展。

Method: 进行全国性调查，评估印尼母语者的需求。

Result: 机器翻译和信息检索是首要需求，但存在隐私和偏见担忧。

Conclusion: 需提高透明度和沟通以支持AI技术更广泛的应用。

Abstract: There is an emerging effort to develop NLP for Indonesias 700+ local
languages, but progress remains costly due to the need for direct engagement
with native speakers. However, it is unclear what these language communities
truly need from language technology. To address this, we conduct a nationwide
survey to assess the actual needs of native speakers in Indonesia. Our findings
indicate that addressing language barriers, particularly through machine
translation and information retrieval, is the most critical priority. Although
there is strong enthusiasm for advancements in language technology, concerns
around privacy, bias, and the use of public data for AI training highlight the
need for greater transparency and clear communication to support broader AI
adoption.

Motivation: 改进ASR系统中的命名实体校正，提升识别准确性。

Method: 扩展RAGEC框架，利用合成去噪原理和语音相似性过滤噪声NE候选，通过上下文学习优化校正。

Result: 在CommonVoice和STOP数据集上，WER相对降低28%，NE命中率显著提升。

Conclusion: DeRAGEC在无需额外训练的情况下，显著提升了ASR系统的命名实体校正性能。

Abstract: We present DeRAGEC, a method for improving Named Entity (NE) correction in
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. By extending the
Retrieval-Augmented Generative Error Correction (RAGEC) framework, DeRAGEC
employs synthetic denoising rationales to filter out noisy NE candidates before
correction. By leveraging phonetic similarity and augmented definitions, it
refines noisy retrieved NEs using in-context learning, requiring no additional
training. Experimental results on CommonVoice and STOP datasets show
significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) and NE hit ratio,
outperforming baseline ASR and RAGEC methods. Specifically, we achieved a 28%
relative reduction in WER compared to ASR without postprocessing. Our source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的事后解释往往与真实决策过程不一致，缺乏系统性解决方案。

Method: 引入PSCB基准，分析自洽性，提出新指标，并用DPO优化LLM。

Result: 自洽性分数在正确与错误预测间差异小，新指标更有效，优化后解释与决策特征更一致。

Conclusion: PSCB和DPO为提升LLM解释的可信度和自洽性提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) seem to offer an easy path to interpretability:
just ask them to explain their decisions. Yet, studies show that these post-hoc
explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by
mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this
inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high
cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small
datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank
(PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and
models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature
importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely
differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the
standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To
overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more
effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune
LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better
alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under
domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy,
self-consistent LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 字节级回退虽能有效防止OOV，但在处理CJK语言和表情符号等字符多样化场景时，会显著增加序列长度，导致计算效率下降。

Method: 提出了一种简单的无损压缩技术。

Result: 该技术能够在不损失信息的情况下减少序列长度。

Conclusion: 通过压缩技术，可以提升训练和推理的计算效率。

Abstract: Byte-level fallbacks for subword tokenization have become a common practice
in large language models. In particular, it has been demonstrated to be
incredibly effective as a pragmatic solution for preventing OOV, especially in
the context of larger models. However, breaking a character down to individual
bytes significantly increases the sequence length for long-tail tokens in
languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) and other
character-diverse contexts such as emoji. The increased sequence length results
in longer computation during both training and inference. In this work, we
propose a simple compression technique that reduces the sequence length
losslessly.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，需要一种无需外部奖励模型的方法来提升其推理能力。

Method: SELT利用改进的MCTS，重新定义上置信界评分以匹配LLM的自我评估能力，并通过语义聚类分解推理过程。

Result: 在MMLU和Seal-Tools等基准测试中，SELT显著提高了答案准确性和推理鲁棒性，且无需任务特定微调。

Conclusion: SELT是一种通用性强、无需外部奖励模型的LLM推理增强框架，适用于多样化推理任务。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide
range of applications, their performance often degrades in complex reasoning
tasks. In this work, we introduce SELT (Self-Evaluation LLM Tree Search), a
novel framework that leverages a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
enhance LLM reasoning without relying on external reward models. By redefining
the Upper Confidence Bound scoring to align with intrinsic self-evaluation
capabilities of LLMs and decomposing the inference process into atomic subtasks
augmented with semantic clustering at each node, SELT effectively balances
exploration and exploitation, reduces redundant reasoning paths, and mitigates
hallucination. We validate our approach on challenging benchmarks, including
the knowledge-based MMLU and the Tool Learning dataset Seal-Tools, where SELT
achieves significant improvements in answer accuracy and reasoning robustness
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our framework operates without
task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating strong generalizability across diverse
reasoning tasks. Relevant results and code are available at

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the large language models (LLMs), their application

with LLMs. The existing works utilise prompting and fine-tuning approaches,
with few focusing on automatic post-editing and creating translation agents for
context-aware machine translation. We observed that the commercial LLMs (such
as ChatGPT and Tower LLM) achieved better results than the open-source LLMs
(such as Llama and Bloom LLMs), and prompt-based approaches serve as good
baselines to assess the quality of translations. Finally, we present some
interesting future directions to explore.

Abstract: Instructing language models with user intent requires large instruction
datasets, which are only available for a limited set of languages. In this
paper, we explore alternatives to conventional instruction adaptation pipelines
in low-resource scenarios. We assume a realistic scenario for low-resource
languages, where only the following are available: corpora in the target
language, existing open-weight multilingual base and instructed backbone LLMs,
and synthetically generated instructions sampled from the instructed backbone.
We present a comprehensive set of experiments for Basque that systematically
study different combinations of these components evaluated on benchmarks and
human preferences from 1,680 participants. Our conclusions show that target
language corpora are essential, with synthetic instructions yielding robust
models, and, most importantly, that using as backbone an instruction-tuned
model outperforms using a base non-instructed model, and improved results when
scaling up. Using Llama 3.1 instruct 70B as backbone our model comes near
frontier models of much larger sizes for Basque, without using any Basque data
apart from the 1.2B word corpora. We release code, models, instruction
datasets, and human preferences to support full reproducibility in future
research on low-resource language adaptation.

Conclusion: PolitiSky24填补了政治立场分析中的空白，具有时效性、开放性和用户级别视角，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Stance detection identifies the viewpoint expressed in text toward a specific
target, such as a political figure. While previous datasets have focused
primarily on tweet-level stances from established platforms, user-level stance
resources, especially on emerging platforms like Bluesky remain scarce.
User-level stance detection provides a more holistic view by considering a
user's complete posting history rather than isolated posts. We present the
first stance detection dataset for the 2024 U.S. presidential election,
collected from Bluesky and centered on Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The
dataset comprises 16,044 user-target stance pairs enriched with engagement
metadata, interaction graphs, and user posting histories. PolitiSky24 was
created using a carefully evaluated pipeline combining advanced information
retrieval and large language models, which generates stance labels with
supporting rationales and text spans for transparency. The labeling approach
achieves 81\% accuracy with scalable LLMs. This resource addresses gaps in
political stance analysis through its timeliness, open-data nature, and
user-level perspective. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 解决乌克兰Hutsul方言这一低资源且形态复杂的方言的翻译问题。

Result: 微调后的7B模型在自动和LLM评估指标上均优于GPT-4o的零样本基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了低资源方言的翻译问题，并公开了数据、模型和代码。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce the first effort to adapt large language models
(LLMs) to the Ukrainian dialect (in our case Hutsul), a low-resource and
morphologically complex dialect spoken in the Carpathian Highlands. We created
a parallel corpus of 9852 dialect-to-standard Ukrainian sentence pairs and a
dictionary of 7320 dialectal word mappings. We also addressed data shortage by
proposing an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to generate
synthetic parallel translation pairs, expanding the corpus with 52142 examples.
We have fine-tuned multiple open-source LLMs using LoRA and evaluated them on a
standard-to-dialect translation task, also comparing with few-shot GPT-4o
translation. In the absence of human annotators, we adopt a multi-metric
evaluation strategy combining BLEU, chrF++, TER, and LLM-based judgment
(GPT-4o). The results show that even small(7B) finetuned models outperform
zero-shot baselines such as GPT-4o across both automatic and LLM-evaluated
metrics. All data, models, and code are publicly released at:

computationally expensive job. To mitigate this, many techniques have been
developed that prime efficiency, a prominent one being Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). However, LoRA and its variants employ re-parametrized additive updates.
In this paper, we propose Low-Rank Multiplicative Adaptation (LoRMA), which
shifts the paradigm of additive updates to a richer space of matrix
multiplicative transformations. We tackle challenges such as computational
complexity and rank bottleneck of matrix multiplication by effectively
re-ordering operations and introducing rank inflation strategies. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms
of various evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在教育应用中缺乏与教学策略的对齐，需任务特定适应。

Method: 使用MathDial数据集，应用自动化标注框架重新标注部分数据，细粒度分类为11种教学意图，并微调LLM。

Result: 细粒度模型在自动和定性评估中表现更优，生成回答更符合教学需求。

Conclusion: 细粒度意图标注对教育场景中的可控文本生成有价值，发布标注数据和代码以促进研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for educational applications,
particularly in intelligent tutoring systems. However, effective tutoring
requires alignment with pedagogical strategies - something current LLMs lack
without task-specific adaptation. In this work, we explore whether fine-grained
annotation of teacher intents can improve the quality of LLM-generated tutoring
responses. We focus on MathDial, a dialog dataset for math instruction, and
apply an automated annotation framework to re-annotate a portion of the dataset
using a detailed taxonomy of eleven pedagogical intents. We then fine-tune an
LLM using these new annotations and compare its performance to models trained
on the original four-category taxonomy. Both automatic and qualitative
evaluations show that the fine-grained model produces more pedagogically
aligned and effective responses. Our findings highlight the value of intent
specificity for controlled text generation in educational settings, and we
release our annotated data and code to facilitate further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估视觉语言模型生成段落的事实准确性方法存在不足，缺乏细粒度错误检测和验证数据集。

Method: 引入DOCCI-Critique基准和VNLI-Critique模型，通过人工标注和自动化分类实现句子级事实性评估。

Result: VNLI-Critique在多个基准测试中表现优异，AutoRater与人类评估高度一致，Critic-and-Revise流程显著提升事实性。

Conclusion: 该研究为细粒度评估提供了关键工具，有助于提升VLM的图像理解能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate highly detailed,
paragraphlength image captions, yet evaluating their factual accuracy remains
challenging. Current methods often miss fine-grained errors, being designed for
shorter texts or lacking datasets with verified inaccuracies. We introduce
DOCCI-Critique, a benchmark with 1,400 VLM-generated paragraph captions (100
images, 14 VLMs) featuring over 10,216 sentence-level human annotations of
factual correctness and explanatory rationales for errors, all within paragraph
context. Building on this, we develop VNLI-Critique, a model for automated
sentence-level factuality classification and critique generation. We highlight
three key applications: (1) VNLI-Critique demonstrates robust generalization,
validated by state-of-the-art performance on the M-HalDetect benchmark and
strong results in CHOCOLATE claim verification. (2) The VNLI-Critique driven
AutoRater for DOCCI-Critique provides reliable VLM rankings, showing excellent
alignment with human factuality judgments (e.g., 0.98 Spearman). (3) An
innovative Critic-and-Revise pipeline, where critiques from VNLI-Critique guide
LLM-based corrections, achieves substantial improvements in caption factuality
(e.g., a 46% gain on DetailCaps-4870). Our work offers a crucial benchmark
alongside practical tools, designed to significantly elevate the standards for
fine-grained evaluation and foster the improvement of VLM image understanding.

TLDR: TreeReview是一种新颖的框架，通过分层和双向问答过程生成更全面、深入的论文评审，同时显著减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在辅助论文评审时难以兼顾全面性和效率，因此需要一种更高效且深入的评审方法。

Method: TreeReview将评审建模为分层问答过程，通过递归分解问题并动态扩展问题树，从叶子到根节点聚合答案生成最终评审。

Result: 实验表明，TreeReview在生成全面、深入且专家对齐的评审反馈方面优于基线方法，同时减少80%的LLM令牌使用。

Conclusion: TreeReview为高效且深入的论文评审提供了一种可行方案，其代码和基准数据集已开源。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in
assisting peer review, current methods often struggle to generate thorough and
insightful reviews while maintaining efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TreeReview, a novel framework that models paper review as a hierarchical and
bidirectional question-answering process. TreeReview first constructs a tree of
review questions by recursively decomposing high-level questions into
fine-grained sub-questions and then resolves the question tree by iteratively
aggregating answers from leaf to root to get the final review. Crucially, we
incorporate a dynamic question expansion mechanism to enable deeper probing by
generating follow-up questions when needed. We construct a benchmark derived
from ICLR and NeurIPS venues to evaluate our method on full review generation
and actionable feedback comments generation tasks. Experimental results of both
LLM-based and human evaluation show that TreeReview outperforms strong
baselines in providing comprehensive, in-depth, and expert-aligned review
feedback, while reducing LLM token usage by up to 80% compared to
computationally intensive approaches. Our code and benchmark dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在低资源语言中的安全性，揭示其潜在漏洞。

Method: 通过少量字符修改和小型代理模型计算词重要性，构建攻击方法。

Result: 攻击显著改变了LLMs的预测结果，表明其安全机制存在漏洞。

Conclusion: LLMs在低资源语言中易受攻击，需加强安全训练数据覆盖。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks in recent years. However, their
susceptibility to jailbreaks and perturbations necessitates additional
evaluations. Many LLMs are multilingual, but safety-related training data
contains mainly high-resource languages like English. This can leave them
vulnerable to perturbations in low-resource languages such as Polish. We show
how surprisingly strong attacks can be cheaply created by altering just a few
characters and using a small proxy model for word importance calculation. We
find that these character and word-level attacks drastically alter the
predictions of different LLMs, suggesting a potential vulnerability that can be
used to circumvent their internal safety mechanisms. We validate our attack
construction methodology on Polish, a low-resource language, and find potential
vulnerabilities of LLMs in this language. Additionally, we show how it can be
extended to other languages. We release the created datasets and code for
further research.

Conclusion: 该方法能高效生成高质量标注，适用于TTS数据集构建。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for annotating phonemic and prosodic
labels on a given audio-transcript pair, aimed at constructing Japanese
text-to-speech (TTS) datasets. Our approach involves fine-tuning a large-scale
pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, conditioned on ground
truth transcripts, to simultaneously output phrase-level graphemes and
annotation labels. To further correct errors in phonemic labeling, we employ a
decoding strategy that utilizes dictionary prior knowledge. The objective
evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous
approaches relying solely on text or audio. The subjective evaluation results
indicate that the naturalness of speech synthesized by the TTS model, trained
with labels annotated using our method, is comparable to that of a model
trained with manual annotations.

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的领域特定语言模型评测方法，并为领域适应中的知识表示和高效微调策略提供了新见解。

Abstract: The paper addresses two critical challenges in language model (LM)
evaluation: creating reliable domain-specific benchmarks and understanding
knowledge representation during domain adaptation. We introduce a deterministic
pipeline that converts raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks
without relying on LMs or human curation, eliminating benchmark contamination
issues while enabling evaluation on the latest domain data. Our approach
generates domain-specific keywords and related word lists using TF and Term
TF-IDF methods and constructs prompt-target pairs. We evaluate models by
measuring their ability to complete these prompts with the correct
domain-specific targets, providing a direct assessment of domain knowledge with
low computational cost. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple
models (GPT-2 medium/XL, Llama-2/3.1, OLMo-2, Qwen-2, Mistral) and domains, we
demonstrate that our benchmark strongly correlates with expert-generated
benchmarks while providing a more accurate measure of domain knowledge than
traditional perplexity metrics. We reveal that domain adaptation happens
rapidly in smaller models (within 500 steps) and illustrate a new approach to
domain knowledge evaluation in base models during training for early stopping.
By extending mechanistic analysis to domain adaptation, we discover that
initial-to-mid layers are primarily responsible for attribute extraction, while
later layers focus on next token prediction. Furthermore, we show that during
adaptation, forgetting begins in the middle layers, where attribute extraction
happens and is amplified in later layers. Our work provides both a practical
evaluation methodology for domain-specific LMs and novel insights into
knowledge representation during adaptation, with implications for more
efficient fine-tuning strategies and targeted approaches to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting.

Result: 模型性能随推理长度增加而下降，但实验验证了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法及数据集有望推动LLM推理能力的未来研究。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains challenging for LLMs due to complex logic and
the need for precise computation. Existing methods enhance LLM reasoning by
synthesizing datasets through problem rephrasing, but face issues with
generation quality and problem complexity. To address this, we propose to
extract structural information with generated problem-solving code from
mathematical reasoning and guide data generation with structured solutions.
Applied to MATH and GSM8K, our approach produces 39K problems with labeled
intermediate steps and a 6.1K-problem benchmark of higher difficulty. Results
on our benchmark show that model performance declines as reasoning length
increases. Additionally, we conducted fine-tuning experiments using the
proposed training data on a range of LLMs, and the results validate the
effectiveness of our dataset. We hope the proposed method and dataset will
contribute to future research in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 研究在线平台自动审核系统的有效性，尤其是实时互动场景下的表现。

Method: 通过创建测试账户，利用Twitch API发送10.7万条评论，评估AutoMod标记仇恨内容的准确性。

Result: AutoMod漏检94%的仇恨内容，依赖脏词作为信号，同时误删89.5%的良性内容。

Conclusion: AutoMod存在重大缺陷，需改进上下文理解能力。

Abstract: To meet the demands of content moderation, online platforms have resorted to
automated systems. Newer forms of real-time engagement($\textit{e.g.}$, users
commenting on live streams) on platforms like Twitch exert additional pressures
on the latency expected of such moderation systems. Despite their prevalence,
relatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this
paper, we conduct an audit of Twitch's automated moderation tool
($\texttt{AutoMod}$) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful
content. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test
beds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch's APIs to send over
$107,000$ comments collated from $4$ datasets. We measure $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s
accuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism,
ableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful
messages, up to $94\%$ on some datasets, $\textit{bypass moderation}$.
Contextual addition of slurs to these messages results in $100\%$ removal,
revealing $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s reliance on slurs as a moderation signal. We
also find that contrary to Twitch's community guidelines, $\texttt{AutoMod}$
blocks up to $89.5\%$ of benign examples that use sensitive words in
pedagogical or empowering contexts. Overall, our audit points to large gaps in
$\texttt{AutoMod}$'s capabilities and underscores the importance for such
systems to understand context effectively.

Motivation: 当前LLM在RAG任务中倾向于过度概括而非严格基于相关基础段落生成答案，或在缺乏信息时提供回避回答。GaRAGe旨在提供一个真实场景的测试平台。

Method: GaRAGe包含2366个多样化问题，超过35K标注段落，涵盖私人和公共文档集。评估了多个先进LLM的表现。

Result: LLM在相关基础段落上的表现有限（最高60%相关性评分），回避回答的准确率最高31%，且在处理时间敏感问题和稀疏私人基础源时表现更差。

Conclusion: GaRAGe揭示了LLM在RAG任务中的不足，尤其是在严格依赖相关信息和回避回答方面的挑战。

Abstract: We present GaRAGe, a large RAG benchmark with human-curated long-form answers
and annotations of each grounding passage, allowing a fine-grained evaluation
of whether LLMs can identify relevant grounding when generating RAG answers.
Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and
topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private
document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it
an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant
information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response
when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise
rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant
passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b)
deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true
positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at
most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering
time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private
grounding sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAE训练方法主要针对基础模型，在指令模型上表现不佳，因此需要一种专门的方法来改进。

Method: FAST方法通过调整训练过程以匹配指令模型的数据分布和激活模式，优化SAE性能。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct上，FAST的均方误差为0.6468，显著优于基线方法；在Llama3.2-3B-Instruct上，高质量特征比例达21.1%。

Conclusion: FAST不仅提升了SAE在指令模型上的表现，还揭示了通过干预特殊令牌激活改进输出质量的新机会。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in scale and capability, understanding
their internal mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) have emerged as a key tool in mechanistic interpretability, enabling the
extraction of human-interpretable features from LLMs. However, existing SAE
training methods are primarily designed for base models, resulting in reduced
reconstruction quality and interpretability when applied to instruct models. To
bridge this gap, we propose
$\underline{\textbf{F}}$inetuning-$\underline{\textbf{a}}$ligned
$\underline{\textbf{S}}$equential $\underline{\textbf{T}}$raining
($\textit{FAST}$), a novel training method specifically tailored for instruct
models. $\textit{FAST}$ aligns the training process with the data distribution
and activation patterns characteristic of instruct models, resulting in
substantial improvements in both reconstruction and feature interpretability.
On Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, $\textit{FAST}$ achieves a mean squared error of 0.6468
in token reconstruction, significantly outperforming baseline methods with
errors of 5.1985 and 1.5096. In feature interpretability, $\textit{FAST}$
yields a higher proportion of high-quality features, for Llama3.2-3B-Instruct,
$21.1\%$ scored in the top range, compared to $7.0\%$ and $10.2\%$ for
$\textit{BT(P)}$ and $\textit{BT(F)}$. Surprisingly, we discover that
intervening on the activations of special tokens via the SAEs leads to
improvements in output quality, suggesting new opportunities for fine-grained
control of model behavior. Code, data, and 240 trained SAEs are available at
https://github.com/Geaming2002/FAST.

Motivation: 探讨小语言模型在长链思维监督训练中的性能表现，揭示其潜在问题。

Method: 通过在Qwen2.5、LLaMA3和Gemma3系列模型上进行实验，分析长链思维训练对性能的影响。

Result: 小模型在长链思维训练中性能显著下降，部分模型即使训练大量数据也无法恢复原始性能。

Conclusion: 长链思维训练对小模型效果有限，需谨慎使用，并提出改进建议。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has become a common strategy to
enhance reasoning in language models. While effective for large models, we
identify a phenomenon we call Long CoT Degradation, in which small language
models (SLMs; <=3B parameters) trained on limited long CoT data experience
significant performance deterioration. Through extensive experiments on the
Qwen2.5, LLaMA3 and Gemma3 families, we demonstrate that this degradation is
widespread across SLMs. In some settings, models trained on only 8k long CoT
examples lose up to 75% of their original performance before fine-tuning.
Strikingly, we further observe that for some particularly small models, even
training on 220k long CoT examples fails to recover or surpass their original
performance prior to fine-tuning. Our analysis attributes this effect to error
accumulation: while longer responses increase the capacity for multi-step
reasoning, they also amplify the risk of compounding mistakes. Furthermore, we
find that Long CoT Degradation may negatively impacts downstream reinforcement
learning (RL), although this can be alleviated by sufficiently scaled
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our findings challenge common assumptions about
the benefits of long CoT training for SLMs and offer practical guidance for
building more effective small-scale reasoning models.

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) relies on accurate error annotation and

introduce a standardized, modular framework for multilingual grammatical error
annotation. Our approach combines a language-agnostic foundation with
structured language-specific extensions, enabling both consistency and
flexibility across languages. We reimplement $\texttt{errant}$ using
$\texttt{stanza}$ to support broader multilingual coverage, and demonstrate the
framework's adaptability through applications to English, German, Czech,
Korean, and Chinese, ranging from general-purpose annotation to more customized
linguistic refinements. This work supports scalable and interpretable GEC

Method: 使用Whisper Large-v3转录音频，再通过两步骤GPT-4o校正（命名实体修正和语义完整性评估），并结合数据驱动过滤。

Result: 最终数据集包含801小时音频，751小时通过质量控制，比原句级版本BLEU提升6分。

Conclusion: 结合ASR、LLM校正和数据过滤，显著提升了低资源领域语料库的质量。

Abstract: This paper presents a new long-form release of the Swiss Parliaments Corpus,
converting entire multi-hour Swiss German debate sessions (each aligned with
the official session protocols) into high-quality speech-text pairs. Our
pipeline starts by transcribing all session audio into Standard German using
Whisper Large-v3 under high-compute settings. We then apply a two-step GPT-4o
correction process: first, GPT-4o ingests the raw Whisper output alongside the
official protocols to refine misrecognitions, mainly named entities. Second, a
separate GPT-4o pass evaluates each refined segment for semantic completeness.
We filter out any segments whose Predicted BLEU score (derived from Whisper's
average token log-probability) and GPT-4o evaluation score fall below a certain
threshold. The final corpus contains 801 hours of audio, of which 751 hours
pass our quality control. Compared to the original sentence-level SPC release,
our long-form dataset achieves a 6-point BLEU improvement, demonstrating the
power of combining robust ASR, LLM-based correction, and data-driven filtering
for low-resource, domain-specific speech corpora.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型（尤其是较小模型）在面对分布变化时推理能力下降的问题。

Method: 采用强化学习（而非监督微调）来训练模型进行抽象推理，生成粒度化的抽象数据。

Result: AbstraL方法显著减轻了在GSM扰动基准测试中的性能下降。

Conclusion: 抽象推理结合强化学习是提升语言模型鲁棒性的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially
smaller ones, often lack robustness in their reasoning. I.e., they tend to
experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as
changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting
clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data
to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In
contrast, our approach focuses on "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not
only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection
to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. We find that this abstraction process
is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised
fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method,
AbstraL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular
abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent
GSM perturbation benchmarks.

Result: 在5个NLP数据集的10个设置中，9个达到最优，且在数据不平衡场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: MultiMatch在SSL中表现卓越，尤其在数据不平衡任务中具有显著优势。

Abstract: We introduce MultiMatch, a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm
combining the paradigms of co-training and consistency regularization with
pseudo-labeling. At its core, MultiMatch features a three-fold pseudo-label
weighting module designed for three key purposes: selecting and filtering
pseudo-labels based on head agreement and model confidence, and weighting them
according to the perceived classification difficulty. This novel module
enhances and unifies three existing techniques -- heads agreement from
Multihead Co-training, self-adaptive thresholds from FreeMatch, and Average
Pseudo-Margins from MarginMatch -- resulting in a holistic approach that
improves robustness and performance in SSL settings. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of MultiMatch, achieving
state-of-the-art results on 9 out of 10 setups from 5 natural language

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Generative AI technology, Multimodal Large
Language Models(MLLMs) have the potential to act as AI software engineers
capable of executing complex web application development. Considering that the
model requires a confluence of multidimensional sub-capabilities to address the
challenges of various development phases, constructing a multi-view evaluation
framework is crucial for accurately guiding the enhancement of development
efficiency. However, existing benchmarks usually fail to provide an assessment
of sub-capabilities and focus solely on webpage generation outcomes. In this
work, we draw inspiration from the principles of software engineering and
further propose WebUIBench, a benchmark systematically designed to evaluate
MLLMs in four key areas: WebUI Perception, HTML Programming,WebUI-HTML
Understanding, and WebUI-to-Code. WebUIBench comprises 21K high-quality
question-answer pairs derived from over 0.7K real-world websites. The extensive
evaluation of 29 mainstream MLLMs uncovers the skill characteristics and
various weakness that models encountered during the development process.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为LeaF的两阶段框架，通过干预式推理解决大语言模型在长上下文推理中的注意力分散问题，显著提升了推理准确性和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文推理中容易受到训练数据中虚假相关性的干扰，导致注意力分散和推理效率低下，甚至生成错误答案。

Method: LeaF框架分为两阶段：1）通过梯度比较识别干扰性标记；2）在蒸馏过程中修剪这些标记，使学生的注意力分布与教师的关键标记对齐。

Result: 实验表明，LeaF在数学推理和代码生成任务中显著提升性能，并有效抑制了对干扰性标记的注意力。

Conclusion: LeaF通过干预式推理解决了注意力分散问题，提升了模型的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
contextual understanding. However, their ability to attend to truly critical
information during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the
pace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting
patterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing
these patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation
quality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training
data, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal
instruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant
reasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead
and, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To
mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus
(LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding
factors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an
advanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal
relationships in the training corpus. Then, in the second stage, it prunes
these tokens during distillation to enact intervention, aligning the student's
attention with the teacher's focus distribution on truly critical context
tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that LeaF not only achieves an
absolute improvement in various mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks but also effectively suppresses attention to confounding tokens
during inference, yielding a more interpretable and reliable reasoning model.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: MEMOIR是一种可扩展的框架，通过残差记忆模块注入新知识，避免干扰已有编辑，实现高效模型更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在更新知识时面临的效率低、干扰多、难以扩展的问题。

Method: 使用残差记忆模块和稀疏激活掩码，将编辑限制在特定参数子集，减少编辑间干扰。

Result: 在问答、幻觉纠正等任务中表现优异，支持数千次顺序编辑且遗忘极少。

Conclusion: MEMOIR在可靠性、泛化性和局部性方面达到最优，适用于大规模模型编辑。

Abstract: Language models deployed in real-world systems often require post-hoc updates
to incorporate new or corrected knowledge. However, editing such models
efficiently and reliably - without retraining or forgetting previous
information - remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model
editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to
scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework
that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter
module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By
sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines
each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing
interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by
comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during
editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only
the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for
unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction,
and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks across LLaMA-3 and Mistral
demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across
reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of
sequential edits with minimal forgetting.

Conclusion: MiniCPM4展示了高效性和广泛适用性，成功应用于多种场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM)
designed explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through
systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training
data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of
model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention
mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context
processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and
accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,
a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable
satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training
tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient
pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by
introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and
data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose
CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative
sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse
on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B
parameters, respectively. Sufficient evaluation results show that MiniCPM4
outperforms open-source models of similar size across multiple benchmarks,
highlighting both its efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, MiniCPM4-8B
demonstrates significant speed improvements over Qwen3-8B when processing long
sequences. Through further adaptation, MiniCPM4 successfully powers diverse
applications, including trustworthy survey generation and tool use with model
context protocol, clearly showcasing its broad usability.

Motivation: 量子机器学习在复杂结构化数据建模中具有潜力，QGT旨在通过量子自注意力机制提升模型效率和表达能力。

Method: QGT将参数化量子电路（PQCs）用于自注意力机制，集成到消息传递框架中，减少可训练参数数量。

Result: QGT在五个情感分类基准测试中表现优于或与现有QNLP模型相当，相比经典图变换器平均准确率提升5.42%（真实数据集）和4.76%（合成数据集），样本效率提升50%。

Conclusion: QGT展示了图基量子自然语言处理技术在高效和可扩展语言理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a promising direction for building more efficient
and expressive models, particularly in domains where understanding complex,
structured data is critical. We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a
hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention
mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling.
The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while
significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical
attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification
benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or
comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP)
models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When
compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average
accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic
datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring
nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp
dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques
for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于分布的扰动分析框架，用于测试大型语言模型（LLM）输出在任意干预下的变化，通过蒙特卡洛采样构建低维语义相似度空间中的分布，实现可解释的假设检验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法直接比较LLM输出的变化，且无法处理计算复杂性，需要一种新的框架来量化干预对输出的影响。

Method: 通过蒙特卡洛采样构建低维语义相似度空间中的经验分布，将扰动分析转化为频率假设检验问题。

Result: 框架具有模型无关性、支持任意输入扰动、提供可解释的p值和标量效应大小，并通过案例研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM审计提供了一种可靠的频率假设检验方法，能够量化输出变化并评估模型对齐性。

Abstract: Consider the problem of testing whether the outputs of a large language model
(LLM) system change under an arbitrary intervention, such as an input
perturbation or changing the model variant. We cannot simply compare two LLM
outputs since they might differ due to the stochastic nature of the system, nor
can we compare the entire output distribution due to computational
intractability. While existing methods for analyzing text-based outputs exist,
they focus on fundamentally different problems, such as measuring bias or
fairness. To this end, we introduce distribution-based perturbation analysis, a
framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist
hypothesis testing problem. We construct empirical null and alternative output
distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte
Carlo sampling, enabling tractable inference without restrictive distributional
assumptions. The framework is (i) model-agnostic, (ii) supports the evaluation
of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, (iii) yields
interpretable p-values; (iv) supports multiple perturbations via controlled
error rates; and (v) provides scalar effect sizes. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the framework across multiple case studies, showing how we can
quantify response changes, measure true/false positive rates, and evaluate
alignment with reference models. Above all, we see this as a reliable
frequentist hypothesis testing framework for LLM auditing.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 现代语言模型通过确定性分词器（如字节对编码）将字符字符串的概率分布表示为（更短的）标记字符串的分布。然而，当前方法存在非规范标记编码的问题，导致模型分配概率给无效标记。本文提出两种方法确保仅规范标记获得正概率，并证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在分词时会将概率分配给大量非规范标记，这些标记虽能解码为有效字符但实际不会出现在训练数据中。这种错误分配既浪费概率质量又影响模型性能，因此需要解决。

Method: 提出两种方法：(1) 通过条件推理在测试时确保规范标记；(2) 通过模型参数化在训练时保证规范输出。

Result: 实验表明，修正非规范标记问题能提高模型在多个数据集上的对数似然。

Conclusion: 通过强制规范标记分配，可以避免概率浪费并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Modern language models represent probability distributions over character
strings as distributions over (shorter) token strings derived via a
deterministic tokenizer, such as byte-pair encoding. While this approach is
highly effective at scaling up language models to large corpora, its current
incarnations have a concerning property: the model assigns nonzero probability
mass to an exponential number of $\it{noncanonical}$ token encodings of each
character string -- these are token strings that decode to valid character
strings but are impossible under the deterministic tokenizer (i.e., they will
never be seen in any training corpus, no matter how large). This misallocation
is both erroneous, as noncanonical strings never appear in training data, and
wasteful, diverting probability mass away from plausible outputs. These are
avoidable mistakes! In this work, we propose methods to enforce canonicality in
token-level language models, ensuring that only canonical token strings are
assigned positive probability. We present two approaches: (1) canonicality by
conditioning, leveraging test-time inference strategies without additional
training, and (2) canonicality by construction, a model parameterization that
guarantees canonical outputs but requires training. We demonstrate that fixing
canonicality mistakes improves the likelihood of held-out data for several
models and corpora.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同LLMs是否因多样性而存在显著差异，缺乏实证证据。

Method: 对350多个LLMs进行大规模评估，使用两个流行排行榜和简历筛选任务。

Result: 模型错误高度相关（60%一致），共享架构和提供商是驱动因素；更大、更准确的模型即使架构和提供商不同，错误也高度相关。

Conclusion: 模型错误相关性影响下游任务（如LLM-as-judge评估和招聘），反映了算法单一化的理论预测。

Abstract: Diversity in training data, architecture, and providers is assumed to
mitigate homogeneity in LLMs. However, we lack empirical evidence on whether
different LLMs differ meaningfully. We conduct a large-scale empirical
evaluation on over 350 LLMs overall, using two popular leaderboards and a
resume-screening task. We find substantial correlation in model errors -- on
one leaderboard dataset, models agree 60% of the time when both models err. We
identify factors driving model correlation, including shared architectures and
providers. Crucially, however, larger and more accurate models have highly
correlated errors, even with distinct architectures and providers. Finally, we
show the effects of correlation in two downstream tasks: LLM-as-judge
evaluation and hiring -- the latter reflecting theoretical predictions
regarding algorithmic monoculture.

Result: RPT显著提升了下一词预测的准确性，并为后续强化微调提供了强大的预训练基础。

Conclusion: RPT是一种有效且有前景的语言模型预训练扩展范式。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) as a new scaling
paradigm for large language models and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we reframe next-token prediction as a reasoning task trained
using RL, where it receives verifiable rewards for correctly predicting the
next token for a given context. RPT offers a scalable method to leverage vast
amounts of text data for general-purpose RL, rather than relying on
domain-specific annotated answers. By incentivizing the capability of
next-token reasoning, RPT significantly improves the language modeling accuracy
of predicting the next tokens. Moreover, RPT provides a strong pre-trained
foundation for further reinforcement fine-tuning. The scaling curves show that
increased training compute consistently improves the next-token prediction
accuracy. The results position RPT as an effective and promising scaling
paradigm to advance language model pre-training.

Abstract: Effective financial reasoning demands not only textual understanding but also
the ability to interpret complex visual data such as charts, tables, and trend

performance and that incorporating error feedback leads to consistent and

Conclusion: 该框架为处理不存在实体提供了一种实用且计算可行的解决方案，优于传统方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for representing information about entities
that do not exist or may never exist, such as those involving fictional
entities, blueprints, simulations, and future scenarios. Traditional approaches
that introduce "dummy instances" or rely on modal logic are criticized, and a
proposal is defended in which such cases are modeled using the intersections of
actual types rather than specific non existent tokens. The paper positions
itself within the Basic Formal Ontology and its realist commitments,
emphasizing the importance of practical, implementable solutions over purely
metaphysical or philosophical proposals, arguing that existing approaches to
non existent entities either overcommit to metaphysical assumptions or
introduce computational inefficiencies that hinder applications. By developing
a structured ontology driven approach to unreal patterns, the paper aims to
provide a useful and computationally viable means of handling references to
hypothetical or non existent entities.

Abstract: Evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFS) have gained significant attention due to their
ability to adaptively update their structure in response to data dynamics while
maintaining interpretability. However, the lack of publicly available
implementations of these models limits their accessibility and widespread
adoption. To address this gap, we present evolvingfuzzysystems, a Python
library that provides implementations of several well-established eFS models,
including ePL-KRLS-DISCO, ePL+, eMG, ePL, exTS, Simpl\_eTS, and eTS. The
library facilitates model evaluation and comparison by offering built-in tools
for training, visualization, and performance assessment. The models are
evaluated using the fetch\_california\_housing dataset, with performance
measured in terms of normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), non-dimensional
error index (NDEI), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Additionally,
computational complexity is analyzed by measuring execution times and rule
evolution during training and testing phases. The results highlight ePL as a
simple yet efficient model that balances accuracy and computational cost,
making it particularly suitable for real-world applications. By making these
models publicly available, evolvingfuzzysystems aims to foster research and
practical applications in adaptive and interpretable machine learning.

Abstract: Roadway safety and mobility remain critical challenges for modern
transportation systems, demanding innovative analytical frameworks capable of
addressing complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous environments. While traditional
engineering methods have made progress, the complexity and dynamism of
real-world traffic necessitate more advanced analytical frameworks. Large
Language Models (LLMs), with their unprecedented capabilities in natural
language understanding, knowledge integration, and reasoning, represent a
promising paradigm shift. This paper comprehensively reviews the application
and customization of LLMs for enhancing roadway safety and mobility. A key
focus is how LLMs are adapted -- via architectural, training, prompting, and
multimodal strategies -- to bridge the "modality gap" with transportation's
unique spatio-temporal and physical data. The review systematically analyzes
diverse LLM applications in mobility (e.g., traffic flow prediction, signal
control) and safety (e.g., crash analysis, driver behavior assessment,).
Enabling technologies such as V2X integration, domain-specific foundation
models, explainability frameworks, and edge computing are also examined.
Despite significant potential, challenges persist regarding inherent LLM
limitations (hallucinations, reasoning deficits), data governance (privacy,
bias), deployment complexities (sim-to-real, latency), and rigorous safety
assurance. Promising future research directions are highlighted, including
advanced multimodal fusion, enhanced spatio-temporal reasoning, human-AI
collaboration, continuous learning, and the development of efficient,
verifiable systems. This review provides a structured roadmap of current
capabilities, limitations, and opportunities, underscoring LLMs' transformative
potential while emphasizing the need for responsible innovation to realize
safer, more intelligent transportation systems.

collaborative relationship in existing studies needs to be more consistent. For
example, the prefix "co" is used interchangeably to represent both
"collaborative" and "mutual," and the terms "co-learning" and "co-adaptation"
are sometimes used interchangeably. However, they can reflect subtle
differences in the focus of the studies. The current scoping review's primary
research question (RQ1) aims to gather existing papers discussing this
collaboration pattern and examine the terms researchers use to describe this
human-agent relationship. Given the relative newness of this area of study, we
are also keen on exploring the specific types of intelligent agents and task
domains that have been considered in existing research (RQ2). This exploration
is significant as it can shed light on the diversity of human-agent
interactions, from one-time to continuous learning/adaptation scenarios. It can
also help us understand the dynamics of human-agent interactions in different
task domains, guiding our expectations towards research situated in dynamic,
complex domains. Our third objective (RQ3) is to investigate the cognitive
theories and frameworks that have been utilized in existing studies to measure
human-agent co-learning and co-adaptation. This investigation is crucial as it
can help us understand the theoretical underpinnings of human-agent
collaboration and adaptation, and it can also guide us in identifying any new
frameworks proposed specifically for this type of relationship.

### [380] [Memory OS of AI Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06326)
*Jiazheng Kang,Mingming Ji,Zhe Zhao,Ting Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为MemoryOS的内存操作系统，用于解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在固定上下文窗口和内存管理不足的问题，提升长期记忆能力和个性化交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs面临固定上下文窗口和内存管理不足的挑战，导致长期记忆能力不足和交互体验缺乏个性化。

Method: MemoryOS设计了一个分层存储架构，包含四个关键模块：存储、更新、检索和生成，并采用三级存储单元（短期、中期、长期记忆）和动态更新策略。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准测试中，MemoryOS在F1和BLEU-1指标上分别平均提升了49.11%和46.18%，优于基线模型GPT-4o-mini。

Conclusion: MemoryOS通过分层内存集成和动态更新，显著提升了LLMs的长期记忆能力和个性化交互体验，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a crucial challenge from fixed context
windows and inadequate memory management, leading to a severe shortage of
long-term memory capabilities and limited personalization in the interactive
experience with AI agents. To overcome this challenge, we innovatively propose
a Memory Operating System, i.e., MemoryOS, to achieve comprehensive and
efficient memory management for AI agents. Inspired by the memory management
principles in operating systems, MemoryOS designs a hierarchical storage
architecture and consists of four key modules: Memory Storage, Updating,
Retrieval, and Generation. Specifically, the architecture comprises three
levels of storage units: short-term memory, mid-term memory, and long-term
personal memory. Key operations within MemoryOS include dynamic updates between
storage units: short-term to mid-term updates follow a dialogue-chain-based
FIFO principle, while mid-term to long-term updates use a segmented page
organization strategy. Our pioneering MemoryOS enables hierarchical memory
integration and dynamic updating. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo benchmark
show an average improvement of 49.11% on F1 and 46.18% on BLEU-1 over the
baselines on GPT-4o-mini, showing contextual coherence and personalized memory
retention in long conversations. The implementation code is open-sourced at
https://github.com/BAI-LAB/MemoryOS.

*Christian Tarsney*

TLDR: 本文通过决策理论框架形式化工具性趋同和权力追求的概念，评估权力是否是一种趋同工具性目标。结论是这一观点有一定道理，但预测效用可能有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者对高级AI可能带来的灾难性风险表示担忧，认为强大的AI代理会追求权力，因为权力是一种趋同工具性目标。本文旨在验证这一观点。

Method: 使用抽象的决策理论框架形式化工具性趋同和权力追求的概念。

Result: 权力作为趋同工具性目标的观点有一定道理，但预测效用可能有限，因为缺乏代理最终目标的具体信息时，无法总是按权力排序选项。

Conclusion: 工具性趋同对有望获得绝对或接近绝对权力的代理更具预测性。

Abstract: Researchers worried about catastrophic risks from advanced AI have argued
that we should expect sufficiently capable AI agents to pursue power over
humanity because power is a convergent instrumental goal, something that is
useful for a wide range of final goals. Others have recently expressed
skepticism of these claims. This paper aims to formalize the concepts of
instrumental convergence and power-seeking in an abstract, decision-theoretic
framework, and to assess the claim that power is a convergent instrumental
goal. I conclude that this claim contains at least an element of truth, but
might turn out to have limited predictive utility, since an agent's options
cannot always be ranked in terms of power in the absence of substantive
information about the agent's final goals. However, the fact of instrumental
convergence is more predictive for agents who have a good shot at attaining
absolute or near-absolute power.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 提出了首个完全归纳的时序知识图谱链接预测方法POSTRA，通过正弦位置编码和消息传递生成适应性表示，实现了对未见实体的零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序知识图谱嵌入模型在推理时依赖训练中已见的元素，限制了模型的迁移和泛化能力。

Method: 使用正弦位置编码捕捉细粒度时序模式，通过消息传递生成适应性实体和关系表示。

Result: POSTRA在未见时序知识图谱上表现出强大的零样本性能，能泛化到新实体、关系和时间戳。

Conclusion: POSTRA为时序知识图谱的基础模型迈出了重要一步，展示了单预训练模型在多场景中的零样本性能提升。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) store temporal facts with quadruple formats
(s, p, o, t). Existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) models perform
link prediction tasks in transductive or semi-inductive settings, which means
the entities, relations, and temporal information in the test graph are fully
or partially observed during training. Such reliance on seen elements during
inference limits the models' ability to transfer to new domains and generalize
to real-world scenarios. A central limitation is the difficulty in learning
representations for entities, relations, and timestamps that are transferable
and not tied to dataset-specific vocabularies. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce the first fully-inductive approach to temporal knowledge graph
link prediction. Our model employs sinusoidal positional encodings to capture
fine-grained temporal patterns and generates adaptive entity and relation
representations using message passing conditioned on both local and global
temporal contexts. Our model design is agnostic to temporal granularity and
time span, effectively addressing temporal discrepancies across TKGs and
facilitating time-aware structural information transfer. As a pretrained,
scalable, and transferable model, POSTRA demonstrates strong zero-shot
performance on unseen temporal knowledge graphs, effectively generalizing to
novel entities, relations, and timestamps. Extensive theoretical analysis and
empirical results show that a single pretrained model can improve zero-shot
performance on various inductive temporal reasoning scenarios, marking a
significant step toward a foundation model for temporal KGs.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: SIGMA框架通过重新利用MCTS搜索树中被丢弃的兄弟节点，优化LLM推理，显著减少数据需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅保留MCTS搜索树中的最优路径，浪费了大量有价值的非最优推理分支信息。

Method: SIGMA通过语义链接兄弟节点，分两阶段优化：批判模型识别优缺点，修订模型基于反馈优化最优路径。

Result: 在MATH基准测试中，SIGMA优化的7B模型仅用30K样本达到54.92%准确率，优于590K样本训练的SOTA模型。

Conclusion: SIGMA展示了利用非最优推理分支信息可显著提升LLM推理能力，同时减少数据需求。

Abstract: Enhancing large language models by simply scaling up datasets has begun to
yield diminishing returns, shifting the spotlight to data quality. Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) has emerged as a powerful technique for generating
high-quality chain-of-thought data, yet conventional approaches typically
retain only the top-scoring trajectory from the search tree, discarding sibling
nodes that often contain valuable partial insights, recurrent error patterns,
and alternative reasoning strategies. This unconditional rejection of
non-optimal reasoning branches may waste vast amounts of informative data in
the whole search tree. We propose SIGMA (Sibling Guided Monte Carlo
Augmentation), a novel framework that reintegrates these discarded sibling
nodes to refine LLM reasoning. SIGMA forges semantic links among sibling nodes
along each search path and applies a two-stage refinement: a critique model
identifies overlooked strengths and weaknesses across the sibling set, and a
revision model conducts text-based backpropagation to refine the top-scoring
trajectory in light of this comparative feedback. By recovering and amplifying
the underutilized but valuable signals from non-optimal reasoning branches,
SIGMA substantially improves reasoning trajectories. On the challenging MATH
benchmark, our SIGMA-tuned 7B model achieves 54.92% accuracy using only 30K
samples, outperforming state-of-the-art models trained on 590K samples. This
result highlights that our sibling-guided optimization not only significantly
reduces data usage but also significantly boosts LLM reasoning.

TLDR: ScriptDoctor是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的系统，用于自动生成和测试PuzzleScript游戏，展示了LLM在自动游戏设计中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何将大型预训练模型集成到长期自动游戏设计（AGD）流程中，减少对人工监督的依赖。

Method: ScriptDoctor通过迭代循环生成和测试游戏设计，利用人类示例、PuzzleScript引擎的编译错误和基于搜索的代理进行游戏测试。

Result: ScriptDoctor能够自动生成新颖的游戏内容，展示了LLM在开放工作流中的潜力。

Conclusion: ScriptDoctor为LLM在自动游戏设计中的应用提供了具体示例，证明了其可行性和潜力。

Abstract: There is much interest in using large pre-trained models in Automatic Game
Design (AGD), whether via the generation of code, assets, or more abstract
conceptualization of design ideas. But so far this interest largely stems from
the ad hoc use of such generative models under persistent human supervision.
Much work remains to show how these tools can be integrated into
longer-time-horizon AGD pipelines, in which systems interface with game engines
to test generated content autonomously. To this end, we introduce ScriptDoctor,
a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven system for automatically generating and
testing games in PuzzleScript, an expressive but highly constrained description
language for turn-based puzzle games over 2D gridworlds. ScriptDoctor generates
and tests game design ideas in an iterative loop, where human-authored examples
are used to ground the system's output, compilation errors from the
PuzzleScript engine are used to elicit functional code, and search-based agents
play-test generated games. ScriptDoctor serves as a concrete example of the
potential of automated, open-ended LLM-based workflows in generating novel game
content.

TLDR: 多智能体AI系统在临床中表现优于单智能体系统，但组件优化可能导致系统性能下降，需关注信息流和兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体AI系统中组件优化与整体性能的关系，以提升临床诊断效果。

Method: 使用2,400例真实患者数据，对比单智能体与多智能体系统在诊断、流程和成本效率上的表现。

Result: 多智能体系统整体表现更优，但组件优化的系统在诊断准确率上显著低于其他多智能体系统。

Conclusion: AI在医疗中的成功应用需关注系统整体验证，而非仅依赖组件指标。

Abstract: Multi-agent artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in
clinical settings, yet the relationship between component-level optimization
and system-wide performance remains poorly understood. We evaluated this
relationship using 2,400 real patient cases from the MIMIC-CDM dataset across
four abdominal pathologies (appendicitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis,
diverticulitis), decomposing clinical diagnosis into information gathering,
interpretation, and differential diagnosis. We evaluated single agent systems
(one model performing all tasks) against multi-agent systems (specialized
models for each task) using comprehensive metrics spanning diagnostic outcomes,
process adherence, and cost efficiency. Our results reveal a paradox: while
multi-agent systems generally outperformed single agents, the
component-optimized or Best of Breed system with superior components and
excellent process metrics (85.5% information accuracy) significantly
underperformed in diagnostic accuracy (67.7% vs. 77.4% for a top multi-agent
system). This finding underscores that successful integration of AI in
healthcare requires not just component level optimization but also attention to
information flow and compatibility between agents. Our findings highlight the
need for end to end system validation rather than relying on component metrics
alone.

Abstract: Insufficient data volume and quality are particularly pressing challenges in
the adoption of modern subsymbolic AI. To alleviate these challenges, AI
simulation uses virtual training environments in which AI agents can be safely

new avenues in AI simulation, as these high-fidelity virtual replicas of
physical systems are equipped with state-of-the-art simulators and the ability
to further interact with the physical system for additional data collection. In
this article, we report on our systematic survey of digital twin-enabled AI
simulation. By analyzing 22 primary studies, we identify technological trends
and derive a reference framework to situate digital twins and AI components.
Based on our findings, we derive a reference framework and provide
architectural guidelines by mapping it onto the ISO 23247 reference
architecture for digital twins. Finally, we identify challenges and research
opportunities for prospective researchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经TSP求解器难以同时高效处理不同规模的TSP问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出GELD框架，结合全局编码器和局部解码器，采用低复杂度注意力机制和两阶段训练策略。

Result: GELD在合成和真实数据集上优于七种先进模型，并能处理多达744,710个节点的TSP问题。

Conclusion: GELD显著提升了神经TSP求解器的性能和实用性，适用于超大规模问题。

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial
optimization problem with broad real-world applications. Recent advancements in
neural network-based TSP solvers have shown promising results. Nonetheless,
these models often struggle to efficiently solve both small- and large-scale
TSPs using the same set of pre-trained model parameters, limiting their
practical utility. To address this issue, we introduce a novel neural TSP
solver named GELD, built upon our proposed broad global assessment and refined
local selection framework. Specifically, GELD integrates a lightweight
Global-view Encoder (GE) with a heavyweight Local-view Decoder (LD) to enrich
embedding representation while accelerating the decision-making process.
Moreover, GE incorporates a novel low-complexity attention mechanism, allowing
GELD to achieve low inference latency and scalability to larger-scale TSPs.
Additionally, we propose a two-stage training strategy that utilizes training
instances of different sizes to bolster GELD's generalization ability.
Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that GELD outperforms seven state-of-the-art models considering
both solution quality and inference speed. Furthermore, GELD can be employed as
a post-processing method to significantly elevate the quality of the solutions
derived by existing neural TSP solvers via spending affordable additional
computing time. Notably, GELD is shown as capable of solving TSPs with up to
744,710 nodes, first-of-its-kind to solve this large size TSP without relying
on divide-and-conquer strategies to the best of our knowledge.

Motivation: 当前LLM代理在复杂任务中缺乏环境特定经验且无法在推理时持续学习，导致性能不佳。

Method: CER框架通过动态记忆缓冲区积累环境动态和决策模式，使代理能在新任务中检索相关知识。

Result: 在VisualWebArena和WebArena基准测试中，CER分别达到31.9%和36.7%的成功率，相对GPT-4o基线提升51.0%。

Conclusion: CER显著提升了LLM代理的适应性和性能，证明了其高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have been applied to sequential
decision-making tasks such as web navigation, but without any
environment-specific experiences, they often fail in these complex tasks.
Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past
experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain
these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual
Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient
self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER
accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer.
These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making
patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant
knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments.
We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On
VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena,
CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving
the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a
comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand
it better.

Abstract: This paper presents a SysML profile that enables the direct integration of
planning semantics based on the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) into
system models. Reusable stereotypes are defined for key PDDL concepts such as
types, predicates, functions and actions, while formal OCL constraints ensure
syntactic consistency. The profile was derived from the Backus-Naur Form (BNF)
definition of PDDL 3.1 to align with SysML modeling practices. A case study
from aircraft manufacturing demonstrates the application of the profile: a
robotic system with interchangeable end effectors is modeled and enriched to
generate both domain and problem descriptions in PDDL format. These are used as
input to a PDDL solver to derive optimized execution plans. The approach
supports automated and model-based generation of planning descriptions and
provides a reusable bridge between system modeling and AI planning in
engineering design.

Motivation: LLMs在结构化领域（如模拟环境）中难以生成精确预测，因其无法将广泛知识落地到具体环境。

Result: 实验证明WorldLLM在文本游戏环境中提升了预测准确性，并生成了可解释的环境动态理论。

Conclusion: WorldLLM通过自主探索和假设优化，显著提升了LLM在结构化环境中的预测能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess general world knowledge but often
struggle to generate precise predictions in structured, domain-specific
contexts such as simulations. These limitations arise from their inability to
ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To
address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world
modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with
reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of
LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language
hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined
through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the
proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected
using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the
environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based
predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining
hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives
continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to
manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive
accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment
dynamics.

Result: 现有模型表现不佳，GPT-4o准确率仅45.9%。

Conclusion: VisioMath为多模态推理研究提供了新基准，推动未来技术进步。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving
capabilities across various domains. However, their ability to perform
mathematical reasoning when answer options are represented as images--an
essential aspect of multi-image comprehension--remains underexplored. To bridge
this gap, we introduce VisioMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate mathematical
reasoning in multimodal contexts involving image-based answer choices.
VisioMath comprises 8,070 images and 1,800 multiple-choice questions, where
each answer option is an image, presenting unique challenges to existing LMMs.
To the best of our knowledge, VisioMath is the first dataset specifically
tailored for mathematical reasoning in image-based-option scenarios, where
fine-grained distinctions between answer choices are critical for accurate
problem-solving. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on VisioMath
and find that even the most advanced models struggle with this task. Notably,
GPT-4o achieves only 45.9% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current
models in reasoning over visually similar answer choices. By addressing a
crucial gap in existing benchmarks, VisioMath establishes a rigorous testbed
for future research, driving advancements in multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 在ILP中，假设空间通常很大，搜索效率低。通过预处理缩小假设空间，可以显著减少学习时间。

Method: 利用背景知识识别并移除不可能出现在最优假设中的规则，使用答案集编程实现。

Result: 实验表明，预处理时间仅需10秒，学习时间可从10小时缩短至2秒，同时保持预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升ILP系统的学习效率，适用于视觉推理和游戏等领域。

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. The
goal is to search a hypothesis space for a hypothesis that generalises training
examples and background knowledge. We introduce an approach that 'shrinks' the
hypothesis space before an ILP system searches it. Our approach uses background
knowledge to find rules that cannot be in an optimal hypothesis regardless of
the training examples. For instance, our approach discovers relationships such
as "even numbers cannot be odd" and "prime numbers greater than 2 are odd". It
then removes violating rules from the hypothesis space. We implement our
approach using answer set programming and use it to shrink the hypothesis space
of a constraint-based ILP system. Our experiments on multiple domains,
including visual reasoning and game playing, show that our approach can
substantially reduce learning times whilst maintaining predictive accuracies.
For instance, given just 10 seconds of preprocessing time, our approach can
reduce learning times from over 10 hours to only 2 seconds.

Motivation: 心理咨询需求增长与专业人员短缺的矛盾促使研究利用LLMs辅助心理咨询，但现有模型缺乏对情感的深入理解和个性化治疗能力。

Method: 提出AI PsyRoom框架，包括多代理PsyRoom A用于对话重构生成高质量数据集EmoPsy，以及PsyRoom B用于生成个性化治疗计划。

Conclusion: AI PsyRoom为AI辅助心理咨询研究提供了数据集和模型基础，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Psychological counseling faces huge challenges due to the growing demand for
mental health services and the shortage of trained professionals. Large
language models (LLMs) have shown potential to assist psychological counseling,
especially in empathy and emotional support. However, existing models lack a
deep understanding of emotions and are unable to generate personalized
treatment plans based on fine-grained emotions. To address these shortcomings,
we present AI PsyRoom, a multi-agent simulation framework designed to enhance
psychological counseling by generating empathetic and emotionally nuanced
conversations. By leveraging fine-grained emotion classification and a
multi-agent framework, we construct a multi-agent PsyRoom A for dialogue
reconstruction, generating a high-quality dialogue dataset EmoPsy, which
contains 35 sub-emotions, 423 specific emotion scenarios, and 12,350 dialogues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SNN训练中的挑战，如时间动态性、脉冲事件的不可微性和稀疏事件驱动激活，同时探索生物启发学习算法在分类任务中的潜力。

Method: 提出了一种结合SNN和LZC的生物启发分类器，比较了经典反向传播算法和生物启发算法（如tempotron和Spikprop）的性能。

Result: 经典反向传播算法分类精度高但计算成本高，生物启发算法在保持竞争力的同时提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: 选择学习算法需权衡分类精度和计算成本，并考虑应用约束。

Abstract: Training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is challenging due to their unique
properties, including temporal dynamics, non-differentiability of spike events,
and sparse event-driven activations. In this paper, we widely consider the
influence of the type of chosen learning algorithm, including bioinspired
learning rules on the accuracy of classification. We proposed a bioinspired
classifier based on the combination of SNN and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC).
This approach synergizes the strengths of SNNs in temporal precision and
biological realism with LZC's structural complexity analysis, facilitating
efficient and interpretable classification of spatiotemporal neural data. It
turned out that the classic backpropagation algorithm achieves excellent
classification accuracy, but at extremely high computational cost, which makes
it impractical for real-time applications. Biologically inspired learning
algorithms such as tempotron and Spikprop provide increased computational
efficiency while maintaining competitive classification performance, making
them suitable for time-sensitive tasks. The results obtained indicate that the
selection of the most appropriate learning algorithm depends on the trade-off
between classification accuracy and computational cost as well as application
constraints.

TLDR: CA-MIQ是一种轻量级双批评强化学习框架，通过动态调整探索策略适应任务优先级变化，在SAR任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险的搜救任务需要系统在动态优先级下持续获取关键信息，传统方法难以适应优先级变化。

Method: CA-MIQ结合外在和内在批评器，通过状态新颖性、信息位置感知和实时优先级对齐动态调整策略，并内置优先级变化检测器。

Result: 在模拟SAR任务中，CA-MIQ在单次和多次优先级变化下分别实现4倍和3倍以上的成功率，基线方法无法适应。

Conclusion: CA-MIQ适用于离散环境中信息价值分布分段平稳的场景，能有效适应动态优先级变化。

Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in high-stakes search-and-rescue (SAR) missions
must continuously gather mission-critical information while flexibly adapting
to shifting operational priorities. We propose CA-MIQ (Context-Aware
Max-Information Q-learning), a lightweight dual-critic reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that dynamically adjusts its exploration strategy whenever
mission priorities change. CA-MIQ pairs a standard extrinsic critic for task
reward with an intrinsic critic that fuses state-novelty, information-location
awareness, and real-time priority alignment. A built-in shift detector triggers
transient exploration boosts and selective critic resets, allowing the agent to
re-focus after a priority revision. In a simulated SAR grid-world, where
experiments specifically test adaptation to changes in the priority order of
information types the agent is expected to focus on, CA-MIQ achieves nearly
four times higher mission-success rates than baselines after a single priority
shift and more than three times better performance in multiple-shift scenarios,
achieving 100% recovery while baseline methods fail to adapt. These results
highlight CA-MIQ's effectiveness in any discrete environment with
piecewise-stationary information-value distributions.

Motivation: 探讨LLM如何理解其生成文本的概率分布，并扩展其任务范围，超越简单的生成采样。

Method: 设计Xent游戏，包括单人和多人形式，基于交叉熵分数和约束，构建计算图和程序。

Result: Xent游戏空间丰富且可构造，可用于构建能力基准测试（Xent Game measures）。

Conclusion: 通过进化动力学方法探索Xent游戏空间，为评估LLM的通用能力提供新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By
considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know
such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to
formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms
of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality
search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be
formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent)
Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve
cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as
simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large
enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible
from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game
space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the
construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be
used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a
covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the
challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of
Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary
dynamics.

TLDR: 论文提出CoThinker框架，通过多智能体协作减轻LLM的认知负荷，提升复杂任务解决能力。


<details>

Motivation: LLM在复杂任务中表现受限，源于其认知负荷能力不足，类比人类认知负荷理论（CLT）。

Method: 基于CLT设计CoThinker框架，通过智能体分工和结构化通信管理认知负荷。

Result: 实验验证CoThinker在复杂任务中优于现有方法，提升解决方案质量和效率。

Conclusion: CoThinker为突破LLM性能瓶颈提供了理论支持，展示了集体认知的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a notable performance ceiling on
complex, multi-faceted tasks, as they often fail to integrate diverse
information or adhere to multiple constraints. We posit that such limitation
arises when the demands of a task exceed the LLM's effective cognitive load
capacity. This interpretation draws a strong analogy to Cognitive Load Theory
(CLT) in cognitive science, which explains similar performance boundaries in
the human mind, and is further supported by emerging evidence that reveals LLMs
have bounded working memory characteristics. Building upon this CLT-grounded
understanding, we introduce CoThinker, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework
designed to mitigate cognitive overload and enhance collaborative
problem-solving abilities. CoThinker operationalizes CLT principles by
distributing intrinsic cognitive load through agent specialization and managing
transactional load via structured communication and a collective working
memory. We empirically validate CoThinker on complex problem-solving tasks and
fabricated high cognitive load scenarios, demonstrating improvements over
existing multi-agent baselines in solution quality and efficiency. Our analysis
reveals characteristic interaction patterns, providing insights into the
emergence of collective cognition and effective load management, thus offering
a principled approach to overcoming LLM performance ceilings.

Conclusion: 该框架为ML在安全关键系统中的动态安全评估和适应提供了可行方案，并强调了显式建模ML失效的重要性。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into safety-critical
systems, such as autonomous vehicle platooning, to enable real-time
decision-making. However, their inherent imperfection introduces a new class of
failure: reasoning failures often triggered by distributional shifts between
operational and training data. Traditional safety assessment methods, which
rely on design artefacts or code, are ill-suited for ML components that learn
behaviour from data. SafeML was recently proposed to dynamically detect such
shifts and assign confidence levels to the reasoning of ML-based components.
Building on this, we introduce a probabilistic safety assurance framework that
integrates SafeML with Bayesian Networks (BNs) to model ML failures as part of
a broader causal safety analysis. This allows for dynamic safety evaluation and
system adaptation under uncertainty. We demonstrate the approach on an
simulated automotive platooning system with traffic sign recognition. The
findings highlight the potential broader benefits of explicitly modelling ML
failures in safety assessment.

Conclusion: KDR框架和KCII模型显著提升了知识分析任务的能力，为深度学习研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Deep knowledge analysis tasks always involve the systematic extraction and
association of knowledge from large volumes of data, followed by logical
reasoning to discover insights. However, to solve such complex tasks, existing
deep research frameworks face three major challenges: 1) They lack systematic
organization and management of knowledge; 2) They operate purely online, making
it inefficient for tasks that rely on shared and large-scale knowledge; 3) They
cannot perform complex knowledge computation, limiting their abilities to
produce insightful analytical results. Motivated by these, in this paper, we
propose a \textbf{K}nowledgeable \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esearch (\textbf{KDR})
framework that empowers deep research with deep knowledge analysis capability.
Specifically, it introduces an independent knowledge organization phase to
preprocess large-scale, domain-relevant data into systematic knowledge offline.
Based on this knowledge, it extends deep research with an additional kind of
reasoning steps that perform complex knowledge computation in an online manner.
To enhance the abilities of LLMs to solve knowledge analysis tasks in the above
framework, we further introduce \textbf{\KCII}, an LLM that bridges knowledge
organization and reasoning via unified code generation. For knowledge
organization, it generates instantiation code for predefined classes,
transforming data into knowledge objects. For knowledge computation, it
generates analysis code and executes on the above knowledge objects to obtain
deep analysis results. Experimental results on more than thirty datasets across
six knowledge analysis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of \KCII. Moreover,
when integrated into the KDR framework, \KCII can generate high-quality reports
with insightful analytical results compared to the mainstream deep research
framework.

Motivation: 现有LMM依赖上下文学习（ICL）但性能不稳定，尤其是小规模模型，可能因图像嵌入中的冗余信息而表现不佳。

Method: 引入注意力映射模块和软提示蒸馏，结合LLaVA v1.5架构，实现少样本任务适应。

Result: 在VL-ICL Bench上，该方法优于ICL和其他提示调优方法，尤其在图像扰动下表现更优。

Conclusion: 元学习方法有效提升了LMM在少样本任务中的适应性和推理能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to
perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance,
especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve
monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to
the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image
embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we
propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing
few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are
distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time
using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an
attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA
v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task
adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps.
Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms
ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations,
improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

Abstract: Understanding how events in a scenario causally connect with each other is
important for effectively modeling and reasoning about events. But event
reasoning remains a difficult challenge, and despite recent advances, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to accurately identify causal connections
between events. This struggle leads to poor performance on deeper reasoning
tasks like event forecasting and timeline understanding. To address this
challenge, we investigate the generation of causal event graphs (e.g., A
enables B) as a parallel mechanism to help LLMs explicitly represent causality
during inference. This paper evaluates both how to generate correct graphs as
well as how graphs can assist reasoning. We propose a collaborative approach to
causal graph generation where we use LLMs to simulate experts that focus on
specific semantic relations. The experts engage in multiple rounds of
discussions which are then consolidated by a final expert. Then, to demonstrate
the utility of causal graphs, we use them on multiple downstream applications,
and also introduce a new explainable event prediction task that requires a
causal chain of events in the explanation. These explanations are more
informative and coherent than baseline generations. Finally, our overall
approach not finetuned on any downstream task, achieves competitive results
with state-of-the-art models on both forecasting and next event prediction
tasks.

Conclusion: SPOC通过实时自校正和多智能体协作，有效提升了LLM的数学推理能力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success on a
broad range of tasks, math reasoning remains a challenging one. One of the
approaches for improving math reasoning is self-correction, which designs
self-improving loops to let the model correct its own mistakes. However,
existing self-correction approaches treat corrections as standalone
post-generation refinements, relying on extra prompt and system designs to
elicit self-corrections, instead of performing real-time, spontaneous
self-corrections in a single pass. To address this, we propose SPOC, a
spontaneous self-correction approach that enables LLMs to generate interleaved
solutions and verifications in a single inference pass, with generation
dynamically terminated based on verification outcomes, thereby effectively
scaling inference time compute. SPOC considers a multi-agent perspective by
assigning dual roles -- solution proposer and verifier -- to the same model. We
adopt a simple yet effective approach to generate synthetic data for
fine-tuning, enabling the model to develop capabilities for self-verification
and multi-agent collaboration. We further improve its solution proposal and
verification accuracy through online reinforcement learning. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that SPOC significantly improves
performance. Notably, SPOC boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B and 70B Instruct
models, achieving gains of 8.8% and 11.6% on MATH500, 10.0% and 20.0% on AMC23,

external tools via APIs for tasks like simulation and optimization, utilizes

effectiveness is demonstrated in its ability to automate, reason, plan, and
adapt. Notably, the Agentic Framework possesses internal reflection and
decision flexibility, permitting highly varied and potentially novel outputs.

Abstract: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers.
While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks,
their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain
insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established
math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this
evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide
insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate
these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise
manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures.
This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal
reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive
experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain
complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their
reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines
despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard
LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance
regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2)
medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3)
high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that
LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit
algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the
reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and
analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their
strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning
capabilities.

Result: 实验证明该方法能在样本MDP中实现约束下的局部最优。

Conclusion: 该方法为同时优化效用和约束提供了一种可行方案。

Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are the most common model for decision
making under uncertainty in the Machine Learning community. An MDP captures
non-determinism, probabilistic uncertainty, and an explicit model of action. A
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent learns to act in an MDP by maximizing a
utility function. This paper considers the problem of learning a decision
policy that maximizes utility subject to satisfying a constraint expressed in
deontic logic. In this setup, the utility captures the agent's mission - such
as going quickly from A to B. The deontic formula represents (ethical, social,
situational) constraints on how the agent might achieve its mission by
prohibiting classes of behaviors. We use the logic of Expected Act
Utilitarianism, a probabilistic stit logic that can be interpreted over
controlled MDPs. We develop a variation on policy improvement, and show that it
reaches a constrained local maximum of the mission utility. Given that in stit
logic, an agent's duty is derived from value maximization, this can be seen as
a way of acting to simultaneously maximize two value functions, one of which is
implicit, in a bi-level structure. We illustrate these results with experiments
on sample MDPs.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) utilizes labeled samples of known
classes to discover novel classes in unlabeled samples. Existing methods show
effective performance on artificial datasets with balanced distributions.
However, real-world datasets are always imbalanced, significantly affecting the
effectiveness of these methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
framework that performs generalized category discovery in long-tailed
distributions. We first present a self-guided labeling technique that uses a
learnable distribution to generate pseudo-labels, resulting in less biased
classifiers. We then introduce a representation balancing process to derive
discriminative representations. By mining sample neighborhoods, this process
encourages the model to focus more on tail classes. We conduct experiments on
public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The
results show that our model exceeds previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents --
particularly as task and agent sophistication increase -- requires more than
simple comparison of reward curves, yet standard methods for behavioral
analysis remain underdeveloped in DRL. We apply tools from neuroscience and
ethology to study DRL agents in a novel, complex, partially observable
environment, ForageWorld, designed to capture key aspects of real-world animal
foraging -- including sparse, depleting resource patches, predator threats, and
spatially extended arenas. We use this environment as a platform for applying
joint behavioral and neural analysis to agents, revealing detailed,
quantitatively grounded insights into agent strategies, memory, and planning.
Contrary to common assumptions, we find that model-free RNN-based DRL agents
can exhibit structured, planning-like behavior purely through emergent dynamics
-- without requiring explicit memory modules or world models. Our results show
that studying DRL agents like animals -- analyzing them with
neuroethology-inspired tools that reveal structure in both behavior and neural
dynamics -- uncovers rich structure in their learning dynamics that would
otherwise remain invisible. We distill these tools into a general analysis
framework linking core behavioral and representational features to diagnostic
methods, which can be reused for a wide range of tasks and agents. As agents
grow more complex and autonomous, bridging neuroscience, cognitive science, and
AI will be essential -- not just for understanding their behavior, but for
ensuring safe alignment and maximizing desirable behaviors that are hard to
measure via reward. We show how this can be done by drawing on lessons from how
biological intelligence is studied.

Abstract: The recent success of generative AI highlights the crucial role of
high-quality human feedback in building trustworthy AI systems. However, the
increasing use of large language models (LLMs) by crowdsourcing workers poses a
significant challenge: datasets intended to reflect human input may be
compromised by LLM-generated responses. Existing LLM detection approaches often
rely on high-dimension training data such as text, making them unsuitable for
annotation tasks like multiple-choice labeling. In this work, we investigate
the potential of peer prediction -- a mechanism that evaluates the information
within workers' responses without using ground truth -- to mitigate
LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing with a focus on annotation tasks. Our
approach quantifies the correlations between worker answers while conditioning
on (a subset of) LLM-generated labels available to the requester. Building on
prior research, we propose a training-free scoring mechanism with theoretical
guarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. We
establish conditions under which our method is effective and empirically
demonstrate its robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world
crowdsourcing datasets.

TLDR: Mathesis是一个端到端的定理证明系统，通过自动形式化和证明生成处理非正式问题陈述，显著提升了自然语言问题的形式化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的定理证明器需要专家编写的正式语句作为输入，限制了其在自然语言表达的实际问题中的应用。

Method: 提出Mathesis-Autoformalizer（基于强化学习的自动形式化工具）和Mathesis-Prover（形式化证明生成器），并引入LeanScorer框架评估形式化质量。

Result: 在Gaokao-Formal基准测试中，自动形式化工具比最佳基线高出22%通过率，全系统在MiniF2F和Gaokao-Formal上分别达到64%和18%的准确率。

Conclusion: Mathesis系统在端到端定理证明中表现出色，为处理自然语言问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models show strong promise for formal
reasoning. However, most LLM-based theorem provers have long been constrained
by the need for expert-written formal statements as inputs, limiting their
applicability to real-world problems expressed in natural language. We tackle
this gap with Mathesis, the first end-to-end theorem proving pipeline
processing informal problem statements. It contributes Mathesis-Autoformalizer,
the first autoformalizer using reinforcement learning to enhance the
formalization ability of natural language problems, aided by our novel
LeanScorer framework for nuanced formalization quality assessment. It also
proposes a Mathesis-Prover, which generates formal proofs from the formalized
statements. To evaluate the real-world applicability of end-to-end formal
theorem proving, we introduce Gaokao-Formal, a benchmark of 488 complex
problems from China's national college entrance exam. Our approach is carefully
designed, with a thorough study of each component. Experiments demonstrate
Mathesis's effectiveness, with the autoformalizer outperforming the best
baseline by 22% in pass-rate on Gaokao-Formal. The full system surpasses other
model combinations, achieving 64% accuracy on MiniF2F with pass@32 and a
state-of-the-art 18% on Gaokao-Formal.

TLDR: 提出了一种结构化推理框架，用于多跳事实验证，通过显式建模推理路径为结构化图，提升证据检索和验证的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中事实声明的复杂性增加，现有方法因静态或浅层模型无法捕捉推理路径的动态结构，导致检索碎片化和可解释性有限。

Method: 提出结构化推理框架，包含结构增强的检索机制和推理路径引导的验证模块，结合结构感知推理机制捕获多跳证据链的长程依赖。

Result: 在FEVER和HoVer数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于基线，验证了推理路径建模的有效性。

Conclusion: 结构化推理框架通过建模推理路径，显著提升了多跳事实验证的检索和验证性能。

Abstract: The growing complexity of factual claims in real-world scenarios presents
significant challenges for automated fact verification systems, particularly in
accurately aggregating and reasoning over multi-hop evidence. Existing
approaches often rely on static or shallow models that fail to capture the
evolving structure of reasoning paths, leading to fragmented retrieval and
limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a Structural
Reasoning framework for Multi-hop Fact Verification that explicitly models
reasoning paths as structured graphs throughout both evidence retrieval and
claim verification stages. Our method comprises two key modules: a
structure-enhanced retrieval mechanism that constructs reasoning graphs to
guide evidence collection, and a reasoning-path-guided verification module that
incrementally builds subgraphs to represent evolving inference trajectories. We
further incorporate a structure-aware reasoning mechanism that captures
long-range dependencies across multi-hop evidence chains, enabling more precise
verification. Extensive experiments on the FEVER and HoVer datasets demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the
effectiveness of reasoning-path modeling in enhancing retrieval precision and
verification accuracy.

Motivation: 解决BRIGHT基准中因网络爬取导致的常见问题（如内容冗余和语义不连贯），以提升检索准确性和下游推理能力。

Method: 提出MARCUS多智能体流程，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）清理和重组BRIGHT语料库，生成BRIGHT-Plus。

Result: BRIGHT-Plus在检索准确性和多跳推理方面均表现显著提升。

Conclusion: MARCUS和BRIGHT-Plus为未来研究提供了更高质量的语料库和工具，支持稳健的推理中心检索。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both
structurally clean and semantically coherent. BRIGHT is a recent and
influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across
diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is
limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and
semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream
reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven
StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and
Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean.
  In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a
higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for
structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing
spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in
both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of
retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to
support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.

Abstract: The Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a simple Python FL
framework that is easy to use by ML&AI developers who do not need to be
professional programmers and is also amenable to LLMs. In the previous
research, generic federated learning algorithms provided by this framework were
manually translated into the CSP processes and algorithms' safety and liveness
properties were automatically verified by the model checker PAT. In this paper,
a simple translation process is introduced wherein the ChatGPT is used to
automate the translation of the mentioned federated learning algorithms in
Python into the corresponding CSP processes. Within the process, the minimality
of the used context is estimated based on the feedback from ChatGPT. The
proposed translation process was experimentally validated by successful
translation (verified by the model checker PAT) of both generic centralized and
decentralized federated learning algorithms.

Method: 提出SHE框架，包括基于自适应时间窗口的视觉-文本对齐检测和联合嵌入空间的正交投影缓解。

Result: SHE在标准基准测试中减少行为幻觉超过10%（BEACH指标），同时保持描述准确性。

Conclusion: SHE有效填补行为幻觉研究空白，为多模态模型可靠性提供新解决方案。

Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at various tasks, they still
suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability and scalability for
broader domain applications. To address this issue, recent research mainly
focuses on objective hallucination. However, for sequential images, besides
objective hallucination, there is also behavioral hallucination, which is less
studied. This work aims to fill in the gap. We first reveal that behavioral
hallucinations mainly arise from two key factors: prior-driven bias and the
snowball effect. Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence
Hallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects
hallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive
temporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint
embedding space. We also propose a new metric (BEACH) to quantify behavioral
hallucination severity. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that SHE reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on BEACH while
maintaining descriptive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课堂对话分析因复杂性和手动编码耗时性而具挑战性，现有方法难以适用于小数据集或定制编码需求。

Result: 研究发现，尽管有局限，MyGPT代理可作为编码助手生成建议。

Conclusion: 基于MyGPT特性的策略能有效配置代理，支持小数据集下的课堂对话编码。

Abstract: This study investigates effective strategies for developing a customised GPT
agent to code classroom dialogue. While classroom dialogue is widely recognised
as a crucial element of education, its analysis remains challenging due to the
need for a nuanced understanding of dialogic functions and the labour-intensive
nature of manual transcript coding. Recent advancements in large language
models offer promising avenues for automating this process. However, existing
studies predominantly focus on training large-scale models or evaluating
pre-trained models with fixed codebooks, which are often not applicable or
replicable for dialogue researchers working with small datasets or customised
coding schemes. Using GPT-4's MyGPT agent as a case, this study evaluates its
baseline performance in coding classroom dialogue with a human codebook and
examines how performance varies with different example inputs through a
variable control method. Through a design-based research approach, it
identifies a set of practical strategies, based on MyGPT's unique features, for
configuring effective agents with limited data. The findings suggest that,
despite some limitations, a MyGPT agent developed with these strategies can
serve as a useful coding assistant by generating coding suggestions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLM在视觉语言基准测试中表现优异，但数据污染问题可能掩盖其真实泛化能力，需要更严格的评估方法。

Method: 通过任务扰动（如QA、标题生成等）评估模型，使用自动化流程和校准评分机制分析模型跨任务能力。

Result: 实验表明，在模拟测试数据上微调的模型任务特定性能提升，但泛化能力下降。

Conclusion: 动态任务扰动能更深入评估MLLM泛化能力，区分真实理解与数据泄漏或过拟合。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show impressive vision-language
benchmark performance, yet growing concerns about data contamination (test set
exposure during training) risk masking true generalization. This concern
extends to reasoning MLLMs, often fine-tuned via reinforcement learning from
potentially contaminated base models. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation
framework to rigorously assess MLLM generalization, moving beyond static
benchmarks. Instead of perturbing inputs, we perturb the task itself. Using the
same visual input, models are evaluated across a family of tasks (e.g., QA,
captioning, question posing, verification) to probe diverse capabilities. This
task perturbation reveals whether model performance is robust or reliant on
superficial task-specific cues. Our approach is analogous to loss landscape
sharpness: models overfit or contaminated for a single task (sharp minima)
falter under task shifts, unlike models with generalizable solutions (flatter
minima). We developed an automated pipeline with a calibrated judge scoring
open-ended generations (captions, questions) using paraphrase and corruption
sampling. Applying this framework to leading image/video MLLMs on benchmarks
including MME, RealWorldQA, and CVRR-ES, we analyze each model's cross-task
"ability vector." We demonstrate that fine-tuning on simulated test data
(extreme contamination) drastically sharpens task-specific performance but
harms overall generalization. Our dynamic task perturbation offers deeper
insights into MLLM generalization, distinguishing genuine understanding from
spurious leakage or overfitting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机代理主要关注通用桌面自动化任务，而在高度专业化的AEC领域（如BIM软件中的复杂交互和开放设计任务）中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: BIMgent利用多模态LLMs，通过GUI操作实现自主建筑建模，包括多模态输入、软件特定工作流规划和GUI动作执行。

Result: BIMgent在真实建模任务中实现了32%的成功率，而基线模型完全失败（0%）。设计质量合理，能有效保留设计意图。

Conclusion: BIMgent展示了在实际建筑建模场景中的潜力，显著减少人工工作量并保持设计意图。

Abstract: Existing computer-use agents primarily focus on general-purpose desktop
automation tasks, with limited exploration of their application in highly
specialized domains. In particular, the 3D building modeling process in the
Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector involves open-ended
design tasks and complex interaction patterns within Building Information
Modeling (BIM) authoring software, which has yet to be thoroughly addressed by
current studies. In this paper, we propose BIMgent, an agentic framework
powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), designed to enable
autonomous building model authoring via graphical user interface (GUI)
operations. BIMgent automates the architectural building modeling process,
including multimodal input for conceptual design, planning of software-specific
workflows, and efficient execution of the authoring GUI actions. We evaluate
BIMgent on real-world building modeling tasks, including both text-based
conceptual design generation and reconstruction from existing building design.
The design quality achieved by BIMgent was found to be reasonable. Its
operations achieved a 32% success rate, whereas all baseline models failed to
complete the tasks (0% success rate). Results demonstrate that BIMgent
effectively reduces manual workload while preserving design intent,
highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world architectural
modeling scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: 在高动态风险场景（如火灾、洪水）中，决策延迟是一个关键但研究不足的问题，需要一种新的方法来评估和优化代理性能。

Method: 提出了TCM将推理延迟转换为等效仿真帧，并扩展HAZARD基准以包含延迟感知指标（RL和LAR）。同时设计了RRARA代理，结合轻量级LLM反馈模块和基于规则的代理，实现快速反应和异步反思。

Result: 实验表明，RRARA在延迟敏感场景中显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: TCM和RRARA为高动态风险场景中的延迟问题提供了有效解决方案，并展示了延迟感知评估的重要性。

Abstract: In the realm of embodied intelligence, the evolution of large language models
(LLMs) has markedly enhanced agent decision making. Consequently, researchers
have begun exploring agent performance in dynamically changing high-risk
scenarios, i.e., fire, flood, and wind scenarios in the HAZARD benchmark. Under
these extreme conditions, the delay in decision making emerges as a crucial yet
insufficiently studied issue. We propose a Time Conversion Mechanism (TCM) that
translates inference delays in decision-making into equivalent simulation
frames, thus aligning cognitive and physical costs under a single FPS-based
metric. By extending HAZARD with Respond Latency (RL) and Latency-to-Action
Ratio (LAR), we deliver a fully latency-aware evaluation protocol. Moreover, we
present the Rapid-Reflex Async-Reflect Agent (RRARA), which couples a
lightweight LLM-guided feedback module with a rule-based agent to enable
immediate reactive behaviors and asynchronous reflective refinements in situ.
Experiments on HAZARD show that RRARA substantially outperforms existing
baselines in latency-sensitive scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法显著改善了策略树搜索算法的训练效率。

Abstract: Policy tree search is a family of tree search algorithms that use a policy to
guide the search. These algorithms provide guarantees on the number of
expansions required to solve a given problem that are based on the quality of
the policy. While these algorithms have shown promising results, the process in
which they are trained requires complete solution trajectories to train the
policy. Search trajectories are obtained during a trial-and-error search
process. When the training problem instances are hard, learning can be
prohibitively costly, especially when starting from a randomly initialized
policy. As a result, search samples are wasted in failed attempts to solve
these hard instances. This paper introduces a novel method for learning
subgoal-based policies for policy tree search algorithms. The subgoals and
policies conditioned on subgoals are learned from the trees that the search
expands while attempting to solve problems, including the search trees of
failed attempts. We empirically show that our policy formulation and training
method improve the sample efficiency of learning a policy and heuristic
function in this online setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在编码任务中表现优异，但在漏洞检测方面能力有限，主要原因是缺乏相关推理数据和语义学习而非模式识别。

Method: ReVD框架通过构建漏洞及其修复代码的前向和后向推理过程，合成高质量推理数据，并采用三元组监督微调和课程在线偏好优化。

Result: 在PrimeVul和SVEN数据集上的实验表明，ReVD在漏洞检测准确率上提升了12.24%-22.77%，达到最新水平。

Conclusion: ReVD通过推理数据合成和偏好优化，显著提升了LLM在漏洞检测中的能力，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate considerable proficiency in numerous
coding-related tasks; however, their capabilities in detecting software
vulnerabilities remain limited. This limitation primarily stems from two
factors: (1) the absence of reasoning data related to vulnerabilities, which
hinders the models' ability to capture underlying vulnerability patterns; and
(2) their focus on learning semantic representations rather than the reason
behind them, thus failing to recognize semantically similar vulnerability
samples. Furthermore, the development of LLMs specialized in vulnerability
detection is challenging, particularly in environments characterized by the
scarcity of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
ReVD that excels at mining vulnerability patterns through reasoning data
synthesizing and vulnerability-specific preference optimization. Specifically,
we construct forward and backward reasoning processes for vulnerability and
corresponding fixed code, ensuring the synthesis of high-quality reasoning
data. Moreover, we design the triplet supervised fine-tuning followed by
curriculum online preference optimization for enabling ReVD to better
understand vulnerability patterns. The extensive experiments conducted on
PrimeVul and SVEN datasets demonstrate that ReVD sets new state-of-the-art for
LLM-based software vulnerability detection, e.g., 12.24\%-22.77\% improvement
in the accuracy. The source code and data are available at

Conclusion: IFSHM通过LLM和DRL的结合，显著提升了故障恢复效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: As the scale and complexity of cloud-based AI systems continue to increase,
the detection and adaptive recovery of system faults have become the core
challenges to ensure service reliability and continuity. In this paper, we
propose an Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism (IFSHM) that integrates
Large Language Model (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), aiming to
realize a fault recovery framework with semantic understanding and policy
optimization capabilities in cloud AI systems. On the basis of the traditional
DRL-based control model, the proposed method constructs a two-stage hybrid
architecture: (1) an LLM-driven fault semantic interpretation module, which can
dynamically extract deep contextual semantics from multi-source logs and system
indicators to accurately identify potential fault modes; (2) DRL recovery
strategy optimizer, based on reinforcement learning, learns the dynamic
matching of fault types and response behaviors in the cloud environment. The
innovation of this method lies in the introduction of LLM for environment
modeling and action space abstraction, which greatly improves the exploration
efficiency and generalization ability of reinforcement learning. At the same
time, a memory-guided meta-controller is introduced, combined with
reinforcement learning playback and LLM prompt fine-tuning strategy, to achieve
continuous adaptation to new failure modes and avoid catastrophic forgetting.
Experimental results on the cloud fault injection platform show that compared
with the existing DRL and rule methods, the IFSHM framework shortens the system
recovery time by 37% with unknown fault scenarios.

Motivation: 研究MLLMs在视觉数学问题解决中的能力，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 通过多语言Kangaroo风格基准测试评估多个MLLMs模型，涵盖几何、代数、逻辑等主题。

Result: 模型整体表现中等，Gemini 2.0 Flash在图像任务中表现最佳，但未达人类水平；GPT 4o和Gemini在推理能力上优于其他模型。

Conclusion: MLLMs在视觉数学问题中仍有提升空间，需进一步优化对视觉信息的利用和推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) promise advanced vision language
capabilities, yet their effectiveness in visually presented mathematics remains
underexplored. This paper analyzes the development and evaluation of MLLMs for
mathematical problem solving, focusing on diagrams, multilingual text, and
symbolic notation. We then assess several models, including GPT 4o, Pixtral,
Qwen VL, Llama 3.2 Vision variants, and Gemini 2.0 Flash in a multilingual
Kangaroo style benchmark spanning English, French, Spanish, and Catalan. Our
experiments reveal four key findings. First, overall precision remains moderate
across geometry, visual algebra, logic, patterns, and combinatorics: no single
model excels in every topic. Second, while most models see improved accuracy
with questions that do not have images, the gain is often limited; performance
for some remains nearly unchanged without visual input, indicating
underutilization of diagrammatic information. Third, substantial variation
exists across languages and difficulty levels: models frequently handle easier
items but struggle with advanced geometry and combinatorial reasoning. Notably,
Gemini 2.0 Flash achieves the highest precision on image based tasks, followed
by Qwen VL 2.5 72B and GPT 4o, though none approach human level performance.
Fourth, a complementary analysis aimed at distinguishing whether models reason
or simply recite reveals that Gemini and GPT 4o stand out for their structured
reasoning and consistent accuracy. In contrast, Pixtral and Llama exhibit less
consistent reasoning, often defaulting to heuristics or randomness when unable
to align their outputs with the given answer options.

Result: 实验表明HeTa具有强大的攻击性能和泛化能力，能快速适应新异构图。

Conclusion: HeTa通过共享攻击单元实现了跨HGNNs的通用攻击，为HGNNs的安全性评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are vulnerable, highlighting the
need for tailored attacks to assess their robustness and ensure security.
However, existing HGNN attacks often require complex retraining of parameters
to generate specific perturbations for new scenarios. Recently, foundation
models have opened new horizons for the generalization of graph neural networks
by capturing shared semantics across various graph distributions. This leads us
to ask:Can we design a foundation attack model for HGNNs that enables
generalizable perturbations across different HGNNs, and quickly adapts to new
heterogeneous graphs (HGs)? Empirical findings reveal that, despite significant
differences in model design and parameter space, different HGNNs surprisingly
share common vulnerability patterns from a relation-aware perspective.
Therefore, we explore how to design foundation HGNN attack criteria by mining
shared attack units. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-wise
heterogeneous graph foundation attack model, HeTa. We introduce a foundation
surrogate model to align heterogeneity and identify the importance of shared
relation-aware attack units. Building on this, we implement a serialized
relation-by-relation attack based on the identified relational weights. In this
way, the perturbation can be transferred to various target HGNNs and easily
fine-tuned for new HGs. Extensive experiments exhibit powerful attack
performances and generalizability of our method.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂法律推理中常出现逻辑错误，需要一种更可靠的方法来支持司法决策和提高效率。

Method: LegalReasoner通过识别争议点分解复杂案件，逐步推理并验证每一步的逻辑，发现错误时应用专家设计的修正策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，LegalReasoner将LLAMA-3.1-70B模型与法院判决的一致性从72.37提高到80.27。

Conclusion: LegalReasoner通过逐步验证和修正推理过程，显著提升了法律判决预测的可靠性，并发布了LegalHK数据集支持研究。

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP) aims to function as a judge by making final
rulings based on case claims and facts, which plays a vital role in the
judicial domain for supporting court decision-making and improving judicial
efficiency. However, existing methods often struggle with logical errors when
conducting complex legal reasoning. We propose LegalReasoner, which enhances
LJP reliability through step-wise verification and correction of the reasoning
process. Specifically, it first identifies dispute points to decompose complex
cases, and then conducts step-wise reasoning while employing a process verifier
to validate each step's logic from correctness, progressiveness, and potential
perspectives. When errors are detected, expert-designed attribution and
resolution strategies are applied for correction. To fine-tune LegalReasoner,
we release the LegalHK dataset, containing 58,130 Hong Kong court cases with
detailed annotations of dispute points, step-by-step reasoning chains, and
process verification labels. Experiments demonstrate that LegalReasoner
significantly improves concordance with court decisions from 72.37 to 80.27 on
LLAMA-3.1-70B. The data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理需要多跳推理的复杂主张时表现不佳，因静态分解策略和表层语义检索无法捕捉主张的细微结构和意图，导致推理错误累积和噪声证据污染。

Method: 提出AFEV框架，通过迭代分解复杂主张为原子事实，动态优化主张理解，重排证据以过滤噪声，并利用上下文特定示例指导推理过程。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，AFEV在准确性和可解释性方面均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: AFEV通过迭代分解和自适应推理，有效解决了复杂主张验证中的问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Fact verification plays a vital role in combating misinformation by assessing
the veracity of claims through evidence retrieval and reasoning. However,
traditional methods struggle with complex claims requiring multi-hop reasoning
over fragmented evidence, as they often rely on static decomposition strategies
and surface-level semantic retrieval, which fail to capture the nuanced
structure and intent of the claim. This results in accumulated reasoning
errors, noisy evidence contamination, and limited adaptability to diverse
claims, ultimately undermining verification accuracy in complex scenarios. To
address this, we propose Atomic Fact Extraction and Verification (AFEV), a
novel framework that iteratively decomposes complex claims into atomic facts,
enabling fine-grained retrieval and adaptive reasoning. AFEV dynamically
refines claim understanding and reduces error propagation through iterative
fact extraction, reranks evidence to filter noise, and leverages
context-specific demonstrations to guide the reasoning process. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that AFEV achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and interpretability.

TLDR: XPM-WM框架通过利用学习的世界模型生成模拟轨迹，显著提高了零样本协调（ZSC）代理的训练效率，减少了计算成本和样本需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成多样化的协作伙伴代理的方法（如XPM）计算成本高且样本效率低，需要改进。

Method: 提出XPM-WM框架，利用学习的世界模型生成模拟轨迹，避免多次采样真实轨迹。

Result: XPM-WM能高效生成多样化的伙伴代理，性能与现有方法相当，但样本效率和可扩展性显著提升。

Conclusion: XPM-WM是一种更高效、可扩展的ZSC代理训练方法。

Abstract: A major bottleneck in the training process for Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC)
agents is the generation of partner agents that are diverse in collaborative
conventions. Current Cross-play Minimization (XPM) methods for population
generation can be very computationally expensive and sample inefficient as the
training objective requires sampling multiple types of trajectories. Each
partner agent in the population is also trained from scratch, despite all of
the partners in the population learning policies of the same coordination task.
In this work, we propose that simulated trajectories from the dynamics model of
an environment can drastically speed up the training process for XPM methods.
We introduce XPM-WM, a framework for generating simulated trajectories for XPM
via a learned World Model (WM). We show XPM with simulated trajectories removes
the need to sample multiple trajectories. In addition, we show our proposed
method can effectively generate partners with diverse conventions that match
the performance of previous methods in terms of SP population training reward
as well as training partners for ZSC agents. Our method is thus, significantly
more sample efficient and scalable to a larger number of partners.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为ReLIFT的新训练方法，结合强化学习（RL）和监督微调（SFT），以提升大语言模型的推理能力。ReLIFT在多个基准测试中表现优异，且数据效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL方法无法突破基础模型的局限性，而SFT能补充RL的不足，引入新知识和推理模式。因此，结合两者的优势成为研究动机。

Method: 提出ReLIFT方法，交替使用RL和在线SFT：RL用于维持和提升模型现有能力，SFT用于处理超出模型当前能力的问题。

Result: ReLIFT在五个竞赛级基准和一个分布外基准上平均提升5.2分，且仅需13%的详细演示数据，优于单独使用RL或SFT。

Conclusion: ReLIFT克服了RL的局限性，展示了结合RL和SFT的潜力，为提升模型推理能力提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning have shown that
sophisticated behaviors such as planning and self-reflection can emerge through
reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite these successes, RL in its
current form remains insufficient to induce capabilities that exceed the
limitations of the base model, as it is primarily optimized based on existing
knowledge of the model rather than facilitating the acquisition of new
information. To address this limitation, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
to learn what RL cannot, which enables the incorporation of new knowledge and
reasoning patterns by leveraging high-quality demonstration data. We analyze
the training dynamics of RL and SFT for LLM reasoning and find that RL excels
at maintaining and improving performance on questions within the model's
original capabilities, while SFT is more effective at enabling progress on
questions beyond the current scope of the model. Motivated by the complementary
strengths of RL and SFT, we introduce a novel training approach,
\textbf{ReLIFT} (\textbf{Re}inforcement \textbf{L}earning \textbf{I}nterleaved
with Online \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning). In ReLIFT, the model is primarily
trained using RL, but when it encounters challenging questions, high-quality
solutions are collected for fine-tuning, and the training process alternates
between RL and fine-tuning to enhance the model's reasoning abilities. ReLIFT
achieves an average improvement of over +5.2 points across five
competition-level benchmarks and one out-of-distribution benchmark compared to
other zero-RL models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ReLIFT outperforms both
RL and SFT while using only 13\% of the detailed demonstration data,
highlighting its scalability. These results provide compelling evidence that
ReLIFT overcomes the fundamental limitations of RL and underscores the
significant potential.

TLDR: HARIS模型通过分层代理（推理与搜索）实现多跳声明验证，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳声明验证需要动态检索证据与推理交替进行，现有方法难以协调。

Method: 提出HARIS模型，包含高层推理代理（生成问题）和低层搜索代理（动态检索），通过强化学习训练。

Result: 在EX-FEVER和HOVER基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: HARIS通过分层协作显著提升多跳验证的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Multi-hop claim verification is inherently challenging, requiring multi-step
reasoning to construct verification chains while iteratively searching for
information to uncover hidden bridging facts. This process is fundamentally
interleaved, as effective reasoning relies on dynamically retrieved evidence,
while effective search demands reasoning to refine queries based on partial
information. To achieve this, we propose Hierarchical Agent Reasoning and
Information Search (HARIS), explicitly modeling the coordinated process of
reasoning-driven searching and search-informed reasoning. HARIS consists of a
high-level reasoning agent that focuses on constructing the main verification
chain, generating factual questions when more information is needed, and a
low-level search agent that iteratively retrieves more information, refining
its search based on intermediate findings. This design allows each agent to
specialize in its respective task, enhancing verification accuracy and
interpretability. HARIS is trained using reinforcement learning with
outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on the EX-FEVER and HOVER
benchmarks demonstrate that HARIS achieves strong performance, greatly
advancing multi-hop claim verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL方法在固定对手策略下训练，适应性差且策略次优，需动态调整难度以提升性能。

Method: 采用动态CL框架，结合CGRPA机制，通过反事实优势函数评估个体贡献并提供内在奖励。

Result: 实验显示方法提升了训练稳定性和最终性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 动态CL与CGRPA结合有效解决了MARL中的非平稳性和信用分配问题。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved strong performance in
cooperative adversarial tasks. However, most existing methods typically train
agents against fixed opponent strategies and rely on such meta-static
difficulty conditions, which limits their adaptability to changing environments
and often leads to suboptimal policies. Inspired by the success of curriculum
learning (CL) in supervised tasks, we propose a dynamic CL framework for MARL
that employs an self-adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism. This mechanism
continuously modulates opponent strength based on real-time agent training
performance, allowing agents to progressively learn from easier to more
challenging scenarios. However, the dynamic nature of CL introduces instability
due to nonstationary environments and sparse global rewards. To address this
challenge, we develop a Counterfactual Group Relative Policy Advantage (CGRPA),
which is tightly coupled with the curriculum by providing intrinsic credit
signals that reflect each agent's impact under evolving task demands. CGRPA
constructs a counterfactual advantage function that isolates individual
contributions within group behavior, facilitating more reliable policy updates
throughout the curriculum. CGRPA evaluates each agent's contribution through
constructing counterfactual action advantage function, providing intrinsic
rewards that enhance credit assignment and stabilize learning under
non-stationary conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
improves both training stability and final performance, achieving competitive
results against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂分子结构和标注不一致问题上的局限性。

Method: 提出GTR-Mol-VLM框架，包含图遍历机制和忠实识别原则，并构建GTR-CoT-1.3M数据集和MolRec-Bench基准。

Result: GTR-Mol-VLM在功能组缩写场景中优于基线模型约14个百分点。

Conclusion: 该工作有望推动OCSR技术更好地满足实际需求，促进化学信息学和AI科学的发展。

Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) is crucial for digitizing
chemical knowledge by converting molecular images into machine-readable
formats. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in
this task, their image-captioning approach often struggles with complex
molecular structures and inconsistent annotations. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GTR-Mol-VLM, a novel framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) the \textit{Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought}
mechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular
graphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric
principle of \textit{Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen}, which addresses
the mismatch between abbreviated structures in images and their expanded
annotations. To support model development, we constructed GTR-CoT-1.3M, a
large-scale instruction-tuning dataset with meticulously corrected annotations,
and introduced MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark designed for a fine-grained
evaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that GTR-Mol-VLM achieves superior results compared to specialist
models, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial general-purpose VLMs. Notably, in
scenarios involving molecular images with functional group abbreviations,
GTR-Mol-VLM outperforms the second-best baseline by approximately 14 percentage
points, both in SMILES-based and graph-based metrics. We hope that this work
will drive OCSR technology to more effectively meet real-world needs, thereby
advancing the fields of cheminformatics and AI for Science. We will release
GTR-CoT at https://github.com/opendatalab/GTR-CoT.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM/VLM的代理框架在安全信息流、可靠性和多代理协调方面缺乏机制，SAFEFLOW旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SAFEFLOW通过信息流控制（IFC）、事务执行、冲突解决和安全调度等技术，确保数据的安全性和一致性。

Result: 实验表明，SAFEFLOW在对抗性和并发环境下显著优于现有技术，同时保持任务性能和安全性。

Conclusion: SAFEFLOW为构建可靠、安全的代理生态系统奠定了基础，推动了自主代理的前沿发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models
(VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and
multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent
frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information
flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce
SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based
agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC),
precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data
exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM
reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or
adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure
robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces
transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared
state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce
mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that
further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To
validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and
concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security
guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming
state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for
principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of
reliable autonomy.

Abstract: This paper introduces PROTEUS, a fully automated system that produces
data-driven hypotheses from raw data files. We apply PROTEUS to clinical
proteogenomics, a field where effective downstream data analysis and hypothesis
proposal is crucial for producing novel discoveries. PROTEUS uses separate
modules to simulate different stages of the scientific process, from open-ended
data exploration to specific statistical analysis and hypothesis proposal. It
formulates research directions, tools, and results in terms of relationships
between biological entities, using unified graph structures to manage complex
research processes. We applied PROTEUS to 10 clinical multiomics datasets from
published research, arriving at 360 total hypotheses. Results were evaluated
through external data validation and automatic open-ended scoring. Through
exploratory and iterative research, the system can navigate high-throughput and
heterogeneous multiomics data to arrive at hypotheses that balance reliability

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly from conversational
problem solving to addressing real-world tasks involving tool use, such as

Second, we scale up agent trajectories to construct the training data for

Method: 采用白盒应用（可修改源码）和动态代码检测技术，提供201个多样化任务，支持GPU加速和跨平台部署。

Result: 初步实验显示LLM驱动的CUA框架任务完成准确率达75.12%，验证了MCP的有效性。

Conclusion: MCPWorld有望推动下一代CUA的标准化评测，支持丰富外部工具的利用。

Abstract: (M)LLM-powered computer use agents (CUA) are emerging as a transformative
technique to automate human-computer interaction. However, existing CUA
benchmarks predominantly target GUI agents, whose evaluation methods are
susceptible to UI changes and ignore function interactions exposed by
application APIs, e.g., Model Context Protocol (MCP). To this end, we propose
MCPWorld, the first automatic CUA testbed for API, GUI, and API-GUI hybrid
agents. A key principle of MCPWorld is the use of "white-box apps", i.e., those
with source code availability and can be revised/re-compiled as needed (e.g.,
adding MCP support), with two notable advantages:
  (1) It greatly broadens the design space of CUA, such as what and how the app
features to be exposed/extracted as CUA-callable APIs.
  (2) It allows MCPWorld to programmatically verify task completion by directly
monitoring application behavior through techniques like dynamic code
instrumentation, offering robust, accurate CUA evaluation decoupled from
specific agent implementations or UI states.
  Currently, MCPWorld includes 201 well curated and annotated user tasks,
covering diversified use cases and difficulty levels. MCPWorld is also fully
containerized with GPU acceleration support for flexible adoption on different
OS/hardware environments. Our preliminary experiments, using a representative
LLM-powered CUA framework, achieve 75.12% task completion accuracy,
simultaneously providing initial evidence on the practical effectiveness of
agent automation leveraging MCP. Overall, we anticipate MCPWorld to facilitate
and standardize the benchmarking of next-generation computer use agents that
can leverage rich external tools. Our code and dataset are publicly available

Conclusion: 旨在推动早期训练评估策略设计，使基础LLM研究更系统化，吸引多学科参与。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks have proven effective for assessing the performance of
fully trained large language models. However, we find striking differences in
the early training stages of small models, where benchmarks often fail to
provide meaningful or discriminative signals. To explore how these differences
arise, this competition tackles the challenge of designing scientific knowledge
evaluation tasks specifically tailored for measuring early training progress of
language models. Participants are invited to develop novel evaluation
methodologies or adapt existing benchmarks to better capture performance
differences among language models. To support this effort, we provide three
pre-trained small models (0.5B, 1B, and 3B parameters), along with intermediate
checkpoints sampled during training up to 200B tokens. All experiments and
development work can be run on widely available free cloud-based GPU platforms,
making participation accessible to researchers with limited computational
resources. Submissions will be evaluated based on three criteria: the quality
of the performance signal they produce, the consistency of model rankings at 1
trillion tokens of training, and their relevance to the scientific knowledge
domain. By promoting the design of tailored evaluation strategies for early
training, this competition aims to attract a broad range of participants from
various disciplines, including those who may not be machine learning experts or
have access to dedicated GPU resources. Ultimately, this initiative seeks to
make foundational LLM research more systematic and benchmark-informed from the

Method: RSafe采用两步训练：1）政策引导的逐步推理分析安全风险；2）基于规则的强化学习优化推理路径。

Result: RSafe能够根据用户指定的安全政策提供定制化防护，泛化能力优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RSafe通过推理和强化学习结合，显著提升了对未知安全威胁的防护能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities despite
deliberate safety alignment efforts, posing significant risks to users and
society. To safeguard against the risk of policy-violating content,
system-level moderation via external guard models-designed to monitor LLM
inputs and outputs and block potentially harmful content-has emerged as a
prevalent mitigation strategy. Existing approaches of training guard models
rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with
out-of-distribution threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak
attacks. To address these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive
reasoning-based safeguard that conducts guided safety reasoning to provide
robust protection within the scope of specified safety policies. RSafe operates
in two stages: 1) guided reasoning, where it analyzes safety risks of input
content through policy-guided step-by-step reasoning, and 2) reinforced
alignment, where rule-based RL optimizes its reasoning paths to align with
accurate safety prediction. This two-stage training paradigm enables RSafe to
internalize safety principles to generalize safety protection capability over
unseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios. During inference, RSafe
accepts user-specified safety policies to provide enhanced safeguards tailored
to specific safety requirements.

Conclusion: 语义时空图模型通过形式化操作和吸收态分析，为知识表示和过程建模提供了可预测且可扩展的框架，同时强调了边界信息的重要性。

Abstract: Some formal aspects of the Semantic Spacetime graph model are presented, with
reference to its use for directed knowledge representations and process
modelling. A finite $\gamma(3,4)$ representation is defined to form a closed
set of operations that can scale to any degree of semantic complexity. The
Semantic Spacetime postulates bring predictability with minimal constraints to
pathways in graphs. The ubiquitous appearance of absorbing states in any
partial graph means that a graph process leaks information. The issue is
closely associated with the issue of division by zero, which signals a loss of
closure and the need for manual injection of remedial information. The Semantic
Spacetime model (and its Promise Theory) origins help to clarify how such
absorbing states are associated with boundary information where intentionality
can enter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多目标优化算法需大量问题建模且难以适应非线性结构，LLM的引入可提升解释性、适应性和推理能力。

Method: 提出REMoH框架，结合NSGA-II与LLM生成启发式，利用聚类和搜索空间反射机制生成多样高质量启发式。

Result: 在FJSSP问题上，REMoH与现有最优方法竞争，且建模成本更低、适应性更强。

Conclusion: LLM可增强传统优化方法，在多目标场景中提供更高灵活性、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization is fundamental in complex decision-making tasks.
Traditional algorithms, while effective, often demand extensive
problem-specific modeling and struggle to adapt to nonlinear structures. Recent
advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enhanced explainability,
adaptability, and reasoning. This work proposes Reflective Evolution of
Multi-objective Heuristics (REMoH), a novel framework integrating NSGA-II with
LLM-based heuristic generation. A key innovation is a reflection mechanism that
uses clustering and search-space reflection to guide the creation of diverse,
high-quality heuristics, improving convergence and maintaining solution
diversity. The approach is evaluated on the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling
Problem (FJSSP) in-depth benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods using
three instance datasets: Dauzere, Barnes, and Brandimarte. Results demonstrate
that REMoH achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art approaches
with reduced modeling effort and enhanced adaptability. These findings
underscore the potential of LLMs to augment traditional optimization, offering
greater flexibility, interpretability, and robustness in multi-objective
scenarios.

TLDR: 提出了一种在通用认知模型（CMC）中整合元认知的统一方法，利用工作记忆中的显式表征推理代理的认知能力与过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为人类类似思维的认知架构提供元认知的整合方法，扩展CMC的功能。

Result: 展示了提案中元认知的具体实例。

Conclusion: 该方法成功整合元认知于CMC，验证了其可行性与实用性。

Abstract: The Common Model of Cognition (CMC) provides an abstract characterization of
the structure and processing required by a cognitive architecture for
human-like minds. We propose a unified approach to integrating metacognition
within the CMC. We propose that metacognition involves reasoning over explicit
representations of an agent's cognitive capabilities and processes in working
memory. Our proposal exploits the existing cognitive capabilities of the CMC,
making minimal extensions in the structure and information available within
working memory. We provide examples of metacognition within our proposal.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: Guideline Forest是一个通过从已验证示例中提取结构化推理策略（指南）并逐步执行的框架，显著提升大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法高效利用多样化的可重用推理策略，而人类推理的灵活性和适应性是当前大语言模型难以模拟的。

Method: 通过从已验证示例中提取可重用指南，扩展为多样化变体，并行执行并通过自校正逐步聚合。

Result: 在数学和编程推理的四个基准测试中，Guideline Forest显著优于现有方法（如CoT、ReAct等）。

Conclusion: Guideline Forest展示了多路径推理和逐步聚合的有效性，具有强大的适应性和泛化潜力。

Abstract: Human reasoning is flexible, adaptive, and grounded in prior
experience-qualities that large language models (LLMs) still struggle to
emulate. Existing methods either explore diverse reasoning paths at inference
time or search for optimal workflows through expensive operations, but both
fall short in leveraging multiple reusable strategies in a structured,
efficient manner. We propose Guideline Forest, a framework that enhances LLMs
reasoning by inducing structured reasoning strategies-called guidelines-from
verified examples and executing them via step-wise aggregation. Unlike
test-time search or single-path distillation, our method draws on verified
reasoning experiences by inducing reusable guidelines and expanding each into
diverse variants. Much like human reasoning, these variants reflect alternative
thought patterns, are executed in parallel, refined via self-correction, and
aggregated step by step-enabling the model to adaptively resolve uncertainty
and synthesize robust solutions.We evaluate Guideline Forest on four
benchmarks-GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, and HumanEval-spanning mathematical and
programmatic reasoning. Guideline Forest consistently outperforms strong
baselines, including CoT, ReAct, ToT, FoT, and AFlow. Ablation studies further
highlight the effectiveness of multi-path reasoning and stepwise aggregation,
underscoring the Guideline Forest's adaptability and generalization potential.

Result: 模型的计算过程分为四个阶段：公式结构解码、核心计算特征提取、数字抽象生成和最终内容组织，显示出分层计算特性。

Conclusion: 模型倾向于内部计算而非机械记忆，支持分层计算机制。代码和数据已公开以便复现。

Abstract: Multi-digit addition is a clear probe of the computational power of large
language models. To dissect the internal arithmetic processes in
LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, we combine linear probing with logit-lens inspection.
Inspired by the step-by-step manner in which humans perform addition, we
propose and analyze a coherent four-stage trajectory in the forward
pass:Formula-structure representations become linearly decodable first, while
the answer token is still far down the candidate list.Core computational
features then emerge prominently.At deeper activation layers, numerical
abstractions of the result become clearer, enabling near-perfect detection and
decoding of the individual digits in the sum.Near the output, the model
organizes and generates the final content, with the correct token reliably
occupying the top rank.This trajectory suggests a hierarchical process that
favors internal computation over rote memorization. We release our code and
data to facilitate reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在特定领域表现不佳，主要由于缺乏领域特定数据，如医学超声领域的图像-文本数据。

Method: 设计了一种从领域特定材料生成四元组（图像、问题、思考轨迹、答案）的数据生成流程，并构建了ReMUD数据集。

Result: ReMUD-7B模型在医学超声领域表现优于通用领域模型，数据集包含超过45,000条数据。

Conclusion: ReMUD解决了特定领域数据短缺问题，相关资源将开源以促进研究。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in
general domains but perform poorly in some specific domains due to a lack of
domain-specific data, such as image-text data or vedio-text data. In some
specific domains, there is abundant graphic and textual data scattered around,
but lacks standardized arrangement. In the field of medical ultrasound, there
are ultrasonic diagnostic books, ultrasonic clinical guidelines, ultrasonic
diagnostic reports, and so on. However, these ultrasonic materials are often
saved in the forms of PDF, images, etc., and cannot be directly used for the
training of MLLMs. This paper proposes a novel image-text reasoning supervised
fine-tuning data generation pipeline to create specific domain quadruplets
(image, question, thinking trace, and answer) from domain-specific materials. A
medical ultrasound domain dataset ReMUD is established, containing over 45,000
reasoning and non-reasoning supervised fine-tuning Question Answering (QA) and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) data. The ReMUD-7B model, fine-tuned on
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, outperforms general-domain MLLMs in medical ultrasound
field. To facilitate research, the ReMUD dataset, data generation codebase, and
ReMUD-7B parameters will be released at https://github.com/ShiDaizi/ReMUD,
addressing the data shortage issue in specific domain MLLMs.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种扩展FRBRoo框架的结构化时间模型，用于细粒度跟踪法律规范的演变，解决了现有标准在组件级版本控制上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律文档建模框架（如FRBR/FRBRoo和Akoma Ntoso）缺乏对法律规范细粒度、组件级版本控制的支持，影响了法律文本的确定性时间点重构能力。

Method: 提出了一种结构化时间模型，扩展FRBRoo框架，引入Temporal Version (TV)、Language Version (LV)等子类，并分层应用以跟踪法律组件（如条款、段落）的生命周期。

Result: 以巴西联邦宪法为例，展示了模型如何精确记录法律条款的时间变化，实现确定性检索和重构。

Conclusion: 该模型为开发高级法律信息系统和AI工具提供了基础，克服了现有生成模型的局限性。

Abstract: Effectively representing legal norms for automated processing is a critical
challenge, particularly in tracking the diachronic evolution of their
hierarchical components (e.g., articles, paragraphs). While foundational
frameworks like FRBR/FRBRoo and standards like Akoma Ntoso model legal
documents at a macro level, they lack native mechanisms for granular,
component-level versioning. This limitation hinders the deterministic
point-in-time reconstruction of legal texts, a fundamental capability for
reliable Legal Tech and AI applications. This paper proposes a structured,
temporal model that extends the FRBRoo framework to address this gap. It
introduces specialized subclasses of Expressio - Temporal Version (TV) and
Language Version (LV - to represent the state of a legal norm and its
linguistic variations at specific points in time. The model applies this same
paradigm hierarchically, introducing Component Work (CW), Component Temporal
Version (CTV), and Component Language Version (CLV) to track the lifecycle of
individual articles, paragraphs, and clauses. Using the Brazilian Federal
Constitution as a case study, the paper demonstrates how each amendment creates
new Component Temporal Versions for affected provisions, while unaffected
components retain their existing versions. This fine-grained, time-aware
architecture enables the precise, deterministic retrieval and reconstruction of
any part of a legal text as it existed on a specific date. The model provides a
robust foundation for developing advanced legal information systems, knowledge
graphs, and AI tools capable of accurate historical analysis and impact
assessment, overcoming the limitations of current generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现代LLMs是否具备解决传统AI无法解决的框架问题和符号接地问题的认知能力。

Method: 设计两个基准任务，零样本条件下测试13种LLMs，评估其输出质量。

Result: 开源模型表现不一，部分封闭模型表现稳定且高分。

Conclusion: 部分现代LLMs可能具备解决长期理论挑战的能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revitalized
philosophical debates surrounding artificial intelligence. Two of the most
fundamental challenges - namely, the Frame Problem and the Symbol Grounding
Problem - have historically been viewed as unsolvable within traditional
symbolic AI systems. This study investigates whether modern LLMs possess the
cognitive capacities required to address these problems. To do so, I designed
two benchmark tasks reflecting the philosophical core of each problem,
administered them under zero-shot conditions to 13 prominent LLMs (both closed
and open-source), and assessed the quality of the models' outputs across five
trials each. Responses were scored along multiple criteria, including
contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering. The
results demonstrate that while open-source models showed variability in
performance due to differences in model size, quantization, and instruction
tuning, several closed models consistently achieved high scores. These findings
suggest that select modern LLMs may be acquiring capacities sufficient to
produce meaningful and stable responses to these long-standing theoretical
challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文提出LUCIFER框架，结合分层决策架构、强化学习和大型语言模型，以解决动态环境中自主决策的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中，先验知识与现实环境的快速脱节限制了自主决策的有效性，而人类领域专家的实时观察和上下文知识未被充分利用。

Method: LUCIFER框架整合分层决策架构、强化学习和LLMs，LLMs扮演上下文提取器和零样本探索引导者双重角色。

Result: 实验表明，LUCIFER在探索效率和决策质量上优于传统方法，验证了上下文驱动决策的潜力。

Conclusion: LUCIFER展示了结合人类上下文知识提升自主系统性能的有效性，为动态环境中的决策提供了新思路。

Abstract: In dynamic environments, the rapid obsolescence of pre-existing environmental
knowledge creates a gap between an agent's internal model and the evolving
reality of its operational context. This disparity between prior and updated
environmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous
decision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain
stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time
observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and
context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains
an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding
and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a
domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making
architecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs)
into a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex
tasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each
focused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike
traditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER
integrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring
verbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence
decision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived
insights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration
facilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.
We benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves
exploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat,
goal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven
decision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge
for operational success.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种非正式但可验证的不等式证明任务，并发布了IneqMath数据集，揭示了当前大型语言模型在严格证明中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不等式证明是数学和科学中的重要领域，但现有数据集稀缺或形式化，限制了研究进展。

Method: 将不等式证明分为两个可自动检查的子任务：边界估计和关系预测，并开发了LLM-as-judge评估框架。

Result: 评估29个领先LLM发现，即使顶级模型在逐步审查下准确率不足10%，揭示了证明构造的薄弱环节。

Conclusion: 模型规模和计算资源对证明正确性提升有限，未来研究方向包括定理引导推理和自我优化。

Abstract: Inequality proving, crucial across diverse scientific and mathematical
fields, tests advanced reasoning skills such as discovering tight bounds and
strategic theorem application. This makes it a distinct, demanding frontier for
large language models (LLMs), offering insights beyond general mathematical
problem-solving. Progress in this area is hampered by existing datasets that
are often scarce, synthetic, or rigidly formal. We address this by proposing an
informal yet verifiable task formulation, recasting inequality proving into two
automatically checkable subtasks: bound estimation and relation prediction.
Building on this, we release IneqMath, an expert-curated dataset of
Olympiad-level inequalities, including a test set and training corpus enriched
with step-wise solutions and theorem annotations. We also develop a novel
LLM-as-judge evaluation framework, combining a final-answer judge with four
step-wise judges designed to detect common reasoning flaws. A systematic
evaluation of 29 leading LLMs on IneqMath reveals a surprising reality: even
top models like o1 achieve less than 10% overall accuracy under step-wise
scrutiny; this is a drop of up to 65.5% from their accuracy considering only
final answer equivalence. This discrepancy exposes fragile deductive chains and
a critical gap for current LLMs between merely finding an answer and
constructing a rigorous proof. Scaling model size and increasing test-time
computation yield limited gains in overall proof correctness. Instead, our
findings highlight promising research directions such as theorem-guided
reasoning and self-refinement. Code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AutoML平台依赖单一优化策略，仅探索部分可行超参数配置，限制了性能提升。

Method: Gradients将超参数优化转化为竞争性市场，独立矿工通过经济激励竞争发现最优配置。

Result: 在180个实验中，Gradients对HuggingFace AutoTrain的胜率为82.8%，对其他平台的胜率为100%，平均性能提升11.8%-42.1%。

Conclusion: 经济驱动的竞争性方法能系统性发现集中式AutoML遗漏的优越配置。

Abstract: Foundation model fine-tuning faces a fundamental challenge: existing AutoML
platforms rely on single optimisation strategies that explore only a fraction
of viable hyperparameter configurations. In this white paper, We introduce
Gradients, a decentralised AutoML platform that transforms hyperparameter
optimisation into a competitive marketplace where independent miners compete to
discover optimal configurations. Economic incentives align individual
exploration with collective optimisation goals, driving systematic
investigation of hyperparameter regions that centralised methods miss. We
evaluate our approach across 180 controlled experiments spanning diverse model
architectures (70M to 70B parameters) and task types. Gradients achieves an
82.8\% win rate against HuggingFace AutoTrain and 100\% against TogetherAI,
Databricks, and Google Cloud, with mean improvements of 11.8\% and 42.1\%
respectively. Complex reasoning and retrieval tasks show particularly strong
gains of 30-40\%, whilst diffusion models achieve 23.4\% improvements for
person-specific generation. These results demonstrate that competitive,
economically-driven approaches can systematically discover superior
configurations that centralised AutoML consistently miss.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在图像-文本对齐上表现不佳，且现有方法依赖外部监督，仅解决单向任务。

Result: 在视觉理解和生成任务上显著提升性能，尤其在文本到图像任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 自监督双奖励机制有效提升了多模态模型的理解与生成能力，无需外部监督。

Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models
(LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework.
However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate image-text alignment, prone to
generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow
the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision
(e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional
tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the
observation that understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, we
introduce a self-supervised dual reward mechanism to reinforce the
understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs. Specifically, we sample
multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the
input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood of the model as self-rewards
for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the
performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving
remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话AI代理的基准测试仅模拟单控制环境，而现实场景（如技术支持）需要用户主动参与修改共享世界状态。

Method: 1) 提出电信双控制领域模型（Dec-POMDP）；2) 设计组合任务生成器；3) 开发可靠用户模拟器；4) 通过多维度分析代理性能。

Result: 实验显示，代理在双控制环境中性能显著下降，突显了引导用户的挑战。

Conclusion: $	au^2$-bench为需要有效推理和引导用户行为的代理提供了可控测试平台。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for conversational AI agents simulate single-control
environments, where only the AI agent can use tools to interact with the world,
while the user remains a passive information provider. This differs from
real-world scenarios like technical support, where users need to actively
participate in modifying the state of the (shared) world. In order to address
this gap, we introduce $\tau^2$-bench, with four key contributions:
  1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both
agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that
tests both agent coordination and communication,
  2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse,
verifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and
controlled complexity,
  3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose
behavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation
fidelity,
  4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations
including separating errors arising from reasoning vs
communication/coordination.
  In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents
shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding
users. Overall, $\tau^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents that
must both reason effectively and guide user actions.

Conclusion: GUI-Reflection为更强大、适应性更强的GUI自动化铺平道路，所有资源将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in
revolutionizing Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. However, existing
GUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories,
thus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates
self-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal
GUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training,
offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning.
GUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated
data generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation.
Specifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically
construct reflection and error correction data from existing successful
trajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI
understanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and
evaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a
diverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of
GUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection
tuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to
continuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our
framework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities,
paving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with
all data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.

Abstract: Global population aging presents increasing challenges to healthcare systems,
with coronary artery disease (CAD) responsible for approximately 17.8 million
deaths annually, making it a leading cause of global mortality. As CAD is
largely preventable, early detection and proactive management are essential. In
this work, we introduce DigitalShadow, an advanced early warning system for

on 21 million facial images and subsequently fine-tuned into LiveCAD, a
specialized CAD risk assessment model trained on 7,004 facial images from 1,751
subjects across four hospitals in China. DigitalShadow functions passively and
contactlessly, extracting facial features from live video streams without
requiring active user engagement. Integrated with a personalized database, it
generates natural language risk reports and individualized health
recommendations. With privacy as a core design principle, DigitalShadow
supports local deployment to ensure secure handling of user data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Transformer模型在计算机视觉任务中的成功应用，研究其在医学图像（如皮肤病诊断）中的对抗性脆弱性具有重要意义。

Method: 使用投影梯度下降（PGD）生成对抗性水印，测试ViT和CNN的脆弱性，并评估对抗训练的效果。

Result: ViT对对抗性攻击非常脆弱（准确率下降至27.6%），但对抗训练能显著提升其鲁棒性（准确率恢复至90.0%）。

Conclusion: ViT在医学图像中易受对抗性攻击，但对抗训练是一种有效的防御手段。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown remarkable success in dermatological image
analysis, offering potential for automated skin disease diagnosis. Previously,
convolutional neural network(CNN) based architectures have achieved immense
popularity and success in computer vision (CV) based task like skin image
recognition, generation and video analysis. But with the emergence of
transformer based models, CV tasks are now are nowadays carrying out using
these models. Vision Transformers (ViTs) is such a transformer-based models
that have shown success in computer vision. It uses self-attention mechanisms
to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, their
reliance on global attention mechanisms makes them susceptible to adversarial
perturbations. This paper aims to investigate the susceptibility of ViTs for
medical images to adversarial watermarking-a method that adds so-called
imperceptible perturbations in order to fool models. By generating adversarial
watermarks through Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), we examine the
transferability of such attacks to CNNs and analyze the performance defense
mechanism -- adversarial training. Results indicate that while performance is
not compromised for clean images, ViTs certainly become much more vulnerable to
adversarial attacks: an accuracy drop of as low as 27.6%. Nevertheless,
adversarial training raises it up to 90.0%.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于RGB智能手机摄像头的远程健身追踪系统，具有隐私性、可扩展性和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有健身监督模型要么运动种类有限，要么过于复杂，难以实际部署。

Method: 开发了一种多任务运动分析模型，结合大规模健身数据集Olympia，支持数百种运动的检测和重复计数。

Result: 模型在Olympia数据集上运动检测准确率为76.5%，重复计数准确率为85.3%。

Conclusion: 通过单一视觉语言模型实现运动识别和计数，推动了AI健身追踪的普及。

Abstract: We introduce a fitness tracking system that enables remote monitoring for
exercises using only a RGB smartphone camera, making fitness tracking more
private, scalable, and cost effective. Although prior work explored automated
exercise supervision, existing models are either too limited in exercise
variety or too complex for real-world deployment. Prior approaches typically
focus on a small set of exercises and fail to generalize across diverse
movements. In contrast, we develop a robust, multitask motion analysis model
capable of performing exercise detection and repetition counting across
hundreds of exercises, a scale far beyond previous methods. We overcome
previous data limitations by assembling a large-scale fitness dataset, Olympia
covering more than 1,900 exercises. To our knowledge, our vision-language model
is the first that can perform multiple tasks on skeletal fitness data. On
Olympia, our model can detect exercises with 76.5% accuracy and count
repetitions with 85.3% off-by-one accuracy, using only RGB video. By presenting
a single vision-language transformer model for both exercise identification and
rep counting, we take a significant step toward democratizing AI-powered
fitness tracking.

*Mingqi Jiang,Chanho Kim,Chen Ziwen,Li Fuxin*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种通用的基于高斯溅射（GS）的语义SLAM算法，通过学习网络从RGB-D视频流中增量构建和更新3D场景表示，解决了现有GS方法依赖场景优化且泛化性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM算法生成的地图分辨率低且不完整，而现有GS方法依赖场景优化且泛化性差，需要一种更高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: 使用RGB-D图像识别主干网络预测高斯参数，并集成3D语义分割，通过1次迭代优化解决定位漂移和浮动问题。

Result: 在ScanNet上实现了最先进的语义SLAM性能，高斯数量比其他GS方法少一个数量级，并在NYUv2和TUM RGB-D数据集上展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过通用网络和高效优化策略，显著提升了GS在语义SLAM中的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Traditional SLAM algorithms are excellent at camera tracking but might
generate lower resolution and incomplete 3D maps. Recently, Gaussian Splatting
(GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map
building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene
optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes
well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM
algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from
an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach
starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian
parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location.
Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS
framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To
correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for
only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of
magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and
showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to
the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.

Conclusion: 多模态模型整合对细粒度视听分割有效。

Abstract: Audiovisual segmentation (AVS) aims to identify visual regions corresponding
to sound sources, playing a vital role in video understanding, surveillance,
and human-computer interaction. Traditional AVS methods depend on large-scale
pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To
address this, we propose a novel zero-shot AVS framework that eliminates
task-specific training by leveraging multiple pretrained models. Our approach
integrates audio, vision, and text representations to bridge modality gaps,
enabling precise sound source segmentation without AVS-specific annotations. We
systematically explore different strategies for connecting pretrained models
and evaluate their efficacy across multiple datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot AVS
performance, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal model integration for
finegrained audiovisual segmentation.

Motivation: 确保交通标志识别DNN模型在训练过程中不被攻击或中毒，提高模型安全性。

Method: 通过误差最小化攻击测试模型鲁棒性，提出数据增强训练方法，并设计检测模型识别中毒数据。

Result: 攻击使模型准确率从99.9%降至10.6%，但提出的方法恢复至96.05%，检测模型识别成功率超99%。

Conclusion: 需采用先进训练方法增强DNN在交通标志识别中的安全性，抵御数据中毒攻击。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for traffic sign recognition
because they can automatically extract high-level features from images. These
DNNs are trained on large-scale datasets obtained from unknown sources.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the models remain secure and are not
compromised or poisoned during training. In this paper, we investigate the
robustness of DNNs trained for traffic sign recognition. First, we perform the
error-minimizing attacks on DNNs used for traffic sign recognition by adding
imperceptible perturbations on training data. Then, we propose a data
augmentation-based training method to mitigate the error-minimizing attacks.
The proposed training method utilizes nonlinear transformations to disrupt the
perturbations and improve the model robustness. We experiment with two
well-known traffic sign datasets to demonstrate the severity of the attack and
the effectiveness of our mitigation scheme. The error-minimizing attacks reduce
the prediction accuracy of the DNNs from 99.90% to 10.6%. However, our
mitigation scheme successfully restores the prediction accuracy to 96.05%.
Moreover, our approach outperforms adversarial training in mitigating the
error-minimizing attacks. Furthermore, we propose a detection model capable of
identifying poisoned data even when the perturbations are imperceptible to
human inspection. Our detection model achieves a success rate of over 99% in
identifying the attack. This research highlights the need to employ advanced
training methods for DNNs in traffic sign recognition systems to mitigate the
effects of data poisoning attacks.

Result: 分类任务准确率达81.25%，分割任务mIoU为0.90。

Conclusion: 研究表明，RGB图像结合现代深度学习技术可用于自动化纺织品回收的关键分析步骤。

Abstract: Automated sorting is crucial for improving the efficiency and scalability of
textile recycling, but accurately identifying material composition and
detecting contaminants from sensor data remains challenging. This paper
investigates the use of standard RGB imagery, a cost-effective sensing
modality, for key pre-processing tasks in an automated system. We present
computer vision components designed for a conveyor belt setup to perform (a)
classification of four common textile types and (b) segmentation of non-textile
features such as buttons and zippers. For classification, several pre-trained
architectures were evaluated using transfer learning and cross-validation, with
EfficientNetB0 achieving the best performance on a held-out test set with
81.25\% accuracy. For feature segmentation, a zero-shot approach combining the
Grounding DINO open-vocabulary detector with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
was employed, demonstrating excellent performance with a mIoU of 0.90 for the
generated masks against ground truth. This study demonstrates the feasibility
of using RGB images coupled with modern deep learning techniques, including
transfer learning for classification and foundation models for zero-shot
segmentation, to enable essential analysis steps for automated textile
recycling pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监控系统因低质量图像和视频导致人脸识别准确性下降，且AI模型存在肤色和遮挡偏见，数据集缺乏多样性。

Result: 在CelebA数据集上验证，平台提升了训练数据多样性和模型公平性。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了AI人脸分析的偏见，提升了监控系统在复杂环境中的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Surveillance systems play a critical role in security and reconnaissance, but
their performance is often compromised by low-quality images and videos,
leading to reduced accuracy in face recognition. Additionally, existing
AI-based facial analysis models suffer from biases related to skin tone
variations and partially occluded faces, further limiting their effectiveness
in diverse real-world scenarios. These challenges are the results of data
limitations and imbalances, where available training datasets lack sufficient
diversity, resulting in unfair and unreliable facial recognition performance.
To address these issues, we propose a data-driven platform that enhances
surveillance capabilities by generating synthetic training data tailored to
compensate for dataset biases. Our approach leverages deep learning-based
facial attribute manipulation and reconstruction using autoencoders and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create diverse and high-quality
facial datasets. Additionally, our system integrates an image enhancement
module, improving the clarity of low-resolution or occluded faces in
surveillance footage. We evaluate our approach using the CelebA dataset,
demonstrating that the proposed platform enhances both training data diversity
and model fairness. This work contributes to reducing bias in AI-based facial
analysis and improving surveillance accuracy in challenging environments,
leading to fairer and more reliable security applications.

TLDR: EV-LayerSegNet是一种自监督CNN，用于事件相机的运动分割，通过分层场景动态表示学习光流和分割掩码，并利用去模糊质量作为自监督损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在运动任务中表现优异，但获取真实标签昂贵且困难，因此需要自监督方法。

Method: 提出EV-LayerSegNet，通过分层表示分别学习仿射光流和分割掩码，并利用去模糊质量作为自监督损失。

Result: 在模拟数据集上，IoU和检测率分别达到71%和87%。

Conclusion: EV-LayerSegNet在自监督条件下有效解决了事件相机的运动分割问题。

Abstract: Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that capture motion dynamics
with much higher temporal resolution than traditional cameras, since pixels
react asynchronously to brightness changes. They are therefore better suited
for tasks involving motion such as motion segmentation. However, training
event-based networks still represents a difficult challenge, as obtaining
ground truth is very expensive, error-prone and limited in frequency. In this
article, we introduce EV-LayerSegNet, a self-supervised CNN for event-based
motion segmentation. Inspired by a layered representation of the scene
dynamics, we show that it is possible to learn affine optical flow and
segmentation masks separately, and use them to deblur the input events. The
deblurring quality is then measured and used as self-supervised learning loss.
We train and test the network on a simulated dataset with only affine motion,
achieving IoU and detection rate up to 71% and 87% respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗视觉语言模型在泛化性、透明性和计算效率方面存在局限，阻碍了其在资源受限环境中的实际应用。

Method: 采用低秩适应（Low-Rank Adaptation）和自定义奖励函数微调轻量级基础模型Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct，结合诊断准确性和推理质量进行训练。

Result: RARL在医疗图像分析和临床推理任务中显著优于监督微调（提升7.78%），并在未见数据集上表现更优（提升27%）。

Conclusion: 推理引导学习和推理提示能有效提升医疗视觉语言模型的透明性、准确性和资源效率。

Abstract: The growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical
applications offers promising support for diagnostic reasoning. However,
current medical VLMs often face limitations in generalization, transparency,
and computational efficiency-barriers that hinder deployment in real-world,
resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
Reasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, \textbf{RARL}, that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of medical VLMs while remaining efficient and
adaptable to low-resource environments. Our approach fine-tunes a lightweight
base model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward
functions that jointly consider diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality.
Training is performed on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU, demonstrating the
feasibility of deploying such models in constrained environments. We evaluate
the model using an LLM-as-judge framework that scores both correctness and
explanation quality. Experimental results show that RARL significantly improves
VLM performance in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning, outperforming
supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-focused tasks by approximately 7.78%, while
requiring fewer computational resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the
generalization capabilities of our approach on unseen datasets, achieving
around 27% improved performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and about 4%
over traditional RL fine-tuning. Our experiments also illustrate that diversity
prompting during training and reasoning prompting during inference are crucial
for enhancing VLM performance. Our findings highlight the potential of
reasoning-guided learning and reasoning prompting to steer medical VLMs toward
more transparent, accurate, and resource-efficient clinical decision-making.
Code and data are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进零样本CIR在FashionIQ基准上的低召回率（20-25% Recall@10）。

Method: 1. 微调BLIP-2，使用轻量级Q-Former融合视觉和文本特征。2. 尝试Retrieval-DPO方法，优化CLIP文本编码器。

Result: BLIP-2方法显著提升召回率（Recall@10达45.6%），Retrieval-DPO方法表现不佳（仅0.02% Recall@10）。

Conclusion: 有效的基于偏好的CIR需要多模态融合、排名感知目标和高质量负样本。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) allows a user to locate a target image by
applying a fine-grained textual edit (e.g., ``turn the dress blue'' or ``remove
stripes'') to a reference image. Zero-shot CIR, which embeds the image and the
text with separate pretrained vision-language encoders, reaches only 20-25\%
Recall@10 on the FashionIQ benchmark. We improve this by fine-tuning BLIP-2
with a lightweight Q-Former that fuses visual and textual features into a
single embedding, raising Recall@10 to 45.6\% (shirt), 40.1\% (dress), and
50.4\% (top-tee) and increasing the average Recall@50 to 67.6\%. We also
examine Retrieval-DPO, which fine-tunes CLIP's text encoder with a Direct
Preference Optimization loss applied to FAISS-mined hard negatives. Despite
extensive tuning of the scaling factor, index, and sampling strategy,
Retrieval-DPO attains only 0.02\% Recall@10 -- far below zero-shot and
prompt-tuned baselines -- because it (i) lacks joint image-text fusion, (ii)
uses a margin objective misaligned with top-$K$ metrics, (iii) relies on
low-quality negatives, and (iv) keeps the vision and Transformer layers frozen.
Our results show that effective preference-based CIR requires genuine
multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives, and carefully curated negatives.

Conclusion: PhysLab有望推动细粒度视觉解析、智能课堂系统的发展，并促进计算机视觉与教育技术的融合。

Abstract: Visual parsing of images and videos is critical for a wide range of
real-world applications. However, progress in this field is constrained by
limitations of existing datasets: (1) insufficient annotation granularity,
which impedes fine-grained scene understanding and high-level reasoning; (2)
limited coverage of domains, particularly a lack of datasets tailored for
educational scenarios; and (3) lack of explicit procedural guidance, with
minimal logical rules and insufficient representation of structured task
process. To address these gaps, we introduce PhysLab, the first video dataset
that captures students conducting complex physics experiments. The dataset
includes four representative experiments that feature diverse scientific
instruments and rich human-object interaction (HOI) patterns. PhysLab comprises
620 long-form videos and provides multilevel annotations that support a variety
of vision tasks, including action recognition, object detection, HOI analysis,
etc. We establish strong baselines and perform extensive evaluations to
highlight key challenges in the parsing of procedural educational videos. We
expect PhysLab to serve as a valuable resource for advancing fine-grained
visual parsing, facilitating intelligent classroom systems, and fostering
closer integration between computer vision and educational technologies. The
dataset and the evaluation toolkit are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有深度估计方法通常依赖多张图像，而单张散焦图像深度估计因问题欠约束而研究较少。本文旨在通过暗通道先验提升单张图像深度估计性能。

Method: 结合局部散焦模糊与对比度变化作为深度线索，采用对抗训练实现端到端深度估计。

Result: 在真实数据上的实验表明，引入暗通道先验能有效提升单张图像深度估计的准确性。

Conclusion: 暗通道先验在单张散焦图像深度估计中具有显著效果，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the dark channel as a complementary cue to estimate
the depth of a scene from a single space-variant defocus blurred image due to
its effectiveness in implicitly capturing the local statistics of blurred
images and the scene structure. Existing depth-from-defocus (DFD) techniques
typically rely on multiple images with varying apertures or focus settings to
recover depth information. Very few attempts have focused on DFD from a single
defocused image due to the underconstrained nature of the problem. Our method
capitalizes on the relationship between local defocus blur and contrast
variations as key depth cues to enhance the overall performance in estimating
the scene's structure. The entire pipeline is trained adversarially in a fully
end-to-end fashion. Experiments conducted on real data with realistic
depth-induced defocus blur demonstrate that incorporating dark channel prior
into single image DFD yields meaningful depth estimation results, validating
the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: PGHM为单目化身创建提供了高效且高质量的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Photorealistic and animatable human avatars are a key enabler for
virtual/augmented reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While
recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved rendering
quality and efficiency, existing methods still face fundamental challenges,
including time-consuming per-subject optimization and poor generalization under
sparse monocular inputs. In this work, we present the Parametric Gaussian Human
Model (PGHM), a generalizable and efficient framework that integrates human
priors into 3DGS for fast and high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from
monocular videos. PGHM introduces two core components: (1) a UV-aligned latent
identity map that compactly encodes subject-specific geometry and appearance
into a learnable feature tensor; and (2) a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net that
predicts Gaussian attributes by decomposing static, pose-dependent, and
view-dependent components via conditioned decoders. This design enables robust
rendering quality under challenging poses and viewpoints, while allowing
efficient subject adaptation without requiring multi-view capture or long
optimization time. Experiments show that PGHM is significantly more efficient
than optimization-from-scratch methods, requiring only approximately 20 minutes
per subject to produce avatars with comparable visual quality, thereby
demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world monocular avatar
creation.

TLDR: Flood-DamageSense是一种深度学习框架，专门用于建筑物级别的洪水损害评估，融合多模态数据，显著提升了损害分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在洪水损害分类中表现不佳，尤其是在损害特征不明显时。Flood-DamageSense旨在填补这一空白，提供更可靠的损害评估。

Method: 模型结合了SAR/InSAR数据、高分辨率光学底图和洪水风险层，采用多模态Mamba架构，预测损害状态、洪水范围和建筑物轮廓。

Result: 在Hurricane Harvey数据上，模型比现有方法F1分数提高了19个百分点，尤其在“轻微”和“中等”损害类别中表现突出。

Conclusion: Flood-DamageSense通过风险感知建模和SAR数据，为灾后决策提供了更快、更精细的损害情报。

Abstract: Most post-disaster damage classifiers succeed only when destructive forces
leave clear spectral or structural signatures -- conditions rarely present
after inundation. Consequently, existing models perform poorly at identifying
flood-related building damages. The model presented in this study,
Flood-DamageSense, addresses this gap as the first deep-learning framework
purpose-built for building-level flood-damage assessment. The architecture
fuses pre- and post-event SAR/InSAR scenes with very-high-resolution optical
basemaps and an inherent flood-risk layer that encodes long-term exposure
probabilities, guiding the network toward plausibly affected structures even
when compositional change is minimal. A multimodal Mamba backbone with a
semi-Siamese encoder and task-specific decoders jointly predicts (1) graded
building-damage states, (2) floodwater extent, and (3) building footprints.
Training and evaluation on Hurricane Harvey (2017) imagery from Harris County,
Texas -- supported by insurance-derived property-damage extents -- show a mean
F1 improvement of up to 19 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines,
with the largest gains in the frequently misclassified "minor" and "moderate"
damage categories. Ablation studies identify the inherent-risk feature as the
single most significant contributor to this performance boost. An end-to-end
post-processing pipeline converts pixel-level outputs to actionable,
building-scale damage maps within minutes of image acquisition. By combining
risk-aware modeling with SAR's all-weather capability, Flood-DamageSense
delivers faster, finer-grained, and more reliable flood-damage intelligence to
support post-disaster decision-making and resource allocation.

Abstract: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life,
affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise
in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the
primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address
the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade
embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer,
yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images
provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we
introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for
classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN)
and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM.
Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo
classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

Abstract: Omnidirectional image and video super-resolution is a crucial research topic
in low-level vision, playing an essential role in virtual reality and augmented
reality applications. Its goal is to reconstruct high-resolution images or
video frames from low-resolution inputs, thereby enhancing detail preservation
and enabling more accurate scene analysis and interpretation. In recent years,
numerous innovative and effective approaches have been proposed, predominantly
based on deep learning techniques, involving diverse network architectures,
loss functions, projection strategies, and training datasets. This paper
presents a systematic review of recent progress in omnidirectional image and
video super-resolution, focusing on deep learning-based methods. Given that
existing datasets predominantly rely on synthetic degradation and fall short in
capturing real-world distortions, we introduce a new dataset, 360Insta, that
comprises authentically degraded omnidirectional images and videos collected
under diverse conditions, including varying lighting, motion, and exposure
settings. This dataset addresses a critical gap in current omnidirectional
benchmarks and enables more robust evaluation of the generalization
capabilities of omnidirectional super-resolution methods. We conduct
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of existing methods on
both public datasets and our proposed dataset. Furthermore, we provide a
systematic overview of the current status of research and discuss promising
directions for future exploration. All datasets, methods, and evaluation

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了基于双曲平均曲率流的主动轮廓模型（HMCF-ACMs）和双模式正则化流驱动的主动轮廓模型（HDRF-ACMs），通过可调初始速度场和边缘感知力调制，提升了图像分割的精度和抗噪性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的抛物线平均曲率流驱动的主动轮廓模型（PMCF-ACMs）对初始曲线配置依赖性强，限制了其适应性。本文旨在通过引入双曲平均曲率流，解决这一问题。

Method: 提出HMCF-ACMs和HDRF-ACMs，利用可调初始速度场和边缘感知力调制，并通过优化的加权四阶Runge-Kutta算法求解相关波动方程。

Result: 实验表明，HMCF-ACMs和HDRF-ACMs在噪声抵抗和数值稳定性方面表现优异，能够实现更精确的分割。

Conclusion: HMCF-ACMs和HDRF-ACMs通过任务自适应的初始速度和轮廓配置，显著提升了图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Parabolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (PMCF-ACMs) are
widely used in image segmentation, which however depend heavily on the
selection of initial curve configurations. In this paper, we firstly propose
several hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs), which introduce
tunable initial velocity fields, enabling adaptive optimization for diverse
segmentation scenarios. We shall prove that HMCF-ACMs are indeed normal flows
and establish the numerical equivalence between dissipative HMCF formulations
and certain wave equations using the level set method with signed distance
function. Building on this framework, we furthermore develop hyperbolic
dual-mode regularized flow-driven ACMs (HDRF-ACMs), which utilize smooth
Heaviside functions for edge-aware force modulation to suppress over-diffusion
near weak boundaries. Then, we optimize a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta
algorithm with nine-point stencil spatial discretization when solving the
above-mentioned wave equations. Experiments show that both HMCF-ACMs and
HDRF-ACMs could achieve more precise segmentations with superior noise
resistance and numerical stability due to task-adaptive configurations of
initial velocities and initial contours.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人类与野生动物冲突需要准确识别潜在威胁物种，但现有分类模型在未知类别上表现不佳，因此研究OOD检测方法。

Method: 采用参数化NCM和非参数对比学习方法，利用预训练和投影特征，并与文献中常见OOD方法进行比较。

Result: 基于特征的方法在泛化能力上表现更强，NCM结合ImageNet预训练特征在AUPR-IN、AUPR-OUT和AUTC指标上分别提升2%、4%和22%。

Conclusion: 特征方法在野生动物OOD检测中具有优势，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mitigating human-wildlife conflict seeks to resolve unwanted encounters
between these parties. Computer Vision provides a solution to identifying
individuals that might escalate into conflict, such as members of the Big Five
African animals. However, environments often contain several varied species.
The current state-of-the-art animal classification models are trained under a
closed-world assumption. They almost always remain overconfident in their
predictions even when presented with unknown classes. This study investigates
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection of wildlife, specifically the Big Five. To
this end, we select a parametric Nearest Class Mean (NCM) and a non-parametric
contrastive learning approach as baselines to take advantage of pretrained and
projected features from popular classification encoders. Moreover, we compare
our baselines to various common OOD methods in the literature. The results show
feature-based methods reflect stronger generalisation capability across varying
classification thresholds. Specifically, NCM with ImageNet pre-trained features
achieves a 2%, 4% and 22% improvement on AUPR-IN, AUPR-OUT and AUTC over the
best OOD methods, respectively. The code can be found here

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在视觉和语言融合方面取得了成功，但其输出仍存在与图像内容不符的幻觉现象，需要一种简单有效的方法来缓解这一问题。

Method: 引入Local Perception Search (LPS)，一种基于局部视觉先验信息的解码方法，用于在推理过程中修正解码过程。

Result: 在广泛使用的幻觉基准测试和噪声数据上，LPS显著减少了幻觉现象，尤其在噪声环境下表现优异。

Conclusion: LPS是一种简单、无需训练且兼容性强的解码方法，能有效抑制多模态大语言模型中的幻觉现象。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
them to effectively integrate vision and language, addressing a variety of
downstream tasks. However, despite their significant success, these models
still exhibit hallucination phenomena, where the outputs appear plausible but
do not align with the content of the images. To mitigate this issue, we
introduce Local Perception Search (LPS), a decoding method during inference
that is both simple and training-free, yet effectively suppresses
hallucinations. This method leverages local visual prior information as a value
function to correct the decoding process. Additionally, we observe that the
impact of the local visual prior on model performance is more pronounced in
scenarios with high levels of image noise. Notably, LPS is a plug-and-play
approach that is compatible with various models. Extensive experiments on
widely used hallucination benchmarks and noisy data demonstrate that LPS
significantly reduces the incidence of hallucinations compared to the baseline,
showing exceptional performance, particularly in noisy settings.

Result: 实验验证了每一步的有效性，首次证明可以从单视角SAR图像直接推导飞机目标的3D语义结构表示。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法成功实现了SAR目标结构恢复，为SAR图像的高级信息检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: To translate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image into interpretable forms
for human understanding is the ultimate goal of SAR advanced information
retrieval. Existing methods mainly focus on 3D surface reconstruction or local
geometric feature extraction of targets, neglecting the role of structural
modeling in capturing semantic information. This paper proposes a novel task:
SAR target structure recovery, which aims to infer the components of a target
and the structural relationships between its components, specifically symmetry
and adjacency, from a single-view SAR image. Through learning the structural
consistency and geometric diversity across the same type of targets as observed
in different SAR images, it aims to derive the semantic representation of
target directly from its 2D SAR image. To solve this challenging task, a
two-step algorithmic framework based on structural descriptors is developed.
Specifically, in the training phase, it first detects 2D keypoints from real
SAR images, and then learns the mapping from these keypoints to 3D hierarchical
structures using simulated data. During the testing phase, these two steps are
integrated to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images. Experimental results
validated the effectiveness of each step and demonstrated, for the first time,
that 3D semantic structural representation of aircraft targets can be directly
derived from a single-view SAR image.

Motivation: 生物识别认证系统在关键应用中易受欺骗攻击，现有研究多为模态特定方法，缺乏统一且高效的跨模态解决方案。

Method: 提出LitMAS框架，采用模态对齐集中损失（Modality-Aligned Concentration Loss）增强类间分离性并保持跨模态一致性。

Result: LitMAS仅需6M参数，在七个数据集上的平均EER比现有方法低1.36%，表现出高效性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LitMAS是一种高效、通用的多模态反欺骗解决方案，适合边缘部署。

Abstract: Biometric authentication systems are increasingly being deployed in critical
applications, but they remain susceptible to spoofing. Since most of the
research efforts focus on modality-specific anti-spoofing techniques, building
a unified, resource-efficient solution across multiple biometric modalities
remains a challenge. To address this, we propose LitMAS, a
$\textbf{Li}$gh$\textbf{t}$ weight and generalizable $\textbf{M}$ulti-modal
$\textbf{A}$nti-$\textbf{S}$poofing framework designed to detect spoofing
attacks in speech, face, iris, and fingerprint-based biometric systems. At the
core of LitMAS is a Modality-Aligned Concentration Loss, which enhances
inter-class separability while preserving cross-modal consistency and enabling
robust spoof detection across diverse biometric traits. With just 6M
parameters, LitMAS surpasses state-of-the-art methods by $1.36\%$ in average
EER across seven datasets, demonstrating high efficiency, strong
generalizability, and suitability for edge deployment. Code and trained models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器观测可能噪声大且稀疏，运动模式可能受复杂动力学支配，且应用场景需要长期预测。

Method: 使用神经控制微分方程在SO(3)上建模旋转物体动力学，结合Savitzky-Golay路径，避免简化运动假设。

Result: 在真实数据上展示了优于现有方法的预测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够学习旋转轨迹的潜在动力学系统，同时尊重旋转的几何结构。

Abstract: Tracking and forecasting the rotation of objects is fundamental in computer
vision and robotics, yet SO(3) extrapolation remains challenging as (1) sensor
observations can be noisy and sparse, (2) motion patterns can be governed by
complex dynamics, and (3) application settings can demand long-term
forecasting. This work proposes modeling continuous-time rotational object
dynamics on $SO(3)$ using Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by
Savitzky-Golay paths. Unlike existing methods that rely on simplified motion
assumptions, our method learns a general latent dynamical system of the
underlying object trajectory while respecting the geometric structure of
rotations. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate compelling
forecasting capabilities compared to existing approaches.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持高风格保真度和身份完整性方面显著优于基线模型，尤其适用于小面部或远距离场景。

Conclusion: 该框架无需重新训练或微调，即可有效解决身份保留问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities,
existing style transfer techniques often struggle to maintain identity while
achieving high-quality stylization. This limitation is particularly acute for
images where faces are small or exhibit significant camera-to-face distances,
frequently leading to inadequate identity preservation. To address this, we
introduce a novel, training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized
image synthesis using diffusion models. Key contributions include: (1) the
"Mosaic Restored Content Image" technique, significantly enhancing identity
retention, especially in complex scenes; and (2) a training-free content
consistency loss that enhances the preservation of fine-grained content details
by directing more attention to the original image during stylization. Our
experiments reveal that the proposed approach substantially surpasses the
baseline model in concurrently maintaining high stylistic fidelity and robust
identity integrity, particularly under conditions of small facial regions or
significant camera-to-face distances, all without necessitating model
retraining or fine-tuning.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的自适应框架RDVP-MSD，通过多模态逐步分解链式思维（MSD-CoT）和区域约束的双流视觉提示（RDVP），解决了伪装物体分割中的语义模糊和空间分离问题，实现了更高的分割精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可提示分割方法（如SAM）需要为每个对象提供手动视觉提示，而任务通用的提示方法在伪装物体分割（COS）中仍面临语义模糊和空间分离的问题。

Method: 提出RDVP-MSD框架，结合MSD-CoT逐步分解图像描述以消除语义模糊，并通过RDVP在视觉提示中引入空间约束，独立采样前景和背景点。

Result: 在多个COS基准测试中实现了最先进的分割效果，推理速度更快，显著提升了准确性和效率。

Conclusion: RDVP-MSD无需训练或监督，有效解决了COS中的关键问题，为任务通用的提示分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for
various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each
object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims
to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic
prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to
Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical
issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text
prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic
captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2)
\textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in
getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global
background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation,
causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we
propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework
that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream
\textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal
\textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT
progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity,
while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently
samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively
mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any
training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation
result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than
previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Hi-LSplat通过统一3D表示和层次语义建模，显著提升了3D开放词汇查询的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Modeling 3D language fields with Gaussian Splatting for open-ended language
queries has recently garnered increasing attention. However, recent 3DGS-based
models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but
lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies.
Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in
object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic
understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent
Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying.
To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features
to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered
instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D
semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise
contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations.
Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the
model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments
highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and
localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets
underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D
scenes.

Result: 实验表明，PBL能有效继承源模型的鲁棒性，并显著提升VP在下游任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PBL是一种通用且有效的策略，解决了VP在鲁棒性和泛化能力之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Visual Prompting (VP), an efficient method for transfer learning, has shown
its potential in vision tasks. However, previous works focus exclusively on VP
from standard source models, it is still unknown how it performs under the
scenario of a robust source model: Can the robustness of the source model be
successfully inherited? Does VP also encounter the same trade-off between
robustness and generalization ability as the source model during this process?
If such a trade-off exists, is there a strategy specifically tailored to VP to
mitigate this limitation? In this paper, we thoroughly explore these three
questions for the first time and provide affirmative answers to them. To
mitigate the trade-off faced by VP, we propose a strategy called Prompt
Boundary Loosening (PBL). As a lightweight, plug-and-play strategy naturally
compatible with VP, PBL effectively ensures the successful inheritance of
robustness when the source model is a robust model, while significantly
enhancing VP's generalization ability across various downstream datasets.
Extensive experiments across various datasets show that our findings are
universal and demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed strategy.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在背景耦合、文本对齐和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了背景一致性与对象灵活性的结合。

Abstract: We provide an attention-level control method for the task of coupled image
generation, where "coupled" means that multiple simultaneously generated images
are expected to have the same or very similar backgrounds. While backgrounds
coupled, the centered objects in the generated images are still expected to
enjoy the flexibility raised from different text prompts. The proposed method
disentangles the background and entity components in the model's
cross-attention modules, attached with a sequence of time-varying weight
control parameters depending on the time step of sampling. We optimize this
sequence of weight control parameters with a combined objective that assesses
how coupled the backgrounds are as well as text-to-image alignment and overall
visual quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches across these criteria.

Conclusion: EndoARSS有望推动AI驱动的内窥镜手术系统发展，提升手术安全性和效率。

Abstract: Endoscopic surgery is the gold standard for robotic-assisted minimally
invasive surgery, offering significant advantages in early disease detection
and precise interventions. However, the complexity of surgical scenes,
characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and
confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges
for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often
struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in
each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task
learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance
overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel
multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery
activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2
foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate
efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank
Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we
introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature
representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global
information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we
present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored
for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity
recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks,
significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing
models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven
endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical
safety and efficiency.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的两阶段时间序列异常检测方法（ViT4TS和VLM4TS），显著提升了检测性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏视觉-时间推理能力，无法像人类专家一样识别上下文异常。

Method: 1. ViT4TS：轻量级视觉编码器定位候选异常；2. VLM4TS：结合全局时间上下文和VLM推理能力优化检测。

Result: VLM4TS在未训练时间序列数据的情况下，F1-max分数提升24.6%，且效率提升36倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有TSAD方法的局限性，展示了VLM在时间序列分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of
fields, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Prior
methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical
data, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to
identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on
vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs
for visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has
fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for
TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening
stage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which
leverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate
anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal
context and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates
provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS
outperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases,
yielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline.
Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based
TSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.

*Yangkai Lin,Jiabao Lei,Kui jia*

TLDR: 提出Multi-StyleGS方法，通过自动局部风格转移和语义风格损失函数，实现3D高斯泼溅场景的多风格适配，保持内存高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯泼溅场景在多风格适配中的挑战，如自动局部风格转移和内存效率问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在风格化效果、灵活性和内存效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Multi-StyleGS为3D场景风格化提供了高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing demand to stylize a given 3D scene
to align with the artistic style of reference images for creative purposes.
While 3D Gaussian Splatting(GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method
for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to
stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style
transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for
stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization
solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we
employ a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify
correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered
images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style
loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to
various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to
enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve
memory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To
better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several
techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our
comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing
plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.

Result: Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick方法表现最佳，误差为7.96，接近现有融合滤波器水平。

Conclusion: 神经网络可用于人体姿态估计，效果与现有技术相当。

Abstract: Inertial-based Motion capture system has been attracting growing attention
due to its wearability and unsconstrained use. However, accurate human joint
estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads
to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens
Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract
the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose
estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network
architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can
estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda)
Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method
was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle
distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was
conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation,
window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error.
This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose,
with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.

*John Waithaka,Moise Busogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于位置预测的自监督学习方法（LOCA），用于多模态卫星图像语义分割，显著优于现有基于重建的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像语义分割受限于标记数据不足，现有自监督方法（如MAE）侧重于重建而非定位，而定位是分割任务的关键。

Method: 扩展SatMAE的通道分组至多模态数据，引入同组注意力掩码以促进跨模态交互，采用相对补丁位置预测任务以增强空间推理能力。

Result: 在Sen1Floods11洪水映射数据集上，该方法显著优于基于重建的自监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 针对多模态卫星图像的位置预测任务能学习到更有效的表示，优于基于重建的方法。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation
applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While
self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown
promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental
aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a
position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite
imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of
satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to
multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and
introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction
during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction,
encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We
evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it
significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised
learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position
prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn
representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than
reconstruction-based approaches.

Result: 实验表明，DONUT在Argoverse 2单代理运动预测基准上优于基线模型，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 解码器专用模型在轨迹预测中表现优异，未来可进一步优化多代理预测。

Abstract: Predicting the motion of other agents in a scene is highly relevant for
autonomous driving, as it allows a self-driving car to anticipate. Inspired by
the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a
Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing
encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and
predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the
model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that
the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the
performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language
modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the
auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This
allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the
performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach
outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art
results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

Result: 在Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark上实现了5%的性能提升，优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: Vision-EKIPL克服了传统强化学习方法的局限，显著提升了视觉推理性能，为该领域研究提供了新范式。

Abstract: Visual reasoning is crucial for understanding complex multimodal data and
advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Existing methods enhance the
reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through
Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning (e.g., GRPO). However, current RL
approaches sample action groups solely from the policy model itself, which
limits the upper boundary of the model's reasoning capability and leads to
inefficient training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
RL framework called \textbf{Vision-EKIPL}. The core of this framework lies in
introducing high-quality actions generated by external auxiliary models during
the RL training process to guide the optimization of the policy model. The
policy learning with knowledge infusion from external models significantly
expands the model's exploration space, effectively improves the reasoning
boundary, and substantially accelerates training convergence speed and
efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Vision-EKIPL
achieved up to a 5\% performance improvement on the Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark
compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA). It reveals that Vision-EKIPL can
overcome the limitations of traditional RL methods, significantly enhance the
visual reasoning performance of MLLMs, and provide a new effective paradigm for
research in this field.

Motivation: 原始点云常因传感器不完善而包含大量噪声，影响识别效果。

Method: 设计cGAN-TOP去噪并恢复特征，采用LDGCNN进行多尺度特征链接识别。

Result: 在Bosphorus数据集上验证，最大识别精度提升14.81%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了噪声点云下的3D人脸识别问题。

Abstract: Face recognition using 3D point clouds is gaining growing interest, while raw
point clouds often contain a significant amount of noise due to imperfect
sensors. In this paper, an end-to-end 3D face recognition on a noisy point
cloud is proposed, which synergistically integrates the denoising and
recognition modules. Specifically, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
on Three Orthogonal Planes (cGAN-TOP) is designed to effectively remove the
noise in the point cloud, and recover the underlying features for subsequent
recognition. A Linked Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (LDGCNN) is
then adapted to recognize faces from the processed point cloud, which
hierarchically links both the local point features and neighboring features of
multiple scales. The proposed method is validated on the Bosphorus dataset. It
significantly improves the recognition accuracy under all noise settings, with
a maximum gain of 14.81%.

Abstract: Accurate Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis is vital for early

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: NSD-Imagery是一个新的基准数据集，用于评估从人类fMRI活动重建心理图像的能力，补充了现有的NSD数据集。研究表明，现有模型在心理图像上的表现与视觉重建表现脱节，且简单架构更适合泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理图像在医学和脑机接口中有重要应用，但现有模型仅针对视觉图像重建进行评估。NSD-Imagery填补了这一空白，支持心理图像重建的研究。

Method: 使用NSD-Imagery评估了多种NSD训练的视觉解码模型（如MindEye1、Brain Diffuser等），比较了它们在心理图像上的表现。

Result: 心理图像解码性能与视觉重建性能脱节，简单线性架构和多模态特征解码泛化更好，复杂架构易过拟合。

Conclusion: 心理图像数据集对实际应用至关重要，NSD-Imagery为视觉解码方法的改进提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We release NSD-Imagery, a benchmark dataset of human fMRI activity paired
with mental images, to complement the existing Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), a
large-scale dataset of fMRI activity paired with seen images that enabled
unprecedented improvements in fMRI-to-image reconstruction efforts. Recent
models trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction.
Using NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on
mental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement
because mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower
signal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to
mental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and
brain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally
generated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source
visual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et
al.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on
mental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction.
We further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact
cross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding
architectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental
imagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data. Our
findings indicate that mental imagery datasets are critical for the development
of practical applications, and establish NSD-Imagery as a useful resource for
better aligning visual decoding methods with this goal.

TLDR: KNN-Defense是一种轻量级防御策略，通过特征空间中的最近邻搜索恢复受扰动的3D点云数据，显著提升对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在3D点云分析中表现优异，但对对抗攻击（如点丢弃、移动和添加）的脆弱性威胁了3D视觉系统的可靠性。现有防御机制效果有限。

Method: 基于流形假设和特征空间最近邻搜索，KNN-Defense通过训练集中邻近样本的语义相似性恢复受扰动输入，而非重建表面几何或强制均匀点分布。

Result: 在ModelNet40数据集上，KNN-Defense显著提升了对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，尤其在点丢弃攻击下，对PointNet、PointNet++、DGCNN和PCT的准确率分别提升了20.1%、3.6%、3.44%和7.74%。

Conclusion: KNN-Defense是一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，适用于实时应用，能有效增强3D点云分类器的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
analyzing 3D point cloud data. However, their vulnerability to adversarial
attacks-such as point dropping, shifting, and adding-poses a critical challenge
to the reliability of 3D vision systems. These attacks can compromise the
semantic and structural integrity of point clouds, rendering many existing
defense mechanisms ineffective. To address this issue, a defense strategy named
KNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and
nearest-neighbor search in feature space. Instead of reconstructing surface
geometry or enforcing uniform point distributions, the method restores
perturbed inputs by leveraging the semantic similarity of neighboring samples
from the training set. KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally
efficient, enabling fast inference and making it suitable for real-time and
practical applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset
demonstrated that KNN-Defense significantly improves robustness across various
attack types. In particular, under point-dropping attacks-where many existing
methods underperform due to the targeted removal of critical points-the
proposed method achieves accuracy gains of 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% on
PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively. These findings suggest that
KNN-Defense offers a scalable and effective solution for enhancing the
adversarial resilience of 3D point cloud classifiers. (An open-source
implementation of the method, including code and data, is available at
https://github.com/nimajam41/3d-knn-defense).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D高斯泼溅系统在静态场景中表现优异，但在长期动态场景（场景在视野外变化）中表现不足，因此需要一种机制来持续更新3D表示。

Method: 引入动态场景适应机制以持续更新3D表示，并提出关键帧管理机制以丢弃过时观测同时保留有效信息。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，提出的GaME方法比现有技术更准确。

Conclusion: GaME方法通过动态适应和关键帧管理，有效解决了长期动态场景的问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Mapping systems with novel view synthesis (NVS) capabilities are widely used
in computer vision, with augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving
applications. Most notably, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems show high NVS
performance; however, many current approaches are limited to static scenes.
While recent works have started addressing short-term dynamics (motion within
the view of the camera), long-term dynamics (the scene evolving through changes
out of view) remain less explored. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
dynamic scene adaptation mechanism that continuously updates the 3D
representation to reflect the latest changes. In addition, since maintaining
geometric and semantic consistency remains challenging due to stale
observations disrupting the reconstruction process, we propose a novel keyframe
management mechanism that discards outdated observations while preserving as
much information as possible. We evaluate Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes
(GaME) on both synthetic and real-world datasets and find it to be more
accurate than the state of the art.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在85晚患者数据中表现优异，优于现有单模态和多模态模型。

Conclusion: 预训练多模态模型可有效用于睡眠分类，接近依赖EEG的系统的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate sleep stage classification is essential for diagnosing sleep
disorders, particularly in aging populations. While traditional polysomnography
(PSG) relies on electroencephalography (EEG) as the gold standard, its
complexity and need for specialized equipment make home-based sleep monitoring
challenging. To address this limitation, we investigate the use of
electrooculography (EOG) and pressure-sensitive mats (PSM) as less obtrusive
alternatives for five-stage sleep-wake classification. This study introduces a
novel approach that leverages ImageBind, a multimodal embedding deep learning
model, to integrate PSM data with dual-channel EOG signals for sleep stage
classification. Our method is the first reported approach that fuses PSM and
EOG data for sleep stage classification with ImageBind. Our results demonstrate
that fine-tuning ImageBind significantly improves classification accuracy,
outperforming existing models based on single-channel EOG (DeepSleepNet),
exclusively PSM data (ViViT), and other multimodal deep learning approaches
(MBT). Notably, the model also achieved strong performance without fine-tuning,
highlighting its adaptability to specific tasks with limited labeled data,
making it particularly advantageous for medical applications. We evaluated our
method using 85 nights of patient recordings from a sleep clinic. Our findings
suggest that pre-trained multimodal embedding models, even those originally
developed for non-medical domains, can be effectively adapted for sleep
staging, with accuracies approaching systems that require complex EEG data.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了智能眼镜在复杂环境中的文本识别能力。

Abstract: Current smart glasses equipped with RGB cameras struggle to perceive the
environment in low-light and high-speed motion scenarios due to motion blur and
the limited dynamic range of frame cameras. Additionally, capturing dense
images with a frame camera requires large bandwidth and power consumption,
consequently draining the battery faster. These challenges are especially
relevant for developing algorithms that can read text from images. In this
work, we propose a novel event-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
approach for smart glasses. By using the eye gaze of the user, we foveate the
event stream to significantly reduce bandwidth by around 98% while exploiting
the benefits of event cameras in high-dynamic and fast scenes. Our proposed
method performs deep binary reconstruction trained on synthetic data and
leverages multimodal LLMs for OCR, outperforming traditional OCR solutions. Our
results demonstrate the ability to read text in low light environments where
RGB cameras struggle while using up to 2400 times less bandwidth than a
wearable RGB camera.

Motivation: 探讨Video LLMs在仅图像训练后表现出的时间推理能力，以及视频训练的低效性。

Method: 使用LongVU算法训练两个LLMs，并在TVBench上进行测试；引入基于标注图像序列的微调方案。

Result: 图像训练的LLMs在时间推理任务上表现显著高于随机水平，甚至接近或超过视频训练的LLMs。

Conclusion: 当前模型未充分利用视频中的时间特征，需进一步研究图像训练LLMs的时间推理机制及视频训练的瓶颈。

Abstract: Research into Video Large Language Models (LLMs) has progressed rapidly, with
numerous models and benchmarks emerging in just a few years. Typically, these
models are initialized with a pretrained text-only LLM and finetuned on both
image- and video-caption datasets. In this paper, we present findings
indicating that Video LLMs are more capable of temporal reasoning after
image-only training than one would assume, and that improvements from
video-specific training are surprisingly small. Specifically, we show that
image-trained versions of two LLMs trained with the recent LongVU algorithm
perform significantly above chance level on TVBench, a temporal reasoning
benchmark. Additionally, we introduce a simple finetuning scheme involving
sequences of annotated images and questions targeting temporal capabilities.
This baseline results in temporal reasoning performance close to, and
occasionally higher than, what is achieved by video-trained LLMs. This suggests
suboptimal utilization of rich temporal features found in real video by current
models. Our analysis motivates further research into the mechanisms that allow
image-trained LLMs to perform temporal reasoning, as well as into the
bottlenecks that render current video training schemes inefficient.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要低延迟、高吞吐量的实时感知，传统LiDAR处理方法存在延迟问题，而流式方法因极坐标几何不匹配导致性能下降。

Method: PHiM采用局部双向Mamba块进行空间编码和全局前向Mamba块进行时序建模，替代卷积和位置编码，实现高效极坐标流式处理。

Result: 在Waymo Open Dataset上，PHiM性能优于现有流式检测器10%，且吞吐量翻倍。

Conclusion: PHiM为极坐标流式LiDAR检测提供了高效解决方案，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient object detection is essential for autonomous vehicles,
where real-time perception requires low latency and high throughput. LiDAR
sensors provide robust depth information, but conventional methods process full
360{\deg} scans in a single pass, introducing significant delay. Streaming
approaches address this by sequentially processing partial scans in the native
polar coordinate system, yet they rely on translation-invariant convolutions
that are misaligned with polar geometry -- resulting in degraded performance or
requiring complex distortion mitigation. Recent Mamba-based state space models
(SSMs) have shown promise for LiDAR perception, but only in the full-scan
setting, relying on geometric serialization and positional embeddings that are
memory-intensive and ill-suited to streaming. We propose Polar Hierarchical
Mamba (PHiM), a novel SSM architecture designed for polar-coordinate streaming
LiDAR. PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial
encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling,
replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware,
dimensionally-decomposed operations. PHiM sets a new state-of-the-art among
streaming detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming the previous best
by 10\% and matching full-scan baselines at twice the throughput. Code will be

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models unifying image understanding
and generation have opened exciting avenues for tackling a wide range of
vision-language tasks within a single framework. Despite progress, existing
unified models typically require extensive pretraining and struggle to achieve
the same level of performance compared to models dedicated to each task.
Additionally, many of these models suffer from slow image generation speeds,
limiting their practical deployment in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. In this work, we propose Layerwise Timestep-Expert Flow-based
Transformer (LaTtE-Flow), a novel and efficient architecture that unifies image
understanding and generation within a single multimodal model. LaTtE-Flow
builds upon powerful pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to inherit strong
multimodal understanding capabilities, and extends them with a novel Layerwise
Timestep Experts flow-based architecture for efficient image generation.
LaTtE-Flow distributes the flow-matching process across specialized groups of
Transformer layers, each responsible for a distinct subset of timesteps. This
design significantly improves sampling efficiency by activating only a small
subset of layers at each sampling timestep. To further enhance performance, we
propose a Timestep-Conditioned Residual Attention mechanism for efficient
information reuse across layers. Experiments demonstrate that LaTtE-Flow
achieves strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks, while achieving
competitive image generation quality with around 6x faster inference speed
compared to recent unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution refers to the reconstruction of a
high-resolution image from a single low-resolution observation. Although recent
deep learning-based methods have demonstrated notable success on simulated
datasets -- with low-resolution images obtained by degrading and downsampling
high-resolution ones -- they frequently fail to generalize to real-world
settings, such as document scans, which are affected by complex degradations
and semantic variability. In this study, we introduce a task-driven, multi-task
learning framework for training a super-resolution network specifically
optimized for optical character recognition tasks. We propose to incorporate
auxiliary loss functions derived from high-level vision tasks, including text
detection using the connectionist text proposal network, text recognition via a
convolutional recurrent neural network, keypoints localization using Key.Net,
and hue consistency. To balance these diverse objectives, we employ dynamic
weight averaging mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the relative importance of
each loss term based on its convergence behavior. We validate our approach upon
the SRResNet architecture, which is a well-established technique for
single-image super-resolution. Experimental evaluations on both simulated and
real-world scanned document datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach
improves text detection, measured with intersection over union, while
preserving overall image fidelity. These findings underscore the value of
multi-objective optimization in super-resolution models for bridging the gap
between simulated training regimes and practical deployment in real-world
scenarios.

TLDR: AR-RAG是一种新的图像生成范式，通过自回归方式在生成过程中动态检索并整合最相关的图像块，解决了现有方法中的静态检索和风格偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成方法通常基于静态检索，容易导致过度复制或风格偏差，AR-RAG旨在通过动态检索提升生成灵活性和质量。

Method: 提出了两种并行框架：DAiD（无训练的解码策略）和FAiD（参数高效的微调方法），分别通过分布和特征增强优化生成过程。

Result: 在Midjourney-30K等基准测试中，AR-RAG显著优于现有图像生成模型。

Conclusion: AR-RAG通过动态检索和增强策略，有效提升了图像生成的灵活性和质量。

Abstract: We introduce Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation (AR-RAG), a novel paradigm
that enhances image generation by autoregressively incorporating knearest
neighbor retrievals at the patch level. Unlike prior methods that perform a
single, static retrieval before generation and condition the entire generation
on fixed reference images, AR-RAG performs context-aware retrievals at each
generation step, using prior-generated patches as queries to retrieve and
incorporate the most relevant patch-level visual references, enabling the model
to respond to evolving generation needs while avoiding limitations (e.g.,
over-copying, stylistic bias, etc.) prevalent in existing methods. To realize
AR-RAG, we propose two parallel frameworks: (1) Distribution-Augmentation in
Decoding (DAiD), a training-free plug-and-use decoding strategy that directly
merges the distribution of model-predicted patches with the distribution of
retrieved patches, and (2) Feature-Augmentation in Decoding (FAiD), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that progressively smooths the features
of retrieved patches via multi-scale convolution operations and leverages them
to augment the image generation process. We validate the effectiveness of
AR-RAG on widely adopted benchmarks, including Midjourney-30K, GenEval and
DPG-Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains over state-of-the-art
image generation models.

TLDR: 本文提出了一个双视角中国手语数据集NationalCSL-DP，并设计了一个CNN-Transformer网络作为基线模型，通过实验验证了数据集和融合策略的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语数据集覆盖不全且多为单视角，难以应对手部遮挡问题，因此需要构建更全面的双视角数据集以提升孤立手语识别（ISLR）的性能。

Method: 提出了一个覆盖中国国家手语词汇的双视角数据集NationalCSL-DP，并设计了一个CNN-Transformer网络及简单的融合策略作为基线。

Result: 实验表明，提出的融合策略显著提升了ISLR性能，但序列到序列模型难以从双视角视频中学习互补特征。

Conclusion: 双视角数据集和融合策略有效解决了手语识别中的部分问题，但双视角特征的互补学习仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Due to the emergence of many sign language datasets, isolated sign language
recognition (ISLR) has made significant progress in recent years. In addition,
the development of various advanced deep neural networks is another reason for
this breakthrough. However, challenges remain in applying the technique in the
real world. First, existing sign language datasets do not cover the whole sign
vocabulary. Second, most of the sign language datasets provide only single view
RGB videos, which makes it difficult to handle hand occlusions when performing
ISLR. To fill this gap, this paper presents a dual-view sign language dataset
for ISLR named NationalCSL-DP, which fully covers the Chinese national sign
language vocabulary. The dataset consists of 134140 sign videos recorded by ten
signers with respect to two vertical views, namely, the front side and the left
side. Furthermore, a CNN transformer network is also proposed as a strong
baseline and an extremely simple but effective fusion strategy for prediction.
Extensive experiments were conducted to prove the effectiveness of the datasets
as well as the baseline. The results show that the proposed fusion strategy can
significantly increase the performance of the ISLR, but it is not easy for the
sequence-to-sequence model, regardless of whether the early-fusion or
late-fusion strategy is applied, to learn the complementary features from the
sign videos of two vertical views.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出MAPLE框架，利用MLLM的细粒度对齐特性改进跨模态表示学习，通过强化学习和新的RPA损失显著提升细粒度检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CLIP在多模态检索中表现出色，但其特征空间仍存在显著的模态差距。MLLM具有强大的模态对齐特性，但现有方法依赖粗粒度对齐机制，限制了潜力。

Method: 提出MAPLE框架，通过强化学习实现跨模态表示学习，包括自动偏好数据构建和新的RPA损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，MAPLE在细粒度跨模态检索中取得显著提升，有效处理语义细微差别。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过利用MLLM的细粒度对齐特性，显著改善了跨模态表示学习，为多模态检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)'s remarkable capability
to retrieve content across modalities, a substantial modality gap persists in
its feature space. Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs
(Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality
alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified
architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality
alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We
introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel
framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to
guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning
process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic
preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative
Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our
preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained
cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced
semantic distinctions.

Result: 混合表示在保持渲染质量的同时，显著提升了帧率并减少了高斯基元数量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了渲染质量和效率，适用于室内场景的实时渲染。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated exceptional performance in
image-based 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, regions with
complex textures require numerous Gaussians to capture significant color
variations accurately, leading to inefficiencies in rendering speed. To address
this challenge, we introduce a hybrid representation for indoor scenes that
combines 3DGS with textured meshes. Our approach uses textured meshes to handle
texture-rich flat areas, while retaining Gaussians to model intricate
geometries. The proposed method begins by pruning and refining the extracted
mesh to eliminate geometrically complex regions. We then employ a joint
optimization for 3DGS and mesh, incorporating a warm-up strategy and
transmittance-aware supervision to balance their contributions
seamlessly.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the hybrid representation
maintains comparable rendering quality and achieves superior frames per second
FPS with fewer Gaussian primitives.

Result: 实验表明COGO显著提高了对抗攻击的迁移成功率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COGO通过优化共享和抑制个体特征，有效提升了对抗样本的迁移性。

Abstract: Exploring effective and transferable adversarial examples is vital for
understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs).
However, adversarial examples generated from surrogate models often exhibit
weak transferability in black-box settings due to overfitting. Existing methods
improve transferability by diversifying perturbation inputs or applying uniform
gradient regularization within surrogate models, yet they have not fully
leveraged the shared and unique features of surrogate models trained on the
same task, leading to suboptimal transfer performance. Therefore, enhancing
perturbations of common information shared by surrogate models and suppressing
those tied to individual characteristics offers an effective way to improve
transferability. Accordingly, we propose a commonality-oriented gradient
optimization strategy (COGO) consisting of two components: Commonality
Enhancement (CE) and Individuality Suppression (IS). CE perturbs the mid-to-low
frequency regions, leveraging the fact that ViTs trained on the same dataset
tend to rely more on mid-to-low frequency information for classification. IS
employs adaptive thresholds to evaluate the correlation between backpropagated
gradients and model individuality, assigning weights to gradients accordingly.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGO significantly improves the transfer
success rates of adversarial attacks, outperforming current state-of-the-art
methods.

Conclusion: DM$^3$Net在双摄像头超分辨率任务中表现出色，同时减少了计算资源消耗。

Abstract: Dual-camera super-resolution is highly practical for smartphone photography
that primarily super-resolve the wide-angle images using the telephoto image as
a reference. In this paper, we propose DM$^3$Net, a novel dual-camera
super-resolution network based on Domain Modulation and Multi-scale Matching.
To bridge the domain gap between the high-resolution domain and the degraded
domain, we learn two compressed global representations from image pairs
corresponding to the two domains. To enable reliable transfer of high-frequency
structural details from the reference image, we design a multi-scale matching
module that conducts patch-level feature matching and retrieval across multiple
receptive fields to improve matching accuracy and robustness. Moreover, we also
introduce Key Pruning to achieve a significant reduction in memory usage and
inference time with little model performance sacrificed. Experimental results
on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our DM$^3$Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: 在多个基准数据库和模型上验证，D2R Loss与CAG结合显著提升了模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D2R Loss和CAG策略有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了模型对抗攻击的防御能力。

Abstract: The robustness of Deep Neural Network models is crucial for defending models
against adversarial attacks. Recent defense methods have employed collaborative
learning frameworks to enhance model robustness. Two key limitations of
existing methods are (i) insufficient guidance of the target model via loss
functions and (ii) non-collaborative adversarial generation. We, therefore,
propose a dual regularization loss (D2R Loss) method and a collaborative
adversarial generation (CAG) strategy for adversarial training. D2R loss
includes two optimization steps. The adversarial distribution and clean
distribution optimizations enhance the target model's robustness by leveraging
the strengths of different loss functions obtained via a suitable function
space exploration to focus more precisely on the target model's distribution.
CAG generates adversarial samples using a gradient-based collaboration between
guidance and target models. We conducted extensive experiments on three
benchmark databases, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and two
popular target models, WideResNet34-10 and PreActResNet18. Our results show
that D2R loss with CAG produces highly robust models.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为BadSem的新型后门攻击方法，利用跨模态语义不匹配作为隐式触发器，攻击视觉语言模型（VLMs）。该方法通过故意错配图像-文本对在训练中注入后门，实验表明攻击成功率高达98%，且能泛化到分布外数据。现有防御策略无法有效缓解此类攻击。

Motivation: 现有后门攻击主要依赖单模态触发器，忽略了VLMs的跨模态融合特性。论文旨在探索跨模态语义不匹配作为攻击面的可能性。

Method: 提出BadSem攻击方法，通过构建SIMBad数据集，故意错配图像-文本对（如颜色和物体属性）以注入后门。

Result: 攻击在四种广泛使用的VLMs上平均成功率超过98%，能泛化到分布外数据，且可跨模态转移。注意力可视化显示后门模型在语义敏感区域异常聚焦。

Conclusion: 现有防御策略无法有效缓解BadSem攻击，凸显了VLMs语义漏洞的严重性，需进一步研究以保障其安全部署。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance, but are also
vulnerable to backdoor attacks whereby the adversary can manipulate the model's
outputs through hidden triggers. Prior attacks primarily rely on
single-modality triggers, leaving the crucial cross-modal fusion nature of VLMs
largely unexplored. Unlike prior work, we identify a novel attack surface that
leverages cross-modal semantic mismatches as implicit triggers. Based on this
insight, we propose BadSem (Backdoor Attack with Semantic Manipulation), a data
poisoning attack that injects stealthy backdoors by deliberately misaligning
image-text pairs during training. To perform the attack, we construct SIMBad, a
dataset tailored for semantic manipulation involving color and object
attributes. Extensive experiments across four widely used VLMs show that BadSem
achieves over 98% average ASR, generalizes well to out-of-distribution
datasets, and can transfer across poisoning modalities. Our detailed analysis
using attention visualization shows that backdoored models focus on
semantically sensitive regions under mismatched conditions while maintaining
normal behavior on clean inputs. To mitigate the attack, we try two defense
strategies based on system prompt and supervised fine-tuning but find that both
of them fail to mitigate the semantic backdoor. Our findings highlight the
urgent need to address semantic vulnerabilities in VLMs for their safer
deployment.

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes和Occ3D-Waymo基准测试中表现优越，推理速度也具竞争力。

Conclusion: BePo有效结合BEV和稀疏点表示，提升了3D占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene
understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,
however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and
cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have
adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with
much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More
concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant
information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,
points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing
flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, BePo, which combines BEV and
sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a
query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned
in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,
which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The
outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.
We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo
benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BePo. Moreover,
BePo also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest
efficient approaches.

Abstract: This work presents UNO, a unified monocular visual odometry framework that
enables robust and adaptable pose estimation across diverse environments,
platforms, and motion patterns. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
deployment-specific tuning or predefined motion priors, our approach
generalizes effectively across a wide range of real-world scenarios, including
autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, mobile robots, and handheld devices. To
this end, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts strategy for local state
estimation, with several specialized decoders that each handle a distinct class
of ego-motion patterns. Moreover, we introduce a fully differentiable
Gumbel-Softmax module that constructs a robust inter-frame correlation graph,
selects the optimal expert decoder, and prunes erroneous estimates. These cues
are then fed into a unified back-end that combines pre-trained,
scale-independent depth priors with a lightweight bundling adjustment to
enforce geometric consistency. We extensively evaluate our method on three
major benchmark datasets: KITTI (outdoor/autonomous driving), EuRoC-MAV
(indoor/aerial drones), and TUM-RGBD (indoor/handheld), demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: AVHaystacks和MAGNET为多视频检索和时间定位任务提供了有效的解决方案和评估工具。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in audio-visual
understanding, yet they struggle with real-world scenarios that require complex
reasoning across extensive video collections. Existing benchmarks for video
question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per
query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale,
audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal
is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query
and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we
present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA
pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and
temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent
framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65%
relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores
in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of
multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation,

### [513] [Interpretable and Reliable Detection of AI-Generated Images via Grounded Reasoning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07045)
*Yikun Ji,Hong Yan,Jun Lan,Huijia Zhu,Weiqiang Wang,Qi Fan,Liqing Zhang,Jianfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的方法，用于检测AI生成图像并提供可解释的视觉定位和文本解释。通过构建标注数据集和多阶段优化策略，模型在检测和定位视觉缺陷方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成图像检测方法多为黑箱，缺乏可解释性。MLLMs虽具备分析能力，但在视觉解释与人类推理对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 构建标注数据集，标注合成伪影的边界框和描述性标题，并通过多阶段优化策略微调MLLMs，平衡检测准确性、视觉定位和文本解释。

Result: 模型在检测AI生成图像和定位视觉缺陷方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合视觉定位和文本解释，显著提升了AI生成图像检测的可解释性和性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand
for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches
often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without
providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit
strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they
can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations.
However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to
align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human
reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images
annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis
artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded
reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy
that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual
localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves
superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing
visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

*Zheng Wang,Kai Ying,Bin Xu,Chunjiao Wang,Cong Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为PRE-Net的两阶段模型，通过多模态知识扩展技术提升红外降水反演的精度，解决了现有方法在范围和准确性上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外降水反演算法精度低，而微波和雷达方法范围有限，因此需要一种能在全圆盘范围内实现高精度降水反演的方法。

Method: 提出两阶段管道：1) Swath-Distilling阶段，通过CoMWE技术将多模态知识迁移到红外模型；2) Full-Disc Adaptation阶段，使用Self-MaskTune平衡多模态和红外知识。

Result: PRE-Net在PRE基准测试中显著优于PERSIANN-CCS、PDIR和IMERG等领先产品。

Conclusion: PRE-Net通过多模态知识扩展，实现了高精度的全圆盘红外降水反演，为实时降水监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate near-real-time precipitation retrieval has been enhanced by
satellite-based technologies. However, infrared-based algorithms have low
accuracy due to weak relations with surface precipitation, whereas passive
microwave and radar-based methods are more accurate but limited in range. This
challenge motivates the Precipitation Retrieval Expansion (PRE) task, which
aims to enable accurate, infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrievals
beyond the scanning swath. We introduce Multimodal Knowledge Expansion, a
two-stage pipeline with the proposed PRE-Net model. In the Swath-Distilling
stage, PRE-Net transfers knowledge from a multimodal data integration model to
an infrared-based model within the scanning swath via Coordinated Masking and
Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE). In the Full-Disc Adaptation stage, Self-MaskTune
refines predictions across the full disc by balancing multimodal and full-disc
infrared knowledge. Experiments on the introduced PRE benchmark demonstrate
that PRE-Net significantly advanced precipitation retrieval performance,
outperforming leading products like PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR, and IMERG. The code
will be available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/PRE-Net.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖预训练教师网络，而LSSKD旨在通过自监督知识蒸馏提升紧凑模型的泛化能力。

Method: 在中间特征图上附加辅助分类器，生成多样化自监督知识，实现一对一跨网络阶段知识转移。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上平均提升4.54%（优于PS-KD），ImageNet上提升0.32%（优于HASSKD），小样本学习场景下也达到SOTA。

Conclusion: LSSKD高效轻量，适用于低计算设备，特别适合多模态感知和弱监督学习场景。

Abstract: We introduce Layered Self-Supervised Knowledge Distillation (LSSKD) framework
for training compact deep learning models. Unlike traditional methods that rely
on pre-trained teacher networks, our approach appends auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate feature maps, generating diverse self-supervised knowledge and
enabling one-to-one transfer across different network stages. Our method
achieves an average improvement of 4.54\% over the state-of-the-art PS-KD
method and a 1.14% gain over SSKD on CIFAR-100, with a 0.32% improvement on
ImageNet compared to HASSKD. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR-100 under
few-shot learning scenarios also achieve state-of-the-art results. These
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model
generalization and performance without the need for large over-parameterized
teacher networks. Importantly, at the inference stage, all auxiliary
classifiers can be removed, yielding no extra computational cost. This makes
our model suitable for deploying small language models on affordable
low-computing devices. Owing to its lightweight design and adaptability, our
framework is particularly suitable for multimodal sensing and cyber-physical
environments that require efficient and responsive inference. LSSKD facilitates
the development of intelligent agents capable of learning from limited sensory
data under weak supervision.

Abstract: The growing availability of high-quality Earth Observation (EO) data enables
accurate global land cover and crop type monitoring. However, the volume and
heterogeneity of these datasets pose major processing and annotation
challenges. To address this, the French National Institute of Geographical and
Forest Information (IGN) is actively exploring innovative strategies to exploit
diverse EO data, which require large annotated datasets. IGN introduces
FLAIR-HUB, the largest multi-sensor land cover dataset with
very-high-resolution (20 cm) annotations, covering 2528 km2 of France. It
combines six aligned modalities: aerial imagery, Sentinel-1/2 time series, SPOT
imagery, topographic data, and historical aerial images. Extensive benchmarks
evaluate multimodal fusion and deep learning models (CNNs, transformers) for
land cover or crop mapping and also explore multi-task learning. Results
underscore the complexity of multimodal fusion and fine-grained classification,
with best land cover performance (78.2% accuracy, 65.8% mIoU) achieved using
nearly all modalities. FLAIR-HUB supports supervised and multimodal
pretraining, with data and code available at

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于动态伪标签学习的无监督伪装目标检测方法（UCOD-DPL），通过自适应伪标签模块、双分支对抗解码器和Look-Twice机制，解决了现有方法因伪标签噪声和简单解码器导致的性能不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督伪装目标检测方法依赖固定策略生成伪标签并使用简单解码器，导致性能低下，主要问题包括伪标签噪声和语义特征捕捉不足。

Method: 提出UCOD-DPL方法，包含自适应伪标签模块（APM）、双分支对抗解码器（DBA）和Look-Twice机制，分别解决伪标签噪声、前景-背景混淆和小目标检测问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能优异，甚至超过部分全监督方法。

Conclusion: UCOD-DPL通过动态伪标签学习和多模块协作，显著提升了无监督伪装目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised Camoflaged Object Detection (UCOD) has gained attention since it
doesn't need to rely on extensive pixel-level labels. Existing UCOD methods
typically generate pseudo-labels using fixed strategies and train 1 x1
convolutional layers as a simple decoder, leading to low performance compared
to fully-supervised methods. We emphasize two drawbacks in these approaches:
1). The model is prone to fitting incorrect knowledge due to the pseudo-label
containing substantial noise. 2). The simple decoder fails to capture and learn
the semantic features of camouflaged objects, especially for small-sized
objects, due to the low-resolution pseudo-labels and severe confusion between
foreground and background pixels. To this end, we propose a UCOD method with a
teacher-student framework via Dynamic Pseudo-label Learning called UCOD-DPL,
which contains an Adaptive Pseudo-label Module (APM), a Dual-Branch Adversarial
(DBA) decoder, and a Look-Twice mechanism. The APM module adaptively combines
pseudo-labels generated by fixed strategies and the teacher model to prevent
the model from overfitting incorrect knowledge while preserving the ability for
self-correction; the DBA decoder takes adversarial learning of different
segmentation objectives, guides the model to overcome the foreground-background
confusion of camouflaged objects, and the Look-Twice mechanism mimics the human
tendency to zoom in on camouflaged objects and performs secondary refinement on
small-sized objects. Extensive experiments show that our method demonstrates
outstanding performance, even surpassing some existing fully supervised
methods. The code is available now.

TLDR: SceneLCM是一个端到端框架，结合LLM进行布局设计和LCM进行场景优化，解决了现有室内场景生成方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在室内场景合成中存在编辑约束、物理不一致、人力需求高、单房间限制和材质质量差等问题，SceneLCM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SceneLCM将场景生成分解为四个模块化流程：布局生成（LLM引导）、家具生成（CTS损失）、环境优化（多分辨率纹理场）和物理编辑（物理模拟）。

Result: 实验验证了SceneLCM在生成高质量、物理一致的室内场景方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SceneLCM展示了在多样化应用中的广泛潜力。

Abstract: Our project page: https://scutyklin.github.io/SceneLCM/. Automated generation
of complex, interactive indoor scenes tailored to user prompt remains a
formidable challenge. While existing methods achieve indoor scene synthesis,
they struggle with rigid editing constraints, physical incoherence, excessive
human effort, single-room limitations, and suboptimal material quality. To
address these limitations, we propose SceneLCM, an end-to-end framework that
synergizes Large Language Model (LLM) for layout design with Latent Consistency
Model(LCM) for scene optimization. Our approach decomposes scene generation
into four modular pipelines: (1) Layout Generation. We employ LLM-guided 3D
spatial reasoning to convert textual descriptions into parametric blueprints(3D
layout). And an iterative programmatic validation mechanism iteratively refines
layout parameters through LLM-mediated dialogue loops; (2) Furniture
Generation. SceneLCM employs Consistency Trajectory Sampling(CTS), a
consistency distillation sampling loss guided by LCM, to form fast,
semantically rich, and high-quality representations. We also offer two
theoretical justification to demonstrate that our CTS loss is equivalent to
consistency loss and its distillation error is bounded by the truncation error
of the Euler solver; (3) Environment Optimization. We use a multiresolution
texture field to encode the appearance of the scene, and optimize via CTS loss.
To maintain cross-geometric texture coherence, we introduce a normal-aware
cross-attention decoder to predict RGB by cross-attending to the anchors
locations in geometrically heterogeneous instance. (4)Physically Editing.
SceneLCM supports physically editing by integrating physical simulation,
achieved persistent physical realism. Extensive experiments validate SceneLCM's
superiority over state-of-the-art techniques, showing its wide-ranging
potential for diverse applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业面板文本检测存在跨尺度定位和密集文本区域模糊边界的挑战，现有方法多关注单一文本形状，缺乏多尺度特征的综合探索。

Result: 在自建的工业面板监控数据集（IPM）上验证了方法的优越性能，实际测试证明了其在实际应用中的实用性。

Conclusion: EdgeSpotter在工业面板监控任务中表现出色，代码和演示将在GitHub上公开。

Abstract: Text spotting for industrial panels is a key task for intelligent monitoring.
However, achieving efficient and accurate text spotting for complex industrial
panels remains challenging due to issues such as cross-scale localization and
ambiguous boundaries in dense text regions. Moreover, most existing methods
primarily focus on representing a single text shape, neglecting a comprehensive
exploration of multi-scale feature information across different texts. To
address these issues, this work proposes a novel multi-scale dense text spotter
for edge AI-based vision system (EdgeSpotter) to achieve accurate and robust
industrial panel monitoring. Specifically, a novel Transformer with efficient
mixer is developed to learn the interdependencies among multi-level features,
integrating multi-layer spatial and semantic cues. In addition, a new feature
sampling with catmull-rom splines is designed, which explicitly encodes the
shape, position, and semantic information of text, thereby alleviating missed
detections and reducing recognition errors caused by multi-scale or dense text
regions. Furthermore, a new benchmark dataset for industrial panel monitoring
(IPM) is constructed. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
this challenging benchmark dataset validate the superior performance of the
proposed method in different challenging panel monitoring tasks. Finally,
practical tests based on the self-designed edge AI-based vision system
demonstrate the practicality of the method. The code and demo will be available

TLDR: Hi-VAE是一种高效的视频自编码框架，通过分层编码视频动态的粗到细运动表示，显著减少冗余，实现高压缩比和高保真重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频自编码方法未能高效建模动态中的时空冗余，导致压缩效果不佳和下游任务训练成本过高。

Method: Hi-VAE将视频动态分解为全局运动和细节运动两个潜在空间，使用自监督运动编码器压缩视频潜在表示，并通过条件扩散解码器重建视频。

Result: Hi-VAE实现了1428倍的压缩比，远超基线方法（如Cosmos-VAE的48倍），同时保持高质量重建和下游生成任务的有效性。

Conclusion: Hi-VAE在高效压缩和高质量重建方面表现优异，为视频潜在表示和生成提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video autoencoders (Video AEs) have advanced video
generation, but existing methods fail to efficiently model spatio-temporal
redundancies in dynamics, resulting in suboptimal compression factors. This
shortfall leads to excessive training costs for downstream tasks. To address
this, we introduce Hi-VAE, an efficient video autoencoding framework that
hierarchically encode coarse-to-fine motion representations of video dynamics
and formulate the decoding process as a conditional generation task.
Specifically, Hi-VAE decomposes video dynamics into two latent spaces: Global
Motion, capturing overarching motion patterns, and Detailed Motion, encoding
high-frequency spatial details. Using separate self-supervised motion encoders,
we compress video latents into compact motion representations to reduce
redundancy significantly. A conditional diffusion decoder then reconstructs
videos by combining hierarchical global and detailed motions, enabling
high-fidelity video reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Hi-VAE achieves a high compression factor of 1428$\times$, almost 30$\times$
higher than baseline methods (e.g., Cosmos-VAE at 48$\times$), validating the
efficiency of our approach. Meanwhile, Hi-VAE maintains high reconstruction
quality at such high compression rates and performs effectively in downstream
generative tasks. Moreover, Hi-VAE exhibits interpretability and scalability,
providing new perspectives for future exploration in video latent
representation and generation.

Result: 在8个流行视觉语言基准测试中，仅使用基线25%的视觉令牌，性能与基线相当或更优。

Conclusion: STF和MBTF模块有效平衡了令牌减少和信息保留，提升了推理效率且不影响性能。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) suffer significant computational challenges
due to the high cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the quadratic
complexity of processing long vision token sequences. In this paper, we explore
the spatial redundancy among vision tokens and shorten the length of vision
token sequences for inference acceleration. Specifically, we propose a Spatial
Token Fusion (STF) method to learn compact vision tokens for short vision token
sequence, where spatial-adjacent tokens are fused into one. Meanwhile,
weight-frozen vision encoder can not well adapt to the demand of extensive
downstream vision-language tasks. To this end, we further introduce a
Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) module to supplement multi-granularity features
for the reduced token sequence. Overall, we combine STF and MBTF module to
balance token reduction and information preservation, thereby improving
inference efficiency without sacrificing multimodal reasoning capabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on LLaVA-1.5 achieves
comparable or even superior performance to the baseline on 8 popular
vision-language benchmarks with only $25\%$ vision tokens of baseline. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪方法仅依赖模型到帧注册，计算成本高且稳定性不足，GoTrack通过结合帧到帧注册优化性能和效率。

Method: GoTrack使用标准神经网络块（基于DINOv2的Transformer）简化模型到帧注册，并采用轻量级光流模型处理帧到帧注册。

Result: GoTrack与现有粗姿态估计方法结合，在标准6DoF物体姿态估计和跟踪基准上达到RGB-only的先进水平。

Conclusion: GoTrack提供了一种高效、准确的6DoF姿态跟踪解决方案，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: We introduce GoTrack, an efficient and accurate CAD-based method for 6DoF
object pose refinement and tracking, which can handle diverse objects without
any object-specific training. Unlike existing tracking methods that rely solely
on an analysis-by-synthesis approach for model-to-frame registration, GoTrack
additionally integrates frame-to-frame registration, which saves compute and
stabilizes tracking. Both types of registration are realized by optical flow
estimation. The model-to-frame registration is noticeably simpler than in
existing methods, relying only on standard neural network blocks (a transformer
is trained on top of DINOv2) and producing reliable pose confidence scores
without a scoring network. For the frame-to-frame registration, which is an
easier problem as consecutive video frames are typically nearly identical, we
employ a light off-the-shelf optical flow model. We demonstrate that GoTrack
can be seamlessly combined with existing coarse pose estimation methods to
create a minimal pipeline that reaches state-of-the-art RGB-only results on
standard benchmarks for 6DoF object pose estimation and tracking. Our source

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于ORB的SLAM系统在移动平台上实时处理能力不足，主要因Oriented FAST计算耗时。

Method: 通过二进制编码策略快速确定候选点，以及利用低层GPU指令实现可分离Harris检测策略。

Result: 在Jetson TX2上实验显示，平均加速比OpenCV GPU版本快7.3倍。

Conclusion: 方法有效提升实时性，适用于移动和资源受限环境。

Abstract: The visual-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a technology
widely used in applications such as robotic navigation and virtual reality,
which primarily focuses on detecting feature points from visual images to
construct an unknown environmental map and simultaneously determines its own
location. It usually imposes stringent requirements on hardware power
consumption, processing speed and accuracy. Currently, the ORB (Oriented FAST
and Rotated BRIEF)-based SLAM systems have exhibited superior performance in
terms of processing speed and robustness. However, they still fall short of
meeting the demands for real-time processing on mobile platforms. This
limitation is primarily due to the time-consuming Oriented FAST calculations
accounting for approximately half of the entire SLAM system. This paper
presents two methods to accelerate the Oriented FAST feature detection on
low-end embedded GPUs. These methods optimize the most time-consuming steps in
Oriented FAST feature detection: FAST feature point detection and Harris corner
detection, which is achieved by implementing a binary-level encoding strategy
to determine candidate points quickly and a separable Harris detection strategy
with efficient low-level GPU hardware-specific instructions. Extensive
experiments on a Jetson TX2 embedded GPU demonstrate an average speedup of over
7.3 times compared to widely used OpenCV with GPU support. This significant
improvement highlights its effectiveness and potential for real-time
applications in mobile and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: Frame Guidance是一种无需训练、兼容性强且高效的可控视频生成方法。

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video quality,
directing attention to fine-grained controllability. However, many existing
methods depend on fine-tuning large-scale video models for specific tasks,
which becomes increasingly impractical as model sizes continue to grow. In this
work, we present Frame Guidance, a training-free guidance for controllable
video generation based on frame-level signals, such as keyframes, style
reference images, sketches, or depth maps. For practical training-free
guidance, we propose a simple latent processing method that dramatically
reduces memory usage, and apply a novel latent optimization strategy designed
for globally coherent video generation. Frame Guidance enables effective
control across diverse tasks, including keyframe guidance, stylization, and
looping, without any training, compatible with any video models. Experimental
results show that Frame Guidance can produce high-quality controlled videos for
a wide range of tasks and input signals.

Result: 在多个标准图像分类基准上表现出优越的泛化性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为模型训练提供了新的高效范式，验证了其有效性和潜力。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a dominant paradigm, yet its
highly entangled black-box models pose significant challenges in terms of
interpretability and safety assurance. To improve model transparency and
training flexibility, this paper proposes a hierarchical and decoupled
post-training framework tailored for pretrained neural networks. By
reconstructing intermediate feature maps from ground-truth labels, surrogate
supervisory signals are introduced at transitional layers to enable independent
training of specific components, thereby avoiding the complexity and coupling
of conventional end-to-end backpropagation and providing interpretable insights
into networks' internal mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first method to formalize feature-level reverse computation as well-posed
optimization problems, which we rigorously reformulate as systems of linear
equations or least squares problems. This establishes a novel and efficient
training paradigm that extends gradient backpropagation to feature
backpropagation. Extensive experiments on multiple standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior generalization performance and computational efficiency compared to
traditional training approaches, validating its effectiveness and potential.

The surgical action planning (SAP) task, which aims to generate future action
sequences from visual inputs, demands precise and sophisticated analytical
capabilities. Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates
in life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to
ensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to
distinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon
procedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks.
To address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality
dataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform
interpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from
the cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and
introduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the
1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five
fundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152
strategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next
action as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that
leverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current
surgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected
surgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the
broader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
MLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5,
Step-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction
performance.

Conclusion: TV-LiVE为复杂视频编辑任务提供了一种高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Video editing has garnered increasing attention alongside the rapid progress
of diffusion-based video generation models. As part of these advancements,
there is a growing demand for more accessible and controllable forms of video
editing, such as prompt-based editing. Previous studies have primarily focused
on tasks such as style transfer, background replacement, object substitution,
and attribute modification, while maintaining the content structure of the
source video. However, more complex tasks, including the addition of novel
objects and nonrigid transformations, remain relatively unexplored. In this
paper, we present TV-LiVE, a Training-free and text-guided Video editing
framework via Layerinformed Vitality Exploitation. We empirically identify
vital layers within the video generation model that significantly influence the
quality of generated outputs. Notably, these layers are closely associated with
Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). Based on this observation, our method
enables both object addition and non-rigid video editing by selectively
injecting key and value features from the source model into the corresponding
layers of the target model guided by the layer vitality. For object addition,
we further identify prominent layers to extract the mask regions corresponding
to the newly added target prompt. We found that the extracted masks from the
prominent layers faithfully indicate the region to be edited. Experimental
results demonstrate that TV-LiVE outperforms existing approaches for both
object addition and non-rigid video editing. Project Page:

Result: 在MSR-VTT、MSVD、DiDeMo和ActivityNet四个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过改进对比学习，本文方法显著提升了文本-视频检索的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, the explosion of web videos makes text-video retrieval
increasingly essential and popular for video filtering, recommendation, and
search. Text-video retrieval aims to rank relevant text/video higher than
irrelevant ones. The core of this task is to precisely measure the cross-modal
similarity between texts and videos. Recently, contrastive learning methods
have shown promising results for text-video retrieval, most of which focus on
the construction of positive and negative pairs to learn text and video
representations. Nevertheless, they do not pay enough attention to hard
negative pairs and lack the ability to model different levels of semantic
similarity. To address these two issues, this paper improves contrastive
learning using two novel techniques. First, to exploit hard examples for robust
discriminative power, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Attention-Enhanced Module
(DMAE) to mine hard negative pairs from textual and visual clues. By further
introducing a Negative-aware InfoNCE (NegNCE) loss, we are able to adaptively
identify all these hard negatives and explicitly highlight their impacts in the
training loss. Second, our work argues that triplet samples can better model
fine-grained semantic similarity compared to pairwise samples. We thereby
present a new Triplet Partial Margin Contrastive Learning (TPM-CL) module to
construct partial order triplet samples by automatically generating
fine-grained hard negatives for matched text-video pairs. The proposed TPM-CL
designs an adaptive token masking strategy with cross-modal interaction to
model subtle semantic differences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach outperforms existing methods on four widely-used text-video
retrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo and ActivityNet.

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性，为手势识别和动作识别应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial technique in deep learning, particularly for
tasks with limited dataset diversity, such as skeleton-based datasets. This
paper proposes a comprehensive data augmentation framework that integrates
geometric transformations, random cropping, rotation, zooming and
intensity-based transformations, brightness and contrast adjustments to
simulate real-world variations. Random cropping ensures the preservation of
spatio-temporal integrity while addressing challenges such as viewpoint bias
and occlusions. The augmentation pipeline generates three augmented versions
for each sample in addition to the data set sample, thus quadrupling the data
set size and enriching the diversity of gesture representations. The proposed
augmentation strategy is evaluated on three models: multi-stream e2eET, FPPR
point cloud-based hand gesture recognition (HGR), and DD-Network. Experiments
are conducted on benchmark datasets including DHG14/28, SHREC'17, and JHMDB.
The e2eET model, recognized as the state-of-the-art for hand gesture
recognition on DHG14/28 and SHREC'17. The FPPR-PCD model, the second-best
performing model on SHREC'17, excels in point cloud-based gesture recognition.
DD-Net, a lightweight and efficient architecture for skeleton-based action
recognition, is evaluated on SHREC'17 and the Human Motion Data Base (JHMDB).
The results underline the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed
augmentation strategy, significantly improving model generalization and
robustness across diverse datasets and architectures. This framework not only
establishes state-of-the-art results on all three evaluated models but also
offers a scalable solution to advance HGR and action recognition applications
in real-world scenarios. The framework is available at

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently seen significant advancements
through integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs). The VLMs, which process
image and text modalities simultaneously, have demonstrated the ability to
learn and understand the interaction between images and texts across various
multi-modal tasks. Reverse designing, which could be defined as a complex
vision-language task, aims to predict the edits and their parameters, given a
source image, an edited version, and an optional high-level textual edit
description. This task requires VLMs to comprehend the interplay between the
source image, the edited version, and the optional textual context
simultaneously, going beyond traditional vision-language tasks. In this paper,
we extend and fine-tune MiniGPT-4 for the reverse designing task. Our
experiments demonstrate the extensibility of off-the-shelf VLMs, specifically
MiniGPT-4, for more complex tasks such as reverse designing. Code is available

Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但在细粒度视觉差异上容易产生幻觉或遗漏语义变化，主要源于训练数据和目标函数的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences,
leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to
limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these
issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces
minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this
pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K
image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute,
count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss
that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our
approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully
balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual
variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference
detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines,
including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard
vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and
alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs采用静态推理范式，限制了其迭代优化和上下文适应的能力，与人类动态感知形成对比。

Conclusion: 动态推理机制为下一代MLLMs实现细粒度、上下文感知的视觉推理提供了潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
capabilities by integrating visual perception with language understanding,
enabling applications such as image-grounded dialogue, visual question
answering, and scientific analysis. However, most MLLMs adopt a static
inference paradigm, encoding the entire image into fixed visual tokens upfront,
which limits their ability to iteratively refine understanding or adapt to
context during inference. This contrasts sharply with human perception, which
is dynamic, selective, and feedback-driven. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework for inference-time visual token scaling that enables MLLMs to perform
iterative, verifier-guided reasoning over visual content. We formulate the
problem as a Markov Decision Process, involving a reasoner that proposes visual
actions and a verifier, which is trained via multi-step Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), that evaluates these actions and determines when reasoning
should terminate. To support this, we present a new dataset, VTS, comprising
supervised reasoning trajectories (VTS-SFT) and preference-labeled reasoning
comparisons (VTS-DPO). Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches
across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks, offering not only improved accuracy
but also more interpretable and grounded reasoning processes. These results
demonstrate the promise of dynamic inference mechanisms for enabling
fine-grained, context-aware visual reasoning in next-generation MLLMs.

Conclusion: VDMs不仅是生成引擎，还是适应性强的视觉学习器，有望成为未来视觉基础模型的核心。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have emerged as powerful generative tools,
capable of synthesizing high-quality spatiotemporal content. Yet, their
potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training
dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally
pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit
understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal
knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs
for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task
into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short
input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen
VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization
across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose
estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results
reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual
learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation
models in vision.

Result: 在类条件和文本条件图像生成任务中表现优异，接近扩散模型的样本质量。

Conclusion: 首次证明了归一化流在大规模高分辨率图像生成中的有效性。

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

Motivation: 现有方法（如MPGD）每去噪步骤仅应用单次梯度更新，限制了恢复质量和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在超分辨率和高斯去模糊任务中提升了LPIPS和PSNR，且在嵌入式设备上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: MPGD具有作为轻量级、即插即用恢复模块的潜力，适用于无人机和移动机器人等实时视觉感知任务。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable flexibility for solving inverse
problems without task-specific retraining. However, existing approaches such as
Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update
per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in
embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a
multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly
enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our
experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that
increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with
minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin
Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally
trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes.
Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play
restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such
as drones and mobile robots.

Conclusion: FANVID旨在促进低分辨率识别中时序建模的创新，适用于监控、法医学和自动驾驶等领域。

Abstract: Real-world surveillance often renders faces and license plates unrecognizable
in individual low-resolution (LR) frames, hindering reliable identification. To
advance temporal recognition models, we present FANVID, a novel video-based
benchmark comprising nearly 1,463 LR clips (180 x 320, 20--60 FPS) featuring 63
identities and 49 license plates from three English-speaking countries. Each
video includes distractor faces and plates, increasing task difficulty and
realism. The dataset contains 31,096 manually verified bounding boxes and
labels.
  FANVID defines two tasks: (1) face matching -- detecting LR faces and
matching them to high-resolution mugshots, and (2) license plate recognition --
extracting text from LR plates without a predefined database. Videos are
downsampled from high-resolution sources to ensure that faces and text are
indecipherable in single frames, requiring models to exploit temporal
information. We introduce evaluation metrics adapted from mean Average
Precision at IoU > 0.5, prioritizing identity correctness for faces and
character-level accuracy for text.
  A baseline method with pre-trained video super-resolution, detection, and
recognition achieved performance scores of 0.58 (face matching) and 0.42 (plate
recognition), highlighting both the feasibility and challenge of the tasks.
FANVID's selection of faces and plates balances diversity with recognition
challenge. We release the software for data access, evaluation, baseline, and
annotation to support reproducibility and extension. FANVID aims to catalyze
innovation in temporal modeling for LR recognition, with applications in
surveillance, forensics, and autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: We introduce AllTracker: a model that estimates long-range point tracks by
way of estimating the flow field between a query frame and every other frame of
a video. Unlike existing point tracking methods, our approach delivers
high-resolution and dense (all-pixel) correspondence fields, which can be
visualized as flow maps. Unlike existing optical flow methods, our approach
corresponds one frame to hundreds of subsequent frames, rather than just the
next frame. We develop a new architecture for this task, blending techniques
from existing work in optical flow and point tracking: the model performs
iterative inference on low-resolution grids of correspondence estimates,
propagating information spatially via 2D convolution layers, and propagating
information temporally via pixel-aligned attention layers. The model is fast
and parameter-efficient (16 million parameters), and delivers state-of-the-art
point tracking accuracy at high resolution (i.e., tracking 768x1024 pixels, on
a 40G GPU). A benefit of our design is that we can train on a wider set of
datasets, and we find that doing so is crucial for top performance. We provide
an extensive ablation study on our architecture details and training recipe,
making it clear which details matter most. Our code and model weights are

Result: 实验表明许多显著性方法对类标签不敏感，而CASE能生成更忠实且类特定的解释。

Conclusion: CASE方法在类敏感性和解释忠实性上优于现有方法，揭示了显著性方法的结构性缺陷。

Abstract: Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed
relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can
obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for
class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class
labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many
widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless
of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that
class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets,
suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated
by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that
isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate
CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and
show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than
existing methods.

Result: 在模拟IIN基准测试中达到最先进性能，并具有实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 提出的分层评分方法显著提升了IIN的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Instance Image-Goal Navigation (IIN) requires autonomous agents to identify
and navigate to a target object or location depicted in a reference image
captured from any viewpoint. While recent methods leverage powerful novel view
synthesis (NVS) techniques, such as three-dimensional Gaussian splatting
(3DGS), they typically rely on randomly sampling multiple viewpoints or
trajectories to ensure comprehensive coverage of discriminative visual cues.
This approach, however, creates significant redundancy through overlapping
image samples and lacks principled view selection, substantially increasing
both rendering and comparison overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel IIN
framework with a hierarchical scoring paradigm that estimates optimal
viewpoints for target matching. Our approach integrates cross-level semantic
scoring, utilizing CLIP-derived relevancy fields to identify regions with high
semantic similarity to the target object class, with fine-grained local
geometric scoring that performs precise pose estimation within promising
regions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on simulated IIN benchmarks and real-world
applicability.

Abstract: Object detection is vital in precision agriculture for plant monitoring,
disease detection, and yield estimation. However, models like YOLO struggle
with occlusions, irregular structures, and background noise, reducing detection
accuracy. While Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) improve spatial invariance
through learned transformations, affine mappings are insufficient for non-rigid
deformations such as bent leaves and overlaps.
  We propose CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO, a model integrating Thin-Plate Splines (TPS)
into STNs for flexible, non-rigid spatial transformations that better align
features. Performance is further enhanced by the Convolutional Block Attention
Module (CBAM), which suppresses background noise and emphasizes relevant
spatial and channel-wise features.
  On the occlusion-heavy Plant Growth and Phenotyping (PGP) dataset, our model
outperforms STN-YOLO in precision, recall, and mAP. It achieves a 12% reduction
in false positives, highlighting the benefits of improved spatial flexibility
and attention-guided refinement. We also examine the impact of the TPS
regularization parameter in balancing transformation smoothness and detection
performance.
  This lightweight model improves spatial awareness and supports real-time edge
deployment, making it ideal for smart farming applications requiring accurate
and efficient monitoring.

Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在多目标图像上表现不佳，MOS旨在通过合成多目标图像并提供额外对象对应关系来改进表示。

Method: 通过拼接单目标图像生成多目标图像，利用预定义的对象对应关系优化无监督表示。

Result: 在ImageNet、CIFAR和COCO数据集上，MOS在单目标和多目标图像上均取得领先的无监督表示性能。

Conclusion: MOS是一种简单有效的方法，能够显著提升多目标图像的无监督表示性能。

Abstract: Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable
progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on
the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the
unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct
the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the
objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence,
compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional
object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations.
In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each
object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for
complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic
segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised
representation performance on both single object centric images and
multi-object ones. The source code is available at

Conclusion: C3S3模型在边界细节和整体精度上表现优异，为医学图像分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: For the immanent challenge of insufficiently annotated samples in the medical
field, semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) offers a promising
solution. Despite achieving impressive results in delineating primary target
areas, most current methodologies struggle to precisely capture the subtle
details of boundaries. This deficiency often leads to significant diagnostic
inaccuracies. To tackle this issue, we introduce C3S3, a novel semi-supervised
segmentation model that synergistically integrates complementary competition
and contrastive selection. This design significantly sharpens boundary
delineation and enhances overall precision. Specifically, we develop an
$\textit{Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning}$ module dedicated to refining
boundary localization. Additionally, we incorporate a $\textit{Dynamic
Complementary Competition}$ module that leverages two high-performing
sub-networks to generate pseudo-labels, thereby further improving segmentation
quality. The proposed C3S3 undergoes rigorous validation on two publicly
accessible datasets, encompassing the practices of both MRI and CT scans. The
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to
previous cutting-edge competitors. Especially, on the 95HD and ASD metrics, our
approach achieves a notable improvement of at least $6\%$, highlighting the
significant advancements. The code is available at

Abstract: The rise of deep generative models has greatly advanced video compression,
reshaping the paradigm of face video coding through their powerful capability
for semantic-aware representation and lifelike synthesis. Generative Face Video
Coding (GFVC) stands at the forefront of this revolution, which could
characterize complex facial dynamics into compact latent codes for bitstream
compactness at the encoder side and leverages powerful deep generative models
to reconstruct high-fidelity face signal from the compressed latent codes at
the decoder side. As such, this well-designed GFVC paradigm could enable
high-fidelity face video communication at ultra-low bitrate ranges, far
surpassing the capabilities of the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC)
standard. To pioneer foundational research and accelerate the evolution of
GFVC, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of GFVC technologies,
systematically bridging critical gaps between theoretical innovation and
industrial standardization. In particular, we first review a broad range of
existing GFVC methods with different feature representations and optimization
strategies, and conduct a thorough benchmarking analysis. In addition, we
construct a large-scale GFVC-compressed face video database with subjective
Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) based on human perception, aiming to identify the
most appropriate quality metrics tailored to GFVC. Moreover, we summarize the
GFVC standardization potentials with a unified high-level syntax and develop a
low-complexity GFVC system which are both expected to push forward future
practical deployments and applications. Finally, we envision the potential of
GFVC in industrial applications and deliberate on the current challenges and
future opportunities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于VideoLLM在自由形式任务（如视频字幕）中幻觉问题严重，现有基准（如多选题）无法全面评估其性能。

Method: 提出ARGUS基准，通过对比模型生成的字幕与人类真实字幕，量化幻觉（错误内容）和遗漏（重要细节缺失）问题。

Result: ARGUS提供了双重指标：幻觉率和遗漏率，全面评估视频字幕性能。

Conclusion: ARGUS为VideoLLM的自由形式任务性能提供了更全面的评估方法。

Abstract: Video large language models have not yet been widely deployed, largely due to
their tendency to hallucinate. Typical benchmarks for Video-LLMs rely simply on
multiple-choice questions. Unfortunately, VideoLLMs hallucinate far more
aggressively on freeform text generation tasks like video captioning than they
do on multiple choice verification tasks. To address this weakness, we propose
ARGUS, a VideoLLM benchmark that measures freeform video captioning
performance. By comparing VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions,
ARGUS quantifies dual metrics. First, we measure the rate of hallucinations in
the form of incorrect statements about video content or temporal relationships.
Second, we measure the rate at which the model omits important descriptive
details. Together, these dual metrics form a comprehensive view of video
captioning performance.

Result: 在V2X-Real和OPV2V数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为多类别道路用户提供了高效的协作检测与跟踪解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception plays a crucial role in enhancing environmental
understanding by expanding the perceptual range and improving robustness
against sensor failures, which primarily involves collaborative 3D detection
and tracking tasks. The former focuses on object recognition in individual
frames, while the latter captures continuous instance tracklets over time.
However, existing works in both areas predominantly focus on the vehicle
superclass, lacking effective solutions for both multi-class collaborative
detection and tracking. This limitation hinders their applicability in
real-world scenarios, which involve diverse object classes with varying
appearances and motion patterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
multi-class collaborative detection and tracking framework tailored for diverse
road users. We first present a detector with a global spatial attention fusion
(GSAF) module, enhancing multi-scale feature learning for objects of varying
sizes. Next, we introduce a tracklet RE-IDentification (REID) module that
leverages visual semantics with a vision foundation model to effectively reduce
ID SWitch (IDSW) errors, in cases of erroneous mismatches involving small
objects like pedestrians. We further design a velocity-based adaptive tracklet
management (VATM) module that adjusts the tracking interval dynamically based
on object motion. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Real and OPV2V datasets show
that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in both detection and tracking accuracy.

Method: 提出域特征导航器（DFN）作为结构化解耦器，结合SAM-SVN方法防止过拟合。

Result: 在1-shot和5-shot场景下，分别超越现有方法2.69%和4.68% MIoU。

Conclusion: DFN和SAM-SVN方法有效解决了跨域少样本分割问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to pre-train the
model on a source-domain dataset with sufficient samples, and then transfer the
model to target-domain datasets where only a few samples are available for
efficient fine-tuning. There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the
domain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we
revisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not
explored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of
downstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler.
Then, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's
inherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information.
Building upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN),
which is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current
works, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's
attention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential
excessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further
design the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific
knowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to
learn target-specific knowledge specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly
by 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.

Result: 在多个数据集和主流视觉语言模型上验证了MrM的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MrM填补了视觉模态攻击的空白，为多模态RAG系统的隐私保护提供了新视角。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large
vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their
increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge
databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection.
However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access
to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks,
particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods
targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the
visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we
propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG
systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by
counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to
retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership
information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method
to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval.
Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to
prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the
interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we
perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract
features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response
patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial
visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves
consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level
evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.

Result: 数据集具有代表性，但现有指标未能完全捕捉压缩特征的语义退化，需要更精细的指标。

Conclusion: 论文为CFQA研究提供了基础资源，并呼吁开发更有效的语义失真评估方法。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large models in resource-constrained
environments has underscored the need for efficient transmission of
intermediate feature representations. In this context, feature coding, which
compresses features into compact bitstreams, becomes a critical component for
scenarios involving feature transmission, storage, and reuse. However, this
compression process introduces inherent semantic degradation that is
notoriously difficult to quantify with traditional metrics. To address this,
this paper introduces the research problem of Compressed Feature Quality
Assessment (CFQA), which seeks to evaluate the semantic fidelity of compressed
features. To advance CFQA research, we propose the first benchmark dataset,
comprising 300 original features and 12000 compressed features derived from
three vision tasks and four feature codecs. Task-specific performance drops are
provided as true semantic distortion for the evaluation of CFQA metrics. We
assess the performance of three widely used metrics (MSE, cosine similarity,
and Centered Kernel Alignment) in capturing semantic degradation. The results
underscore the representativeness of the dataset and highlight the need for
more refined metrics capable of addressing the nuances of semantic distortion
in compressed features. To facilitate the ongoing development of CFQA research,
we release the dataset and all accompanying source code at
\href{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}.
This contribution aims to advance the field and provide a foundational resource

Conclusion: DPFormer通过提示方案有效解决了持续学习中的关键问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: In continual learning, solving the catastrophic forgetting problem may make
the models fall into the stability-plasticity dilemma. Moreover, inter-task
confusion will also occur due to the lack of knowledge exchanges between
different tasks. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a
novel dynamic prompt transformer (DPFormer) with prompt schemes. The prompt
schemes help the DPFormer memorize learned knowledge of previous classes and
tasks, and keep on learning new knowledge from new classes and tasks under a
single network structure with a nearly fixed number of model parameters.
Moreover, they also provide discrepant information to represent different tasks
to solve the inter-task confusion problem. Based on prompt schemes, a unified
classification module with the binary cross entropy loss, the knowledge
distillation loss and the auxiliary loss is proposed to train the whole model
in an end-to-end trainable manner. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our
method achieves the best performance in the CIFAR-100, ImageNet100 and
ImageNet1K datasets under different class-incremental settings in continual
learning. The source code will be available at our GitHub after acceptance.

Conclusion: 该模型通过特征感知和Mamba增强，显著提升了超声图像分割的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Accurate ultrasound image segmentation is a prerequisite for precise
biometrics and accurate assessment. Relying on manual delineation introduces
significant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models
are designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt
to ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly
evident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs.
Therefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image
segmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address
these challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent
viewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were
designed to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve
the fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized
residual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and
enhances local multi-dimensional scanning. The system builds global information
and local feature dependencies, and is trained with a combination of different
optimizers to achieve the optimal solution. After extensive experimental
validation, the FAMSeg network achieved the fastest loss reduction and the best
segmentation performance across images of varying sizes and orientations.

Abstract: The recent emergence of multimodal large language models (LLMs) has
introduced new opportunities for improving visual hazard recognition on
construction sites. Unlike traditional computer vision models that rely on
domain-specific training and extensive datasets, modern LLMs can interpret and
describe complex visual scenes using simple natural language prompts. However,
despite growing interest in their applications, there has been limited
investigation into how different LLMs perform in safety-critical visual tasks
within the construction domain. To address this gap, this study conducts a
comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5,
GPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify
potential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested
under three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought
(CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated
basic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided
step-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative
analysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all
conditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced
performance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across
models. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with
GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings. The findings also
demonstrate the critical role of prompt design in enhancing the accuracy and
consistency of multimodal LLMs for construction safety applications. This study
offers actionable insights into the integration of prompt engineering and LLMs
for practical hazard recognition, contributing to the development of more
reliable AI-assisted safety systems.

Abstract: Driven by advancements in motion capture and generative artificial
intelligence, leveraging large-scale MoCap datasets to train generative models
for synthesizing diverse, realistic human motions has become a promising
research direction. However, existing motion-capture techniques and generative
models often neglect physical constraints, leading to artifacts such as
interpenetration, sliding, and floating. These issues are exacerbated in
multi-person motion generation, where complex interactions are involved. To
address these limitations, we introduce physical mapping, integrated throughout
the human interaction generation pipeline. Specifically, motion imitation
within a physics-based simulation environment is used to project target motions
into a physically valid space. The resulting motions are adjusted to adhere to
real-world physics constraints while retaining their original semantic meaning.
This mapping not only improves MoCap data quality but also directly informs
post-processing of generated motions. Given the unique interactivity of
multi-person scenarios, we propose a tailored motion representation framework.
Motion Consistency (MC) and Marker-based Interaction (MI) loss functions are
introduced to improve model performance. Experiments show our method achieves
impressive results in generated human motion quality, with a 3%-89% improvement
in physical fidelity. Project page http://yw0208.github.io/physiinter

Conclusion: GLOS通过gloss级条件和TAC模块，显著提升了手语生成的质量。

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG), or text-to-sign generation, bridges the gap
between signers and non-signers. Despite recent progress in SLG, existing
methods still often suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic
accuracy. This is primarily due to sentence-level condition, which encodes the
entire sentence of the input text into a single feature vector as a condition
for SLG. This approach fails to capture the temporal structure of sign language
and lacks the granularity of word-level semantics, often leading to disordered
sign sequences and ambiguous motions. To overcome these limitations, we propose
GLOS, a sign language generation framework with temporally aligned gloss-level
conditioning. First, we employ gloss-level conditions, which we define as
sequences of gloss embeddings temporally aligned with the motion sequence. This
enables the model to access both the temporal structure of sign language and
word-level semantics at each timestep. As a result, this allows for
fine-grained control of signs and better preservation of lexical order. Second,
we introduce a condition fusion module, temporal alignment conditioning (TAC),
to efficiently deliver the word-level semantic and temporal structure provided
by the gloss-level condition to the corresponding motion timesteps. Our method,
which is composed of gloss-level conditions and TAC, generates signs with
correct lexical order and high semantic accuracy, outperforming prior methods
on CSL-Daily and Phoenix-2014T.

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement
algorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO
to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this
paper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that
impede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the
vanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose
DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO
(Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO
reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the
advantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping
and min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning
the model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data
augmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable
difficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our
comprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video
reasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种处理部分相关视频检索（PRVR）中文本-视频对模糊性的框架ARL，通过多正对比学习和双重三元组损失优化语义关系，并在文本-帧级别进一步学习，最终提升了PRVR的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PRVR训练假设文本查询与视频是一对一关系，忽略了文本与视频内容之间的模糊性。本文提出这种模糊性会影响模型学习，需加以处理。

Method: 提出ARL框架，通过不确定性和相似性检测模糊对，采用多正对比学习和双重三元组损失分层学习语义关系，并在文本-帧级别细化学习。

Result: ARL框架有效提升了PRVR的性能，解决了文本-视频对模糊性问题。

Conclusion: ARL通过处理模糊性和多层次学习，显著提升了PRVR的效果，为类似任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval~(PRVR) aims to retrieve a video where a
specific segment is relevant to a given text query. Typical training processes
of PRVR assume a one-to-one relationship where each text query is relevant to
only one video. However, we point out the inherent ambiguity between text and
video content based on their conceptual scope and propose a framework that
incorporates this ambiguity into the model learning process. Specifically, we
propose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous
text-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria:
uncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include
commonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates
pair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL
hierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive
learning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained
relationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the
text-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the
inherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often
contains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the
text-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to
mitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to
detect ambiguous pairs for its training. With all components combined, our
proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in PRVR.

Motivation: 现有提示调优方法中，冻结编码器产生的特征可能导致类别混淆，限制了模型的专业化能力。同时，如何在保持专业化的同时提升泛化能力是一个挑战。

Result: 实验表明，CoCoA-Mix在专业化和泛化方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoCoA-Mix通过结合CoA-loss和CoA-weights，有效解决了提示调优中的专业化和泛化问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Prompt tuning, which adapts vision-language models by freezing model
parameters and optimizing only the prompt, has proven effective for
task-specific adaptations. The core challenge in prompt tuning is improving
specialization for a specific task and generalization for unseen domains.
However, frozen encoders often produce misaligned features, leading to
confusion between classes and limiting specialization. To overcome this issue,
we propose a confusion-aware loss (CoA-loss) that improves specialization by
refining the decision boundaries between confusing classes. Additionally, we
mathematically demonstrate that a mixture model can enhance generalization
without compromising specialization. This is achieved using confidence-aware
weights (CoA-weights), which adjust the weights of each prediction in the
mixture model based on its confidence within the class domains. Extensive
experiments show that CoCoA-Mix, a mixture model with CoA-loss and CoA-weights,
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing specialization and
generalization. Our code is publicly available at

TLDR: DriveAnyMesh是一种基于单目视频驱动网格的方法，解决了当前4D生成技术在渲染引擎中的效率与兼容性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D生成技术存在渲染效率低、骨骼方法手动工作量大且缺乏跨类别泛化能力的问题。

Method: 提出一种4D扩散模型，通过去噪潜在集序列并解码为网格动画，利用基于变压器的变分自编码器捕捉3D形状与运动信息。

Result: 实验表明，DriveAnyMesh能快速生成高质量复杂运动动画，且兼容现代渲染引擎。

Conclusion: 该方法在游戏和电影行业具有应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose DriveAnyMesh, a method for driving mesh guided by monocular video.
Current 4D generation techniques encounter challenges with modern rendering
engines. Implicit methods have low rendering efficiency and are unfriendly to
rasterization-based engines, while skeletal methods demand significant manual
effort and lack cross-category generalization. Animating existing 3D assets,
instead of creating 4D assets from scratch, demands a deep understanding of the
input's 3D structure. To tackle these challenges, we present a 4D diffusion
model that denoises sequences of latent sets, which are then decoded to produce
mesh animations from point cloud trajectory sequences. These latent sets
leverage a transformer-based variational autoencoder, simultaneously capturing
3D shape and motion information. By employing a spatiotemporal,
transformer-based diffusion model, information is exchanged across multiple
latent frames, enhancing the efficiency and generalization of the generated
results. Our experimental results demonstrate that DriveAnyMesh can rapidly
produce high-quality animations for complex motions and is compatible with
modern rendering engines. This method holds potential for applications in both
the gaming and filming industries.

Abstract: SpatialLM is a large language model designed to process 3D point cloud data

  To train SpatialLM, we collect a large-scale, high-quality synthetic dataset
consisting of the point clouds of 12,328 indoor scenes (54,778 rooms) with
ground-truth 3D annotations, and conduct a careful study on various modeling
and training decisions. On public benchmarks, our model gives state-of-the-art
performance in layout estimation and competitive results in 3D object
detection. With that, we show a feasible path for enhancing the spatial
understanding capabilities of modern LLMs for applications in augmented
reality, embodied robotics, and more.

consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a
DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR
generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are
directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution

segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical
utility of the generated data.

Motivation: 优化大型语言模型的长上下文推理时，KV缓存的高内存消耗是主要挑战，现有量化方法无法兼顾效率与效果。

Method: 提出MoQAE方法，将不同量化位宽配置视为专家，采用分块输入的路由器选择最优配置，并设计轻量级路由器微调过程。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，MoQAE在效率和效果上均优于现有KV缓存量化方法。

Conclusion: MoQAE通过混合精度量化和优化路由机制，有效平衡了模型精度与内存使用。

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for
long-context inference lies in the high memory consumption of the Key-Value
(KV) cache. Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated
promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization
methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this
paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via
mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization
bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts
(MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency
caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE
method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a
lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive
loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally,
we introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to
further reduce the inference overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KV
cache quantization approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: This paper addresses key aspects of domain randomization in generating
synthetic data for manufacturing object detection applications. To this end, we
present a comprehensive data generation pipeline that reflects different
factors: object characteristics, background, illumination, camera settings, and
post-processing. We also introduce the Synthetic Industrial Parts Object
Detection dataset (SIP15-OD) consisting of 15 objects from three industrial use
cases under varying environments as a test bed for the study, while also
employing an industrial dataset publicly available for robotic applications. In
our experiments, we present more abundant results and insights into the
feasibility as well as challenges of sim-to-real object detection. In
particular, we identified material properties, rendering methods,
post-processing, and distractors as important factors. Our method, leveraging
these, achieves top performance on the public dataset with Yolov8 models
trained exclusively on synthetic data; mAP@50 scores of 96.4% for the robotics
dataset, and 94.1%, 99.5%, and 95.3% across three of the SIP15-OD use cases,
respectively. The results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed domain
randomization, potentially covering the distribution close to real data for the
applications.

Motivation: OCT设备成本高且依赖专业操作人员，限制了其广泛应用；2D眼底摄影更易获取，但缺乏3D信息。生成AI在医学图像合成中表现良好，但2D到3D的转换存在挑战。

Method: 挑战赛提供了基准数据集和评估方法（图像和视频级指标），吸引了342个团队参与。领先方法包括混合数据预处理、预训练、视觉基础模型集成和架构改进。

Result: 42个初步提交和9个决赛方案展示了生成3D OCT图像的可行性，为医疗研究和临床应用提供了新方向。

Conclusion: APTOS-2024挑战赛首次验证了2D到3D OCT合成的潜力，有助于提升资源匮乏地区的眼科护理可及性。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution, 3D, and
non-invasive visualization of retinal layers in vivo, serving as a critical
tool for lesion localization and disease diagnosis. However, its widespread
adoption is limited by equipment costs and the need for specialized operators.
In comparison, 2D color fundus photography offers faster acquisition and
greater accessibility with less dependence on expensive devices. Although
generative artificial intelligence has demonstrated promising results in
medical image synthesis, translating 2D fundus images into 3D OCT images
presents unique challenges due to inherent differences in data dimensionality
and biological information between modalities. To advance generative models in
the fundus-to-3D-OCT setting, the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society
(APTOS-2024) organized a challenge titled Artificial Intelligence-based OCT
Generation from Fundus Images. This paper details the challenge framework
(referred to as APTOS-2024 Challenge), including: the benchmark dataset,
evaluation methodology featuring two fidelity metrics-image-based distance
(pixel-level OCT B-scan similarity) and video-based distance (semantic-level
volumetric consistency), and analysis of top-performing solutions. The
challenge attracted 342 participating teams, with 42 preliminary submissions
and 9 finalists. Leading methodologies incorporated innovations in hybrid data
preprocessing or augmentation (cross-modality collaborative paradigms),
pre-training on external ophthalmic imaging datasets, integration of vision
foundation models, and model architecture improvement. The APTOS-2024 Challenge
is the first benchmark demonstrating the feasibility of fundus-to-3D-OCT
synthesis as a potential solution for improving ophthalmic care accessibility
in under-resourced healthcare settings, while helping to expedite medical
research and clinical applications.

Result: 在LSUN Bedroom和MM CelebA HQ数据集上，SPTI的FID显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SPTI提供了一种高效且兼容现有模型的高分辨率差分隐私图像生成框架。

Abstract: Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers
a promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without
compromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods
struggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the
structure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method,
referred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can
generate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift
the challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by
leveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes
each private image into a concise textual description using image to text
models, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP
text, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI
requires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a
private dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality
than prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less
than or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private
Evolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less
than or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine
tuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private
Textual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model
compatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images,
greatly expanding access to private visual datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 现有H&E-to-IHC研究常忽略细胞核与细胞膜的跨通道相关性，限制了病理图像分析与诊断的准确性。

Method: CCPL将HER2免疫组化染色分解为Hematoxylin和DAB染色通道，利用Gigapath的Tile Encoder提取双通道特征并计算跨通道相关性，同时通过特征蒸馏损失和光学密度统计分析提升模型性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，CCPL在PSNR、SSIM、PCC和FID等指标上表现优异，生成的虚拟染色图像质量高，且得到病理学家的专业认可。

Conclusion: CCPL能有效保留病理特征，生成高质量虚拟染色图像，为多媒体医疗数据的自动化病理诊断提供支持。

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital pathology, virtual staining has become
a key technology in multimedia medical information systems, offering new
possibilities for the analysis and diagnosis of pathological images. However,
existing H&E-to-IHC studies often overlook the cross-channel correlations
between cell nuclei and cell membranes. To address this issue, we propose a
novel Cross-Channel Perception Learning (CCPL) strategy. Specifically, CCPL
first decomposes HER2 immunohistochemical staining into Hematoxylin and DAB
staining channels, corresponding to cell nuclei and cell membranes,
respectively. Using the pathology foundation model Gigapath's Tile Encoder,
CCPL extracts dual-channel features from both the generated and real images and
measures cross-channel correlations between nuclei and membranes. The features
of the generated and real stained images, obtained through the Tile Encoder,
are also used to calculate feature distillation loss, enhancing the model's
feature extraction capabilities without increasing the inference burden.
Additionally, CCPL performs statistical analysis on the focal optical density
maps of both single channels to ensure consistency in staining distribution and
intensity. Experimental results, based on quantitative metrics such as PSNR,
SSIM, PCC, and FID, along with professional evaluations from pathologists,
demonstrate that CCPL effectively preserves pathological features, generates
high-quality virtual stained images, and provides robust support for automated
pathological diagnosis using multimedia medical data.

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation offers significant creative potential yet faces
considerable challenges. The absence of fine-grained multimodal data and the
difficulty of flexible multi-conditional generation limit previous works on
generation controllability and diversity in practice. In this paper, we build
OpenDance5D, an extensive human dance dataset comprising over 101 hours across
14 distinct genres. Each sample has five modalities to facilitate robust
cross-modal learning: RGB video, audio, 2D keypoints, 3D motion, and
fine-grained textual descriptions from human arts. Furthermore, we propose
OpenDanceNet, a unified masked modeling framework for controllable dance
generation conditioned on music and arbitrary combinations of text prompts,
keypoints, or character positioning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenDanceNet achieves high-fidelity and flexible controllability.

Abstract: This paper investigates the task of writer retrieval, which identifies
documents authored by the same individual within a dataset based on handwriting
similarities. While existing datasets and methodologies primarily focus on page
level retrieval, we explore the impact of text quantity on writer retrieval
performance by evaluating line- and word level retrieval. We examine three
state-of-the-art writer retrieval systems, including both handcrafted and deep
learning-based approaches, and analyze their performance using varying amounts
of text. Our experiments on the CVL and IAM dataset demonstrate that while
performance decreases by 20-30% when only one line of text is used as query and
gallery, retrieval accuracy remains above 90% of full-page performance when at
least four lines are included. We further show that text-dependent retrieval
can maintain strong performance in low-text scenarios. Our findings also
highlight the limitations of handcrafted features in low-text scenarios, with
deep learning-based methods like NetVLAD outperforming traditional VLAD
encoding.

Result: OptiScene在布局生成质量和成功率上优于传统方法，并展示了在交互任务中的潜力。

Conclusion: OptiScene为室内布局生成提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to
its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and
embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven
approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and
learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models.
Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high
computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by
coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization
to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout
generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines
synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline,
upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000
scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and
bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations.
We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor
layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our
two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then
conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II,
to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply
multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving
layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based
baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks
such as scene editing and robot navigation.

Abstract: Lipreading is a challenging cross-modal task that aims to convert visual lip
movements into spoken text. Existing lipreading methods often extract visual
features that include speaker-specific lip attributes (e.g., shape, color,
texture), which introduce spurious correlations between vision and text. These
correlations lead to suboptimal lipreading accuracy and restrict model
generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce SIFLip, a
speaker-invariant visual feature learning framework that disentangles
speaker-specific attributes using two complementary disentanglement modules
(Implicit Disentanglement and Explicit Disentanglement) to improve
generalization. Specifically, since different speakers exhibit semantic
consistency between lip movements and phonetic text when pronouncing the same
words, our implicit disentanglement module leverages stable text embeddings as
supervisory signals to learn common visual representations across speakers,
implicitly decoupling speaker-specific features. Additionally, we design a
speaker recognition sub-task within the main lipreading pipeline to filter
speaker-specific features, then further explicitly disentangle these
personalized visual features from the backbone network via gradient reversal.
Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly enhances
generalization performance across multiple public datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly improves generalization
performance across multiple public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods.

*Ruiyang Zhang,Hu Zhang,Hao Fei,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了Uncertainty-o框架，用于评估和量化大型多模态模型（LMMs）的不确定性，并通过实验验证其在多种任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LMMs被认为比纯语言模型更鲁棒，但其不确定性评估仍存在三个关键问题：统一评估方法、如何提示LMMs显示不确定性以及如何量化不确定性。

Method: 提出Uncertainty-o框架，包括模型无关的不确定性揭示方法、多模态提示扰动的实证研究以及多模态语义不确定性的量化公式。

Result: 在18个基准测试和10种LMMs上的实验表明，Uncertainty-o能可靠估计LMMs的不确定性，并提升下游任务（如幻觉检测和缓解）的性能。

Conclusion: Uncertainty-o为LMMs的不确定性评估提供了统一且有效的解决方案，推动了多模态模型在实际任务中的应用。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), harnessing the complementarity among diverse
modalities, are often considered more robust than pure Language Large Models
(LLMs); yet do LMMs know what they do not know? There are three key open
questions remaining: (1) how to evaluate the uncertainty of diverse LMMs in a
unified manner, (2) how to prompt LMMs to show its uncertainty, and (3) how to
quantify uncertainty for downstream tasks. In an attempt to address these
challenges, we introduce Uncertainty-o: (1) a model-agnostic framework designed
to reveal uncertainty in LMMs regardless of their modalities, architectures, or
capabilities, (2) an empirical exploration of multimodal prompt perturbations
to uncover LMM uncertainty, offering insights and findings, and (3) derive the
formulation of multimodal semantic uncertainty, which enables quantifying
uncertainty from multimodal responses. Experiments across 18 benchmarks
spanning various modalities and 10 LMMs (both open- and closed-source)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Uncertainty-o in reliably estimating LMM
uncertainty, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as hallucination
detection, hallucination mitigation, and uncertainty-aware Chain-of-Thought
reasoning.

*Boyu Chen,Siran Chen,Kunchang Li,Qinglin Xu,Yu Qiao,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种统一的超级编码网络（SEN），通过递归关联多模态编码器来增强视频理解任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态基础模型仅通过对比学习对齐不同模态的编码器，缺乏更深层次的多模态交互，限制了复杂视频场景的理解能力。

Method: 将预训练编码器视为“超级神经元”，设计递归关联（RA）块，以递归方式融合多模态信息。

Result: SEN显著提升了四种代表性视频任务（跟踪、识别、聊天和编辑）的性能，例如跟踪任务的Jaccard指数提高2.7%。

Conclusion: SEN通过递归多模态交互有效提升了视频理解能力，为下游任务提供了强大支持。

Abstract: Video understanding has been considered as one critical step towards world
modeling, which is an important long-term problem in AI research. Recently,
multi-modal foundation models have shown such potential via large-scale
pretraining. However, these models simply align encoders of different
modalities via contrastive learning, while lacking deeper multi-modal
interactions, which is critical for understanding complex target movements with
diversified video scenes. To fill this gap, we propose a unified Super Encoding
Network (SEN) for video understanding, which builds up such distinct
interactions through recursive association of multi-modal encoders in the
foundation models. Specifically, we creatively treat those well-trained
encoders as "super neurons" in our SEN. Via designing a Recursive Association
(RA) block, we progressively fuse multi-modalities with the input video, based
on knowledge integrating, distributing, and prompting of super neurons in a
recursive manner. In this way, our SEN can effectively encode deeper
multi-modal interactions, for prompting various video understanding tasks in
downstream. Extensive experiments show that, our SEN can remarkably boost the
four most representative video tasks, including tracking, recognition,
chatting, and editing, e.g., for pixel-level tracking, the average jaccard
index improves 2.7%, temporal coherence(TC) drops 8.8% compared to the popular
CaDeX++ approach. For one-shot video editing, textual alignment improves 6.4%,
and frame consistency increases 4.1% compared to the popular TuneA-Video
approach.

TLDR: 研究发现扩散模型API可能被用于生成合成图像，进而训练高性能替代模型，从而对黑盒分类模型进行模型提取和对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的高保真图像生成能力可能被恶意利用，导致安全和隐私风险，如版权侵犯、敏感信息泄露等。

Method: 通过扩散模型API生成高分辨率、多样化的合成图像，用于训练替代模型，以最小查询量实现模型提取和对抗攻击。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，方法平均提升27.37%，仅需0.01倍查询预算，对抗攻击成功率达98.68%。

Conclusion: 扩散模型API可能成为新的安全威胁，需加强防范措施。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and
photorealistic image generation across diverse applications. However, these
models also present security and privacy risks, including copyright violations,
sensitive information leakage, and the creation of harmful or offensive content
that could be exploited maliciously. In this study, we uncover a novel security
threat where an attacker leverages diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic
images, which are then used to train a high-performing substitute model. This
enables the attacker to execute model extraction and transfer-based adversarial
attacks on black-box classification models with minimal queries, without
needing access to the original training data. The generated images are
sufficiently high-resolution and diverse to train a substitute model whose
outputs closely match those of the target model. Across the seven benchmarks,
including CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, our method shows an average improvement
of 27.37% over state-of-the-art methods while using just 0.01 times of the
query budget, achieving a 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks on the
target model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于固定长度分块的RAG方法破坏了视频的上下文连续性，无法准确捕捉场景边界，而人类能够自然地将连续经验组织为连贯场景，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: SceneRAG利用大语言模型处理ASR转录和时间元数据，分割视频为叙事一致的场景，并通过轻量级启发式方法和迭代修正优化边界。结合视觉和文本信息构建动态知识图谱，支持多跳检索和生成。

Result: 在LongerVideos基准测试中，SceneRAG显著优于现有基线方法，生成任务的胜率高达72.5%。

Conclusion: SceneRAG通过模仿人类场景组织能力，结合多模态信息，有效解决了长视频理解的挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for video
understanding, effectively understanding long-form video content remains
underexplored due to the vast scale and high complexity of video data. Current
RAG approaches typically segment videos into fixed-length chunks, which often
disrupts the continuity of contextual information and fails to capture
authentic scene boundaries. Inspired by the human ability to naturally organize
continuous experiences into coherent scenes, we present SceneRAG, a unified
framework that leverages large language models to segment videos into
narrative-consistent scenes by processing ASR transcripts alongside temporal
metadata. SceneRAG further sharpens these initial boundaries through
lightweight heuristics and iterative correction. For each scene, the framework
fuses information from both visual and textual modalities to extract entity
relations and dynamically builds a knowledge graph, enabling robust multi-hop
retrieval and generation that account for long-range dependencies. Experiments
on the LongerVideos benchmark, featuring over 134 hours of diverse content,
confirm that SceneRAG substantially outperforms prior baselines, achieving a
win rate of up to 72.5 percent on generation tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is pivotal for enabling automated intraoperative

However, progress in developing surgical video foundation models (FMs) remains
hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for pretraining and
systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a
unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset,
\textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}.
SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with
SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11
specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories
(phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis,
action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks.
Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize
across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P
yields substantial performance improvements and superior cross-domain
generalization to unseen procedures and modalities. Our dataset and code are

Motivation: 现有基于拖拽的图像编辑方法存在模糊性和复杂性问题，难以满足用户需求。

Method: 将拖拽编辑重新定义为变形、旋转和平移，提出Latent Region Optimization（LRO）和Progressive Backward Self-Intervention（PBSI）框架。

Result: 在NextBench上的实验表明，DragNeXt显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DragNeXt通过简化流程和提升质量，为基于拖拽的图像编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Drag-Based Image Editing (DBIE), which allows users to manipulate images by
directly dragging objects within them, has recently attracted much attention
from the community. However, it faces two key challenges:
(\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{i}}) point-based drag is often highly ambiguous and
difficult to align with users' intentions; (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{ii}})
current DBIE methods primarily rely on alternating between motion supervision
and point tracking, which is not only cumbersome but also fails to produce
high-quality results. These limitations motivate us to explore DBIE from a new
perspective -- redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of
user-specified handle regions. Thereby, by requiring users to explicitly
specify both drag areas and types, we can effectively address the ambiguity
issue. Furthermore, we propose a simple-yet-effective editing framework, dubbed
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}}. It unifies DBIE as a Latent Region
Optimization (LRO) problem and solves it through Progressive Backward
Self-Intervention (PBSI), simplifying the overall procedure of DBIE while
further enhancing quality by fully leveraging region-level structure
information and progressive guidance from intermediate drag states. We validate
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}} on our NextBench, and extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform
existing approaches. Code will be released on github.

Result: 虚拟IMU数据显著优于真实或增强数据，尤其在数据有限时。

Conclusion: 提供选择数据生成策略的实用建议，并指出每种方法的优缺点。

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is often limited by the scarcity of labeled
datasets due to the high cost and complexity of real-world data collection. To
mitigate this, recent work has explored generating virtual inertial measurement
unit (IMU) data via cross-modality transfer. While video-based and
language-based pipelines have each shown promise, they differ in assumptions
and computational cost. Moreover, their effectiveness relative to traditional
sensor-level data augmentation remains unclear. In this paper, we present a
direct comparison between these two virtual IMU generation approaches against
classical data augmentation techniques. We construct a large-scale virtual IMU
dataset spanning 100 diverse activities from Kinetics-400 and simulate sensor
signals at 22 body locations. The three data generation strategies are
evaluated on benchmark HAR datasets (UTD-MHAD, PAMAP2, HAD-AW) using four
popular models. Results show that virtual IMU data significantly improves
performance over real or augmented data alone, particularly under limited-data
conditions. We offer practical guidance on choosing data generation strategies
and highlight the distinct advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLM）计算需求高，难以在资源受限的边缘设备上部署，且视觉输入中存在大量冗余信息。

Method: EP-VLM通过事件数据引导RGB输入的稀疏化，并采用位置保留标记化策略处理稀疏输入。

Result: EP-VLM在Qwen2-VL-2B上实现了50%的计算量节省，同时保持98%的原始精度。

Conclusion: 事件视觉先验可显著提升VLM效率，为边缘设备上的可持续视觉理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
substantially extended the boundaries of visual understanding capabilities.
However, their high computational demands hinder deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. A key source of inefficiency stems from the
VLM's need to process dense and redundant visual information. Visual inputs
contain significant regions irrelevant to text semantics, rendering the
associated computations ineffective for inference. This paper introduces a
novel Event-Priori-Based Vision-Language Model, termed EP-VLM. Its core
contribution is a novel mechanism leveraging motion priors derived from dynamic
event vision to enhance VLM efficiency. Inspired by human visual cognition,
EP-VLM first employs event data to guide the patch-wise sparsification of RGB
visual inputs, progressively concentrating VLM computation on salient regions
of the visual input. Subsequently, we construct a position-preserving
tokenization strategy for the visual encoder within the VLM architecture. This
strategy processes the event-guided, unstructured, sparse visual input while
accurately preserving positional understanding within the visual input.
Experimental results demonstrate that EP-VLM achieves significant efficiency
improvements while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy compared to baseline
models from the Qwen2-VL series. For instance, against the original
Qwen2-VL-2B, EP-VLM achieves 50% FLOPs savings while retaining 98% of the
original accuracy on the RealWorldQA dataset. This work demonstrates the
potential of event-based vision priors for improving VLM inference efficiency,
paving the way for creating more efficient and deployable VLMs for sustainable
visual understanding at the edge.

Conclusion: HuSc3D揭示了传统数据集掩盖的模型局限性，为3D重建研究提供了更真实的基准。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction from 2D images is one of the most important tasks in
computer graphics. Unfortunately, existing datasets and benchmarks concentrate
on idealized synthetic or meticulously captured realistic data. Such benchmarks
fail to convey the inherent complexities encountered in newly acquired
real-world scenes. In such scenes especially those acquired outside, the
background is often dynamic, and by popular usage of cell phone cameras, there
might be discrepancies in, e.g., white balance. To address this gap, we present
HuSc3D, a novel dataset specifically designed for rigorous benchmarking of 3D
reconstruction models under realistic acquisition challenges. Our dataset
uniquely features six highly detailed, fully white sculptures characterized by
intricate perforations and minimal textural and color variation. Furthermore,
the number of images per scene varies significantly, introducing the additional
challenge of limited training data for some instances alongside scenes with a
standard number of views. By evaluating popular 3D reconstruction methods on
this diverse dataset, we demonstrate the distinctiveness of HuSc3D in
effectively differentiating model performance, particularly highlighting the
sensitivity of methods to fine geometric details, color ambiguity, and varying
data availability--limitations often masked by more conventional datasets.

Motivation: 传统花粉识别方法效率低且主观性强，现有深度学习模型在微小目标的定位精度上表现不佳。

Method: 提出HieraEdgeNet框架，包含三个模块：HEM（提取多尺度边缘特征）、SEF（融合边缘先验与语义信息）、CSPOKM（优化细节丰富的特征层）。

Result: 在120类花粉数据集上，mAP@.5达到0.9501，优于YOLOv12n和RT-DETR等基线模型。

Conclusion: HieraEdgeNet通过系统整合边缘信息，为微小物体的高精度高效检测提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Automated pollen recognition is vital to paleoclimatology, biodiversity
monitoring, and public health, yet conventional methods are hampered by
inefficiency and subjectivity. Existing deep learning models often struggle to
achieve the requisite localization accuracy for microscopic targets like
pollen, which are characterized by their minute size, indistinct edges, and
complex backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we introduce HieraEdgeNet, a
multi-scale edge-enhancement framework. The framework's core innovation is the
introduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),
which explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that
corresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic
Edge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic
information at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel
Module (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers
using an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel
convolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally
efficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset
comprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision
(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline
models such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms
that our approach generates feature representations that are more precisely
focused on object boundaries. By systematically integrating edge information,
HieraEdgeNet provides a robust and powerful solution for high-precision,
high-efficiency automated detection of microscopic objects.

Conclusion: 精细化的场景图数据训练对提升视觉推理任务性能至关重要。

Abstract: Reasoning over visual relationships-spatial, functional, interactional,
social, etc.-is considered to be a fundamental component of human cognition.
Yet, despite the major advances in visual comprehension in multimodal language
models (MLMs), precise reasoning over relationships and their generations
remains a challenge. We introduce ROBIN: an MLM instruction-tuned with densely
annotated relationships capable of constructing high-quality dense scene graphs
at scale. To train ROBIN, we curate SVG, a synthetic scene graph dataset by
completing the missing relations of selected objects in existing scene graphs
using a teacher MLM and a carefully designed filtering process to ensure
high-quality. To generate more accurate and rich scene graphs at scale for any
image, we introduce SG-EDIT: a self-distillation framework where GPT-4o further
refines ROBIN's predicted scene graphs by removing unlikely relations and/or
suggesting relevant ones. In total, our dataset contains 146K images and 5.6M
relationships for 2.6M objects. Results show that our ROBIN-3B model, despite
being trained on less than 3 million instances, outperforms similar-size models
trained on over 300 million instances on relationship understanding benchmarks,
and even surpasses larger models up to 13B parameters. Notably, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance in referring expression comprehension with a score
of 88.9, surpassing the previous best of 87.4. Our results suggest that
training on the refined scene graph data is crucial to maintaining high
performance across diverse visual reasoning task.

Conclusion: FMaMIL在数字病理学中具有潜在应用价值，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Accurate lesion segmentation in histopathology images is essential for
diagnostic interpretation and quantitative analysis, yet it remains challenging
due to the limited availability of costly pixel-level annotations. To address
this, we propose FMaMIL, a novel two-stage framework for weakly supervised
lesion segmentation based solely on image-level labels. In the first stage, a
lightweight Mamba-based encoder is introduced to capture long-range
dependencies across image patches under the MIL paradigm. To enhance spatial
sensitivity and structural awareness, we design a learnable frequency-domain
encoding module that supplements spatial-domain features with spectrum-based
information. CAMs generated in this stage are used to guide segmentation
training. In the second stage, we refine the initial pseudo labels via a
CAM-guided soft-label supervision and a self-correction mechanism, enabling
robust training even under label noise. Extensive experiments on both public
and private histopathology datasets demonstrate that FMaMIL outperforms
state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods without relying on pixel-level
annotations, validating its effectiveness and potential for digital pathology
applications.

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV-10K数据集上，PSNR平均提升1 dB。

Conclusion: ProSplat在宽基线条件下显著提升了渲染质量，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated promising
results for novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, particularly
under narrow-baseline conditions. However, its performance significantly
degrades in wide-baseline scenarios due to limited texture details and
geometric inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we propose ProSplat, a two-stage feed-forward framework designed for
high-fidelity rendering under wide-baseline conditions. The first stage
involves generating 3D Gaussian primitives via a 3DGS generator. In the second
stage, rendered views from these primitives are enhanced through an improvement
model. Specifically, this improvement model is based on a one-step diffusion
model, further optimized by our proposed Maximum Overlap Reference view
Injection (MORI) and Distance-Weighted Epipolar Attention (DWEA). MORI
supplements missing texture and color by strategically selecting a reference
view with maximum viewpoint overlap, while DWEA enforces geometric consistency
using epipolar constraints. Additionally, we introduce a divide-and-conquer
training strategy that aligns data distributions between the two stages through
joint optimization. We evaluate ProSplat on the RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K
datasets under wide-baseline settings. Experimental results demonstrate that
ProSplat achieves an average improvement of 1 dB in PSNR compared to recent
SOTA methods.

open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without requiring manual labeling,
termed OpenSplat3D. Our method leverages feature-splatting techniques to
associate semantic information with individual Gaussians, enabling fine-grained
scene understanding. We incorporate Segment Anything Model instance masks with
a contrastive loss formulation as guidance for the instance features to achieve
accurate instance-level segmentation. Furthermore, we utilize language
embeddings of a vision-language model, allowing for flexible, text-driven
instance identification. This combination enables our system to identify and
segment arbitrary objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions.
We show results on LERF-mask and LERF-OVS as well as the full ScanNet++
validation set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: 3D AI-generated content (AIGC) has made it increasingly accessible for anyone
to become a 3D content creator. While recent methods leverage Score
Distillation Sampling to distill 3D objects from pretrained image diffusion
models, they often suffer from inadequate 3D priors, leading to insufficient
multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce NOVA3D, an innovative
single-image-to-3D generation framework. Our key insight lies in leveraging
strong 3D priors from a pretrained video diffusion model and integrating
geometric information during multi-view video fine-tuning. To facilitate
information exchange between color and geometric domains, we propose the
Geometry-Temporal Alignment (GTA) attention mechanism, thereby improving
generalization and multi-view consistency. Moreover, we introduce the
de-conflict geometry fusion algorithm, which improves texture fidelity by
addressing multi-view inaccuracies and resolving discrepancies in pose
alignment. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NOVA3D over
existing baselines.

Result: 该方法在合成和真实图像数据集上均优于现有盲超分辨率算法。

Conclusion: 动态滤波网络能有效区分并处理两类退化问题，显著提升图像重建性能。

Abstract: Prior methodologies have disregarded the diversities among distinct
degradation types during image reconstruction, employing a uniform network
model to handle multiple deteriorations. Nevertheless, we discover that
prevalent degradation modalities, including sampling, blurring, and noise, can
be roughly categorized into two classes. We classify the first class as
spatial-agnostic dominant degradations, less affected by regional changes in
image space, such as downsampling and noise degradation. The second class
degradation type is intimately associated with the spatial position of the
image, such as blurring, and we identify them as spatial-specific dominant
degradations. We introduce a dynamic filter network integrating global and
local branches to address these two degradation types. This network can greatly
alleviate the practical degradation problem. Specifically, the global dynamic
filtering layer can perceive the spatial-agnostic dominant degradation in
different images by applying weights generated by the attention mechanism to
multiple parallel standard convolution kernels, enhancing the network's
representation ability. Meanwhile, the local dynamic filtering layer converts
feature maps of the image into a spatially specific dynamic filtering operator,
which performs spatially specific convolution operations on the image features
to handle spatial-specific dominant degradations. By effectively integrating
both global and local dynamic filtering operators, our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art blind super-resolution algorithms in both
synthetic and real image datasets.

Conclusion: FlowV2V通过光流驱动和任务分解，显著提升了视频编辑的时序一致性和质量，适用于复杂运动场景。

Abstract: With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like
video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much
computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion
transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the
consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the
temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods
fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are
fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object
motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this
paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex
motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task
of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V
decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V
generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed
shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on
DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error
illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V
compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the
first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.

Conclusion: ReverB-SNN在保持高效性的同时显著提升了SNN的准确性。

Abstract: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN), a biologically inspired neural network
infrastructure, has garnered significant attention recently. SNNs utilize
binary spike activations for efficient information transmission, replacing
multiplications with additions, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. However,
binary spike activation maps often fail to capture sufficient data information,
resulting in reduced accuracy. To address this challenge, we advocate reversing
the bit of the weight and activation for SNNs, called \textbf{ReverB-SNN},
inspired by recent findings that highlight greater accuracy degradation from
quantizing activations compared to weights. Specifically, our method employs
real-valued spike activations alongside binary weights in SNNs. This preserves
the event-driven and multiplication-free advantages of standard SNNs while
enhancing the information capacity of activations. Additionally, we introduce a
trainable factor within binary weights to adaptively learn suitable weight
amplitudes during training, thereby increasing network capacity. To maintain
efficiency akin to vanilla \textbf{ReverB-SNN}, our trainable binary weight
SNNs are converted back to standard form using a re-parameterization technique
during inference. Extensive experiments across various network architectures
and datasets, both static and dynamic, demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在Bench2Drive CARLA Leaderboard-v2基准测试中，ETA将驾驶分数提升8%，达到69.53，同时保持50毫秒的实时推理速度。

Conclusion: ETA系统成功平衡了大型模型的性能优势与实时性需求，为自动驾驶系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: How can we benefit from large models without sacrificing inference speed, a
common dilemma in self-driving systems? A prevalent solution is a dual-system
architecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a
larger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system
designs often implement parallel architectures where inference is either
directly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved
from previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle
to enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key
insight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous
time steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large
models respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we
introduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system
designed to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current
frame using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame
features using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate
these dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes
action-critical image regions. Evaluated on the Bench2Drive CARLA
Leaderboard-v2 benchmark, ETA advances state-of-the-art performance by 8% with
a driving score of 69.53 while maintaining a near-real-time inference speed at
50 ms.

Result: 在KITTI数据集上性能显著提升（Easy: +2.82, Moderate: +3.2, Hard: +3.17），能耗降低72.2%，性能仅下降4%。

Conclusion: SpikeSMOKE在低功耗3D目标检测中表现优异，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Low energy consumption for 3D object detection is an important research area
because of the increasing energy consumption with their wide application in
fields such as autonomous driving. The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with
low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this
research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose
the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power
monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will
generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared
with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue,
inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose
a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature
representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated
filtering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the
speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can
maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection
performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection,
the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2,
Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by
AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the
results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to
the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by
72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only
4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3
times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.

Result: AssetDropper在资产提取任务中达到最先进水平，奖励驱动优化显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: AssetDropper为设计师提供了高效的开放世界资产提取工具，推动了相关下游任务的研究。

Abstract: Recent research on generative models has primarily focused on creating
product-ready visual outputs; however, designers often favor access to
standardized asset libraries, a domain that has yet to be significantly
enhanced by generative capabilities. Although open-world scenes provide ample
raw materials for designers, efficiently extracting high-quality, standardized
assets remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce AssetDropper, the
first framework designed to extract assets from reference images, providing
artists with an open-world asset palette. Our model adeptly extracts a front
view of selected subjects from input images, effectively handling complex
scenarios such as perspective distortion and subject occlusion. We establish a
synthetic dataset of more than 200,000 image-subject pairs and a real-world
benchmark with thousands more for evaluation, facilitating the exploration of
future research in downstream tasks. Furthermore, to ensure precise asset
extraction that aligns well with the image prompts, we employ a pre-trained
reward model to fulfill a closed-loop with feedback. We design the reward model
to perform an inverse task that pastes the extracted assets back into the
reference sources, which assists training with additional consistency and
mitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments show that, with the aid of
reward-driven optimization, AssetDropper achieves the state-of-the-art results
in asset extraction. Project page: AssetDropper.github.io.

Motivation: 传统建筑文化研究依赖主观专家解读和历史文献，存在区域偏见和解释范围有限的问题。

Method: 构建ArchDiffBench数据集（1,765张高质量建筑图像），开发基于视觉语言模型的ArchiLense框架，结合计算机视觉和深度学习技术。

Result: ArchiLense在建筑风格识别中表现优异，与专家标注一致性达92.4%，分类准确率为84.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为建筑文化比较研究提供了更客观、准确的视角，超越了传统分析的主观性。

Abstract: Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic
diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition
to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the
ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects
from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery.
However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on
subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often
suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these
challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a
professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises
1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style
annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We
propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models
and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced
computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms,
ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise
classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language
outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show
that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition,
with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification
accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The
proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses
and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of
architectural culture.

Conclusion: Flow-Anything 通过真实世界图像生成训练数据，为光学流估计和视频任务提供了新的基础模型。

Abstract: Optical flow estimation is a crucial subfield of computer vision, serving as
a foundation for video tasks. However, the real-world robustness is limited by
animated synthetic datasets for training. This introduces domain gaps when
applied to real-world applications and limits the benefits of scaling up
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Flow-Anything}, a
large-scale data generation framework designed to learn optical flow estimation
from any single-view images in the real world. We employ two effective steps to
make data scaling-up promising. First, we convert a single-view image into a 3D
representation using advanced monocular depth estimation networks. This allows
us to render optical flow and novel view images under a virtual camera. Second,
we develop an Object-Independent Volume Rendering module and a Depth-Aware
Inpainting module to model the dynamic objects in the 3D representation. These
two steps allow us to generate realistic datasets for training from large-scale
single-view images, namely \textbf{FA-Flow Dataset}. For the first time, we
demonstrate the benefits of generating optical flow training data from
large-scale real-world images, outperforming the most advanced unsupervised
methods and supervised methods on synthetic datasets. Moreover, our models
serve as a foundation model and enhance the performance of various downstream
video tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法局限于特定模型（如InstructPix2Pix），可能导致偏见或编辑能力不足，需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: 通过Delta Interpolation提取差异，结合Token Consistency Loss和Zero Initialization of Token Embeddings，生成适用于稳定扩散模型的Full Prompt。

Result: Difference Inversion在定量和定性上均优于现有基线，能更可行地生成B'。

Conclusion: Difference Inversion是一种模型无关的方法，能有效生成满足条件的B'。

Abstract: How can we generate an image B' that satisfies A:A'::B:B', given the input
images A,A' and B? Recent works have tackled this challenge through approaches
like visual in-context learning or visual instruction. However, these methods
are typically limited to specific models (e.g. InstructPix2Pix. Inpainting
models) rather than general diffusion models (e.g. Stable Diffusion, SDXL).
This dependency may lead to inherited biases or lower editing capabilities. In
this paper, we propose Difference Inversion, a method that isolates only the
difference from A and A' and applies it to B to generate a plausible B'. To
address model dependency, it is crucial to structure prompts in the form of a
"Full Prompt" suitable for input to stable diffusion models, rather than using
an "Instruction Prompt". To this end, we accurately extract the Difference
between A and A' and combine it with the prompt of B, enabling a plug-and-play
application of the difference. To extract a precise difference, we first
identify it through 1) Delta Interpolation. Additionally, to ensure accurate
training, we propose the 2) Token Consistency Loss and 3) Zero Initialization
of Token Embeddings. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Difference
Inversion outperforms existing baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively,
indicating its ability to generate more feasible B' in a model-agnostic manner.

generate synthetic purchase histories influenced by user-specific trendiness

Abstract: The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has
fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal visual-text reasoning capabilities.
However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date suffer from
generalization performance. Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual
reasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a
step-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and
execute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with
execution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the
task planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to
generate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning
task. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the
composition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence
reasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we
improve the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving
logic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM
hallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and
correct additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to
launching the plan executor. Finally, we employ the ensemble method to improve
the generalization performance of our step-executor. Extensive experiments with
four visual reasoning benchmarks (GQA, MME, NLVR2, VQAv2) show that VLAgent
achieves significant performance enhancement for multimodal text-visual
reasoning applications, compared to the exiting representative VLMs and LLM
based visual composition approaches like ViperGPT and VisProg, thanks to the
novel optimization modules of VLAgent back-engine (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer,
Output Verifiers). Code and data will be made available upon paper acceptance.

Result: 实验表明，针对下游任务优化的融合模型在目标检测中表现更优，尤其是在低光和遮挡场景下。

Conclusion: 论文贡献包括高质量数据集、任务感知评估框架和融合方法的全面分析，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Visible images offer rich texture details, while infrared images emphasize
salient targets. Fusing these complementary modalities enhances scene
understanding, particularly for advanced vision tasks under challenging
conditions. Recently, deep learning-based fusion methods have gained attention,
but current evaluations primarily rely on general-purpose metrics without
standardized benchmarks or downstream task performance. Additionally, the lack
of well-developed dual-spectrum datasets and fair algorithm comparisons hinders
progress.
  To address these gaps, we construct a high-quality dual-spectrum dataset
captured in campus environments, comprising 1,369 well-aligned visible-infrared
image pairs across four representative scenarios: daytime, nighttime, smoke
occlusion, and underpasses. We also propose a comprehensive and fair evaluation
framework that integrates fusion speed, general metrics, and object detection
performance using the lang-segment-anything model to ensure fairness in
downstream evaluation.
  Extensive experiments benchmark several state-of-the-art fusion algorithms
under this framework. Results demonstrate that fusion models optimized for
downstream tasks achieve superior performance in target detection, especially
in low-light and occluded scenes. Notably, some algorithms that perform well on
general metrics do not translate to strong downstream performance, highlighting
limitations of current evaluation practices and validating the necessity of our
proposed framework.
  The main contributions of this work are: (1)a campus-oriented dual-spectrum
dataset with diverse and challenging scenes; (2) a task-aware, comprehensive
evaluation framework; and (3) thorough comparative analysis of leading fusion
methods across multiple datasets, offering insights for future development.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have
significantly improved performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
through multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
methods still face challenges, such as the scarcity of knowledge with reasoning
examples and erratic responses from retrieved knowledge. To address these
issues, in this study, we propose a multimodal RAG framework, termed RCTS,
which enhances LVLMs by constructing a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge
base and a Tree Search re-ranking method. Specifically, we introduce a
self-consistent evaluation mechanism to enrich the knowledge base with
intrinsic reasoning patterns. We further propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search with
Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) to prioritize the most relevant examples. This
ensures that LVLMs can leverage high-quality contextual reasoning for better
and more consistent responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VQA datasets,
significantly outperforming In-Context Learning (ICL) and Vanilla-RAG methods.
It highlights the effectiveness of our knowledge base and re-ranking method in
improving LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/yannqi/RCTS-RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉编码器内部如何表示特征，尤其是不同训练目标对特征信息保留的影响。

Result: 基于图像任务预训练的编码器保留更多图像信息；特征空间的旋转控制颜色编码。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于任何视觉编码器，揭示了特征空间的内部结构。

Abstract: Vision encoders are increasingly used in modern applications, from
vision-only models to multimodal systems such as vision-language models.
Despite their remarkable success, it remains unclear how these architectures
represent features internally. Here, we propose a novel approach for
interpreting vision features via image reconstruction. We compare two related
model families, SigLIP and SigLIP2, which differ only in their training
objective, and show that encoders pre-trained on image-based tasks retain
significantly more image information than those trained on non-image tasks such
as contrastive learning. We further apply our method to a range of vision
encoders, ranking them by the informativeness of their feature representations.
Finally, we demonstrate that manipulating the feature space yields predictable
changes in reconstructed images, revealing that orthogonal rotations (rather
than spatial transformations) control color encoding. Our approach can be
applied to any vision encoder, shedding light on the inner structure of its
feature space. The code and model weights to reproduce the experiments are
available in GitHub.

Conclusion: UGTSR框架有效提升了超分辨率任务中的纹理重建质量。

Abstract: Recent advancements in codebook-based real image super-resolution (SR) have
shown promising results in real-world applications. The core idea involves
matching high-quality image features from a codebook based on low-resolution
(LR) image features. However, existing methods face two major challenges:
inaccurate feature matching with the codebook and poor texture detail
reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided
and Top-k Codebook Matching SR (UGTSR) framework, which incorporates three key
components: (1) an uncertainty learning mechanism that guides the model to
focus on texture-rich regions, (2) a Top-k feature matching strategy that
enhances feature matching accuracy by fusing multiple candidate features, and
(3) an Align-Attention module that enhances the alignment of information
between LR and HR features. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity compared to
existing methods. We will release the code upon formal publication.

Motivation: 现有VideoQA工作主要依赖显式视觉证据，但在涉及符号意义或深层意图的问题中表现不佳，因此需要解决隐式视觉证据的问题。

Method: 提出IRM框架，包括Action-Intent Module（AIM）和Visual Enhancement Module（VEM），分别用于生成线索候选和增强视觉表示。

Result: IRM在I-VQA任务中表现优于GPT-4o、OpenAI-o3和VideoChat2，分别提升0.76%、1.37%和4.87%。

Conclusion: IRM在隐式视觉推理任务中表现出色，并在广告理解和交通预测等类似任务中达到SOTA水平。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) aims to answer natural language questions
based on the given video, with prior work primarily focusing on identifying the
duration of relevant segments, referred to as explicit visual evidence.
However, explicit visual evidence is not always directly available,
particularly when questions target symbolic meanings or deeper intentions,
leading to significant performance degradation. To fill this gap, we introduce
a novel task and dataset, $\textbf{I}$mplicit $\textbf{V}$ideo
$\textbf{Q}$uestion $\textbf{A}$nswering (I-VQA), which focuses on answering
questions in scenarios where explicit visual evidence is inaccessible. Given an
implicit question and its corresponding video, I-VQA requires answering based
on the contextual visual cues present within the video. To tackle I-VQA, we
propose a novel reasoning framework, IRM (Implicit Reasoning Model),
incorporating dual-stream modeling of contextual actions and intent clues as
implicit reasoning chains. IRM comprises the Action-Intent Module (AIM) and the
Visual Enhancement Module (VEM). AIM deduces and preserves question-related
dual clues by generating clue candidates and performing relation deduction. VEM
enhances contextual visual representation by leveraging key contextual clues.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our IRM in I-VQA tasks,
outperforming GPT-4o, OpenAI-o3, and fine-tuned VideoChat2 by $0.76\%$,
$1.37\%$, and $4.87\%$, respectively. Additionally, IRM performs SOTA on
similar implicit advertisement understanding and future prediction in
traffic-VQA. Datasets and codes are available for double-blind review in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定尺度超分辨率缺乏灵活性，而现有方法多为单阶段上采样，难以适应广泛的连续尺度分布。

Method: 采用自级联扩散框架，将大尺度分解为小尺度序列，逐步提升分辨率，并结合坐标引导的残差扩散模型。

Result: CasArbi在多种任意尺度超分辨率基准测试中，在感知和失真性能指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CasArbi通过渐进式上采样和扩散模型的有效结合，实现了灵活且高性能的任意尺度超分辨率。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale image super-resolution aims to upsample images to any desired
resolution, offering greater flexibility than traditional fixed-scale
super-resolution. Recent approaches in this domain utilize regression-based or
generative models, but many of them are a single-stage upsampling process,
which may be challenging to learn across a wide, continuous distribution of
scaling factors. Progressive upsampling strategies have shown promise in
mitigating this issue, yet their integration with diffusion models for flexible
upscaling remains underexplored. Here, we present CasArbi, a novel
self-cascaded diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution.
CasArbi meets the varying scaling demands by breaking them down into smaller
sequential factors and progressively enhancing the image resolution at each
step with seamless transitions for arbitrary scales. Our novel
coordinate-guided residual diffusion model allows for the learning of
continuous image representations while enabling efficient diffusion sampling.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CasArbi outperforms prior arts in
both perceptual and distortion performance metrics across diverse
arbitrary-scale super-resolution benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然图像常受复合退化（如雨、雪、雾）影响，现有方法在动态变化的退化场景中泛化能力有限，且难以平衡局部细节与全局依赖关系。

Method: 1. 使用CLIP引导的MoE门控机制，结合任务条件提示和CLIP语义先验；2. 设计双流架构，融合CNN的局部表征和Mamba的长程建模；3. 引入边缘感知动态门控机制，自适应平衡全局与局部。

Result: 在多个图像恢复基准测试中，M2Restore在视觉质量和定量性能上均表现出优越性。

Conclusion: M2Restore通过创新的架构和机制，显著提升了图像恢复的泛化能力和细节保留效果。

Abstract: Natural images are often degraded by complex, composite degradations such as
rain, snow, and haze, which adversely impact downstream vision applications.
While existing image restoration efforts have achieved notable success, they
are still hindered by two critical challenges: limited generalization across
dynamically varying degradation scenarios and a suboptimal balance between
preserving local details and modeling global dependencies. To overcome these
challenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Mamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image
restoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the
model's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a
CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with
CLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal
feature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various
degradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies
and fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that
integrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range
modeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative
optimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity,
preserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we
introduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances
global modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention
to degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient
and precise restoration. Extensive experiments across multiple image
restoration benchmarks validate the superiority of M2Restore in both visual
quality and quantitative performance.

Abstract: Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and
safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential.
Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to
scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast,
neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a
scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world
driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and
reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result
in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper
introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome
these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into
existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and
consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel
dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an
image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into
neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic
integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2
significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like
text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing
for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable
and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see

Conclusion: 研究填补了扩散模型在小噪声条件下行为的理解空白，为实际应用中的可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Recent work on diffusion models proposed that they operate in two regimes:
memorization, in which models reproduce their training data, and
generalization, in which they generate novel samples. While this has been
tested in high-noise settings, the behavior of diffusion models as effective
denoisers when the corruption level is small remains unclear. To address this
gap, we systematically investigated the behavior of diffusion models under
low-noise diffusion dynamics, with implications for model robustness and
interpretability. Using (i) CelebA subsets of varying sample sizes and (ii)
analytic Gaussian mixture benchmarks, we reveal that models trained on disjoint
data diverge near the data manifold even when their high-noise outputs
converge. We quantify how training set size, data geometry, and model objective
choice shape denoising trajectories and affect score accuracy, providing
insights into how these models actually learn representations of data
distributions. This work starts to address gaps in our understanding of
generative model reliability in practical applications where small
perturbations are common.

Motivation: 传统方法在处理超高清遥感图像时，要么通过下采样丢失细节，要么通过分块处理破坏全局上下文。多分支网络虽能解决这一问题，但存在计算效率低和梯度冲突的问题。

Method: F2Net将图像分解为高频和低频成分，高频分支保留全分辨率细节，低频分支通过双子分支捕获短程和长程依赖关系，并通过混合频率融合模块整合结果。

Conclusion: F2Net通过频率分解和融合模块，实现了高效的语义分割，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery
is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning
but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods
either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via
patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they
suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during
training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR
images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The
high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the
low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches
capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module
integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency
Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and
Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to
stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net
achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39,
respectively. Our code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: PolyVivid为多主体视频生成提供了灵活且身份一致的高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in video generation, existing models still lack
fine-grained controllability, especially for multi-subject customization with
consistent identity and interaction. In this paper, we propose PolyVivid, a
multi-subject video customization framework that enables flexible and
identity-consistent generation. To establish accurate correspondences between
subject images and textual entities, we design a VLLM-based text-image fusion
module that embeds visual identities into the textual space for precise
grounding. To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we
propose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured
bidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings. Moreover, we develop an
attention-inherited identity injection module to effectively inject fused
identity features into the video generation process, mitigating identity drift.
Finally, we construct an MLLM-based data pipeline that combines MLLM-based
grounding, segmentation, and a clique-based subject consolidation strategy to
produce high-quality multi-subject data, effectively enhancing subject
distinction and reducing ambiguity in downstream video generation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PolyVivid achieves superior performance in
identity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLM）因标注数据集稀缺而发展受限的问题。

Method: 结合SMART-OD（自动掩码生成与开放世界目标检测）和FLASH（多目标实时视频实例分割），通过统计方法减少检测错误并保持对象跟踪一致性。

Result: 实验表明，SAM2Auto的标注精度与人工标注相当，同时大幅减少时间和成本。

Conclusion: SAM2Auto为自动化视频标注设定了新基准，有望加速VLM的发展。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lag behind Large Language Models due to the
scarcity of annotated datasets, as creating paired visual-textual annotations
is labor-intensive and expensive. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets
requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach
consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that
combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection
capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a
multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains
consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent
detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require
frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives,
our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while
ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves
comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation
time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse
datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments,
making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work
establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a
pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset
bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.

Result: 在两个室内和一个室外数据集上，LogoSP大幅超越现有无监督方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogoSP证明了全局模式在无监督学习中能有效捕捉3D语义信息，无需人工标注。

Abstract: We study the problem of unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation on raw point
clouds without needing human labels in training. Existing methods usually
formulate this problem into learning per-point local features followed by a
simple grouping strategy, lacking the ability to discover additional and
possibly richer semantic priors beyond local features. In this paper, we
introduce LogoSP to learn 3D semantics from both local and global point
features. The key to our approach is to discover 3D semantic information by
grouping superpoints according to their global patterns in the frequency
domain, thus generating highly accurate semantic pseudo-labels for training a
segmentation network. Extensive experiments on two indoor and an outdoor
datasets show that our LogoSP surpasses all existing unsupervised methods by
large margins, achieving the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D
semantic segmentation. Notably, our investigation into the learned global
patterns reveals that they truly represent meaningful 3D semantics in the
absence of human labels during training.

Result: 系统总延迟低至4.5毫秒，计算效率提升10.81倍。

Conclusion: 首次从第一人称视角利用事件相机预测乒乓球轨迹，性能显著优于传统帧相机。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a real-time egocentric trajectory prediction system
for table tennis using event cameras. Unlike standard cameras, which suffer
from high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide
higher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater
robustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short
time window after the opponent's impact. We collect a dataset of ping-pong game
sequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized
with sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our
system leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to
process only events in the viewer's fovea. This biologically inspired approach
improves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational
latency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually
relevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected
trajectories. Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms,
including computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based
30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception.
Finally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the
ball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from
an egocentric perspective using event cameras.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remain a cornerstone of generative computer
vision, yet their training is often plagued by artifacts that degrade
reconstruction and generation quality. This paper introduces VIVAT, a
systematic approach to mitigating common artifacts in KL-VAE training without
requiring radical architectural changes. We present a detailed taxonomy of five
prevalent artifacts - color shift, grid patterns, blur, corner and droplet
artifacts - and analyze their root causes. Through straightforward
modifications, including adjustments to loss weights, padding strategies, and
the integration of Spatially Conditional Normalization, we demonstrate
significant improvements in VAE performance. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across
multiple benchmarks and enhances text-to-image generation quality, as evidenced
by superior CLIP scores. By preserving the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework
while addressing its practical challenges, VIVAT offers actionable insights for
researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize VAE training.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了方法在帧外推和运动分割中的优越性，物理代码能学习无标签的3D物理运动模式。

Conclusion: FreeGave无需先验即可学习复杂物理运动，为动态3D场景建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and the
underlying physics purely from multi-view videos. By applying various governing
PDEs as PINN losses or incorporating physics simulation into neural networks,
existing works often fail to learn complex physical motions at boundaries or
require object priors such as masks or types. In this paper, we propose
FreeGave to learn the physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes without needing any
object priors. The key to our approach is to introduce a physics code followed
by a carefully designed divergence-free module for estimating a per-Gaussian
velocity field, without relying on the inefficient PINN losses. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets and a newly collected challenging
real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method for
future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation. Most notably, our
investigation into the learned physics codes reveals that they truly learn
meaningful 3D physical motion patterns in the absence of any human labels in
training.

*Muhammad Ahmed Humais,Xiaoqian Huang,Hussain Sajwani,Sajid Javed,Yahya Zweiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于时空状态空间模型（STSSM）的新型网络架构，用于高效的事件相机运动估计（光流），在性能和计算效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在低延迟运动估计方面具有潜力，但现有深度学习方法（如CNN、RNN、ViT）计算效率不足，而异步事件方法（如SNN、GNN）又无法充分捕捉时空信息。

Method: 引入STSSM模块和新型网络架构，利用状态空间模型高效捕捉事件数据的时空相关性。

Result: 在DSEC基准测试中，模型推理速度比TMA快4.5倍，计算量比TMA低8倍，比EV-FlowNet低2倍，性能具有竞争力。

Conclusion: STSSM模块提供了一种高效且性能优异的解决方案，适用于事件相机的实时光流估计。

Abstract: Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with
standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion
estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications.
In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount.
Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown
remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency.
Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are
computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient
spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better
performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce
Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network
architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive
performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively
capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance
with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar
settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations
compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with
competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark. Our code will be available at

Abstract: With the increasing availability of aerial and satellite imagery, deep
learning presents significant potential for transportation asset management,
safety analysis, and urban planning. This study introduces CrosswalkNet, a
robust and efficient deep learning framework designed to detect various types
of pedestrian crosswalks from 15-cm resolution aerial images. CrosswalkNet
incorporates a novel detection approach that improves upon traditional object
detection strategies by utilizing oriented bounding boxes (OBB), enhancing
detection precision by accurately capturing crosswalks regardless of their
orientation. Several optimization techniques, including Convolutional Block
Attention, a dual-branch Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Fast module, and cosine
annealing, are implemented to maximize performance and efficiency. A
comprehensive dataset comprising over 23,000 annotated crosswalk instances is
utilized to train and validate the proposed framework. The best-performing
model achieves an impressive precision of 96.5% and a recall of 93.3% on aerial
imagery from Massachusetts, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness.
CrosswalkNet has also been successfully applied to datasets from New Hampshire,
Virginia, and Maine without transfer learning or fine-tuning, showcasing its
robustness and strong generalization capability. Additionally, the crosswalk
detection results, processed using High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms
and provided in polygon shapefile format, have been shown to accelerate data
processing and detection, supporting real-time analysis for safety and mobility
applications. This integration offers policymakers, transportation engineers,
and urban planners an effective instrument to enhance pedestrian safety and
improve urban mobility.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出EgoM2P框架，通过高效的时间标记器和掩码建模解决多模态自我中心视觉任务中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我中心视觉的多模态数据（如RGB视频、深度、相机位姿和视线）具有异构性和缺失模态的伪标签生成困难，现有方法难以直接应用。

Method: 引入高效时间标记器，提出EgoM2P掩码建模框架，学习时间感知的多模态标记，支持多任务处理。

Result: EgoM2P在视线预测、相机追踪和深度估计等任务中表现优于专业模型，且速度更快。

Conclusion: EgoM2P是一个高效、通用的自我中心4D理解模型，将开源以推动研究。

Abstract: Understanding multimodal signals in egocentric vision, such as RGB video,
depth, camera poses, and gaze, is essential for applications in augmented
reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction. These capabilities enable
systems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and
surrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal
and multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently
heterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and
settings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or
head-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard
supervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera
motion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video
pose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal
foundation models.
  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal
tokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from
temporally aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for
egocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across
diverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction,
egocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric
video. EgoM2P also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric
video synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist
models while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source
EgoM2P to support the community and advance egocentric vision research. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种针对视频扩散模型的首次去学习技术，仅需5对多模态提示对，通过拒绝向量中和有害概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成模型可能继承训练数据中的偏见和有害内容，导致用户生成不良或非法内容。

Method: 通过多模态提示对生成拒绝向量，并采用低秩分解方法隔离目标概念，避免影响其他语义。

Result: 成功中和多种有害内容（如裸露、暴力、版权等），同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练或原始数据，直接嵌入拒绝方向到模型权重，提高了对抗绕过的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video generative models democratize the creation of visual content through
intuitive instruction following, but they also inherit the biases and harmful
concepts embedded within their web-scale training data. This inheritance
creates a significant risk, as users can readily generate undesirable and even
illegal content. This work introduces the first unlearning technique tailored
explicitly for video diffusion models to address this critical issue. Our
method requires 5 multi-modal prompt pairs only. Each pair contains a "safe"
and an "unsafe" example that differ only by the target concept. Averaging their
per-layer latent differences produces a "refusal vector", which, once
subtracted from the model parameters, neutralizes the unsafe concept. We
introduce a novel low-rank factorization approach on the covariance difference
of embeddings that yields robust refusal vectors. This isolates the target
concept while minimizing collateral unlearning of other semantics, thus
preserving the visual quality of the generated video. Our method preserves the
model's generation quality while operating without retraining or access to the
original training data. By embedding the refusal direction directly into the
model's weights, the suppression mechanism becomes inherently more robust
against adversarial bypass attempts compared to surface-level input-output
filters. In a thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that we
can neutralize a variety of harmful contents, including explicit nudity,
graphic violence, copyrights, and trademarks. Project page:

Conclusion: 通过自动化数据生成和混合奖励机制，实现了通用视觉语言推理的优化。

Abstract: Building on the success of text-based reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1,
extending these capabilities to multimodal reasoning holds great promise. While
recent works have attempted to adapt DeepSeek-R1-style reinforcement learning
(RL) training paradigms to multimodal large language models (MLLM), focusing on
domain-specific tasks like math and visual perception, a critical question
remains: How can we achieve the general-purpose visual-language reasoning
through RL? To address this challenge, we make three key efforts: (1) A novel
Scalable Multimodal QA Synthesis pipeline that autonomously generates
context-aware, reasoning-centric question-answer (QA) pairs directly from the
given images. (2) The open-source WeThink dataset containing over 120K
multimodal QA pairs with annotated reasoning paths, curated from 18 diverse
dataset sources and covering various question domains. (3) A comprehensive
exploration of RL on our dataset, incorporating a hybrid reward mechanism that
combines rule-based verification with model-based assessment to optimize RL
training efficiency across various task domains. Across 14 diverse MLLM
benchmarks, we demonstrate that our WeThink dataset significantly enhances
performance, from mathematical reasoning to diverse general multimodal tasks.
Moreover, we show that our automated data pipeline can continuously increase
data diversity to further improve model performance.

Conclusion: 该研究为遥感变化检测任务中U-Net版本的选择提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring the everchanging
landscapes of the Earth. The U-Net architecture has gained popularity for its
capability to capture spatial information and perform pixel-wise
classification. However, their application in the Remote sensing field remains
largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper fill the gap by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of 34 papers. This study conducts a comparison and
analysis of 18 different U-Net variations, assessing their potential for
detecting changes in remote sensing. We evaluate both benefits along with
drawbacks of each variation within the framework of this particular
application. We emphasize variations that are explicitly built for change
detection, such as Siamese Swin-U-Net, which utilizes a Siamese architecture.
The analysis highlights the significance of aspects such as managing data from
different time periods and collecting relationships over a long distance to
enhance the precision of change detection. This study provides valuable
insights for researchers and practitioners that choose U-Net versions for
remote sensing change detection tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 研究发现，视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多模态上下文学习（MM-ICL）中依赖浅层启发式方法而非真正任务理解，性能在分布偏移时下降。提出带推理的MM-ICL方法，但实验表明当前VLMs未能有效利用演示信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs是否真正具备多模态上下文学习能力，而非依赖浅层启发式方法。

Method: 提出带推理的MM-ICL方法，生成演示的答案和理由，并在不同数据集和模型上进行实验。

Result: 性能对演示数量、检索方法等因素不敏感，表明当前VLMs未能有效利用演示信息。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在多模态上下文学习中表现有限，需进一步改进以提升任务理解能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are widely assumed to exhibit in-context
learning (ICL), a property similar to that of their language-only counterparts.
While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies
show they often rely on shallow heuristics -- such as copying or majority
voting -- rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by
evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a
dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with
more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from
them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline
that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the
answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception-
and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B
and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0. We conduct controlled studies
varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our
results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, suggesting
that current VLMs do not effectively utilize demonstration-level information as
intended in MM-ICL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖视觉语言模型（VLM）的微调，但其图像标记化破坏了对象间的空间关系，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: DTwinSeger将任务分为两阶段：1）将图像转换为结构化DT表示；2）用LLM对DT表示进行推理。

Result: 在两个图像推理分割基准和三个图像指代分割基准上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DT表示是视觉与文本间的有效桥梁，使复杂多模态推理任务仅需LLM即可完成。

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation (RS) is a multimodal vision-text task that requires
segmenting objects based on implicit text queries, demanding both precise
visual perception and vision-text reasoning capabilities. Current RS approaches
rely on fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for both perception and
reasoning, but their tokenization of images fundamentally disrupts continuous
spatial relationships between objects. We introduce DTwinSeger, a novel RS
approach that leverages Digital Twin (DT) representation as an intermediate
layer to decouple perception from reasoning. Innovatively, DTwinSeger
reformulates RS as a two-stage process, where the first transforms the image
into a structured DT representation that preserves spatial relationships and
semantic properties and then employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform
explicit reasoning over this representation to identify target objects. We
propose a supervised fine-tuning method specifically for LLM with DT
representation, together with a corresponding fine-tuning dataset Seg-DT, to
enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities with DT representations. Experiments
show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two image RS
benchmarks and three image referring segmentation benchmarks. It yields that DT
representation functions as an effective bridge between vision and text,
enabling complex multimodal reasoning tasks to be accomplished solely with an
LLM.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何将大量手写档案转化为结构化数据，为历史和人口研究提供支持。

Abstract: This article presents a large-scale effort to create a structured dataset of
internal migration in Finland between 1800 and 1920 using digitized church
moving records. These records, maintained by Evangelical-Lutheran parishes,
document the migration of individuals and families and offer a valuable source
for studying historical demographic patterns. The dataset includes over six
million entries extracted from approximately 200,000 images of handwritten
migration records.
  The data extraction process was automated using a deep learning pipeline that
included layout analysis, table detection, cell classification, and handwriting
recognition. The complete pipeline was applied to all images, resulting in a
structured dataset suitable for research.
  The dataset can be used to study internal migration, urbanization, and family
migration, and the spread of disease in preindustrial Finland. A case study
from the Elim\"aki parish shows how local migration histories can be
reconstructed. The work demonstrates how large volumes of handwritten archival
material can be transformed into structured data to support historical and
demographic research.

Motivation: 现有基准难以全面评估MLLMs从原子到组合层面的空间智能，因此提出SpaCE-10填补这一空白。

Method: 定义了10种原子空间能力和8种组合能力，采用分层标注流程生成高质量QA对，覆盖多种评估设置。

Result: 评估显示，即使最先进的MLLMs在空间智能上仍显著落后于人类，且计数能力的不足限制了组合能力。

Conclusion: SpaCE-10为MLLM社区提供了重要发现和评估工具，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require
integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic
tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the
spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional
level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for
compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial
capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on
these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to
generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+
hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor
scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud
input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs
on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans
by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant
findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the
shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial
capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are
available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10.

TLDR: CyberV框架通过引入控制论循环（传感器和控制器）提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对复杂视频的理解能力，无需重新训练即可显著提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs因前馈处理特性在复杂视频理解中存在计算需求高、鲁棒性差和准确性不足的问题，尤其是参数较少的模型。

Method: 提出CyberV框架，通过传感器监控MLLM的中间过程（如注意力漂移），控制器触发自校正和动态资源分配。

Result: 实验显示CyberV显著提升模型性能（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B提升8.3%），甚至超越GPT-4o，并在通用基准测试中表现一致。

Conclusion: CyberV通过控制论循环有效增强MLLMs的鲁棒性和准确性，适用于动态视频理解，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may struggle with
understanding long or complex videos due to computational demands at test time,
lack of robustness, and limited accuracy, primarily stemming from their
feed-forward processing nature. These limitations could be more severe for
models with fewer parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
framework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as
adaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic
resource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a
cybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a
Controller. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and
collects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the
controller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate
feedback to guide the next round. This test-time adaptive scaling framework
enhances frozen MLLMs without requiring retraining or additional components.
Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: CyberV boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B
by 8.3% and InternVL3-8B by 5.5% on VideoMMMU, surpassing the competitive
proprietary model GPT-4o. When applied to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, it yields a 10.0%
improvement, achieving performance even comparable to human experts.
Furthermore, our method demonstrates consistent gains on general-purpose
benchmarks, such as VideoMME and WorldSense, highlighting its effectiveness and
generalization capabilities in making MLLMs more robust and accurate for
dynamic video understanding. The code is released at

Conclusion: OneIG-Bench为文本到图像模型的研究和实践提供了全面的评估支持，填补了现有基准的空白。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating
high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model
advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive
evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and
style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge
modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems
requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not
adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we
introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark
framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions,
including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated
content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this
benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers
and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of
image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by
allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of
generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only
for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the
corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly
available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model
comparisons within the T2I research community.

Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient method for real-time three-dimensional

to previous work, our approach introduces a multi-mode state model with $W$
discrete modes to significantly accelerate optimization while preserving
centimeter-level accuracy -- even in cases of severe occlusion, motion blur,
and complex backgrounds. The system operates on standard CPUs and achieves low
latency suitable for live broadcast settings. Extensive evaluation on a
proprietary dataset of 6K-resolution Russian Premier League matches
demonstrates performance comparable to multi-camera systems, without the need
for specialized or costly infrastructure. This work provides a practical method
for accessible and accurate 3D ball tracking in professional football
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放长尾疾病分类的挑战，提升现有技术的可测量性。

Method: 提供高质量基准数据，引入零样本学习任务，使用多模态模型和生成方法处理噪声标签。

Result: 扩展数据集至377,110张X光片和45种疾病标签，包括19种新罕见病。

Conclusion: CXR-LT 2024为临床现实和泛化诊断模型的发展提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: The CXR-LT series is a community-driven initiative designed to enhance lung
disease classification using chest X-rays (CXR). It tackles challenges in open
long-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of
state-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve
these goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development
and conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting
lung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT
2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45
disease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a
new focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the
previous event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed
classification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a
manually annotated "gold standard" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization
to five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of
CXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating
state-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare
disease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and
zero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded
dataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical
settings, offering a valuable resource for future research. By synthesizing the
insights and innovations of participating teams, we aim to advance the
development of clinically realistic and generalizable diagnostic models for
chest radiography.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种成本效益高且准确的人群评估策略，用于评估神经元解释的可靠性，通过重要性采样和贝叶斯方法显著降低了成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经元解释方法的可靠性评估通常依赖嘈杂且昂贵的人群评估，导致结果不可靠。

Method: 开发了一种基于重要性采样的评估策略，并引入贝叶斯方法聚合评分，显著降低评估成本。

Result: 实现了约30倍的成本降低和约5倍的评分数量减少，同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模比较神经元解释质量提供了高效工具，并验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Interpreting individual neurons or directions in activations space is an
important component of mechanistic interpretability. As such, many algorithms
have been proposed to automatically produce neuron explanations, but it is
often not clear how reliable these explanations are, or which methods produce
the best explanations. This can be measured via crowd-sourced evaluations, but
they can often be noisy and expensive, leading to unreliable results. In this
paper, we carefully analyze the evaluation pipeline and develop a
cost-effective and highly accurate crowdsourced evaluation strategy. In
contrast to previous human studies that only rate whether the explanation
matches the most highly activating inputs, we estimate whether the explanation
describes neuron activations across all inputs. To estimate this effectively,
we introduce a novel application of importance sampling to determine which
inputs are the most valuable to show to raters, leading to around 30x cost
reduction compared to uniform sampling. We also analyze the label noise present
in crowd-sourced evaluations and propose a Bayesian method to aggregate
multiple ratings leading to a further ~5x reduction in number of ratings
required for the same accuracy. Finally, we use these methods to conduct a
large-scale study comparing the quality of neuron explanations produced by the
most popular methods for two different vision models.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为TACA的方法，通过动态调整跨模态注意力的温度和时序权重，解决了MM-DiT模型中文本与图像对齐不精确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MM-DiT模型（如FLUX）在文本驱动的视觉生成中，由于跨模态注意力不平衡和缺乏时序感知权重，导致文本与生成内容对齐不精确。

Method: 提出TACA方法，通过温度缩放和时序依赖调整动态平衡多模态交互，并结合LoRA微调。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench基准测试中，TACA显著提升了文本-图像对齐效果，且计算开销小。在FLUX和SD3.5等模型上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 平衡跨模态注意力对提升文本到图像扩散模型的语义保真度至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have achieved remarkable progress
in text-driven visual generation. However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models
like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and
generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of
MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token
imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of
timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address
these issues, we propose \textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention
(TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal
interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment.
When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image
alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead.
We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating
its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance,
attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the
importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in
text-to-image diffusion models. Our codes are publicly available at

TLDR: PairEdit是一种无需文本指导的视觉编辑方法，通过少量图像对学习复杂编辑语义，显著提升内容一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于示例的编辑方法仍依赖文本提示或隐式文本指令，难以精确指定某些编辑语义。

Method: 提出目标噪声预测和内容保持噪声调度，通过优化LoRAs分离语义变化与内容学习。

Result: PairEdit成功学习复杂语义，内容一致性显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PairEdit为无需文本指导的图像编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided image editing have achieved notable
success by leveraging natural language prompts for fine-grained semantic
control. However, certain editing semantics are challenging to specify
precisely using textual descriptions alone. A practical alternative involves
learning editing semantics from paired source-target examples. Existing
exemplar-based editing methods still rely on text prompts describing the change
within paired examples or learning implicit text-based editing instructions. In
this paper, we introduce PairEdit, a novel visual editing method designed to
effectively learn complex editing semantics from a limited number of image
pairs or even a single image pair, without using any textual guidance. We
propose a target noise prediction that explicitly models semantic variations
within paired images through a guidance direction term. Moreover, we introduce
a content-preserving noise schedule to facilitate more effective semantic
learning. We also propose optimizing distinct LoRAs to disentangle the learning
of semantic variations from content. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate that PairEdit successfully learns intricate semantics
while significantly improving content consistency compared to baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: UA-Pose提出了一种不确定性感知的6D物体姿态估计方法，针对部分参考信息（如不完整的3D模型或单张2D图像）进行优化，显著提升了姿态估计的鲁棒性和物体完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要完整的3D模型或大量参考图像，而部分参考信息（如不完整的3D模型或单张2D图像）下的6D姿态估计仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过初始化部分物体3D模型或利用图像到3D技术生成初始模型，并引入不确定性区分可见与不可见区域，结合不确定性感知采样策略进行在线物体补全。

Result: 在YCB-Video、YCBInEOAT和HO3D数据集上，UA-Pose显著优于现有方法，尤其在物体观测不完整时表现突出。

Conclusion: UA-Pose通过不确定性感知设计，有效解决了部分参考信息下的6D姿态估计问题，提升了准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects.
However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed
3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating
6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's
appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose
UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online
object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume
access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a
single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model
based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use
image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method
integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between
seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose
estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object
completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving
object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and
HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots
and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are
incomplete or partially captured. Project page:

TLDR: MADFormer是一种结合自回归（AR）和扩散模型的混合Transformer，通过分块生成图像，优化了高分辨率图像的生成效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合模型缺乏系统性的容量分配指导，MADFormer旨在分析AR和扩散模型的权衡关系。

Method: MADFormer将图像生成分为空间块，AR层用于全局条件，扩散层用于局部细化。

Result: 实验表明，分块生成显著提升高分辨率图像性能，混合层设计在有限计算下提升FID达75%。

Conclusion: MADFormer为未来混合生成模型提供了实用的设计原则。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal generation has increasingly combined
autoregressive (AR) and diffusion-based approaches, leveraging their
complementary strengths: AR models capture long-range dependencies and produce
fluent, context-aware outputs, while diffusion models operate in continuous
latent spaces to refine high-fidelity visual details. However, existing hybrids
often lack systematic guidance on how and why to allocate model capacity
between these paradigms. In this work, we introduce MADFormer, a Mixed
Autoregressive and Diffusion Transformer that serves as a testbed for analyzing
AR-diffusion trade-offs. MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial
blocks, using AR layers for one-pass global conditioning across blocks and
diffusion layers for iterative local refinement within each block. Through
controlled experiments on FFHQ-1024 and ImageNet, we identify two key insights:
(1) block-wise partitioning significantly improves performance on
high-resolution images, and (2) vertically mixing AR and diffusion layers
yields better quality-efficiency balances--improving FID by up to 75% under
constrained inference compute. Our findings offer practical design principles
for future hybrid generative models.

Conclusion: 该方法为3D场景理解提供了新思路，并通过量化形状编码进一步扩展了模型能力。

Abstract: Creating machines capable of understanding the world in 3D is essential in
assisting designers that build and edit 3D environments and robots navigating

language and image modeling, we investigate the potential of autoregressive
models for a new modality: structured 3D scenes. To this end, we propose a
unified LLM framework that aligns language, images, and 3D scenes and provide a
detailed ''cookbook'' outlining critical design choices for achieving optimal
training and performance addressing key questions related to data
representation, modality-specific objectives, and more. We evaluate performance
across four core 3D tasks -- rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and
question-answering -- and four 3D datasets, synthetic and real-world. We extend
our approach to reconstruct complex 3D object shapes by enriching our 3D
modality with quantized shape encodings, and show our model's effectiveness on

TLDR: MTV是一个多功能框架，用于生成与音频同步的高质量视频，通过分离音频轨道实现精细控制，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频与视觉世界紧密同步，是可控视频生成的理想控制信号，但现有方法在复杂音频类型下表现不足。

Method: MTV框架将音频分为语音、效果和音乐轨道，分别控制唇部动作、事件时间和视觉情绪，并引入DEMIX数据集支持训练。

Result: MTV在视频质量、文本一致性和音视频对齐等六个标准指标上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MTV通过音频分离和多阶段训练，实现了高质量且语义对齐的视频生成。

Abstract: Audio is inherently temporal and closely synchronized with the visual world,
making it a naturally aligned and expressive control signal for controllable
video generation (e.g., movies). Beyond control, directly translating audio
into video is essential for understanding and visualizing rich audio narratives
(e.g., Podcasts or historical recordings). However, existing approaches fall
short in generating high-quality videos with precise audio-visual
synchronization, especially across diverse and complex audio types. In this
work, we introduce MTV, a versatile framework for audio-sync video generation.
MTV explicitly separates audios into speech, effects, and music tracks,
enabling disentangled control over lip motion, event timing, and visual mood,
respectively -- resulting in fine-grained and semantically aligned video
generation. To support the framework, we additionally present DEMIX, a dataset
comprising high-quality cinematic videos and demixed audio tracks. DEMIX is
structured into five overlapped subsets, enabling scalable multi-stage training
for diverse generation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV
achieves state-of-the-art performance across six standard metrics spanning
video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment. Project page:

Motivation: 解决单目视频动态视图合成的逆问题，尤其是在零终端信噪比（SNR）计划下确定性反转的障碍。

Method: 引入K阶递归噪声表示（K-order Recursive Noise Representation）和随机潜在调制（Stochastic Latent Modulation）技术。

Result: 实验表明，通过噪声初始化阶段的结构化潜在操作，可以有效实现动态视图合成。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需训练或额外模块的情况下，成功实现了高质量的动态视图合成。

Abstract: In this work, we address dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos as an
inverse problem in a training-free setting. By redesigning the noise
initialization phase of a pre-trained video diffusion model, we enable
high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without any weight updates or auxiliary
modules. We begin by identifying a fundamental obstacle to deterministic
inversion arising from zero-terminal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) schedules and
resolve it by introducing a novel noise representation, termed K-order
Recursive Noise Representation. We derive a closed form expression for this
representation, enabling precise and efficient alignment between the
VAE-encoded and the DDIM inverted latents. To synthesize newly visible regions
resulting from camera motion, we introduce Stochastic Latent Modulation, which
performs visibility aware sampling over the latent space to complete occluded
regions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic view synthesis can
be effectively performed through structured latent manipulation in the noise
initialization phase.

Conclusion: ZeroVO无需微调或相机校准，扩展了视觉里程计的适用性，适合大规模实际部署。

Abstract: We introduce ZeroVO, a novel visual odometry (VO) algorithm that achieves
zero-shot generalization across diverse cameras and environments, overcoming
limitations in existing methods that depend on predefined or static camera
calibration setups. Our approach incorporates three main innovations. First, we
design a calibration-free, geometry-aware network structure capable of handling
noise in estimated depth and camera parameters. Second, we introduce a
language-based prior that infuses semantic information to enhance robust
feature extraction and generalization to previously unseen domains. Third, we
develop a flexible, semi-supervised training paradigm that iteratively adapts
to new scenes using unlabeled data, further boosting the models' ability to
generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. We analyze complex autonomous
driving contexts, demonstrating over 30% improvement against prior methods on
three standard benchmarks, KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2, as well as a newly
introduced, high-fidelity synthetic dataset derived from Grand Theft Auto
(GTA). By not requiring fine-tuning or camera calibration, our work broadens
the applicability of VO, providing a versatile solution for real-world

Result: 实验显示，Dreamland图像质量提升50.8%，可控性增强17.9%，并支持即插即用的预训练模型。

Conclusion: Dreamland在可控性和生成质量上显著优于基线，对AI代理训练具有潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic
visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise
controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI
agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the
granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content
output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a
layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level
semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the
simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability,
minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world
distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained
generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the
training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate
that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image
quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance
embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型（VLMs）在整合视觉和语言信息方面的能力，并诊断其失败模式。

Method: 比较VLMs与其视觉编码器的直接输出，分析视觉表征退化、任务提示的脆弱性以及语言模型在任务中的作用。

Result: VLMs在视觉任务中表现显著低于视觉编码器，主要瓶颈在于语言模型未能有效利用视觉信息。

Conclusion: VLMs在视觉任务中的失败源于语言模型未能整合视觉信息，研究为未来改进提供了诊断工具。

Abstract: Language provides a natural interface to specify and evaluate performance on
visual tasks. To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must
successfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares
VLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability
to integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric
benchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform
substantially worse than their visual encoders, dropping to near-chance
performance. We investigate these results through a series of analyses across
the entire VLM: namely 1) the degradation of vision representations, 2)
brittleness to task prompt, and 3) the language model's role in solving the
task. We find that the bottleneck in performing these vision-centric tasks lies
in this third category; VLMs are not effectively using visual information
easily accessible throughout the entire model, and they inherit the language
priors present in the LLM. Our work helps diagnose the failure modes of
open-source VLMs, and presents a series of evaluations useful for future
investigations into visual understanding within VLMs.

Motivation: 解决自回归视频扩散模型中曝光偏差的问题，即在推理时模型需要基于自身不完美的输出生成序列。

Method: 在训练中通过自回归展开和KV缓存，基于自生成输出条件生成每一帧，同时采用梯度截断策略和滚动KV缓存机制以提高效率。

Result: 实现了单GPU上的实时视频生成，延迟低于一秒，生成质量与更慢的非因果扩散模型相当或更好。

Conclusion: Self Forcing通过创新的训练策略和高效机制，显著提升了自回归视频扩散模型的性能和实用性。

Abstract: We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video
diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where
models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on
their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise
future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions
each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing
autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This
strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that
directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than
relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training
efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic
gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and
performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables
efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second
latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation
quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models. Project

Motivation: 高范数令牌会导致注意力图噪声，影响下游视觉任务性能，现有方法需重新训练模型，作者希望找到无需训练的解决方案。

Result: 方法能生成更干净的注意力和特征图，提升下游任务性能，效果接近显式训练注册令牌的模型。

Conclusion: 测试时注册令牌可替代训练时注册令牌，为预训练模型提供无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in
Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy
attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a
sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on
outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading
downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these
outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned
register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to
mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our
discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic
the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We
demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps,
enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks,
and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register
tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language
models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time
registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time,
offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without
them.

Abstract: Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature
suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a
novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs
develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing
arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM
via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake,
significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks
like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any
worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of
transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist
models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks,
while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a
challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new
post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable
and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning

*Anh-Quan Cao,Ivan Lopes,Raoul de Charette*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: StableMTL利用扩散模型在零样本设置下进行多任务学习，通过合成数据集和统一潜在损失实现任务扩展，并通过任务注意力机制提升跨任务共享效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务密集预测学习通常需要大量标注数据，而部分任务标注的方法限制了其扩展性。本文旨在通过扩散模型的泛化能力，实现零样本多任务学习。

Method: 提出StableMTL方法，利用图像生成器进行潜在回归，采用去噪框架、任务编码和统一潜在损失，并引入多流模型和任务注意力机制。

Result: 在8个基准测试的7个任务上，StableMTL优于基线方法。

Conclusion: StableMTL通过扩散模型和任务注意力机制，实现了高效的多任务学习，展示了在零样本设置下的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-task learning for dense prediction is limited by the need for extensive
annotation for every task, though recent works have explored training with
partial task labels. Leveraging the generalization power of diffusion models,
we extend the partial learning setup to a zero-shot setting, training a
multi-task model on multiple synthetic datasets, each labeled for only a subset
of tasks. Our method, StableMTL, repurposes image generators for latent
regression. Adapting a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task
conditioning and a tailored training scheme. Instead of per-task losses
requiring careful balancing, a unified latent loss is adopted, enabling
seamless scaling to more tasks. To encourage inter-task synergy, we introduce a
multi-stream model with a task-attention mechanism that converts N-to-N task
interactions into efficient 1-to-N attention, promoting effective cross-task
sharing. StableMTL outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.

*Zhen Xu,Zhengqin Li,Zhao Dong,Xiaowei Zhou,Richard Newcombe,Zhaoyang Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 4DGT是一种基于4D高斯的Transformer模型，用于动态场景重建，仅需单目视频输入，通过统一静态和动态组件，高效建模复杂时变环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态场景重建中效率低且难以处理长视频序列，4DGT旨在通过纯前馈推理和密度控制策略解决这些问题。

Method: 使用4D高斯作为归纳偏置，提出密度控制策略处理长时空输入，以滚动窗口方式处理64帧连续视频，预测场景中的一致4D高斯。

Result: 4DGT在真实视频中显著优于其他高斯网络，在跨域视频上与优化方法精度相当，重建时间从小时级降至秒级。

Conclusion: 4DGT通过高效建模和快速推理，为动态场景重建提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose 4DGT, a 4D Gaussian-based Transformer model for dynamic scene
reconstruction, trained entirely on real-world monocular posed videos. Using 4D
Gaussian as an inductive bias, 4DGT unifies static and dynamic components,
enabling the modeling of complex, time-varying environments with varying object
lifespans. We proposed a novel density control strategy in training, which
enables our 4DGT to handle longer space-time input and remain efficient
rendering at runtime. Our model processes 64 consecutive posed frames in a
rolling-window fashion, predicting consistent 4D Gaussians in the scene. Unlike
optimization-based methods, 4DGT performs purely feed-forward inference,
reducing reconstruction time from hours to seconds and scaling effectively to
long video sequences. Trained only on large-scale monocular posed video
datasets, 4DGT can outperform prior Gaussian-based networks significantly in
real-world videos and achieve on-par accuracy with optimization-based methods
on cross-domain videos. Project page: https://4dgt.github.io

### [643] [GOLFer: Smaller LM-Generated Documents Hallucination Filter & Combiner for Query Expansion in Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04762)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TLDR: GOLFer是一种利用小型开源语言模型进行查询扩展的新方法，通过过滤幻觉内容和组合文档，解决了大型语言模型的高成本和计算强度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在查询扩展中性能优越但成本高且难以访问，因此需要一种更高效且经济的方法。

Method: GOLFer包含两个模块：幻觉过滤器（检测并移除非事实和不一致的句子）和文档组合器（通过权重向量平衡查询与生成内容）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，GOLFer性能优于其他小型模型方法，并与大型模型方法竞争。

Conclusion: GOLFer为查询扩展提供了一种高效且经济的替代方案，尤其适用于资源有限的环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

*Huiyao Chen,Yi Yang,Yinghui Li,Meishan Zhang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TLDR: DISRetrieval是一种基于语言学话语结构的层次检索框架，通过RST理论组织文档，结合LLM增强节点表示和层次证据检索机制，显著提升了长文档理解的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在长文档理解中忽视话语结构的问题，提出利用语言学结构提升检索和理解效果。

Method: 1. 基于RST的文档组织框架；2. LLM增强的节点表示技术；3. 层次证据检索机制。

Result: 在QASPER和QuALITY数据集上表现优于现有方法，验证了话语结构的重要性。

Conclusion: 语言学驱动的文档表示对长文本理解至关重要，DISRetrieval为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Long document understanding has become increasingly crucial in natural
language processing, with retrieval-based methods emerging as a promising
solution to address the context length limitations of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing approaches either treat documents as flat sequences
or employ arbitrary chunking strategies, failing to capture the inherent
discourse structure that guides human comprehension. We present DISRetrieval, a
novel hierarchical retrieval framework that leverages linguistic discourse
structure to enhance long document understanding. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a discourse-aware document organization framework that
utilizes rhetorical structure theory (RST) to create sentence-level
hierarchical representations, preserving both semantic relationships and
natural document flow; (2) an LLM-enhanced node representation technique that
combines discourse structure with adaptive summarization to enrich tree nodes
with contextual information; and (3) a hierarchical evidence retrieval
mechanism that effectively selects relevant content while maintaining discourse
coherence. Through comprehensive experiments on QASPER and QuALITY datasets,
DISRetrieval demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in
both token-level retrieval metrics and downstream question answering tasks. Our
ablation studies confirm that incorporating discourse structure significantly
enhances retrieval effectiveness across different document lengths and query
types, validating the importance of linguistically-informed document
representation in long-text understanding. Our code and datasets are publicly
available at github/DreamH1gh/DISRetrieval to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.IR

TLDR: 提出了一种结合强化学习和LLM的RL-LLM-AB测试框架，用于自动化个性化A/B测试，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决个性化营销中如何通过算法优化A/B测试以最大化用户响应的问题。

Method: 基于预训练语言模型生成候选内容变体，动态融合用户画像和上下文，通过Actor-Critic结构实时选择内容版本，并利用记忆增强奖励估计器捕捉长期偏好。

Result: 在真实营销数据上优于传统A/B测试、上下文赌博机和基准强化学习方法。

Conclusion: RL-LLM-AB测试框架在个性化营销中表现出高效性和优越性。

Abstract: For personalized marketing, a new challenge of how to effectively algorithm
the A/B testing to maximize user response is urgently to be overcome. In this
paper, we present a new approach, the RL-LLM-AB test framework, for using
reinforcement learning strategy optimization combined with LLM to automate and
personalize A/B tests. The RL-LLM-AB test is built upon the pre-trained
instruction-tuned language model. It first generates A/B versions of candidate
content variants using a Prompt-Conditioned Generator, and then dynamically
embeds and fuses the user portrait and the context of the current query with
the multi-modal perception module to constitute the current interaction state.
The content version is then selected in real-time through the policy
optimization module with an Actor-Critic structure, and long-term revenue is
estimated according to real-time feedback (such as click-through rate and
conversion rate). Furthermore, a Memory-Augmented Reward Estimator is embedded
into the framework to capture long-term user preference drift, which helps to
generalize policy across multiple users and content contexts. Numerical results
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RL-LLM-ABTest over existing A/B
testing methods, including classical A/B testing, Contextual Bandits, and
benchmark reinforcement learning approaches on real-world marketing data.

TLDR: FinBERT2是一种针对金融领域优化的双向编码器，在金融分类、检索和主题建模任务中显著优于现有模型和大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在金融领域应用中的局限性，包括在判别任务中性能不足、生成任务依赖检索增强方法以及主题建模等场景的不足。

Method: 提出FinBERT2，基于32b金融语料库预训练，并开发了Fin-Labelers（判别任务）、Fin-Retrievers（检索任务）和Fin-TopicModel（主题建模）。

Result: FinBERT2在金融分类任务中平均优于其他模型9.7%-12.3%，在检索任务中优于开源和专有嵌入模型，主题建模表现优异。

Conclusion: FinBERT2为金融领域提供了高效且高性能的解决方案，填补了LLMs在金融应用中的不足。

Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only
tiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such
as GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has
revealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT
on discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources,
such as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on
generative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods
to provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing
suboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are
additional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic
modeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained
on a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the
largest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter
size. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the
financial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1)
Discriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT
variants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five
financial classification tasks. (2) Contrastive fine-tuned models
(Fin-Retrievers) outperform both open-source (e.g., +6.8\% avg improvement over
BGE-base-zh) and proprietary (e.g., +4.2\% avg improvement over OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-large) embedders across five financial retrieval tasks; (3)
Building on FinBERT2 variants, we construct the Fin-TopicModel, which enables
superior clustering and topic representation for financial titles. Our work
revisits financial BERT models through comparative analysis with contemporary
LLMs and offers practical insights for effectively utilizing FinBERT in the
LLMs era.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG在高资源语言中已有研究，但阿拉伯语的RAG组件优化仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用RAGAS框架，对多种阿拉伯语数据集进行系统评估，比较分块策略、嵌入模型、重排序器和语言模型的性能。

Result: 句子感知分块优于其他方法，BGE-M3和Multilingual-E5-large是最佳嵌入模型，重排序器显著提升复杂数据集的忠实度，Aya-8B生成质量优于StableLM。

Conclusion: 研究为构建高质量阿拉伯语RAG管道提供了关键见解，并为不同文档类型选择最优组件提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful architecture
for combining the precision of retrieval systems with the fluency of large
language models. While several studies have investigated RAG pipelines for
high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains
underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of
state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding
models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets.
Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four
core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and
answer relevancy. Our experiments demonstrate that sentence-aware chunking
outperforms all other segmentation methods, while BGE-M3 and
Multilingual-E5-large emerge as the most effective embedding models. The
inclusion of a reranker (bge-reranker-v2-m3) significantly boosts faithfulness
in complex datasets, and Aya-8B surpasses StableLM in generation quality. These
findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG
pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components
across different document types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教育平台中，现有练习推荐方法难以适应学生多样化的学习节奏，且对不活跃学生的学习模式调整不足，导致推荐准确性和多样性受限。

Method: NR4DER结合mLSTM模型优化练习筛选模块，采用序列增强方法提升不活跃学生的表示，并通过神经重排序生成多样化的推荐列表。

Result: 实验表明，NR4DER在多个真实数据集上显著优于现有方法，并能有效适应学生的学习节奏。

Conclusion: NR4DER通过改进推荐多样性和适应性，提升了在线教育平台的学习效果。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of online education platforms, an increasing
number of students are gaining new knowledge through Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCs). Exercise recommendation have made strides toward improving
student learning outcomes. However, existing methods not only struggle with
high dropout rates but also fail to match the diverse learning pace of
students. They frequently face difficulties in adjusting to inactive students'
learning patterns and in accommodating individualized learning paces, resulting
in limited accuracy and diversity in recommendations. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Neural Re-ranking for Diversified Exercise
Recommendation (in short, NR4DER). NR4DER first leverages the mLSTM model to
improve the effectiveness of the exercise filter module. It then employs a
sequence enhancement method to enhance the representation of inactive students,
accurately matches students with exercises of appropriate difficulty. Finally,
it utilizes neural re-ranking to generate diverse recommendation lists based on
individual students' learning histories. Extensive experimental results
indicate that NR4DER significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple
real-world datasets and effectively caters to the diverse learning pace of
students.

Conclusion: 现代Transformer方法在复杂航空数据分析中更具优势，未来将探索混合模型和多语言数据集。

Abstract: This study compares the effectiveness of BERTopic and Probabilistic Latent
Semantic Analysis (PLSA) in extracting meaningful topics from aviation safety
reports aiming to enhance the understanding of patterns in aviation incident
data. Using a dataset of over 36,000 National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB) reports from 2000 to 2020, BERTopic employed transformer based
embeddings and hierarchical clustering, while PLSA utilized probabilistic
modelling through the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Results showed
that BERTopic outperformed PLSA in topic coherence, achieving a Cv score of
0.41 compared to PLSA 0.37, while also demonstrating superior interpretability
as validated by aviation safety experts. These findings underscore the
advantages of modern transformer based approaches in analyzing complex aviation
datasets, paving the way for enhanced insights and informed decision-making in

Method: 扩展LlamaRec架构，引入轻量级用户偏好模块，动态识别异构知识图谱中的关键关系路径，并将其整合到Llama-2模型的提示中。

Result: 在ML-100K和Amazon Beauty数据集上，LlamaRec-LKG-RAG在MRR、NDCG和Recall等关键排序指标上显著优于LlamaRec。

Conclusion: LlamaRec-LKG-RAG证明了结构化推理在基于LLM的推荐中的重要性，为下一代推荐系统的可扩展、知识感知个性化奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in
recommender systems through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks.
However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based
retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in
user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass,
end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph
context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the
LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module
that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous
knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These
personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned
Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a
unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty
datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over LlamaRec
across key ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall). LlamaRec-LKG-RAG demonstrates
the critical value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations and
establishes a foundation for scalable, knowledge-aware personalization in
next-generation recommender systems. Code is available

Abstract: We present HotelMatch-LLM, a multimodal dense retrieval model for the travel
domain that enables natural language property search, addressing the
limitations of traditional travel search engines which require users to start
with a destination and editing search parameters. HotelMatch-LLM features three
key innovations: (1) Domain-specific multi-task optimization with three novel
retrieval, visual, and language modeling objectives; (2) Asymmetrical dense
retrieval architecture combining a small language model (SLM) for efficient
online query processing and a large language model (LLM) for embedding hotel
data; and (3) Extensive image processing to handle all property image
galleries. Experiments on four diverse test sets show HotelMatch-LLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, including VISTA and MARVEL.
Specifically, on the test set -- main query type -- we achieve 0.681 for
HotelMatch-LLM compared to 0.603 for the most effective baseline, MARVEL. Our

TLDR: 论文提出了一种利用q-度量空间的投影方法，通过强化三角不等式来优化向量搜索算法，显著降低搜索复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量搜索算法忽视了向量嵌入的度量结构，未充分利用其潜在特性。

Method: 提出一种投影方法，将任意相异性度量的向量数据集嵌入到q-度量空间，并学习近似投影以高效转换查询点。

Result: 实验表明，该方法使经典度量树算法在高维数据中表现优异，媲美最先进的搜索方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用q-度量空间的特性，可以显著提升向量搜索算法的效率和性能。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of vector search applications, prevailing search
algorithms overlook the metric structure of vector embeddings, treating it as a
constraint rather than exploiting its underlying properties. In this paper, we
demonstrate that in $q$-metric spaces, metric trees can leverage a stronger
version of the triangle inequality to reduce comparisons for exact search.
Notably, as $q$ approaches infinity, the search complexity becomes logarithmic.
Therefore, we propose a novel projection method that embeds vector datasets
with arbitrary dissimilarity measures into $q$-metric spaces while preserving
the nearest neighbor. We propose to learn an approximation of this projection
to efficiently transform query points to a space where euclidean distances
satisfy the desired properties. Our experimental results with text and image
vector embeddings show that learning $q$-metric approximations enables classic
metric tree algorithms -- which typically underperform with high-dimensional
data -- to achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art search
methods.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于控制函数的两阶段方法，用于纠正隐式反馈数据中的位置偏差，无需依赖点击或倾向模型，且适用于非线性排名模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式反馈数据（如用户点击）易受位置偏差影响，直接用于学习排序系统会导致性能下降。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段利用排名过程的残差外生变量纠正第二阶段点击方程中的位置偏差。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在纠正位置偏差方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可应用于任何先进排序算法，并通过去偏验证点击优化超参数选择。

Abstract: Implicit feedback data, such as user clicks, is commonly used in
learning-to-rank (LTR) systems because it is easy to collect and it often
reflects user preferences. However, this data is prone to various biases, and
training an LTR system directly on biased data can result in suboptimal ranking
performance. One of the most prominent and well-studied biases in implicit
feedback data is position bias, which occurs because users are more likely to
interact with higher-ranked documents regardless of their true relevance. In
this paper, we propose a novel control function-based method that accounts for
position bias in a two-stage process. The first stage uses exogenous variation
from the residuals of the ranking process to correct for position bias in the
second stage click equation. Unlike previous position bias correction methods,
our method does not require knowledge of the click or propensity model and
allows for nonlinearity in the underlying ranking model. Moreover, our method
is general and allows for debiasing any state-of-the-art ranking algorithm by
plugging it into the second stage. We also introduce a technique to debias
validation clicks for hyperparameter tuning to select the optimal model in the
absence of unbiased validation data. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in correcting for position bias.

Abstract: Modern large-scale recommender systems employ multi-stage ranking funnel
(Retrieval, Pre-ranking, Ranking) to balance engagement and computational
constraints (latency, CPU). However, the initial retrieval stage, often relying
on efficient but less precise methods like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), struggles
to effectively surface the most engaging items from billion-scale catalogs,
particularly distinguishing highly relevant and engaging candidates from merely
relevant ones. We introduce Recall Augmentation through Deferred Asynchronous
Retrieval (RADAR), a novel framework that leverages asynchronous, offline
computation to pre-rank a significantly larger candidate set for users using
the full complexity ranking model. These top-ranked items are stored and
utilized as a high-quality retrieval source during online inference, bypassing
online retrieval and pre-ranking stages for these candidates. We demonstrate
through offline experiments that RADAR significantly boosts recall (2X
Recall@200 vs DNN retrieval baseline) by effectively combining a larger
retrieved candidate set with a more powerful ranking model. Online A/B tests
confirm a +0.8% lift in topline engagement metrics, validating RADAR as a
practical and effective method to improve recommendation quality under strict
online serving constraints.

*Ken Yagel,Eyal German,Aviel Ben Siman Tov*

Main category: cs.IR

TLDR: MoE-MLoRA是一种混合专家框架，通过动态加权专家贡献提升多领域推荐系统的性能，尤其在动态数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法（如MLoRA）在处理多样化用户行为时缺乏灵活性的问题。

Method: 独立训练每个专家以专注于其领域，再训练门控网络动态加权专家贡献。

Result: 在动态数据集上性能提升明显（如Taobao-20的Weighed-AUC提高1.45），但在低多样性和稀疏性数据集上效果有限。

Conclusion: 专家架构在多领域推荐系统中潜力显著，任务感知的专业化和自适应门控能提升复杂环境下的预测准确性。

Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems must adapt to user interactions across
different domains. Traditional approaches like MLoRA apply a single adaptation
per domain but lack flexibility in handling diverse user behaviors. To address
this, we propose MoE-MLoRA, a mixture-of-experts framework where each expert is
first trained independently to specialize in its domain before a gating network
is trained to weight their contributions dynamically. We evaluate MoE-MLoRA
across eight CTR models on Movielens and Taobao, showing that it improves
performance in large-scale, dynamic datasets (+1.45 Weighed-AUC in Taobao-20)
but offers limited benefits in structured datasets with low domain diversity
and sparsity. Further analysis of the number of experts per domain reveals that
larger ensembles do not always improve performance, indicating the need for
model-aware tuning. Our findings highlight the potential of expert-based
architectures for multi-domain recommendation systems, demonstrating that
task-aware specialization and adaptive gating can enhance predictive accuracy
in complex environments. The implementation and code are available in our
GitHub repository.

Motivation: 研究实二次域类群的结构与计算复杂性，填补Stark猜想中具体构造的空白，并明确量子计算的复杂度界限。

Method: 通过p-adic Hodge理论和扩展Coleman积分定义Stark-Coleman不变量κ_p(K)，并在广义黎曼假设下证明其分类能力。

Result: 解决了判别式D>10^32的类群同构问题，并给出了类群离散对数问题的量子下界。

Conclusion: Stark单位限制了类群的几何结构，为计算复杂性提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Class groups of real quadratic fields represent fundamental structures in
algebraic number theory with significant computational implications. While
Stark's conjecture establishes theoretical connections between special units
and class group structures, explicit constructions have remained elusive, and
precise quantum complexity bounds for class group computations are lacking.
Here we establish an integrated framework defining Stark-Coleman invariants
$\kappa_p(K) = \log_p \left(
\frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{St},p}}{\sigma(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{St},p})} \right)
\mod p^{\mathrm{ord}_p(\Delta_K)}$ through a synthesis of $p$-adic Hodge theory
and extended Coleman integration. We prove these invariants classify class
groups under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), resolving the
isomorphism problem for discriminants $D > 10^{32}$. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that this approach yields the quantum lower bound
$\exp\left(\Omega\left(\frac{\log D}{(\log \log D)^2}\right)\right)$ for the
class group discrete logarithm problem, improving upon previous bounds lacking
explicit constants. Our results indicate that Stark units constrain the
geometric organization of class groups, providing theoretical insight into
computational complexity barriers.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为HyColor的高效混合启发式算法，用于解决图着色问题（GCP），特别擅长处理大规模稀疏图和小规模稠密图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于GCP的NP难性质，现有算法主要针对小规模难图或大规模稀疏图，缺乏一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: HyColor结合了局部决策策略、图简化策略以及基于k核和混合度的贪心启发式方法。

Result: 在209个实例的测试中，HyColor在93%的案例中表现最佳，显著优于现有算法，并在128个实例中实现了最优着色。

Conclusion: HyColor是一种高效且通用的GCP解决方案，适用于多种图类型。

Abstract: The graph coloring problem (GCP) is a classic combinatorial optimization
problem that aims to find the minimum number of colors assigned to vertices of
a graph such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. GCP has been
extensively studied by researchers from various fields, including mathematics,
computer science, and biological science. Due to the NP-hard nature, many
heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve GCP. However, existing GCP
algorithms focus on either small hard graphs or large-scale sparse graphs (with
up to 10^7 vertices). This paper presents an efficient hybrid heuristic
algorithm for GCP, named HyColor, which excels in handling large-scale sparse
graphs while achieving impressive results on small dense graphs. The efficiency
of HyColor comes from the following three aspects: a local decision strategy to
improve the lower bound on the chromatic number; a graph-reduction strategy to
reduce the working graph; and a k-core and mixed degree-based greedy heuristic
for efficiently coloring graphs. HyColor is evaluated against three
state-of-the-art GCP algorithms across four benchmarks, comprising three
large-scale sparse graph benchmarks and one small dense graph benchmark,
totaling 209 instances. The results demonstrate that HyColor consistently
outperforms existing heuristic algorithms in both solution accuracy and
computational efficiency for the majority of instances. Notably, HyColor
achieved the best solutions in 194 instances (over 93%), with 34 of these
solutions significantly surpassing those of other algorithms. Furthermore,
HyColor successfully determined the chromatic number and achieved optimal
coloring in 128 instances.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) provides a structured approach to
integrating physical knowledge into data-driven modeling, offering significant
potential for advancing hydrological research. In recent years, multiple
methodological families have emerged, including physics-informed machine
learning, physics-guided machine learning, hybrid physics-machine learning, and
data-driven physics discovery. Within each of these families, a proliferation
of heterogeneous approaches has developed independently, often without
conceptual coordination. This fragmentation complicates the assessment of
methodological novelty and makes it difficult to identify where meaningful
advances can still be made in the absence of a unified conceptual framework.
This review, the first focused overview of SciML in hydrology, addresses these
limitations by proposing a unified methodological framework for each SciML
family, bringing together representative contributions into a coherent
structure that fosters conceptual clarity and supports cumulative progress in
hydrological modeling. Finally, we highlight the limitations and future
opportunities of each unified family to guide systematic research in hydrology,
where these methods remain underutilized.

TLDR: TERAIO是一个基于SSD的GPU内存扩展框架，通过智能张量卸载/预取优化LLM训练性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到LLM训练中活跃张量仅占GPU内存的1.7%，非活跃张量占用大量内存且长时间未使用，为卸载/预取提供了机会。

Method: 通过分析张量生命周期生成优化卸载/预取计划，并利用GPUDirect存储直接迁移张量。

Result: 相比现有技术（如ZeRO-Offload），TERAIO平均提升LLM训练性能1.47倍，达到理想性能的80.7%。

Conclusion: TERAIO有效扩展GPU内存并显著提升LLM训练效率。

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of a new lifetime-aware tensor
offloading framework for GPU memory expansion using low-cost PCIe-based
solid-state drives (SSDs). Our framework, TERAIO, is developed explicitly for
large language model (LLM) training with multiple GPUs and multiple SSDs. Its
design is driven by our observation that the active tensors take only a small
fraction (1.7% on average) of allocated GPU memory in each LLM training
iteration, the inactive tensors are usually large and will not be used for a
long period of time, creating ample opportunities for offloading/prefetching
tensors to/from slow SSDs without stalling the GPU training process. TERAIO
accurately estimates the lifetime (active period of time in GPU memory) of each
tensor with the profiling of the first few iterations in the training process.
With the tensor lifetime analysis, TERAIO will generate an optimized tensor
offloading/prefetching plan and integrate it into the compiled LLM program via
PyTorch. TERAIO has a runtime tensor migration engine to execute the
offloading/prefetching plan via GPUDirect storage, which allows direct tensor
migration between GPUs and SSDs for alleviating the CPU bottleneck and
maximizing the SSD bandwidth utilization. In comparison with state-of-the-art
studies such as ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity, we show that TERAIO improves
the training performance of various LLMs by 1.47x on average, and achieves
80.7% of the ideal performance assuming unlimited GPU memory.

TLDR: pFedSOP利用二阶优化加速个性化联邦学习，减少通信轮次并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统联邦学习中因数据异构导致模型泛化能力差的问题，以及现有PFL方法因一阶优化收敛慢和额外计算需求导致的效率低下。

Method: 提出pFedSOP，通过Gompertz函数计算个性化梯度更新，利用正则化Fisher信息矩阵近似Hessian矩阵进行二阶优化。

Result: 在异构图像分类数据集上，pFedSOP优于现有FL和PFL算法。

Conclusion: pFedSOP通过二阶优化高效加速个性化模型训练，减少通信轮次并提升性能。

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) enables clients to collaboratively
train personalized models tailored to their individual objectives, addressing
the challenge of model generalization in traditional Federated Learning (FL)
due to high data heterogeneity. However, existing PFL methods often require
increased communication rounds to achieve the desired performance, primarily
due to slow training caused by the use of first-order optimization, which has
linear convergence. Additionally, many of these methods increase local
computation because of the additional data fed into the model during the search
for personalized local models. One promising solution to this slow training is
second-order optimization, known for its quadratic convergence. However,
employing it in PFL is challenging due to the Hessian matrix and its inverse.
In this paper, we propose pFedSOP, which efficiently utilizes second-order
optimization in PFL to accelerate the training of personalized models and
enhance performance with fewer communication rounds. Our approach first
computes a personalized local gradient update using the Gompertz function-based
normalized angle between local and global gradient updates, incorporating
client-specific global information. We then use a regularized Fisher
Information Matrix (FIM), computed from this personalized gradient update, as
an approximation of the Hessian to update the personalized models. This
FIM-based second-order optimization speeds up training with fewer communication
rounds by tackling the challenges with exact Hessian and avoids additional data
being fed into the model during the search for personalized local models.
Extensive experiments on heterogeneously partitioned image classification
datasets with partial client participation demonstrate that pFedSOP outperforms
state-of-the-art FL and PFL algorithms.

Result: 在弹性板损伤成像实验中，该方法不仅加速了成像过程，还显著提升了复杂环境下的图像质量。

Conclusion: 基于差异原则的神经网络正则化方法能高效生成高质量图像，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: A supervised learning approach is proposed for regularization of large
inverse problems where the main operator is built from noisy data. This is
germane to superresolution imaging via the sampling indicators of the inverse
scattering theory. We aim to accelerate the spatiotemporal regularization
process for this class of inverse problems to enable real-time imaging. In this
approach, a neural operator maps each pattern on the right-hand side of the
scattering equation to its affiliated regularization parameter. The network is
trained in two steps which entails: (1) training on low-resolution
regularization maps furnished by the Morozov discrepancy principle with
nonoptimal thresholds, and (2) optimizing network predictions through
minimization of the Tikhonov loss function regulated by the validation loss.
Step 2 allows for tailoring of the approximate maps of Step 1 toward
construction of higher quality images. This approach enables direct learning
from test data and dispenses with the need for a-priori knowledge of the
optimal regularization maps. The network, trained on low-resolution data,
quickly generates dense regularization maps for high-resolution imaging. We
highlight the importance of the training loss function on the network's
generalizability. In particular, we demonstrate that networks informed by the
logic of discrepancy principle lead to images of higher contrast. In this case,
the training process involves many-objective optimization. We propose a new
method to adaptively select the appropriate loss weights during training
without requiring an additional optimization process. The proposed approach is
synthetically examined for imaging damage evolution in an elastic plate. The
results indicate that the discrepancy-informed regularization networks not only
accelerate the imaging process, but also remarkably enhance the image quality
in complex environments.

Motivation: 在物联网和移动平台时代，如何在硬件资源受限的设备上确保内容真实性是一个关键问题。

Method: 采用混合快速小波变换和加性量化索引调制（FWT-AQIM）方案，在YCbCr颜色空间的亮度分量中嵌入水印，使用低频FWT子带以减少感知失真。

Result: 在树莓派5上测试，嵌入和提取过程耗时少于40毫秒，内存占用低；PSNR≥34 dB，SSIM≥0.97；抗几何和信号处理攻击能力强，NCC≥0.998。

Conclusion: FWT-AQIM为带宽和功耗受限的场景提供了一种高效、可扩展的实时水印解决方案，适用于物联网和多媒体应用。

Abstract: In the age of IoT and mobile platforms, ensuring that content stay authentic
whilst avoiding overburdening limited hardware is a key problem. This study
introduces hybrid Fast Wavelet Transform & Additive Quantization index
Modulation (FWT-AQIM) scheme, a lightweight watermarking approach that secures
digital pictures on low-power, memory-constrained small scale devices to
achieve a balanced trade-off among robustness, imperceptibility, and
computational efficiency. The method embeds watermark in the luminance
component of YCbCr color space using low-frequency FWT sub-bands, minimizing
perceptual distortion, using additive QIM for simplicity. Both the extraction
and embedding processes run in less than 40 ms and require minimum RAM when
tested on a Raspberry Pi 5. Quality assessments on standard and high-resolution
images yield PSNR greater than equal to 34 dB and SSIM greater than equal to
0.97, while robustness verification includes various geometric and
signal-processing attacks demonstrating near-zero bit error rates and NCC
greater than equal to 0.998. Using a mosaic-based watermark, redundancy added
enhancing robustness without reducing throughput, which peaks at 11 MP/s. These
findings show that FWT-AQIM provides an efficient, scalable solution for
real-time, secure watermarking in bandwidth- and power-constrained contexts,
opening the way for dependable content protection in developing IoT and
multimedia applications.

Method: 收集了741个人工标注的数据集，包含短长文本描述和兴趣区域框，评估CLIP模型在不同静态子区域和全图上的检索性能。

Result: 简单的3x3分区和5网格重叠显著提高了检索效果，并对标注框的扰动保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于位置的提示可以有效提升模糊文本查询在专业领域中的图像检索性能。

Abstract: Advances in multimodal text-image models have enabled effective text-based
querying in extensive image collections. While these models show convincing
performance for everyday life scenes, querying in highly homogeneous,
specialized domains remains challenging. The primary problem is that users can
often provide only vague textual descriptions as they lack expert knowledge to
discriminate between homogenous entities. This work investigates whether adding
location-based prompts to complement these vague text queries can enhance
retrieval performance. Specifically, we collected a dataset of 741 human
annotations, each containing short and long textual descriptions and bounding
boxes indicating regions of interest in challenging underwater scenes. Using
these annotations, we evaluate the performance of CLIP when queried on various
static sub-regions of images compared to the full image. Our results show that
both a simple 3-by-3 partitioning and a 5-grid overlap significantly improve
retrieval effectiveness and remain robust to perturbations of the annotation
box.

Result: 现有模型在明确的数据科学代码生成任务中表现良好，但在需要广泛数据处理和领域知识的真实管道中表现不足。

Conclusion: KRAMABENCH是开发自主数据科学代理的重要一步，代码和框架已开源。

Abstract: Constructing real-world data-to-insight pipelines often involves data
extraction from data lakes, data integration across heterogeneous data sources,
and diverse operations from data cleaning to analysis. The design and
implementation of data science pipelines require domain knowledge, technical
expertise, and even project-specific insights. AI systems have shown remarkable
reasoning, coding, and understanding capabilities. However, it remains unclear
to what extent these capabilities translate into successful design and
execution of such complex pipelines. We introduce KRAMABENCH: a benchmark
composed of 104 manually-curated real-world data science pipelines spanning
1700 data files from 24 data sources in 6 different domains. We show that these
pipelines test the end-to-end capabilities of AI systems on data processing,
requiring data discovery, wrangling and cleaning, efficient processing,
statistical reasoning, and orchestrating data processing steps given a
high-level task. Our evaluation tests 5 general models and 3 code generation
models using our reference framework, DS-GURU, which instructs the AI model to
decompose a question into a sequence of subtasks, reason through each step, and
synthesize Python code that implements the proposed design. Our results on
KRAMABENCH show that, although the models are sufficiently capable of solving
well-specified data science code generation tasks, when extensive data
processing and domain knowledge are required to construct real-world data
science pipelines, existing out-of-box models fall short. Progress on
KramaBench represents crucial steps towards developing autonomous data science
agents for real-world applications. Our code, reference framework, and data are

Conclusion: ARGOS在O-RAN框架下有效检测RBS攻击，为5G安全提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Rogue Base Station (RBS) attacks, particularly those exploiting downgrade
vulnerabilities, remain a persistent threat as 5G Standalone (SA) deployments
are still limited and User Equipment (UE) manufacturers continue to support
legacy network connectivity. This work introduces ARGOS, a comprehensive O-RAN
compliant Intrusion Detection System (IDS) deployed within the Near Real-Time
RIC, designed to detect RBS downgrade attacks in real time, an area previously
unexplored within the O-RAN context. The system enhances the 3GPP KPM Service
Model to enable richer, UE-level telemetry and features a custom xApp that
applies unsupervised Machine Learning models for anomaly detection.
Distinctively, the updated KPM Service Model operates on cross-layer features
extracted from Modem Layer 1 (ML1) logs and Measurement Reports collected
directly from Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) UEs. To evaluate system
performance under realistic conditions, a dedicated testbed is implemented
using Open5GS, srsRAN, and FlexRIC, and validated against an extensive
real-world measurement dataset. Among the evaluated models, the Variational

Result: 研究发现，CKKS方案在错误容忍性和鲁棒性方面存在挑战，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Conclusion: 本文首次深入探讨了同态加密的鲁棒性和错误敏感性，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) enables secure computation on encrypted data
without decryption, allowing a great opportunity for privacy-preserving
computation. In particular, domains such as healthcare, finance, and
government, where data privacy and security are of utmost importance, can
benefit from HE by enabling third-party computation and services on sensitive
data. In other words, HE constitutes the "Holy Grail" of cryptography: data
remains encrypted all the time, being protected while in use.
  HE's security guarantees rely on noise added to data to make relatively
simple problems computationally intractable. This error-centric intrinsic HE
mechanism generates new challenges related to the fault tolerance and
robustness of HE itself: hardware- and software-induced errors during HE
operation can easily evade traditional error detection and correction
mechanisms, resulting in silent data corruption (SDC).
  In this work, we motivate a thorough discussion regarding the sensitivity of
HE applications to bit faults and provide a detailed error characterization
study of CKKS (Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song). This is one of the most popular HE schemes
due to its fixed-point arithmetic support for AI and machine learning
applications. We also delve into the impact of the residue number system (RNS)
and the number theoretic transform (NTT), two widely adopted HE optimization
techniques, on CKKS' error sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work that looks into the robustness and error sensitivity of
homomorphic encryption and, as such, it can pave the way for critical future
work in this area.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in generating code for general-purpose programming languages. In
contrast, their applicability for hardware description languages, particularly
for generating synthesizable and functionally correct designs, remains
significantly underexplored. HDLs such as SystemVerilog are logic-oriented and
demand strict adherence to timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability
constraints. Moreover, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks
beyond structural code generation, including testbench development,
assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration
for on-chip communication. The objective of our paper is to analyze the
capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating SystemVerilog
implementations of standard communication protocols, a core component of
embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. This paper introduces the
first benchmark suite targeting four widely used protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, and
AXI. We define code generation tasks that capture varying levels of design
abstraction and prompt specificity. The generated designs are assessed for
syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity via waveform
simulation and test benches.

Motivation: FPGA部署强化学习资源消耗大，尤其是在高质量图像训练中，因此需要一种高效且低能耗的解决方案。

Conclusion: QForce-RL通过量化和硬件加速，实现了高效、灵活的部署，显著提升了性能和能效。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has outperformed other counterparts in sequential
decision-making and dynamic environment control. However, FPGA deployment is
significantly resource-expensive, as associated with large number of
computations in training agents with high-quality images and possess new
challenges. In this work, we propose QForce-RL takes benefits of quantization
to enhance throughput and reduce energy footprint with light-weight RL
architecture, without significant performance degradation. QForce-RL takes
advantages from E2HRL to reduce overall RL actions to learn desired policy and
QuaRL for quantization based SIMD for hardware acceleration. We have also
provided detailed analysis for different RL environments, with emphasis on
model size, parameters, and accelerated compute ops. The architecture is
scalable for resource-constrained devices and provide parametrized efficient
deployment with flexibility in latency, throughput, power, and energy
efficiency. The proposed QForce-RL provides performance enhancement up to 2.3x
and better FPS - 2.6x compared to SoTA works.

Main category: cs.AR

TLDR: MAGNet是一种混合深度学习模型，结合改进的U-Net和图神经网络（GNN），用于集成电路设计中的DRC违规预测，显著提升了预测精度并降低了误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计规则检查（DRC）对降低成本和提升设计效率至关重要，机器学习方法成为重要手段。

Method: MAGNet结合改进的U-Net（含动态注意力模块和多尺度卷积模块）和GNN，通过像素对齐的图结构建模拓扑关系，并采用标签放大策略增强稀疏违规模式的敏感性。

Result: MAGNet在DRC热点检测中表现优于ibUnet、RouteNet和J-Net，显著提升了整体性能。

Conclusion: MAGNet通过结合空间、语义和结构信息，实现了更准确的DRC违规预测，并通过增量训练进一步提升了热点识别能力。

Abstract: Design rule checking (DRC) is of great significance for cost reduction and
design efficiency improvement in integrated circuit (IC) designs.
Machine-learning-based DRC has become an important approach in computer-aided
design (CAD). In this paper, we propose MAGNet, a hybrid deep learning model
that integrates an improved U-Net with a graph neural network for DRC violation
prediction. The U-Net backbone is enhanced with a Dynamic Attention Module
(DAM) and a Multi-Scale Convolution Module (MSCM) to strengthen its capability
in extracting fine-grained and multi-scale spatial features. In parallel, we
construct a pixel-aligned graph structure based on chip layout tiles, and apply
a specialized GNN to model the topological relationships among pins. During
graph construction, a graph-to-grid mapping is generated to align GNN features
with the layout image. In addition, a label amplification strategy is adopted
during training to enhance the model's sensitivity to sparse violation
patterns. Overall, MAGNet effectively combines spatial, semantic, and
structural information, achieving improved prediction accuracy and reduced
false positive rates in DRC hotspot detection. Subsequently, through
incremental training, we achieve a more sensitive discrimination ability for
hotspots. The results demonstrate that, in comparison with ibUnet, RouteNet,
and J-Net, MAGnet significantly outperforms these models, achieving substantial
improvements in overall performance.

Main category: cs.AR

TLDR: VeriLoC是一种新方法，直接从Verilog代码预测设计质量（如时序和布线拥塞），在行级和模块级均表现优异，显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代芯片设计复杂，需要从Verilog代码早期预测关键设计质量指标，尤其是行级预测。现有方法未解决行级预测问题。

Method: VeriLoC利用Verilog代码生成LLM提取行级和模块级嵌入，训练分类器/回归器，结合这些嵌入进行预测。

Result: VeriLoC在行级拥塞和时序预测中F1分数达0.86-0.95，平均百分比误差从14%-18%降至4%。

Conclusion: VeriLoC不仅提升了预测性能，其嵌入和方法对其他硬件设计任务也有潜在价值。

Abstract: Modern chip design is complex, and there is a crucial need for early-stage
prediction of key design-quality metrics like timing and routing congestion
directly from Verilog code (a commonly used programming language for hardware
design). It is especially important yet complex to predict individual lines of
code that cause timing violations or downstream routing congestion. Prior works
have tried approaches like converting Verilog into an intermediate graph
representation and using LLM embeddings alongside other features to predict
module-level quality, but did not consider line-level quality prediction. We
propose VeriLoC, the first method that predicts design quality directly from
Verilog at both the line- and module-level. To this end, VeriLoC leverages
recent Verilog code-generation LLMs to extract local line-level and
module-level embeddings, and train downstream classifiers/regressors on
concatenations of these embeddings. VeriLoC achieves high F1-scores of
0.86-0.95 for line-level congestion and timing prediction, and reduces the mean
average percentage error from 14% - 18% for SOTA methods down to only 4%. We
believe that VeriLoC embeddings and insights from our work will also be of
value for other predictive and optimization tasks for complex hardware design.

Main category: cs.AR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Bullseye的预测器，用于解决TAGE-SC-L预测器中难以预测的分支问题，通过并行子系统提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TAGE-SC-L预测器中难以预测的分支（H2P）导致大量误预测，单纯扩大表格效果有限，需针对性改进。

Method: 设计了一个28 KB的Bullseye子系统，包含H2P识别表、两个感知器和缓存，并行运行并动态调整。

Result: 平均MPKI为3.4045，CycWpPKI为145.09，显著提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: Bullseye预测器有效解决了H2P分支问题，减少了误预测，提升了处理器性能。

Abstract: Branch prediction is key to the performance of out-of-order processors. While
the CBP-2016 winner TAGE-SC-L combines geometric-history tables, a statistical
corrector, and a loop predictor, over half of its remaining mispredictions stem
from a small set of hard-to-predict (H2P) branches. These branches occur under
diverse global histories, causing repeated thrashing in TAGE and eviction
before usefulness counters can mature. Prior work shows that simply enlarging
the tables offers only marginal improvement.
  We augment a 159 KB TAGE-SC-L predictor with a 28 KB H2P-targeted subsystem
called the Bullseye predictor. It identifies problematic PCs using a
set-associative H2P Identification Table (HIT) and steers them to one of two
branch-specific perceptrons, one indexed by hashed local history and the other
by folded global history. A short trial phase tracks head-to-head accuracy in
an H2P cache. A branch becomes perceptron-resident only if the perceptron's
sustained accuracy and output magnitude exceed dynamic thresholds, after which
TAGE updates for that PC are suppressed to reduce pollution. The HIT, cache,
and perceptron operate fully in parallel with TAGE-SC-L, providing higher
fidelity on the H2P tail. This achieves an average MPKI of 3.4045 and CycWpPKI
of 145.09.

TLDR: ASPO是一种改进的贝叶斯优化方法，支持处理分类参数约束并加速FPGA软处理器设计优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准贝叶斯优化（BO）无法处理分类参数约束，且优化时间随处理器复杂度增加，限制了其在FPGA软处理器设计中的应用。

Method: ASPO通过定制BO的数学机制，引入新的协方差核处理分类参数，并通过惩罚获取函数和重用FPGA合成检查点加速设计评估。

Result: ASPO在RISC-V基准测试中，将BOOM处理器的“multiply”基准执行时间减少35%，设计时间比现有方法减少74%。

Conclusion: ASPO成功解决了标准BO在软处理器设计中的限制，显著提升了优化效率和性能。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has shown promise in tuning processor design
parameters. However, standard BO does not support constraints involving
categorical parameters such as types of branch predictors and division
circuits. In addition, optimization time of BO grows with processor complexity,
which becomes increasingly significant especially for FPGA-based soft
processors. This paper introduces ASPO, an approach that leverages disjunctive
form to enable BO to handle constraints involving categorical parameters.
Unlike existing methods that directly apply standard BO, the proposed ASPO
method, for the first time, customizes the mathematical mechanism of BO to
address challenges faced by soft-processor designs on FPGAs. Specifically, ASPO
supports categorical parameters using a novel customized BO covariance kernel.
It also accelerates the design evaluation procedure by penalizing the BO
acquisition function with potential evaluation time and by reusing FPGA
synthesis checkpoints from previously evaluated configurations. ASPO targets
three soft processors: RocketChip, BOOM, and EL2 VeeR. The approach is
evaluated based on seven RISC-V benchmarks. Results show that ASPO can reduce
execution time for the ``multiply'' benchmark on the BOOM processor by up to
35\% compared to the default configuration. Furthermore, it reduces design time
for the BOOM processor by up to 74\% compared to Boomerang, a state-of-the-art
hardware-oriented BO approach.

Main category: cs.RO

TLDR: 论文提出了Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite，一个用于主动触觉感知任务的开源基准测试套件，填补了触觉感知和主动感知领域缺乏标准化基准的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉感知能增强机器人操作的灵活性，但其局部性限制了全局场景理解。主动感知技术可以弥补这一不足，但缺乏标准化基准阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 引入Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite，提供多样化的模拟场景和真实数据集，包括合成3D MNIST数字模型和真实触觉样本，并使用CycleGAN进行触觉模拟渲染。

Result: 提供了13,500个合成3D MNIST数字模型和153,600个真实触觉样本，支持定位、分类和体积估计等任务。

Conclusion: 该基准套件通过标准化协议和可复现的评估框架，推动了触觉感知和主动感知领域的系统性进展。

Abstract: Tactile perception has the potential to significantly enhance dexterous
robotic manipulation by providing rich local information that can complement or
substitute for other sensory modalities such as vision. However, because
tactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that
require broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A
human-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception
techniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more
informative or significant features and integrate such information over time in
order to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and
different methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention
recently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an
open-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active
tactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume
estimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from
simple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using
vision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore, we also offer a comprehensive
dataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit models and 153,600
real-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits. Using this
dataset, we train a CycleGAN for realistic tactile simulation rendering. By
providing standardized protocols and reproducible evaluation frameworks, our
benchmark suite facilitates systematic progress in the fields of tactile
sensing and active perception.

Conclusion: CPS-Guard为安全和安全关键系统提供了结构化且可扩展的严格验证解决方案。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) increasingly depend on advanced AI techniques to
operate in critical applications. However, traditional verification and
validation methods often struggle to handle the unpredictable and dynamic
nature of AI components. In this paper, we introduce CPS-Guard, a novel
framework that employs multi-role orchestration to automate the iterative
assurance process for AI-powered CPS. By assigning specialized roles (e.g.,
safety monitoring, security assessment, fault injection, and recovery planning)
to dedicated agents within a simulated environment, CPS-Guard continuously
evaluates and refines AI behavior against a range of dependability
requirements. We demonstrate the framework through a case study involving an
autonomous vehicle navigating an intersection with an AI-based planner. Our
results show that CPS-Guard effectively detects vulnerabilities, manages
performance impacts, and supports adaptive recovery strategies, thereby
offering a structured and extensible solution for rigorous V&V in safety- and
security-critical systems.

TLDR: ECOD框架利用边缘计算和多CAV协作实现实时多视角物体检测，显著提升精度并降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统车载感知系统因遮挡和盲区精度有限，云端方案延迟高，无法满足实时需求。

Method: ECOD整合PACE（感知聚合与协作估计）和VOTE（变量对象统计与评估）算法，通过边缘计算和多CAV协作实现实时检测。

Result: 实验显示ECOD将物体分类精度提升75%，同时确保低延迟实时处理。

Conclusion: 边缘计算能有效提升协作感知能力，适用于延迟敏感的自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable object detection is critical for ensuring the safety
and efficiency of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Traditional on-board
perception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots,
while cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them
unsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative
framework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that
leverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time,
multi-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key
algorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and
Variable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data
from multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where
individual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting
mechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data
from multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in
real-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We
develop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped
robotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our
experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of
improved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional
single-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency,
edge-driven real-time processing. This research highlights the potential of
edge computing to enhance collaborative perception for latency-sensitive
autonomous systems.

TLDR: ATENA是一个测试时主动学习框架，通过人类-机器人交互优化导航策略，减少预测不确定性并提升适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线训练的视觉语言导航策略在陌生环境中性能下降，熵最小化可能因错误累积导致过度自信。

Method: 提出混合熵优化和自我主动学习策略，结合动作和伪专家分布调整不确定性。

Result: 在REVERIE、R2R和R2R-CE等基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ATENA能有效应对测试时的分布偏移，提升导航决策的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) policies trained on offline datasets often
exhibit degraded task performance when deployed in unfamiliar navigation
environments at test time, where agents are typically evaluated without access
to external interaction or feedback. Entropy minimization has emerged as a
practical solution for reducing prediction uncertainty at test time; however,
it can suffer from accumulated errors, as agents may become overconfident in
incorrect actions without sufficient contextual grounding. To tackle these
challenges, we introduce ATENA (Active TEst-time Navigation Agent), a test-time
active learning framework that enables a practical human-robot interaction via
episodic feedback on uncertain navigation outcomes. In particular, ATENA learns
to increase certainty in successful episodes and decrease it in failed ones,
improving uncertainty calibration. Here, we propose mixture entropy
optimization, where entropy is obtained from a combination of the action and
pseudo-expert distributions-a hypothetical action distribution assuming the
agent's selected action to be optimal-controlling both prediction confidence
and action preference. In addition, we propose a self-active learning strategy
that enables an agent to evaluate its navigation outcomes based on confident
predictions. As a result, the agent stays actively engaged throughout all
iterations, leading to well-grounded and adaptive decision-making. Extensive
evaluations on challenging VLN benchmarks-REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE-demonstrate
that ATENA successfully overcomes distributional shifts at test time,
outperforming the compared baseline methods across various settings.

Motivation: 解决视频生成模型在新任务中泛化能力不足的问题，并探索如何通过在线自学习提升性能。

Method: 提出SAIL框架，利用互联网规模的预训练视频模型和自收集的行为数据，迭代更新域内视频模型。

Result: 在MetaWorld任务和真实机器人任务中，SAIL持续提升性能，且对初始数据质量和过滤方式表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAIL通过结合互联网规模数据和在线自学习，为机器人任务提供了一种高效的视频模型自改进方法。

Abstract: Video generative models trained on expert demonstrations have been utilized
as performant text-conditioned visual planners for solving robotic tasks.
However, generalization to unseen tasks remains a challenge. Whereas improved
generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from
additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video
datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can
continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this
work we thus propose the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an
in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories,
collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and
steadily improves its performance for a specified task of interest. We apply
SAIL to a diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks
on a real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge
over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original
in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is
surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is
filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through
adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online
experience, we thus demonstrate a way to iteratively bootstrap a
high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through
self-improvement.

Result: 在NAVSIM v1和v2中分别达到93.5% PDMS和87.1% EPDMS，展示了卓越的安全性和轨迹质量。

Conclusion: DriveSuprim在安全导航和轨迹质量方面表现优异，适用于多种驾驶场景。

Abstract: In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely.
Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually
does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory.
Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple
trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face
optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands
of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences,
especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to
overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a
coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based
augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and
a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS
in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical
capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while
maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.

Conclusion: RoboPARA为双臂任务并行规划提供了高效解决方案，适用于复杂任务组合。

Abstract: Dual-arm robots play a crucial role in improving efficiency and flexibility
in complex multitasking scenarios. While existing methods have achieved
promising results in task planning, they often fail to fully optimize task
parallelism, limiting the potential of dual-arm collaboration. To address this
issue, we propose RoboPARA, a novel large language model (LLM)-driven framework
for dual-arm task parallelism planning. RoboPARA employs a two-stage process:
(1) Dependency Graph-based Planning Candidates Generation, which constructs
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model task dependencies and eliminate
redundancy, and (2) Graph Re-Traversal-based Dual-Arm Parallel Planning, which
optimizes DAG traversal to maximize parallelism while maintaining task
coherence. In addition, we introduce the Cross-Scenario Dual-Arm Parallel Task
dataset (X-DAPT dataset), the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate
dual-arm task parallelism across diverse scenarios and difficulty levels.
Extensive experiments on the X-DAPT dataset demonstrate that RoboPARA
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher efficiency and
reliability, particularly in complex task combinations. The code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Result: 实验显示，特征检测和匹配性能提升47-197%，视觉估计更可靠。

Conclusion: NightHawk有效解决了地下环境中的机器人视觉挑战。

Abstract: Subterranean environments such as culverts present significant challenges to
robot vision due to dim lighting and lack of distinctive features. Although
onboard illumination can help, it introduces issues such as specular
reflections, overexposure, and increased power consumption. We propose
NightHawk, a framework that combines active illumination with exposure control
to optimize image quality in these settings. NightHawk formulates an online
Bayesian optimization problem to determine the best light intensity and
exposure-time for a given scene. We propose a novel feature detector-based
metric to quantify image utility and use it as the cost function for the
optimizer. We built NightHawk as an event-triggered recursive optimization
pipeline and deployed it on a legged robot navigating a culvert beneath the
Erie Canal. Results from field experiments demonstrate improvements in feature
detection and matching by 47-197% enabling more reliable visual estimation in
challenging lighting conditions.

Conclusion: 多模态空间语言地图显著提升了导航代理的多模态感知和空间目标定位能力，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage
pretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event
descriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment
mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional
modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal
spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained
multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these
maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our
maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to
audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When
combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural
language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the
sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across
different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.
Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a
unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues
through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.
This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or
audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the
incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal
disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps
enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by
50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and
tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual,
audio, and spatial cues.

TLDR: GTRS是一个端到端多模态规划的统一框架，结合粗粒度和细粒度轨迹评估，解决了静态和动态轨迹评分方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹评分方法在泛化能力上存在显著不足，静态词汇表难以适应细粒度调整，动态提案无法捕捉更广泛的轨迹分布。

Method: GTRS提出三个创新：扩散基轨迹生成器、词汇泛化技术和传感器增强策略。

Result: GTRS在Navsim v2挑战赛中表现优异，接近依赖真实感知的特权方法。

Conclusion: GTRS通过结合粗粒度和细粒度评估，显著提升了轨迹评分的泛化能力。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning is a promising paradigm in autonomous
driving, enabling decision-making with diverse trajectory candidates. A key
component is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal
trajectory from these candidates. While recent trajectory scorers focus on
scoring either large sets of static trajectories or small sets of dynamically
generated ones, both approaches face significant limitations in generalization.
Static vocabularies provide effective coarse discretization but struggle to
make fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals offer detailed precision
but fail to capture broader trajectory distributions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose GTRS (Generalized Trajectory Scoring), a unified
framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning that combines coarse and
fine-grained trajectory evaluation. GTRS consists of three complementary
innovations: (1) a diffusion-based trajectory generator that produces diverse
fine-grained proposals; (2) a vocabulary generalization technique that trains a
scorer on super-dense trajectory sets with dropout regularization, enabling its
robust inference on smaller subsets; and (3) a sensor augmentation strategy
that enhances out-of-domain generalization while incorporating refinement
training for critical trajectory discrimination. As the winning solution of the
Navsim v2 Challenge, GTRS demonstrates superior performance even with
sub-optimal sensor inputs, approaching privileged methods that rely on
ground-truth perception. Code will be available at

TLDR: RoboCerebra是一个用于评估机器人长期操作中高级推理能力的基准，结合了高层次VLM规划器和低层次VLA控制器，并提供了大规模模拟数据集。


<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注反应性策略，未充分利用VLM在语义推理和长期规划中的优势，因此需要新的基准来探索这些能力。

Method: 提出RoboCerebra基准，包括大规模模拟数据集、分层框架（VLM规划器+VLA控制器）和结构化评估协议。数据集通过GPT生成任务指令并由人类执行构建。

Result: 相比现有基准，RoboCerebra具有更长的动作序列和更密集的标注，并评估了先进VLM作为System 2模块的性能。

Conclusion: RoboCerebra推动了更强大和通用的机器人规划器的发展，填补了长期规划和语义推理研究的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled
instruction-conditioned robotic systems with improved generalization. However,
most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs'
strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2
capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under
explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current
benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for
evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation.
RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task
horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a
hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level
vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol
targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2
interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT
generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human
operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality
trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks,
RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser
annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and
analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the
development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.

Conclusion: SpikePingpong为高速动态任务中的机器人控制提供了新视角，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Learning to control high-speed objects in the real world remains a
challenging frontier in robotics. Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for
this problem, demanding both rapid interception of fast-moving balls and
precise adjustment of their trajectories. This task presents two fundamental
challenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately
predicting ball trajectories, and it necessitates intelligent strategic
planning to ensure precise ball placement to target regions. The dynamic nature
of table tennis, coupled with its real-time response requirements, makes it
particularly well-suited for advancing robotic control capabilities in
fast-paced, precision-critical domains. In this paper, we present
SpikePingpong, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation
learning for high-precision robotic table tennis. Our approach introduces two
key attempts that directly address the aforementioned challenges: SONIC, a
spike camera-based module that achieves millimeter-level precision in
ball-racket contact prediction by compensating for real-world uncertainties
such as air resistance and friction; and IMPACT, a strategic planning module
that enables accurate ball placement to targeted table regions. The system
harnesses a 20 kHz spike camera for high-temporal resolution ball tracking,
combined with efficient neural network models for real-time trajectory
correction and stroke planning. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikePingpong achieves a remarkable 91% success rate for 30 cm accuracy target
area and 71% in the more challenging 20 cm accuracy task, surpassing previous
state-of-the-art approaches by 38% and 37% respectively. These significant
performance improvements enable the robust implementation of sophisticated
tactical gameplay strategies, providing a new research perspective for robotic
control in high-speed dynamic tasks.

Result: 在模拟和实际实验中，CARoL表现出更快的收敛速度和更高的奖励，成功将仿真策略迁移到现实地形。

Conclusion: CARoL能高效学习新任务，并具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn new robotic tasks from scratch is
often inefficient. Leveraging prior knowledge has the potential to
significantly enhance learning efficiency, which, however, raises two critical
challenges: how to determine the relevancy of existing knowledge and how to
adaptively integrate them into learning a new task. In this paper, we propose
Context-aware Adaptation for Robot Learning (CARoL), a novel framework to
efficiently learn a similar but distinct new task from prior knowledge. CARoL
incorporates context awareness by analyzing state transitions in system
dynamics to identify similarities between the new task and prior knowledge. It
then utilizes these identified similarities to prioritize and adapt specific
knowledge pieces for the new task. Additionally, CARoL has a broad
applicability spanning policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic RL
algorithms. We validate the efficiency and generalizability of CARoL on both
simulated robotic platforms and physical ground vehicles. The simulations
include CarRacing and LunarLander environments, where CARoL demonstrates faster
convergence and higher rewards when learning policies for new tasks. In
real-world experiments, we show that CARoL enables a ground vehicle to quickly
and efficiently adapt policies learned in simulation to smoothly traverse
real-world off-road terrain.

Motivation: 传统G-TAMP方法依赖启发式或学习经验，计算成本高；人类则利用常识直觉解决问题，启发使用LLMs。

Method: 设计基于谓词的提示编码几何信息，利用LLM生成任务计划，结合MCTS搜索可行参数。

Result: 在六个G-TAMP问题上，该方法优于之前的LLM规划器和纯搜索算法。

Conclusion: LLMs结合MCTS能有效解决G-TAMP问题，减少计算成本。

Abstract: The problem of relocating a set of objects to designated areas amidst movable
obstacles can be framed as a Geometric Task and Motion Planning (G-TAMP)
problem, a subclass of task and motion planning (TAMP). Traditional approaches
to G-TAMP have relied either on domain-independent heuristics or on learning
from planning experience to guide the search, both of which typically demand
significant computational resources or data. In contrast, humans often use
common sense to intuitively decide which objects to manipulate in G-TAMP
problems. Inspired by this, we propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs),
which have common sense knowledge acquired from internet-scale data, to guide
task planning in G-TAMP problems. To enable LLMs to perform geometric
reasoning, we design a predicate-based prompt that encodes geometric
information derived from a motion planning algorithm. We then query the LLM to
generate a task plan, which is then used to search for a feasible set of
continuous parameters. Since LLMs are prone to mistakes, instead of committing
to LLM's outputs, we extend Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to a hybrid action
space and use the LLM to guide the search. Unlike the previous approach that
calls an LLM at every node and incurs high computational costs, we use it to
warm-start the MCTS with the nodes explored in completing the LLM's task plan.
On six different G-TAMP problems, we show our method outperforms previous LLM
planners and pure search algorithms. Code can be found at:

Conclusion: MapBERT通过创新的编码和推理方法，显著提升了室内语义分布的建模能力，适用于实际机器人任务。

Abstract: Spatial awareness is a critical capability for embodied agents, as it enables
them to anticipate and reason about unobserved regions. The primary challenge
arises from learning the distribution of indoor semantics, complicated by
sparse, imbalanced object categories and diverse spatial scales. Existing
methods struggle to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time and do not
generalize well to new environments. To this end, we propose \textbf{MapBERT},
a novel framework designed to effectively model the distribution of unseen
spaces. Motivated by the observation that the one-hot encoding of semantic maps
aligns naturally with the binary structure of bit encoding, we, for the first
time, leverage a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into compact
bitwise tokens. Building on this, a masked transformer is employed to infer
missing regions and generate complete semantic maps from limited observations.
To enhance object-centric reasoning, we propose an object-aware masking
strategy that masks entire object categories concurrently and pairs them with
learnable embeddings, capturing implicit relationships between object
embeddings and spatial tokens. By learning these relationships, the model more
effectively captures indoor semantic distributions crucial for practical
robotic tasks. Experiments on Gibson benchmarks show that MapBERT achieves
state-of-the-art semantic map generation, balancing computational efficiency
with accurate reconstruction of unobserved regions.

Conclusion: BitVLA在内存受限设备上具有高效部署潜力，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive capabilities across
a wide range of robotics manipulation tasks. However, their growing model size
poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic
systems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the
inference efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss,
its application to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present
BitVLA, the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every
parameter is ternary, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint
of the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that
compresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process,
a full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent
representations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA
achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with
4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only
29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on
memory-constrained edge devices. We release the code and model weights in

Result: 实验证明，该方法在模拟和现实场景中表现出优异的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HAPO方法为VLA模型提供了可靠的部署和从失败中学习的能力。

Abstract: Establishing a reliable and iteratively refined robotic system is essential
for deploying real-world applications. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic
deployment, their dependence on expert demonstrations hinders the crucial
capabilities of correction and learning from failures. To mitigate this
limitation, we introduce a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization method
named HAPO, designed to correct deployment failures and foster effective
adaptation through preference alignment for VLA models. This method begins with
a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and
interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. These
human-intervention trajectories are further employed within the action
preference optimization process, facilitating VLA models to mitigate failure
action occurrences while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Specifically,
we propose an adaptive reweighting algorithm to address the issues of
irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch when introducing
preference optimization into VLA models, facilitating model learning from
binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Through combining these
modules, our human-assisted action preference optimization method ensures
reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models. The
experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior
generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation
tasks.

Motivation: 现代AI系统在实时交互中面临高延迟问题，现有方法无法完全解决分块边界的不连贯动作。

Result: 在12个动态任务和6个真实世界双手机器人任务中，RTC显著提升了性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RTC是一种高效、鲁棒的方法，适用于高延迟环境下的精确任务。

Abstract: Modern AI systems, especially those interacting with the physical world,
increasingly require real-time performance. However, the high latency of
state-of-the-art generalist models, including recent vision-language action
models (VLAs), poses a significant challenge. While action chunking has enabled
temporal consistency in high-frequency control tasks, it does not fully address
the latency problem, leading to pauses or out-of-distribution jerky movements
at chunk boundaries. This paper presents a novel inference-time algorithm that
enables smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies. Our method,
real-time chunking (RTC), is applicable to any diffusion- or flow-based VLA out
of the box with no re-training. It generates the next action chunk while
executing the current one, "freezing" actions guaranteed to execute and
"inpainting" the rest. To test RTC, we introduce a new benchmark of 12 highly
dynamic tasks in the Kinetix simulator, as well as evaluate 6 challenging
real-world bimanual manipulation tasks. Results demonstrate that RTC is fast,
performant, and uniquely robust to inference delay, significantly improving
task throughput and enabling high success rates in precise tasks
$\unicode{x2013}$ such as lighting a match $\unicode{x2013}$ even in the
presence of significant latency. See

Abstract: Self-localization is an important technology for automating bulldozers.
Conventional bulldozer self-localization systems rely on RTK-GNSS (Real Time
Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite Systems). However, RTK-GNSS signals are
sometimes lost in certain mining conditions. Therefore, self-localization
methods that do not depend on RTK-GNSS are required. In this paper, we propose
a machine learning-based self-localization method for bulldozers. The proposed
method consists of two steps: estimating local velocities using a machine
learning model from internal sensors, and incorporating these estimates into an
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for global localization. We also created a novel
dataset for bulldozer odometry and conducted experiments across various driving
scenarios, including slalom, excavation, and driving on slopes. The result
demonstrated that the proposed self-localization method suppressed the
accumulation of position errors compared to kinematics-based methods,
especially when slip occurred. Furthermore, this study showed that
bulldozer-specific sensors, such as blade position sensors and hydraulic
pressure sensors, contributed to improving self-localization accuracy.

Abstract: Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building
vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to
effective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D
signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the
spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In
this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D
inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone,
and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and
output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a
scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability
to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments
show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and
effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across
three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate
from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better
performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average
success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing
baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments,
BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It
generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual
disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a
success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task,

Motivation: MEMS陀螺仪在测量范围和噪声性能之间存在固有矛盾，现有硬件和深度学习方法难以兼顾。

Method: MoE-Gyro采用两种专家模型（ORE和DE）和一个轻量级门控模块，分别处理过范围信号和噪声抑制。

Result: 实验表明，MoE-Gyro将测量范围从450 deg/s扩展到1500 deg/s，并将Bias Instability降低了98.4%。

Conclusion: MoE-Gyro有效解决了惯性传感中的长期矛盾，性能达到领先水平。

Abstract: MEMS gyroscopes play a critical role in inertial navigation and motion
control applications but typically suffer from a fundamental trade-off between
measurement range and noise performance. Existing hardware-based solutions
aimed at mitigating this issue introduce additional complexity, cost, and
scalability challenges. Deep-learning methods primarily focus on noise
reduction and typically require precisely aligned ground-truth signals, making
them difficult to deploy in practical scenarios and leaving the fundamental
trade-off unresolved. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of
Experts for MEMS Gyroscopes (MoE-Gyro), a novel self-supervised framework
specifically designed for simultaneous over-range signal reconstruction and
noise suppression. MoE-Gyro employs two experts: an Over-Range Reconstruction
Expert (ORE), featuring a Gaussian-Decay Attention mechanism for reconstructing
saturated segments; and a Denoise Expert (DE), utilizing dual-branch
complementary masking combined with FFT-guided augmentation for robust noise
reduction. A lightweight gating module dynamically routes input segments to the
appropriate expert. Furthermore, existing evaluation lack a comprehensive
standard for assessing multi-dimensional signal enhancement. To bridge this
gap, we introduce IMU Signal Enhancement Benchmark (ISEBench), an open-source
benchmarking platform comprising the GyroPeak-100 dataset and a unified
evaluation of IMU signal enhancement methods. We evaluate MoE-Gyro using our
proposed ISEBench, demonstrating that our framework significantly extends the
measurable range from 450 deg/s to 1500 deg/s, reduces Bias Instability by
98.4%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively addressing the
long-standing trade-off in inertial sensing.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements
that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance
beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties.
They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via
optimization techniques. In addition to performance and energy improvements, it
is also crucial to consider the concept of fair communications. RISs must
ensure that User Equipment (UE) units receive their signals with adequate
strength, without other UE being deprived of service due to insufficient power.
In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of
previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining an efficient
and fair duplex RIS-RL system for multiple legitimate UE units. We report and
discuss our experimental work and simulation results. We also release our code
and datasets to foster further research in the topic.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种优化的卷积神经网络方法，用于快速预测全球范围内的次声传播损失（TLs），解决了传统抛物线方程（PE）方法计算成本高的问题，并在不利风条件下提高了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 次声传播损失的精确建模对国际监测系统网络的性能评估至关重要，但现有方法如抛物线方程（PE）计算成本高，且神经网络方法在不利风条件下表现不佳。

Method: 开发了一种优化的卷积神经网络，基于全球模拟的温度和风场数据（传播范围达4000公里），通过关键优化提升架构性能。

Result: 模型在整个频段（0.1-3.2 Hz）内的平均预测误差为8.6 dB，能够处理真实大气场景。

Conclusion: 优化后的卷积神经网络显著降低了计算成本并提高了预测精度，适用于全球次声传播损失建模。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission losses (TLs) is essential to
assess the performance of the global International Monitoring System infrasound
network. Among existing propagation modeling tools, parabolic equation (PE)
method enables TLs to be finely modeled, but its computational cost does not
allow exploration of a large parameter space for operational monitoring
applications. To reduce computation times, Brissaud et al. 2023 explored the
potential of convolutional neural networks trained on a large set of regionally
simulated wavefields (< 1000 km from the source) to predict TLs with negligible
computation times compared to PE simulations. However, this method struggles in
unfavorable initial wind conditions, especially at high frequencies, and causal
issues with winds at large distances from the source affecting ground TLs close
to the source. In this study, we have developed an optimized convolutional
network designed to minimize prediction errors while predicting TLs from
globally simulated combined temperature and wind fields spanning over
propagation ranges of 4000 km. Our approach enhances the previously proposed
one by implementing key optimizations that improve the overall architecture
performance. The implemented model predicts TLs with an average error of 8.6 dB
in the whole frequency band (0.1-3.2 Hz) and explored realistic atmospheric
scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission loss is essential for evaluating
the performance of the International Monitoring System, enabling the effective
design and maintenance of infrasound stations to support compliance of the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. State-of-the-art propagation modeling
tools enable transmission loss to be finely simulated using atmospheric models.
However, the computational cost prohibits the exploration of a large parameter
space in operational monitoring applications. To address this, recent studies
made use of a deep learning algorithm capable of making transmission loss
predictions almost instantaneously. However, the use of nudged atmospheric
models leads to an incomplete representation of the medium, and the absence of
temperature as an input makes the algorithm incompatible with long range
propagation. In this study, we address these limitations by using both wind and
temperature fields as inputs to a neural network, simulated up to 130 km
altitude and 4,000 km distance. We also optimize several aspects of the neural
network architecture. We exploit convolutional and recurrent layers to capture
spatially and range-dependent features embedded in realistic atmospheric
models, improving the overall performance. The neural network reaches an
average error of 4 dB compared to full parabolic equation simulations and
provides epistemic and data-related uncertainty estimates. Its evaluation on
the 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption demonstrates its
prediction capability using atmospheric conditions and frequencies not included
in the training. This represents a significant step towards near real-time
assessment of International Monitoring System detection thresholds of explosive
sources.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large antenna arrays at base stations has
significantly improved the spatial resolution and localization accuracy of
radio-localization methods. However, traditional signal processing techniques
struggle in complex radio environments, particularly in scenarios dominated by
non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting in degraded localization
accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have facilitated the
development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques, enhancing
localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these methods
often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training and
inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based
localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and
improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to
learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural
channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison
dictionary while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method
outperforms fingerprinting baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization
accuracy, even in NLoS environments. Remarkably, it offers an improvement by
several orders of magnitude in localization accuracy, while simultaneously
reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared to classical
fingerprinting methods.

Abstract: Agitation is one of the most common responsive behaviors in people living
with dementia, particularly among those residing in community settings without
continuous clinical supervision. Timely prediction of agitation can enable
early intervention, reduce caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life
for both patients and caregivers. This study aimed to develop and benchmark
machine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in
community-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A
new set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was
introduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine
learning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem
formulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular
sensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly
detection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the
Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly
available dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia,
comprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most
effective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the
current 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp.
Incorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation
history, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720
and AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work
presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques
for agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using
privacy-preserving sensor data. The approach enables accurate, explainable, and
efficient agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care and aging in
place.

Conclusion: 手工特征能更好捕捉ECG信号的时空变化，未来可结合多导联信号和时序依赖提升分类效果。

Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals
through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing
hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats.
The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering,
and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis.
In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean,
variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers,
including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and
LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images
using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and
Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN
architectures like VGG and Inception.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest
performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the
image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost
yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this
task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to
capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to
image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may
benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies
across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.

Abstract: Olive production is an important tree crop in Mediterranean climates.
However, olive yield varies significantly due to climate change. Accurately
estimating yield using remote sensing and machine learning remains a complex
challenge. In this study, we developed a streamlined pipeline for olive yield
estimation in the Kairouan and Sousse governorates of Tunisia. We extracted
features from multispectral reflectance bands, vegetation indices derived from
Landsat-8 OLI and Landsat-9 OLI-2 satellite imagery, along with digital
elevation model data. These spatial features were combined with ground-based
field survey data to form a structured tabular dataset. We then developed an
automated ensemble learning framework, implemented using AutoGluon to train and
evaluate multiple machine learning models, select optimal combinations through
stacking, and generate robust yield predictions using five-fold
cross-validation. The results demonstrate strong predictive performance from
both sensors, with Landsat-8 OLI achieving R2 = 0.8635 and RMSE = 1.17 tons per
ha, and Landsat-9 OLI-2 achieving R2 = 0.8378 and RMSE = 1.32 tons per ha. This
study highlights a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate method for olive

Conclusion: PMQ方法有效提升了ECG预训练模型的性能，尤其在数据稀缺场景下表现优异。

Abstract: In the field of automatic Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, due to the
relatively limited amount of labeled data, how to build a robust ECG pretrained
model based on unlabeled data is a key area of focus for researchers. Recent
advancements in contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained models highlight the
potential of exploiting the additional patient-level self-supervisory signals
inherent in ECG. They are referred to as patient contrastive learning. Its
rationale is that multiple physical recordings from the same patient may share
commonalities, termed patient consistency, so redefining positive and negative
pairs in contrastive learning as intrapatient and inter-patient samples
provides more shared context to learn an effective representation. However,
these methods still fail to efficiently exploit patient consistency due to the
insufficient amount of intra-inter patient samples existing in a batch. Hence,
we propose a contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained model enhanced by the
Patient Memory Queue (PMQ), which incorporates a large patient memory queue to
mitigate model degeneration that can arise from insufficient intra-inter
patient samples. In order to further enhance the performance of the pretrained
model, we introduce two extra data augmentation methods to provide more
perspectives of positive and negative pairs for pretraining. Extensive
experiments were conducted on three public datasets with three different data
ratios. The experimental results show that the comprehensive performance of our
method outperforms previous contrastive learning methods and exhibits greater
robustness in scenarios with limited labeled data. The code is available at

Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)
technique for subsurface exploration, particularly in infrastructure inspection
and maintenance. However, conventional interpretation methods are often limited
by noise sensitivity and a lack of structural awareness. This study presents a
novel framework that enhances the detection of underground utilities,
especially pipelines, by integrating shape-aware topological features derived
from B-scan GPR images using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with the spatial
detection capabilities of the YOLOv5 deep neural network (DNN). We propose a
novel shape-aware topological representation that amplifies structural features
in the input data, thereby improving the model's responsiveness to the
geometrical features of buried objects. To address the scarcity of annotated
real-world data, we employ a Sim2Real strategy that generates diverse and
realistic synthetic datasets, effectively bridging the gap between simulated
and real-world domains. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the robustness and
efficacy of our approach. This approach underscores the potential of
TDA-enhanced learning in achieving reliable, real-time subsurface object
detection, with broad applications in urban planning, safety inspection, and
infrastructure management.

Result: 在合成信号实验中，PPO代理表现出泛化能力，实时性能优于传统滤波器。

Conclusion: 验证了策略梯度强化学习在鲁棒、低延迟自适应信号滤波中的可行性。

Abstract: Model-free and reinforcement learning-based adaptive filtering methods are
gaining traction for denoising in dynamic, non-stationary environments such as
wireless signal channels. Traditional filters like LMS, RLS, Wiener, and Kalman
are limited by assumptions of stationary or requiring complex fine-tuning or
exact noise statistics or fixed models. This letter proposes an adaptive
filtering framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a
composite reward that balances SNR improvement, MSE reduction, and residual
smoothness. Experiments on synthetic signals with various noise types show that
our PPO agent generalizes beyond its training distribution, achieving real-time
performance and outperforming classical filters. This work demonstrates the
viability of policy-gradient reinforcement learning for robust, low-latency
adaptive signal filtering.

Abstract: We propose a deep neural architecture that performs uncertainty-aware
multi-view classification of arrhythmia from ECG. Our method learns two
different views (1D and 2D) of single-lead ECG to capture different types of
information. We use a fusion technique to reduce the conflict between the
different views caused by noise and artifacts in ECG data, thus incorporating
uncertainty to obtain stronger final predictions. Our framework contains the
following three modules (1) a time-series module to learn the morphological
features from ECG; (2) an image-space learning module to learn the
spatiotemporal features; and (3) the uncertainty-aware fusion module to fuse
the information from the two different views. Experimental results on two
real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework not only improves the
performance on arrhythmia classification compared to the state-of-the-art but
also shows better robustness to noise and artifacts present in ECG.

Abstract: Prioritizing methane for near-term climate action is crucial due to its
significant impact on global warming. Previous work used columnwise matched
filter products from the airborne AVIRIS-NG imaging spectrometer to detect
methane plume sources; convolutional neural networks (CNNs) discerned
anthropogenic methane plumes from false positive enhancements. However, as an
increasing number of remote sensing platforms are used for methane plume
detection, there is a growing need to address cross-platform alignment. In this
work, we describe model- and data-driven machine learning approaches that
leverage airborne observations to improve spaceborne methane plume detection,
reconciling the distributional shifts inherent with performing the same task
across platforms. We develop a spaceborne methane plume classifier using data
from the EMIT imaging spectroscopy mission. We refine classifiers trained on
airborne imagery from AVIRIS-NG campaigns using transfer learning,
outperforming the standalone spaceborne model. Finally, we use CycleGAN, an
unsupervised image-to-image translation technique, to align the data
distributions between airborne and spaceborne contexts. Translating spaceborne
EMIT data to the airborne AVIRIS-NG domain using CycleGAN and applying airborne
classifiers directly yields the best plume detection results. This methodology
is useful not only for data simulation, but also for direct data alignment.
Though demonstrated on the task of methane plume detection, our work more
broadly demonstrates a data-driven approach to align related products obtained
from distinct remote sensing instruments.

Abstract: Accurately detecting drowsiness is vital to driving safety. Among all
measures, physiological-signal-based drowsiness monitoring can be more
privacy-preserving than a camera-based approach. However, conflicts exist
regarding how physiological metrics are associated with different drowsiness
labels across datasets. Thus, we analyzed key features from electrocardiograms
(ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiratory (RESP) signals across four
datasets, where different drowsiness inducers (such as fatigue and low arousal)
and assessment methods (subjective vs. objective) were used. Binary logistic
regression models were built to identify the physiological metrics that are
associated with drowsiness. Findings indicate that distinct different
drowsiness inducers can lead to different physiological responses, and
objective assessments were more sensitive than subjective ones in detecting
drowsiness. Further, the increased heart rate stability, reduced respiratory
amplitude, and decreased tonic EDA are robustly associated with increased
drowsiness. The results enhance understanding of drowsiness detection and can
inform future generalizable monitoring designs.

Abstract: Decomposing Electrodermal Activity (EDA) into phasic (short-term,
stimulus-linked responses) and tonic (longer-term baseline) components is
essential for extracting meaningful emotional and physiological biomarkers.
This study presents a comparative analysis of knowledge-driven, statistical,
and deep learning-based methods for EDA signal decomposition, with a focus on
in-the-wild data collected from wearable devices. In particular, the authors
introduce the Feel Transformer, a novel Transformer-based model adapted from
the Autoformer architecture, designed to separate phasic and tonic components
without explicit supervision. The model leverages pooling and trend-removal
mechanisms to enforce physiologically meaningful decompositions. Comparative
experiments against methods such as Ledalab, cvxEDA, and conventional
detrending show that the Feel Transformer achieves a balance between feature
fidelity (SCR frequency, amplitude, and tonic slope) and robustness to noisy,
real-world data. The model demonstrates potential for real-time biosignal
analysis and future applications in stress prediction, digital mental health
interventions, and physiological forecasting.

Motivation: 探索直接操作原始I/Q信号的基础模型在无线通信中的潜力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出IQFM模型，采用任务感知增强策略和对比自监督学习框架，预训练轻量级编码器。

Conclusion: IQFM展示了原始I/Q信号基础模型在6G系统中高效多任务学习的潜力。

Abstract: Foundational models have shown remarkable potential in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet remain in their infancy in wireless
communications. While a few efforts have explored image-based modalities such
as channel state information (CSI) and frequency spectrograms, foundational
models that operate directly on raw IQ data remain largely unexplored. This
paper presents, IQFM, the first I/Q signal foundational model for wireless
communications. IQFM supporting diverse tasks: modulation classification,
angle-of-arrival (AoA), beam prediction, and RF fingerprinting, without heavy
preprocessing or handcrafted features. We also introduce a task-aware
augmentation strategy that categorizes transformations into core augmentations,
such as cyclic time shifting, and task-specific augmentations. This strategy
forms the basis for structured, task-dependent representation learning within a
contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Using this strategy, the
lightweight encoder, pre-trained via SSL on over-the-air multi-antenna IQ data,
achieves up to 99.67% and 65.45% accuracy on modulation and AoA classification,
respectively, using only one labeled sample per class, outperforming supervised
baselines by up to 7x and 145x. The model also generalizes to
out-of-distribution tasks; when adapted to new tasks using only 500 samples per
class and minimal parameter updates via LoRA, the same frozen encoder achieves
94.15% on beam prediction (vs. 89.53% supervised), 50.00% on RML2016a
modulation classification (vs. 49.30%), and 96.05% on RF fingerprinting (vs.
96.64%). These results demonstrate the potential of raw IQ-based foundational
models as efficient, reusable encoders for multi-task learning in AI-native 6G
systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TLDR: 提出了一种基于条件去噪扩散模型（CDDM）和多模态变换器（MMT）的新框架，用于提升无蜂窝集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统中的信道估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无蜂窝ISAC系统在6G网络中具有潜力，但信道估计受限于导频污染和噪声干扰。

Method: 结合CDDM和MMT，利用感知信息优化信道估计。

Result: 相比LS和MMSE估计器，NMSE分别提升8 dB和9 dB；相比传统去噪扩散模型（TDDM），NMSE提升27.8%。

Conclusion: 该模型在导频污染和低信噪比条件下表现稳健，尤其适用于靠近感知目标的用户。

Abstract: Cell-free Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) aims to revolutionize
6th Generation (6G) networks. By combining distributed access points with ISAC
capabilities, it boosts spectral efficiency, situational awareness, and
communication reliability. Channel estimation is a critical step in cell-free
ISAC systems to ensure reliable communication, but its performance is usually
limited by challenges such as pilot contamination and noisy channel estimates.
This paper presents a novel framework leveraging sensing information as a key
input within a Conditional Denoising Diffusion Model (CDDM). In this framework,
we integrate CDDM with a Multimodal Transformer (MMT) to enhance channel
estimation in ISAC-enabled cell-free systems. The MMT encoder effectively
captures inter-modal relationships between sensing and location data, enabling
the CDDM to iteratively denoise and refine channel estimates. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains. As compared with Least Squares (LS) and Minimum Mean Squared Error
(MMSE) estimators, the proposed model achieves normalized mean squared error
(NMSE) improvements of 8 dB and 9 dB, respectively. Moreover, we achieve a
27.8% NMSE improvement compared to the traditional denoising diffusion model
(TDDM), which does not incorporate sensing channel information. Additionally,
the model exhibits higher robustness against pilot contamination and maintains
high accuracy under challenging conditions, such as low signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs). According to the simulation results, the model performs well for users
near sensing targets by leveraging the correlation between sensing and
communication channels.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型（DM）的RIS辅助系统信道估计方法，通过确定性采样策略和轻量级网络设计提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统扩散模型在信道估计中的随机性问题，并降低计算复杂度。

Method: 将信道估计问题转化为去噪过程，采用确定性采样策略和轻量级U-Net设计。

Result: 在多种SNR下性能优于基线，NMSE提升达13.5 dB，轻量级网络参数仅需原U-Net的6.59%。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和实用性上均表现出色，适用于RIS辅助系统。

Abstract: This letter proposes a channel estimation method for reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted systems through a novel diffusion model (DM)
framework. We reformulate the channel estimation problem as a denoising
process, which aligns with the reverse process of the DM. To overcome the
inherent randomness in the reverse process of conventional DM approaches, we
adopt a deterministic sampling strategy with a step alignment mechanism that
ensures the accuracy of channel estimation while adapting to different
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, to reduce the number of parameters of
the U-Net, we meticulously design a lightweight network that achieves
comparable performance, thereby enhancing the practicality of our proposed
method. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior performance over a wide
range of SNRs compared to baselines. For instance, the proposed method achieves
performance improvements of up to 13.5 dB in normalized mean square error
(NMSE) at SNR = 0 dB. Notably, the proposed lightweight network exhibits almost
no performance loss compared to the original U-Net, while requiring only 6.59\%
of its parameters.

Method: 分析了有限神经带宽如何促进简洁编码、混沌游走如何增强灵活性，以及储备计算如何快速泛化。同时强调了内在动机和社会环境的作用。

Result: 研究表明，约束（如能量限制、简洁架构）可以促进高效、可解释且更接近生物系统的AI。

Conclusion: 通过采用‘少即是多’原则（如资源约束、交互学习），可以开发出更高效、适应性更强的AI系统。

Abstract: Natural intelligence (NI) consistently achieves more with less. Infants learn
language, develop abstract concepts, and acquire sensorimotor skills from
sparse data, all within tight neural and energy limits. In contrast, today's AI
relies on virtually unlimited computational power, energy, and data to reach
high performance. This paper argues that constraints in NI are paradoxically
catalysts for efficiency, adaptability, and creativity. We first show how
limited neural bandwidth promotes concise codes that still capture complex
patterns. Spiking neurons, hierarchical structures, and symbolic-like
representations emerge naturally from bandwidth constraints, enabling robust
generalization. Next, we discuss chaotic itinerancy, illustrating how the brain
transits among transient attractors to flexibly retrieve memories and manage
uncertainty. We then highlight reservoir computing, where random projections
facilitate rapid generalization from small datasets. Drawing on developmental
perspectives, we emphasize how intrinsic motivation, along with responsive
social environments, drives infant language learning and discovery of meaning.
Such active, embodied processes are largely absent in current AI. Finally, we
suggest that adopting 'less is more' principles -- energy constraints,
parsimonious architectures, and real-world interaction -- can foster the
emergence of more efficient, interpretable, and biologically grounded
artificial systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: P2G技术虽能整合间歇性可再生能源，但其运营成本效益难以确定，且效率低于电池储能系统。现有研究多关注短期，忽略了P2G的长期存储潜力。

Method: 通过三个逐步复杂的案例研究，评估了深度Q网络和近端策略优化算法，并引入预测整合、奖励惩罚和战略成本计算等改进。

Result: 改进后的深度强化学习方法显著提升了P2G系统的成本效益运营能力，解决了延迟奖励问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为P2G技术的长期能源存储潜力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Power-to-Gas (P2G) technologies gain recognition for enabling the integration
of intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar, into electricity grids.
However, determining the most cost-effective operation of these systems is
complex due to the volatile nature of renewable energy, electricity prices, and
loads. Additionally, P2G systems are less efficient in converting and storing
energy compared to battery energy storage systems (BESs), and the benefits of
converting electricity into gas are not immediately apparent. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in managing the operation of
energy systems amidst these uncertainties. Yet, DRL techniques face
difficulties with the delayed reward characteristic of P2G system operation.
Previous research has mostly focused on short-term studies that look at the
energy conversion process, neglecting the long-term storage capabilities of
P2G.
  This study presents a new method by thoroughly examining how DRL can be
applied to the economic operation of P2G systems, in combination with BESs and
gas turbines, over extended periods. Through three progressively more complex
case studies, we assess the performance of DRL algorithms, specifically Deep
Q-Networks and Proximal Policy Optimization, and introduce modifications to
enhance their effectiveness. These modifications include integrating forecasts,
implementing penalties on the reward function, and applying strategic cost
calculations, all aimed at addressing the issue of delayed rewards. Our
findings indicate that while DRL initially struggles with the complex
decision-making required for P2G system operation, the adjustments we propose
significantly improve its capability to devise cost-effective operation
strategies, thereby unlocking the potential for long-term energy storage in P2G
technologies.

Conclusion: 该框架在理论和应用上均表现出色，为未来研究提供了新的方向，并通过摆的非线性动力学仿真验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothetical hybrid control framework for
port-Hamiltonian (p$\mathcal{H}$) systems, employing a dynamic decomposition
based on Data-Assisted Control (DAC). The system's evolution is split into two
parts with fixed topology: Right-Hand Side (RHS)- an intrinsic Hamiltonian flow
handling worst-case parametric uncertainties, and Left-Hand Side (LHS)- a
dissipative/input flow addressing both structural and parametric uncertainties.
A virtual port variable $\Pi$ serves as the interface between these two
components. A nonlinear controller manages the intrinsic Hamiltonian flow,
determining a desired port control value $\Pi_c$. Concurrently, Reinforcement
Learning (RL) is applied to the dissipative/input flow to learn an agent for
providing optimal policy in mapping $\Pi_c$ to the actual system input. This
hybrid approach effectively manages RHS uncertainties while preserving the
system's inherent structure. Key advantages include adjustable performance via
LHS controller parameters, enhanced AI explainability and interpretability
through the port variable $\Pi$, the ability to guarantee safety and state
attainability with hard/soft constraints, reduced complexity in learning
hypothesis classes compared to end-to-end solutions, and improved
state/parameter estimation using LHS prior knowledge and system Hamiltonian to
address partial observability. The paper details the p$\mathcal{H}$
formulation, derives the decomposition, and presents the modular controller
architecture. Beyond design, crucial aspects of stability and robustness
analysis and synthesis are investigated, paving the way for deeper theoretical
investigations. An application example, a pendulum with nonlinear dynamics, is
simulated to demonstrate the approach's empirical and phenomenological benefits
for future research.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in multi-agent systems is a significant challenge,
particularly in settings where centralized coordination is impractical. In this
work, we propose a novel risk-sensitive safety filter for discrete-time
multi-agent systems with uncertain dynamics that leverages control barrier
functions (CBFs) defined through value functions. Our approach relies on
centralized risk-sensitive safety conditions based on exponential risk
operators to ensure robustness against model uncertainties. We introduce a
distributed formulation of the safety filter by deriving two alternative
strategies: one based on worst-case anticipation and another on proximity to a
known safe policy. By allowing agents to switch between strategies, feasibility
can be ensured. Through detailed numerical evaluations, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in maintaining safety without being overly
conservative.

Conclusion: 该模型在个体和社区层面均能有效实现能源平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized model of energy cooperation between
microgrids, in which decisions are made locally, at the level of the microgrid
community. Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk
or Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and
its role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and
buying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual
in the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that
encodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids.
The population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators.
Recombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation
is applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The
evaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that
considers the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community
level, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the
degradation of microgrids batteries. The method was tested on a simulated
scenario with 100 microgrids, each with its own selling and buying thresholds,
to reflect a realistic environment with variable storage characteristics of
microgrids batteries. By applying the algorithm on this scenario, 95 out of the
100 microgrids reached a stable energy state. This result confirms the
effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving energy balance both at the
individual level, for each microgrid, and at the level of the entire community.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization poses a significant computational challenge due to its
nested structure, where each upper-level candidate solution requires solving a
corresponding lower-level problem. While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are
effective at navigating such complex landscapes, their high resource demands
remain a key bottleneck -- particularly the redundant evaluation of numerous
unpromising lower-level tasks. Despite recent advances in multitasking and
transfer learning, resource waste persists. To address this issue, we propose a
novel resource allocation framework for bilevel EAs that selectively identifies
and focuses on promising lower-level tasks. Central to our approach is a
contrastive ranking network that learns relational patterns between paired
upper- and lower-level solutions online. This knowledge guides a
reference-based ranking strategy that prioritizes tasks for optimization and
adaptively controls resampling based on estimated population quality.
Comprehensive experiments across five state-of-the-art bilevel algorithms show
that our framework significantly reduces computational cost while preserving --
or even enhancing -- solution accuracy. This work offers a generalizable
strategy to improve the efficiency of bilevel EAs, paving the way for more
scalable bilevel optimization.

critical criteria to be considered an appropriate brain model: (1) good
neuroscience task performance and (2) alignment with neural recordings. While
extensive research has assessed the first criterion, the second remains
underexamined. Employing methods such as Procrustes analysis on well-known
neuroscience datasets, this study demonstrates the existence of a biologically
plausible learning rule -- namely e-prop, which is based on gradient truncation
and has demonstrated versatility across a wide range of tasks -- that can
achieve neural data similarity comparable to Backpropagation Through Time
(BPTT) when matched for task accuracy. Our findings also reveal that model
architecture and initial conditions can play a more significant role in
determining neural similarity than the specific learning rule. Furthermore, we
observe that BPTT-trained models and their biologically plausible counterparts
exhibit similar dynamical properties at comparable accuracies. These results
underscore the substantial progress made in developing biologically plausible
learning rules, highlighting their potential to achieve both competitive task
performance and neural data similarity.

*Gabriel Nova,Sander van Cranenburgh,Stephane Hess*

Main category: econ.GN

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于深度强化学习的框架，用于动态优化离散选择模型的规格，解决了传统方法的静态性和主观性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散选择模型的规格优化依赖专家经验和主观假设，过程耗时且缺乏动态适应性。

Method: 采用深度强化学习框架，通过代理模型根据拟合优度和简洁性动态调整规格。

Result: 结果显示该方法能动态适应不同数据生成过程，具有鲁棒性和潜在的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 该框架为离散选择模型规格优化提供了自动化、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Discrete choice modelling is a theory-driven modelling framework for
understanding and forecasting choice behaviour. To obtain behavioural insights,
modellers test several competing model specifications in their attempts to
discover the 'true' data generation process. This trial-and-error process
requires expertise, is time-consuming, and relies on subjective theoretical
assumptions. Although metaheuristics have been proposed to assist choice
modellers, they treat model specification as a classic optimisation problem,
relying on static strategies, applying predefined rules, and neglecting
outcomes from previous estimated models. As a result, current metaheuristics
struggle to prioritise promising search regions, adapt exploration dynamically,
and transfer knowledge to other modelling tasks. To address these limitations,
we introduce a deep reinforcement learning-based framework where an 'agent'
specifies models by estimating them and receiving rewards based on
goodness-of-fit and parsimony. Results demonstrate the agent dynamically adapts
its strategies to identify promising specifications across data generation
processes, showing robustness and potential transferability, without prior
domain knowledge.

Main category: cs.SE

TLDR: 论文研究了私有GPT自动生成可执行测试代码的能力，通过需求（如验收标准）作为输入，比较了直接生成代码与通过Gherkin语法中间步骤生成的效果，发现后者在可读性和代码质量上更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索私有GPT如何利用需求（如验收标准）自动生成测试代码，为产品所有者或业务智能提供直接生成可测试标准的方法。

Method: 采用两种方法生成测试代码：1) 直接从需求生成代码；2) 通过Gherkin语法作为中间步骤。评估了两种方法在简单程序和复杂模型上的效果。

Result: 通过Gherkin语法的两步方法在代码可读性和最佳实践（如代码行数和测试库使用）上表现更好。结构化提示能生成更高质量的测试输出。

Conclusion: 使用中间步骤（如Gherkin语法）能显著提升GPT生成的测试代码质量，结构化提示是关键。

Abstract: In this contribution, we examine the capability of private GPTs to
automatically generate executable test code based on requirements. More
specifically, we use acceptance criteria as input, formulated as part of epics,
or stories, which are typically used in modern development processes. This
gives product owners, or business intelligence, respectively, a way to directly
produce testable criteria through the use of LLMs. We explore the quality of
the so-produced tests in two ways: i) directly by letting the LLM generate code
from requirements, ii) through an intermediate step using Gherkin syntax. As a
result, it turns out that the two-step procedure yields better results -where
we define better in terms of human readability and best coding practices, i.e.
lines of code and use of additional libraries typically used in testing.
Concretely, we evaluate prompt effectiveness across two scenarios: a simple
"Hello World" program and a digit classification model, showing that structured
prompts lead to higher-quality test outputs.

Result: 生成了一个统一的重构分类法，为AI辅助迁移和自动化重构技术提供了基础。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅支持量子软件工程的发展，还提升了开发流程、语言兼容性和最佳实践。

Abstract: As quantum computing advances, quantum programming libraries' heterogeneity
and steady evolution create new challenges for software developers. Frequent
updates in software libraries break working code that needs to be refactored,
thus adding complexity to an already complex landscape. These refactoring
challenges are, in many cases, fundamentally different from those known in
classical software engineering due to the nature of quantum computing software.
This study addresses these challenges by developing a taxonomy of quantum
circuit's refactoring problems, providing a structured framework to analyze and
compare different refactoring approaches. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
proven valuable tools for classic software development, yet their value in
quantum software engineering remains unexplored. This study uses LLMs to
categorize refactoring needs in migration scenarios between different Qiskit
versions. Qiskit documentation and release notes were scrutinized to create an
initial taxonomy of refactoring required for migrating between Qiskit releases.
Two taxonomies were produced: one by expert developers and one by an LLM. These
taxonomies were compared, analyzing differences and similarities, and were
integrated into a unified taxonomy that reflects the findings of both methods.
By systematically categorizing refactoring challenges in Qiskit, the unified
taxonomy is a foundation for future research on AI-assisted migration while
enabling a more rigorous evaluation of automated refactoring techniques.
Additionally, this work contributes to quantum software engineering (QSE) by
enhancing software development workflows, improving language compatibility, and
promoting best practices in quantum programming.

TLDR: IntenTest是一个API为中心的测试框架，用于发现LLM代理中的意图完整性违规，通过语义分区和突变生成现实任务，显著优于基线方法。


<details>

Motivation: LLM代理在通过自然语言指令调用API时容易误解用户意图，传统软件测试无法处理自然语言的模糊性。

Method: IntenTest基于工具包文档生成现实任务，通过语义分区和突变暴露代理错误，利用轻量级预测器排序任务，并使用数据类型感知策略记忆提高效率。

Result: 在80个工具包API上的实验显示，IntenTest显著优于基线方法，能有效发现意图完整性违规，且适应性强。

Conclusion: IntenTest为LLM代理的意图完整性测试提供了高效且通用的解决方案，适用于不断演化的API。

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to automate real-world tasks by invoking
APIs through natural language instructions. While powerful, they often suffer
from misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that
diverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve.
Traditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in
handling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce IntenTest, an
API-centric stress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent
integrity violations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed
benchmarks or adversarial inputs, IntenTest generates realistic tasks based on
toolkits' documentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent
errors while preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic
partitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories
based on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each
partition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that
estimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency,
IntenTest maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts
effective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs
demonstrate that IntenTest effectively uncovers intent integrity violations,
significantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query
efficiency. Moreover, IntenTest generalizes well to stronger target models
using smaller LLMs for test generation, and adapts to evolving APIs across
domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图CT可减少辐射剂量，但重建问题复杂，现有方法缺乏物理可解释性或计算成本高。

Method: 基于PFGM++，引入条件引导和残差融合模块，跳过冗余步骤并保持数据一致性。

Result: 在合成和临床数据集上，ResPF表现出更优的重建质量、更快推理和更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ResPF首次将Poisson Flow模型应用于稀疏视图CT，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is a practical solution to reduce
radiation dose, but the resulting ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Although deep learning and
diffusion-based methods have shown promising results, they often lack physical
interpretability or suffer from high computational costs due to iterative
sampling starting from random noise. Recent advances in generative modeling,
particularly Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM), enable high-fidelity image
synthesis by modeling the full data distribution. In this work, we propose
Residual Poisson Flow (ResPF) Generative Models for efficient and accurate
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Based on PFGM++, ResPF integrates conditional
guidance from sparse measurements and employs a hijacking strategy to
significantly reduce sampling cost by skipping redundant initial steps.
However, skipping early stages can degrade reconstruction quality and introduce
unrealistic structures. To address this, we embed a data-consistency into each
iteration, ensuring fidelity to sparse-view measurements. Yet, PFGM sampling
relies on a fixed ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory induced by
electrostatic fields, which can be disrupted by step-wise data consistency,
resulting in unstable or degraded reconstructions. Inspired by ResNet, we
introduce a residual fusion module to linearly combine generative outputs with
data-consistent reconstructions, effectively preserving trajectory continuity.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Poisson flow
models to sparse-view CT. Extensive experiments on synthetic and clinical
datasets demonstrate that ResPF achieves superior reconstruction quality,
faster inference, and stronger robustness compared to state-of-the-art
iterative, learning-based, and diffusion models.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架，将二进制SPC图像转换为高质量彩色新视图，解决了传统3D合成技术因信息丢失而无效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPC图像因二进制特性导致纹理和颜色信息严重丢失，传统3D合成技术难以处理。

Method: 采用模块化两阶段框架：第一阶段使用Pix2PixHD进行图像到图像转换，第二阶段使用NeRF或3DGS进行3D场景重建。

Result: 实验验证了框架在感知质量和几何一致性上的显著提升。

Conclusion: 该框架为SPC数据的3D重建和辐射场恢复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) represent a cutting-edge imaging
technology, capable of detecting individual photons with remarkable timing
precision. Building on this sensitivity, Single Photon Cameras (SPCs) enable
image capture at exceptionally high speeds under both low and high
illumination. Enabling 3D reconstruction and radiance field recovery from such
SPC data holds significant promise. However, the binary nature of SPC images
leads to severe information loss, particularly in texture and color, making
traditional 3D synthesis techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, we
propose a modular two-stage framework that converts binary SPC images into
high-quality colorized novel views. The first stage performs image-to-image
(I2I) translation using generative models such as Pix2PixHD, converting binary
SPC inputs into plausible RGB representations. The second stage employs 3D
scene reconstruction techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) to generate novel views. We validate our two-stage pipeline
(Pix2PixHD + Nerf/3DGS) through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality and
geometric consistency over the alternative baseline.

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images enables morphometric
analysis of nuclei structures, which in turn helps in the detection and
diagnosis of diseases under consideration. To develop a nuclei segmentation
algorithm, applicable to different types of target domain representations,
image-to-image translation networks can be considered as they are invariant to
target domain image representations. One of the important issues with
image-to-image translation models is that they fail miserably when the
information content between two image domains are asymmetric in nature. In this
regard, the paper introduces a new deep generative model for segmenting nuclei
structures from histological images. The proposed model considers an embedding
space for handling information-disparity between information-rich histological
image space and information-poor segmentation map domain. Integrating
judiciously the concepts of optimal transport and measure theory, the model
develops an invertible generator, which provides an efficient optimization
framework with lower network complexity. The concept of invertible generator
automatically eliminates the need of any explicit cycle-consistency loss. The
proposed model also introduces a spatially-constrained squeeze operation within
the framework of invertible generator to maintain spatial continuity within the
image patches. The model provides a better trade-off between network complexity
and model performance compared to other existing models having complex network
architectures. The performance of the proposed deep generative model, along
with a comparison with state-of-the-art nuclei segmentation methods, is
demonstrated on publicly available histological image data sets.

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images is an important task
for automated computer-aided analysis of histological images, particularly in
the presence of impermissible color variation in the color appearance of
stained tissue images. While color normalization enables better nuclei
segmentation, accurate segmentation of nuclei structures makes color
normalization rather trivial. In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep
generative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and
normalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model
judiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial
attention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information,
corresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective
nuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled
representation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification
or loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei
segmentation map as well as embedding information. Also, for dealing with the
stain overlap of associated histochemical reagents, the prior for latent color
appearance code is assumed to be a mixture of truncated normal distributions.
The proposed model incorporates the concept of spatial attention for
segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images. The performance of the
proposed approach, along with a comparative analysis with related
state-of-the-art algorithms, has been demonstrated on publicly available
standard histological image data sets.

Abstract: Brain tumors, regardless of being benign or malignant, pose considerable
health risks, with malignant tumors being more perilous due to their swift and
uncontrolled proliferation, resulting in malignancy. Timely identification is
crucial for enhancing patient outcomes, particularly in nations such as
Bangladesh, where healthcare infrastructure is constrained. Manual MRI analysis
is arduous and susceptible to inaccuracies, rendering it inefficient for prompt
diagnosis. This research sought to tackle these problems by creating an
automated brain tumor classification system utilizing MRI data obtained from
many hospitals in Bangladesh. Advanced deep learning models, including VGG16,
VGG19, and ResNet50, were utilized to classify glioma, meningioma, and various
brain cancers. Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies, such as Grad-CAM and
Grad-CAM++, were employed to improve model interpretability by emphasizing the
critical areas in MRI scans that influenced the categorization. VGG16 achieved
the most accuracy, attaining 99.17%. The integration of XAI enhanced the
system's transparency and stability, rendering it more appropriate for clinical
application in resource-limited environments such as Bangladesh. This study
highlights the capability of deep learning models, in conjunction with
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), to enhance brain tumor detection and
identification in areas with restricted access to advanced medical
technologies.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical medicine, serving
as a tool for auxiliary diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring,
thus facilitating physicians in the study and treatment of diseases. However,
existing medical image segmentation methods are limited by the weak semantic
expression of the target segmentation regions, which is caused by the low
contrast between the target and non-target segmentation regions. To address
this limitation, text prompt information has greast potential to capture the
lesion location. However, existing text-guided methods suffer from insufficient
cross-modal interaction and inadequate cross-modal feature expression. To
resolve these issues, we propose the Text-guided Multi-stage Cross-perception
network (TMC). In TMC, we introduce a multistage cross-attention module to
enhance the model's understanding of semantic details and a multi-stage
alignment loss to improve the consistency of cross-modal semantics. The results
of the experiments demonstrate that our TMC achieves a superior performance
with Dice of 84.77%, 78.50%, 88.73% in three public datasets (QaTa-COV19,
MosMedData and Breast), outperforming UNet based networks and text-guided
methods.

Motivation: 现有神经B帧编码器直接采用P帧工具，未能解决B帧压缩的独特挑战，导致性能不佳。

Method: 设计了细粒度运动压缩方法（交互式双分支运动自动编码器）和选择性时间融合方法（预测双向融合权重）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有神经B帧编码器，性能接近或超过H.266/VVC参考软件。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了B帧压缩的挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: With the remarkable progress in neural P-frame video coding, neural B-frame
coding has recently emerged as a critical research direction. However, most
existing neural B-frame codecs directly adopt P-frame coding tools without
adequately addressing the unique challenges of B-frame compression, leading to
suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for
motion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we
design a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an
interactive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive
quantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional
motion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and
reconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an
interactive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between
bi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging
partitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a
selective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to
achieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal
contexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a
hyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling.
By treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent
representation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the
fused bi-directional temporal priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our proposed codec outperforms state-of-the-art neural B-frame codecs and
achieves comparable or even superior compression performance to the H.266/VVC
reference software under random-access configurations.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为音频感知解码（AAD）的方法，通过对比解码减少大型音频-语言模型（LALMs）的幻觉问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的LALMs在标准基准测试中表现良好，但存在幻觉问题（即模型生成与音频内容不符的信息）。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了AAD方法。

Method: AAD是一种轻量级的推理时策略，通过对比解码比较音频上下文存在与否时的token预测概率，优先选择音频存在时概率增加的token。

Result: 实验表明，AAD在对象幻觉数据集上将F1分数提升了0.046至0.428，在通用音频QA数据集（如Clotho-AQA）上准确率提升了5.4%至10.3%。

Conclusion: AAD有效减少了LALMs的幻觉问题，并通过消融研究验证了其各组件的有效性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) can take audio and text as the inputs and
answer questions about the audio. While prior LALMs have shown strong
performance on standard benchmarks, there has been alarming evidence that LALMs
can hallucinate what is presented in the audio. To mitigate the hallucination
of LALMs, we introduce Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD), a lightweight inference-time
strategy that uses contrastive decoding to compare the token prediction logits
with and without the audio context. By contrastive decoding, AAD promotes the
tokens whose probability increases when the audio is present. We conduct our
experiment on object hallucination datasets with three LALMs and show that AAD
improves the F1 score by 0.046 to 0.428. We also show that AAD can improve the
accuracy on general audio QA datasets like Clotho-AQA by 5.4% to 10.3%. We
conduct thorough ablation studies to understand the effectiveness of each
component in AAD.

Motivation: SOT方法因说话人分配错误导致识别准确率下降，而依赖辅助信息（如时间戳）的提取在实际对话中具有挑战性。

Method: 提出SD-CTC，扩展CTC以联合分配帧的标记和说话人标签，并将其整合到SOT框架中，仅使用重叠语音和转录学习说话人区分。

Result: 实验表明，SD-CTC与SOT的多任务学习将SOT模型的错误率降低26%，性能接近依赖辅助信息的先进方法。

Conclusion: SD-CTC有效解决了SOT的说话人分配问题，无需辅助信息即可实现高性能的多说话人语音识别。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for multi-talker automatic speech
recognition without the need for auxiliary information. Serialized Output
Training (SOT), a widely used approach, suffers from recognition errors due to
speaker assignment failures. Although incorporating auxiliary information, such
as token-level timestamps, can improve recognition accuracy, extracting such
information from natural conversational speech remains challenging. To address
this limitation, we propose Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC), an extension
of CTC that jointly assigns a token and its corresponding speaker label to each
frame. We further integrate SD-CTC into the SOT framework, enabling the SOT
model to learn speaker distinction using only overlapping speech and
transcriptions. Experimental comparisons show that multi-task learning with
SD-CTC and SOT reduces the error rate of the SOT model by 26% and achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods relying on auxiliary
information.

Result: 该方法旨在克服传统SBR和盲DNN方法的不足，提升带宽扩展性能。

Conclusion: 结合DNN的参数化非盲带宽扩展方法有望成为传统SBR的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Audio bandwidth extension is the task of reconstructing missing high
frequency components of bandwidth-limited audio signals, where bandwidth
limitation is a common issue for audio signals due to several reasons,
including channel capacity and data constraints. While conventional spectral
band replication is a well-established parametric approach to audio bandwidth
extension, the SBR usually entails coarse feature extraction and reconstruction
techniques, which leads to limitations when processing various types of audio
signals. In parallel, numerous deep neural network-based audio bandwidth
extension methods have been proposed. These DNN-based methods are usually
referred to as blind BWE, as these methods do not rely on prior information
extracted from original signals, and only utilize given low frequency band
signals to estimate missing high frequency components. In order to replace
conventional SBR with DNNs, simply adopting existing DNN-based methodologies
results in suboptimal performance due to the blindness of these methods. My
proposed research suggests a new approach to parametric non-blind bandwidth
extension, as DNN-based side information extraction and DNN-based bandwidth
extension are performed only at the front and end of the audio coding pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调方法在生成特定主题图像时存在欠拟合和过拟合问题，导致主题识别不可靠或背景多样性降低。

Method: 引入两种辅助一致性损失：先验一致性正则化损失和主题一致性正则化损失，分别提升模型保真度和主题识别能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CLIP分数、背景多样性和视觉质量上优于DreamBooth。

Conclusion: 提出的损失函数有效平衡了主题识别和图像多样性，提升了微调效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by
adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However,
existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where
the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it
memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion
fine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the
predicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent
with that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject
consistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to
multiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject
identity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity
but also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP
scores, background variation, and overall visual quality.

Abstract: Faithfully reconstructing textured shapes and physical properties from videos
presents an intriguing yet challenging problem. Significant efforts have been
dedicated to advancing such a system identification problem in this area.
Previous methods often rely on heavy optimization pipelines with a
differentiable simulator and renderer to estimate physical parameters. However,
these approaches frequently necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning for
each scene and involve a costly optimization process, which limits both their
practicality and generalizability. In this work, we propose a novel framework,
Vid2Sim, a generalizable video-based approach for recovering geometry and
physical properties through a mesh-free reduced simulation based on Linear
Blend Skinning (LBS), offering high computational efficiency and versatile
representation capability. Specifically, Vid2Sim first reconstructs the
observed configuration of the physical system from video using a feed-forward
neural network trained to capture physical world knowledge. A lightweight
optimization pipeline then refines the estimated appearance, geometry, and
physical properties to closely align with video observations within just a few
minutes. Additionally, after the reconstruction, Vid2Sim enables high-quality,
mesh-free simulation with high efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in reconstructing
geometry and physical properties from video data.

Method: 提出一种方法，对3DGS重建中的重复实例进行分割、对齐，并允许实例间信息共享，同时考虑外观变化。

Result: 在合成和真实场景中验证，新视角合成质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 利用重复元素能有效改善场景重建质量。

Abstract: We leverage repetitive elements in 3D scenes to improve novel view synthesis.
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly
improved novel view synthesis but renderings of unseen and occluded parts
remain low-quality if the training views are not exhaustive enough. Our key
observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We
propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of
low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose
a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction,
registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances.
Our method improves the geometry while also accounting for appearance
variations across instances. We demonstrate our method on a variety of
synthetic and real scenes with typical repetitive elements, leading to a
substantial improvement in the quality of novel view synthesis.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for
high-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields
such as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive
algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices
remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper
presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.
First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of
common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve
this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses
shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,
effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by
identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,
we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent
blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for
costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to
improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization
and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing
array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we
introduce a $\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and
Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves
rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\sim27.8\times$ and energy
savings of $28.8\sim51.4\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes. We
plan to open-source our design to foster further development in this field.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成复杂交互序列，显著提升真实性和文本对齐。

Conclusion: HOI-PAGE在零样本4D HOI生成中表现出更高的灵活性和效果。

Abstract: We present HOI-PAGE, a new approach to synthesizing 4D human-object
interactions (HOIs) from text prompts in a zero-shot fashion, driven by
part-level affordance reasoning. In contrast to prior works that focus on
global, whole body-object motion for 4D HOI synthesis, we observe that
generating realistic and diverse HOIs requires a finer-grained understanding --
at the level of how human body parts engage with object parts. We thus
introduce Part Affordance Graphs (PAGs), a structured HOI representation
distilled from large language models (LLMs) that encodes fine-grained part
information along with contact relations. We then use these PAGs to guide a
three-stage synthesis: first, decomposing input 3D objects into geometric
parts; then, generating reference HOI videos from text prompts, from which we
extract part-based motion constraints; finally, optimizing for 4D HOI motion
sequences that not only mimic the reference dynamics but also satisfy
part-level contact constraints. Extensive experiments show that our approach is
flexible and capable of generating complex multi-object or multi-person
interaction sequences, with significantly improved realism and text alignment
for zero-shot 4D HOI generation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved remarkable success in reconstructing both
static and dynamic 3D scenes. However, in a scene represented by 3D Gaussian
primitives, interactions between objects suffer from inaccurate 3D
segmentation, imprecise deformation among different materials, and severe
rendering artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PIG:
Physically-Based Multi-Material Interaction with 3D Gaussians, a novel approach
that combines 3D object segmentation with the simulation of interacting objects
in high precision. Firstly, our method facilitates fast and accurate mapping
from 2D pixels to 3D Gaussians, enabling precise 3D object-level segmentation.
Secondly, we assign unique physical properties to correspondingly segmented
objects within the scene for multi-material coupled interactions. Finally, we
have successfully embedded constraint scales into deformation gradients,
specifically clamping the scaling and rotation properties of the Gaussian
primitives to eliminate artifacts and achieve geometric fidelity and visual
consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of visual quality, but also
opens up new directions and pipelines for the field of physically realistic
scene generation.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing the resolution and geometric
fidelity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) beyond native training resolution.
Current 3DGS methods are fundamentally limited by their input resolution,
producing reconstructions that cannot extrapolate finer details than are
present in the training views. Our work breaks this limitation through a
lightweight generative model that predicts and refines additional 3D Gaussians
where needed most. The key innovation is our Hessian-assisted sampling
strategy, which intelligently identifies regions that are likely to benefit
from densification, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike computationally
intensive GANs or diffusion approaches, our method operates in real-time
(0.015s per inference on a single consumer-grade GPU), making it practical for
interactive applications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for resolution-free 3D
scene enhancement.

Abstract: Recent extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to dynamic scenes achieve
high-quality novel view synthesis by using neural networks to predict the
time-varying deformation of each Gaussian. However, performing per-Gaussian
neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting
rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper,
we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general
pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS
representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary
techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that
identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene
reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that
improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses.
Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters
Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation
per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our
techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\times$, reduce model size by
$7.71\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset.
SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\times$ and $58.23\times$ on
the D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets. Our methods are modular and can be
integrated into any deformable 3DGS or 4DGS framework.

Motivation: 现有3D数据压缩方法难以实现高压缩比且保持视觉质量，Squeeze3D旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过可训练映射网络连接预训练编码器和生成模型的潜在空间，将3D数据压缩为紧凑潜在代码，再通过生成模型解压缩。

Conclusion: Squeeze3D无需训练对象特定网络即可实现高效压缩和解压缩，支持多种3D数据格式。

Abstract: We propose Squeeze3D, a novel framework that leverages implicit prior
knowledge learnt by existing pre-trained 3D generative models to compress 3D
data at extremely high compression ratios. Our approach bridges the latent
spaces between a pre-trained encoder and a pre-trained generation model through
trainable mapping networks. Any 3D model represented as a mesh, point cloud, or
a radiance field is first encoded by the pre-trained encoder and then
transformed (i.e. compressed) into a highly compact latent code. This latent
code can effectively be used as an extremely compressed representation of the
mesh or point cloud. A mapping network transforms the compressed latent code
into the latent space of a powerful generative model, which is then conditioned
to recreate the original 3D model (i.e. decompression). Squeeze3D is trained
entirely on generated synthetic data and does not require any 3D datasets. The
Squeeze3D architecture can be flexibly used with existing pre-trained 3D
encoders and existing generative models. It can flexibly support different
formats, including meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields. Our experiments
demonstrate that Squeeze3D achieves compression ratios of up to 2187x for
textured meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields while
maintaining visual quality comparable to many existing methods. Squeeze3D only
incurs a small compression and decompression latency since it does not involve
training object-specific networks to compress an object.

Abstract: Time-series data is a vital modality within data science communities. This is
particularly valuable in financial applications, where it helps in detecting
patterns, understanding market behavior, and making informed decisions based on
historical data. Recent advances in language modeling have led to the rise of
time-series pre-trained models that are trained on vast collections of datasets
and applied to diverse tasks across financial domains. However, across
financial applications, existing time-series pre-trained models have not shown
boosts in performance over simple finance benchmarks in both zero-shot and
fine-tuning settings. This phenomenon occurs because of a i) lack of financial
data within the pre-training stage, and ii) the negative transfer effect due to
inherently different time-series patterns across domains. Furthermore,
time-series data is continuous, noisy, and can be collected at varying
frequencies and with varying lags across different variables, making this data
more challenging to model than languages. To address the above problems, we
introduce a Pre-trained MoDEL for FINance TimE-series (Delphyne). Delphyne
achieves competitive performance to existing foundation and full-shot models
with few fine-tuning steps on publicly available datasets, and also shows
superior performances on various financial tasks.

on the daily stock prices of the five highest-volume banks listed in the
BIST100 index, along with XBANK and XU100 indices, covering the period from
January 2015 to March 2025. Models including DLinear, LTSNet, Vanilla

enriched by technical indicators. SHAP and LIME techniques are used to provide
transparency into the influence of individual features on model outputs. The
results demonstrate the strong predictive capabilities of transformer models
and highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning to empower
individuals in making informed investment decisions and actively engaging in
financial markets.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hype Index as a novel metric to quantify media
attention toward large-cap equities, leveraging advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) for extracting predictive signals from financial news. Using
the S&P 100 as the focus universe, we first construct a News Count-Based Hype
Index, which measures relative media exposure by computing the share of news
articles referencing each stock or sector. We then extend it to the
Capitalization Adjusted Hype Index, adjusts for economic size by taking the
ratio of a stock's or sector's media weight to its market capitalization weight
within its industry or sector. We compute both versions of the Hype Index at
the stock and sector levels, and evaluate them through multiple lenses: (1)
their classification into different hype groups, (2) their associations with
returns, volatility, and VIX index at various lags, (3) their signaling power
for short-term market movements, and (4) their empirical properties including
correlations, samplings, and trends. Our findings suggest that the Hype Index
family provides a valuable set of tools for stock volatility analysis, market
signaling, and NLP extensions in Finance.

Motivation: 现有金融基准主要评估LLMs回答金融问题的能力，但未反映其在生成财务分析报告等实际任务中的表现，可能导致不准确的分析和严重后果。

Method: 提出FinAR-Bench数据集，将财务报表分析任务分解为三个步骤（信息提取、指标计算、逻辑推理），以结构化方式评估LLMs的表现。

Result: 研究明确了LLMs在基本面分析中的当前优势和局限性，并提供了更实用的基准方法。

Conclusion: FinAR-Bench为LLMs在金融领域的实际应用提供了更可靠的评估标准，有助于减少风险并提升信任。

Abstract: Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), is beginning to
transform the financial industry by automating tasks and helping to make sense
of complex financial information. One especially promising use case is the
automatic creation of fundamental analysis reports, which are essential for
making informed investment decisions, evaluating credit risks, guiding
corporate mergers, etc. While LLMs attempt to generate these reports from a
single prompt, the risks of inaccuracy are significant. Poor analysis can lead
to misguided investments, regulatory issues, and loss of trust. Existing
financial benchmarks mainly evaluate how well LLMs answer financial questions
but do not reflect performance in real-world tasks like generating financial
analysis reports. In this paper, we propose FinAR-Bench, a solid benchmark
dataset focusing on financial statement analysis, a core competence of
fundamental analysis. To make the evaluation more precise and reliable, we
break this task into three measurable steps: extracting key information,
calculating financial indicators, and applying logical reasoning. This
structured approach allows us to objectively assess how well LLMs perform each
step of the process. Our findings offer a clear understanding of LLMs current
strengths and limitations in fundamental analysis and provide a more practical
way to benchmark their performance in real-world financial settings.

Abstract: This paper explains \textbf{why it is impossible to create large language
models that do not hallucinate and what are the trade-offs we should be looking
for}. It presents a formal \textbf{impossibility theorem} demonstrating that no
inference mechanism can simultaneously satisfy four fundamental properties:
\textbf{truthful (non-hallucinatory) generation, semantic information
conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained
optimality}. By modeling LLM inference as an \textbf{auction of ideas} where
neural components compete to contribute to responses, we prove the
impossibility using the Green-Laffont theorem. That mathematical framework
provides a rigorous foundation for understanding the nature of inference
process, with implications for model architecture, training objectives, and
evaluation methods.

Abstract: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models have become the
cornerstone for sequential data modeling in numerous applications, ranging from
natural language processing to time series forecasting. Despite their success,
the problem of model selection, including hyperparameter tuning, architecture
specification, and regularization choice remains largely heuristic and
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a unified statistical
framework for systematic model selection in LSTM networks. Our framework
extends classical model selection ideas, such as information criteria and
shrinkage estimation, to sequential neural networks. We define penalized
likelihoods adapted to temporal structures, propose a generalized threshold
approach for hidden state dynamics, and provide efficient estimation strategies
using variational Bayes and approximate marginal likelihood methods. Several
biomedical data centric examples demonstrate the flexibility and improved
performance of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效平滑似然目标，处理复杂似然地形，具有快速、灵活和高效的特点。

Abstract: We study the problem of likelihood maximization when the likelihood function
is intractable but model simulations are readily available. We propose a
sequential, gradient-based optimization method that directly models the Fisher
score based on a local score matching technique which uses simulations from a
localized region around each parameter iterate. By employing a linear
parameterization to the surrogate score model, our technique admits a
closed-form, least-squares solution. This approach yields a fast, flexible, and
efficient approximation to the Fisher score, effectively smoothing the
likelihood objective and mitigating the challenges posed by complex likelihood
landscapes. We provide theoretical guarantees for our score estimator,
including bounds on the bias introduced by the smoothing. Empirical results on
a range of synthetic and real-world problems demonstrate the superior
performance of our method compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 研究结果为高维分布学习问题提供了新的理论支持，解决了文献中的两个开放性问题。

Abstract: Learning distribution families over $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a fundamental problem
in unsupervised learning and statistics. A central question in this setting is
whether a given family of distributions possesses sufficient structure to be
(at least) information-theoretically learnable and, if so, to characterize its
sample complexity. In 2018, Ashtiani et al. reframed \emph{sample
compressibility}, originally due to Littlestone and Warmuth (1986), as a
structural property of distribution classes, proving that it guarantees
PAC-learnability. This discovery subsequently enabled a series of recent
advancements in deriving nearly tight sample complexity bounds for various
high-dimensional open problems. It has been further conjectured that the
converse also holds: every learnable class admits a tight sample compression
scheme.
  In this work, we establish that sample compressible families remain learnable
even from perturbed samples, subject to a set of necessary and sufficient
conditions. We analyze two models of data perturbation: (i) an additive
independent noise model, and (ii) an adversarial corruption model, where an
adversary manipulates a limited subset of the samples unknown to the learner.
Our results are general and rely on as minimal assumptions as possible. We
develop a perturbation-quantization framework that interfaces naturally with
the compression scheme and leads to sample complexity bounds that scale
gracefully with the noise level and corruption budget. As concrete
applications, we establish new sample complexity bounds for learning finite
mixtures of high-dimensional uniform distributions under both noise and
adversarial perturbations, as well as for learning Gaussian mixture models from
adversarially corrupted samples, resolving two open problems in the literature.

Result: 在图像生成任务中，CoSIM性能优于现有扩散模型加速方法。

Conclusion: CoSIM为生成模型的多步蒸馏提供了新思路，具有高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Semi-implicit distributions have shown great promise in variational inference
and generative modeling. Hierarchical semi-implicit models, which stack
multiple semi-implicit layers, enhance the expressiveness of semi-implicit
distributions and can be used to accelerate diffusion models given pretrained
score networks. However, their sequential training often suffers from slow
convergence. In this paper, we introduce CoSIM, a continuous semi-implicit
model that extends hierarchical semi-implicit models into a continuous
framework. By incorporating a continuous transition kernel, CoSIM enables
efficient, simulation-free training. Furthermore, we show that CoSIM achieves
consistency with a carefully designed transition kernel, offering a novel
approach for multistep distillation of generative models at the distributional
level. Extensive experiments on image generation demonstrate that CoSIM
performs on par or better than existing diffusion model acceleration methods,
achieving superior performance on FD-DINOv2.

Result: 通过仅依赖历史冲突数据的简约框架，实现了对冲突趋势的准确估计和未来预测。

Conclusion: 该方法为冲突研究提供了强大的工具，能够揭示冲突动态并支持预测。

Abstract: I present a novel approach to estimating the temporal and spatial patterns of
violent conflict. I show how we can use highly temporally and spatially
disaggregated data on conflict events in tandem with Gaussian processes to
estimate temporospatial conflict trends. These trends can be studied to gain
insight into conflict traps, diffusion and tempo-spatial conflict exposure in
general; they can also be used to control for such phenomenons given other
estimation tasks; lastly, the approach allow us to extrapolate the estimated
tempo-spatial conflict patterns into future temporal units, thus facilitating
powerful, stat-of-the-art, conflict forecasts. Importantly, these results are
achieved via a relatively parsimonious framework using only one data source:
past conflict patterns.

Conclusion: Half-AVAE展示了VAE在变分推断中的灵活性，为复杂ICA任务提供了有效解决方案，推动了在解耦、因果推断和生成建模中的应用。

Abstract: This study advances the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework by addressing
challenges in Independent Component Analysis (ICA) under both determined and
underdetermined conditions, focusing on enhancing the independence and
interpretability of latent variables. Traditional VAEs map observed data to
latent variables and back via an encoder-decoder architecture, but struggle
with underdetermined ICA where the number of latent variables exceeds observed
signals. The proposed Half Adversarial VAE (Half-AVAE) builds on the
encoder-free Half-VAE framework, eliminating explicit inverse mapping to tackle
underdetermined scenarios. By integrating adversarial networks and External
Enhancement (EE) terms, Half-AVAE promotes mutual independence among latent
dimensions, achieving factorized and interpretable representations. Experiments
with synthetic signals demonstrate that Half-AVAE outperforms baseline models,
including GP-AVAE and Half-VAE, in recovering independent components under
underdetermined conditions, as evidenced by lower root mean square errors. The
study highlights the flexibility of VAEs in variational inference, showing that
encoder omission, combined with adversarial training and structured priors,
enables effective solutions for complex ICA tasks, advancing applications in
disentanglement, causal inference, and generative modeling.

Abstract: We study quantile-optimal policy learning where the goal is to find a policy
whose reward distribution has the largest $\alpha$-quantile for some $\alpha
\in (0, 1)$. We focus on the offline setting whose generating process involves
unobserved confounders. Such a problem suffers from three main challenges: (i)
nonlinearity of the quantile objective as a functional of the reward
distribution, (ii) unobserved confounding issue, and (iii) insufficient
coverage of the offline dataset. To address these challenges, we propose a
suite of causal-assisted policy learning methods that provably enjoy strong
theoretical guarantees under mild conditions. In particular, to address (i) and
(ii), using causal inference tools such as instrumental variables and negative
controls, we propose to estimate the quantile objectives by solving nonlinear
functional integral equations. Then we adopt a minimax estimation approach with
nonparametric models to solve these integral equations, and propose to
construct conservative policy estimates that address (iii). The final policy is
the one that maximizes these pessimistic estimates. In addition, we propose a
novel regularized policy learning method that is more amenable to computation.
Finally, we prove that the policies learned by these methods are
$\tilde{\mathscr{O}}(n^{-1/2})$ quantile-optimal under a mild coverage
assumption on the offline dataset. Here, $\tilde{\mathscr{O}}(\cdot)$ omits
poly-logarithmic factors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first
sample-efficient policy learning algorithms for estimating the quantile-optimal
policy when there exist unmeasured confounding.

Abstract: Many critical applications, from autonomous scientific discovery to
personalized medicine, demand systems that can both strategically acquire the
most informative data and instantaneously perform inference based upon it.
While amortized methods for Bayesian inference and experimental design offer
part of the solution, neither approach is optimal in the most general and
challenging task, where new data needs to be collected for instant inference.
To tackle this issue, we introduce the Amortized Active Learning and Inference
Engine (ALINE), a unified framework for amortized Bayesian inference and active
data acquisition. ALINE leverages a transformer architecture trained via
reinforcement learning with a reward based on self-estimated information gain
provided by its own integrated inference component. This allows it to
strategically query informative data points while simultaneously refining its
predictions. Moreover, ALINE can selectively direct its querying strategy
towards specific subsets of model parameters or designated predictive tasks,
optimizing for posterior estimation, data prediction, or a mixture thereof.
Empirical results on regression-based active learning, classical Bayesian
experimental design benchmarks, and a psychometric model with selectively
targeted parameters demonstrate that ALINE delivers both instant and accurate
inference along with efficient selection of informative points.

Conclusion: R2-G2估计器通过Rao-Blackwell化显著提升了梯度估计的效率，适用于广泛的概率模型。

Abstract: Latent Gaussian variables have been popularised in probabilistic machine
learning. In turn, gradient estimators are the machinery that facilitates
gradient-based optimisation for models with latent Gaussian variables. The
reparameterisation trick is often used as the default estimator as it is simple
to implement and yields low-variance gradients for variational inference. In
this work, we propose the R2-G2 estimator as the Rao-Blackwellisation of the
reparameterisation gradient estimator. Interestingly, we show that the local
reparameterisation gradient estimator for Bayesian MLPs is an instance of the
R2-G2 estimator and Rao-Blackwellisation. This lets us extend benefits of
Rao-Blackwellised gradients to a suite of probabilistic models. We show that
initial training with R2-G2 consistently yields better performance in models
with multiple applications of the reparameterisation trick.

Abstract: We propose an algorithm for change point monitoring in linear causal models
that accounts for interventions. Through a special centralization technique, we
can concentrate the changes arising from causal propagation across nodes into a
single dimension. Additionally, by selecting appropriate intervention nodes
based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, we can amplify the change magnitude. We
also present an algorithm for selecting the intervention values, which aids in
the identification of the most effective intervention nodes. Two monitoring
methods are proposed, each with an adaptive intervention policy to make a
balance between exploration and exploitation. We theoretically demonstrate the
first-order optimality of the proposed methods and validate their properties
using simulation datasets and two real-world case studies.

Conclusion: 论文通过理论和实验证明，合理设计的斜对称矩阵能显著提升SRNLD的性能，为约束采样问题提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained
domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained
sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo
(PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and
more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC)
based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics
(SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on
the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD.
Although the non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SRNLD (and SRNLMC) and the
acceleration compared to RLD (and PMLC) have been studied in the literature, it
is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to
achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle
(LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is
chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the
boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that
SRNLD can accelerate the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD
with this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC
based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance which
validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.

TLDR: 提出一种高效的力导向布局算法，将图嵌入低维空间，径向距离作为中心性度量的代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模图上计算传统中心性度量（如介数和接近度）计算成本高。

Method: 使用力导向布局算法将图嵌入低维空间，径向距离作为中心性度量的代理。

Result: 在多种图类型上验证，与度、PageRank和路径中心性有强相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法为网络中找到高影响力节点提供了一种快速、可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Computing classical centrality measures such as betweenness and closeness is
computationally expensive on large-scale graphs. In this work, we introduce an
efficient force layout algorithm that embeds a graph into a low-dimensional
space, where the radial distance from the origin serves as a proxy for various
centrality measures. We evaluate our method on multiple graph families and
demonstrate strong correlations with degree, PageRank, and paths-based
centralities. As an application, it turns out that the proposed embedding
allows to find high-influence nodes in a network, and provides a fast and
scalable alternative to the standard greedy algorithm.

### [776] [Explaining Risks: Axiomatic Risk Attributions for Financial Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06653)
*Dangxing Chen*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley值框架的风险分配方法，用于解释机器学习模型在高风险领域（如金融）中的风险贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域，模型的风险分配与均值预测同样重要，但现有方法主要关注特征贡献的解释，而忽略了风险分配问题。

Method: 通过扩展Shapley值框架，提出了一种公平分配风险的方法。

Result: 分析和实证表明，该方法能够有效地分配风险。

Conclusion: 扩展的Shapley值框架为模型风险分配提供了一种可行且公平的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning models have achieved great success at the
expense of highly complex black-box structures. By using axiomatic attribution
methods, we can fairly allocate the contributions of each feature, thus
allowing us to interpret the model predictions. In high-risk sectors such as
finance, risk is just as important as mean predictions. Throughout this work,
we address the following risk attribution problem: how to fairly allocate the
risk given a model with data? We demonstrate with analysis and empirical
examples that risk can be well allocated by extending the Shapley value
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化金融中模型不确定性对决策质量影响显著，但真实概率测度难以获取，需依赖近似方法。

Method: 结合Klibanoff框架，提出基于子采样的模型不确定性近似策略，并开发高效并行化算法。

Result: 不确定性度量优于传统混合测度策略，子采样方法在鲁棒性和性能上接近复杂贝叶斯方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效应对模型风险，为量化金融决策提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of model uncertainty in quantitative
finance, where decisions in portfolio allocation, derivative pricing, and risk
management rely on estimating stochastic models from limited data. In practice,
the unavailability of the true probability measure forces reliance on an
empirical approximation, and even small misestimations can lead to significant
deviations in decision quality. Building on the framework of Klibanoff et al.
(2005), we enhance the conventional objective - whether this is expected
utility in an investing context or a hedging metric - by superimposing an outer
"uncertainty measure", motivated by traditional monetary risk measures, on the
space of models. In scenarios where a natural model distribution is lacking or
Bayesian methods are impractical, we propose an ad hoc subsampling strategy,
analogous to bootstrapping in statistical finance and related to mini-batch
sampling in deep learning, to approximate model uncertainty. To address the
quadratic memory demands of naive implementations, we also present an adapted
stochastic gradient descent algorithm that enables efficient parallelization.
Through analytical, simulated, and empirical studies - including multi-period,
real data and high-dimensional examples - we demonstrate that uncertainty
measures outperform traditional mixture of measures strategies and our
model-agnostic subsampling-based approach not only enhances robustness against
model risk but also achieves performance comparable to more elaborate Bayesian
methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive formalization of the von
Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) expected utility theorem using the Lean 4 interactive
theorem prover. We implement the classical axioms of preference-completeness,
transitivity, continuity, and independence-enabling machine-verified proofs of
both the existence and uniqueness of utility representations. Our formalization
captures the mathematical structure of preference relations over lotteries,
verifying that preferences satisfying the vNM axioms can be represented by
expected utility maximization.
  Our contributions include a granular implementation of the independence
axiom, formally verified proofs of fundamental claims about mixture lotteries,
constructive demonstrations of utility existence, and computational experiments
validating the results. We prove equivalence to classical presentations while
offering greater precision at decision boundaries.
  This formalization provides a rigorous foundation for applications in
economic modeling, AI alignment, and management decision systems, bridging the
gap between theoretical decision theory and computational implementation.

Conclusion: 该方法成功设计并制造了具有定制选择性发射光谱的自由形式超材料，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures that manipulate
electromagnetic waves, having optical properties absent in natural materials.
Recently, machine learning for the inverse design of metamaterials has drawn
attention. However, the highly nonlinear relationship between the metamaterial
structures and optical behaviour, coupled with fabrication difficulties, poses
challenges for using machine learning to design and manufacture complex
metamaterials. Herein, we propose a general framework that implements
customised spectrum-to-shape and size parameters to address one-to-many
metamaterial inverse design problems using conditional diffusion models. Our
method exhibits superior spectral prediction accuracy, generates a diverse
range of patterns compared to other typical generative models, and offers
valuable prior knowledge for manufacturing through the subsequent analysis of
the diverse generated results, thereby facilitating the experimental
fabrication of metamaterial designs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed method by successfully designing and fabricating a free-form
metamaterial with a tailored selective emission spectrum for thermal camouflage
applications.

Motivation: 研究如何高效地从强对数凹分布中采样，特别是通过改进的离散化方法超越现有方法的性能。

Method: 采用泊松中点离散化方法（随机中点方法的变体）用于过阻尼/欠阻尼Langevin动力学。

Result: 在2-Wasserstein距离下实现了收敛，并在目标精度上获得了三次加速，且在欠阻尼情况下复杂度显著低于文献中的下界。

Conclusion: 泊松中点离散化方法在采样效率和收敛性上优于现有方法，特别是在欠阻尼Langevin动力学中表现突出。

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from strongly log-concave distributions over
$\mathbb{R}^d$ using the Poisson midpoint discretization (a variant of the
randomized midpoint method) for overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics. We
prove its convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance ($W_2$), achieving a cubic
speedup in dependence on the target accuracy ($\epsilon$) over the
Euler-Maruyama discretization, surpassing existing bounds for randomized
midpoint methods. Notably, in the case of underdamped Langevin dynamics, we
demonstrate the complexity of $W_2$ convergence is much smaller than the
complexity lower bounds for convergence in $L^2$ strong error established in
the literature.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种递归语义锚定方法，用于处理语言变体和混合语，通过固定点算子建模语义漂移，并证明了其收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISO 639:2023缺乏处理方言漂移和混合语的机器原生机制，需要一种形式化方法来增强语言标识的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用固定点算子建模语义漂移，将语言实体与漂移向量结合，并通过范畴论和函子理论证明收敛性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在语言识别和翻译任务中对噪声或混合输入具有更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架兼容ISO/TC 37，为未来标准提供了支持语义漂移的AI可处理层。

Abstract: ISO 639:2023 unifies the ISO language-code family and introduces contextual
metadata, but it lacks a machine-native mechanism for handling dialectal drift
and creole mixtures. We propose a formalisation of recursive semantic
anchoring, attaching to every language entity $\chi$ a family of fixed-point
operators $\phi_{n,m}$ that model bounded semantic drift via the relation
$\phi_{n,m}(\chi) = \chi \oplus \Delta(\chi)$, where $\Delta(\chi)$ is a drift
vector in a latent semantic manifold. The base anchor $\phi_{0,0}$ recovers the
canonical ISO 639:2023 identity, whereas $\phi_{99,9}$ marks the maximal drift
state that triggers a deterministic fallback. Using category theory, we treat
the operators $\phi_{n,m}$ as morphisms and drift vectors as arrows in a
category $\mathrm{DriftLang}$. A functor $\Phi: \mathrm{DriftLang} \to
\mathrm{AnchorLang}$ maps every drifted object to its unique anchor and proves
convergence. We provide an RDF/Turtle schema (\texttt{BaseLanguage},
\texttt{DriftedLanguage}, \texttt{ResolvedAnchor}) and worked examples -- e.g.,
$\phi_{8,4}$ (Standard Mandarin) versus $\phi_{8,7}$ (a colloquial variant),
and $\phi_{1,7}$ for Nigerian Pidgin anchored to English. Experiments with
transformer models show higher accuracy in language identification and
translation on noisy or code-switched input when the $\phi$-indices are used to
guide fallback routing. The framework is compatible with ISO/TC 37 and provides
an AI-tractable, drift-aware semantic layer for future standards.

Conclusion: QuantMCP为LLMs与金融数据间提供了可靠、可扩展的桥梁，提升了金融应用中LLMs的可靠性和分析能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense promise for revolutionizing
financial analysis and decision-making, yet their direct application is often
hampered by issues of data hallucination and lack of access to real-time,
verifiable financial information. This paper introduces QuantMCP, a novel
framework designed to rigorously ground LLMs in financial reality. By
leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized and secure tool
invocation, QuantMCP enables LLMs to accurately interface with a diverse array
of Python-accessible financial data APIs (e.g., Wind, yfinance). Users can
interact via natural language to precisely retrieve up-to-date financial data,
thereby overcoming LLM's inherent limitations in factual data recall. More
critically, once furnished with this verified, structured data, the LLM's
analytical capabilities are unlocked, empowering it to perform sophisticated
data interpretation, generate insights, and ultimately support more informed
financial decision-making processes. QuantMCP provides a robust, extensible,
and secure bridge between conversational AI and the complex world of financial
data, aiming to enhance both the reliability and the analytical depth of LLM
applications in finance.

Abstract: This paper presents a sophisticated multi-day turnover quantitative trading
algorithm that integrates advanced deep learning techniques with comprehensive
cross-sectional stock prediction for the Chinese A-share market. Our framework
combines five interconnected modules: initial stock selection through deep
cross-sectional prediction networks, opening signal distribution analysis using
mixture models for arbitrage identification, market capitalization and
liquidity-based dynamic position sizing, grid-search optimized profit-taking
and stop-loss mechanisms, and multi-granularity volatility-based market timing
models. The algorithm employs a novel approach to balance capital efficiency
with risk management through adaptive holding periods and sophisticated
entry/exit timing. Trained on comprehensive A-share data from 2010-2020 and
rigorously backtested on 2021-2024 data, our method achieves remarkable
performance with 15.2\% annualized returns, maximum drawdown constrained below
5\%, and a Sharpe ratio of 1.87. The strategy demonstrates exceptional
scalability by maintaining 50-100 daily positions with a 9-day maximum holding
period, incorporating dynamic profit-taking and stop-loss mechanisms that
enhance capital turnover efficiency while preserving risk-adjusted returns. Our
approach exhibits robust performance across various market regimes while
maintaining high capital capacity suitable for institutional deployment.

Method: 利用图神经网络基础模型进行高效计算，结合大型语言模型实现自然语言理解和任务规划，提供交互式界面。

Result: 在13个基准任务中，小模型适用于简单任务，复杂任务需大模型支持；多智能体框架可提升小模型性能。

Conclusion: ChemGraph通过AI和多智能体框架显著提升了原子模拟的效率和可访问性。

Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science,
accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and
pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to
the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the
need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and
validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework
powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to
streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science
workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for
accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models
(LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific
reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform
tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry
optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with
methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials
to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate
ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs
(GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows,
while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o.
Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks
through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed
GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法在模拟数据上训练时难以泛化到真实数据，且容易过拟合非语音区域。

Method: 结合Whisper的语义特征编码和Wav2vec2与AudioMAE的声学特征编码，提出SASTNet。

Result: SASTNet在CodecFake+数据集的CoSG测试集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: SASTNet能有效提升源追踪的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent attempts at source tracing for codec-based deepfake speech
(CodecFake), generated by neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG)
models, have exhibited suboptimal performance. However, how to train source
tracing models using simulated CoSG data while maintaining strong performance
on real CoSG-generated audio remains an open challenge. In this paper, we show
that models trained solely on codec-resynthesized data tend to overfit to
non-speech regions and struggle to generalize to unseen content. To mitigate
these challenges, we introduce the Semantic-Acoustic Source Tracing Network
(SASTNet), which jointly leverages Whisper for semantic feature encoding and
Wav2vec2 with AudioMAE for acoustic feature encoding. Our proposed SASTNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoSG test set of the CodecFake+
dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for reliable source tracing.

<details>

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在图像诊断任务中表现优异，但忽略了音频特征。本文旨在解决音频特征提取中的噪声挑战，提升抑郁症诊断的准确性。

Method: RBA-FE提取六种声学特征，结合改进的脉冲神经元模型（ARSLIF），模拟大脑注意力系统的信号选择性调整机制，增强噪声鲁棒性。

Result: 在MODMA数据集上，RBA-FE在精确度、准确度、召回率和F1分数上分别达到0.8750、0.8974、0.8750和0.8750，并在AVEC2014和DAIC-WOZ数据集上表现出更强的噪声鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RBA-FE模型在抑郁症音频诊断中表现出色，ARSLIF神经元模型提供了脑启发的可解释性，揭示了抑郁音频数据的异常放电模式。

Abstract: This article proposes a robust brain-inspired audio feature extractor
(RBA-FE) model for depression diagnosis, using an improved hierarchical network
architecture. Most deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance
for image-based diagnostic tasks, ignoring the counterpart audio features. In
order to tailor the noise challenge, RBA-FE leverages six acoustic features
extracted from the raw audio, capturing both spatial characteristics and
temporal dependencies. This hybrid attribute helps alleviate the precision
limitation in audio feature extraction within other learning models like deep
residual shrinkage networks. To deal with the noise issues, our model
incorporates an improved spiking neuron model, called adaptive rate smooth
leaky integrate-and-fire (ARSLIF). The ARSLIF model emulates the mechanism of
``retuning of cellular signal selectivity" in the brain attention systems,
which enhances the model robustness against environmental noises in audio data.
Experimental results demonstrate that RBA-FE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
on the MODMA dataset, respectively with 0.8750, 0.8974, 0.8750 and 0.8750 in
precision, accuracy, recall and F1 score. Extensive experiments on the AVEC2014
and DAIC-WOZ datasets both show enhancements in noise robustness. It is further
indicated by comparison that the ARSLIF neuron model suggest the abnormal
firing pattern within the feature extraction on depressive audio data, offering
brain-inspired interpretability.

Motivation: 现有ASR系统在复杂环境（如电视剧）中表现不佳，多模态方法未能充分利用视频中的丰富信息。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中验证了该方法能显著提升ASR性能。

Conclusion: 视频上下文信息能有效提升复杂多媒体环境中的ASR转录准确性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has achieved remarkable success with deep
learning, driving advancements in conversational artificial intelligence, media
transcription, and assistive technologies. However, ASR systems still struggle
in complex environments such as TV series, where overlapping speech,
domain-specific terminology, and long-range contextual dependencies pose
significant challenges to transcription accuracy. Existing multimodal
approaches fail to correct ASR outputs with the rich temporal and contextual
information available in video. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
multimodal post-correction framework that refines ASR transcriptions by
leveraging contextual cues extracted from video. Our framework consists of two
stages: ASR Generation and Video-based Post-Correction, where the first stage
produces the initial transcript and the second stage corrects errors using
Video-based Contextual Information Extraction and Context-aware ASR Correction.
We employ the Video-Large Multimodal Model (VLMM) to extract key contextual
information using tailored prompts, which is then integrated with a Large
Language Model (LLM) to refine the ASR output. We evaluate our method on a
multimodal benchmark for TV series ASR and demonstrate its effectiveness in
improving ASR performance by leveraging video-based context to enhance
transcription accuracy in complex multimedia environments.

Conclusion: 该方法轻量高效，能有效检测单模态和多模态深度伪造，且对未知类型伪造具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deepfakes are AI-synthesized multimedia data that may be abused for spreading
misinformation. Deepfake generation involves both visual and audio
manipulation. To detect audio-visual deepfakes, previous studies commonly
employ two relatively independent sub-models to learn audio and visual
features, respectively, and fuse them subsequently for deepfake detection.
However, this may underutilize the inherent correlations between audio and
visual features. Moreover, utilizing two isolated feature learning sub-models
can result in redundant neural layers, making the overall model inefficient and
impractical for resource-constrained environments.
  In this work, we design a lightweight network for audio-visual deepfake
detection via a single-stream multi-modal learning framework. Specifically, we
introduce a collaborative audio-visual learning block to efficiently integrate
multi-modal information while learning the visual and audio features. By
iteratively employing this block, our single-stream network achieves a
continuous fusion of multi-modal features across its layers. Thus, our network
efficiently captures visual and audio features without the need for excessive
block stacking, resulting in a lightweight network design. Furthermore, we
propose a multi-modal classification module that can boost the dependence of
the visual and audio classifiers on modality content. It also enhances the
whole resistance of the video classifier against the mismatches between audio
and visual modalities. We conduct experiments on the DF-TIMIT, FakeAVCeleb, and
DFDC benchmark datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art audio-visual joint
detection methods, our method is significantly lightweight with only 0.48M
parameters, yet it achieves superiority in both uni-modal and multi-modal
deepfakes, as well as in unseen types of deepfakes.

Conclusion: 通过建模参数分布的多模态性和对称性，显著提升了音频合成器参数反演的性能。

Abstract: Many audio synthesizers can produce the same signal given different parameter
configurations, meaning the inversion from sound to parameters is an inherently
ill-posed problem. We show that this is largely due to intrinsic symmetries of
the synthesizer, and focus in particular on permutation invariance. First, we
demonstrate on a synthetic task that regressing point estimates under
permutation symmetry degrades performance, even when using a
permutation-invariant loss function or symmetry-breaking heuristics. Then,
viewing equivalent solutions as modes of a probability distribution, we show
that a conditional generative model substantially improves performance.
Further, acknowledging the invariance of the implicit parameter distribution,
we find that performance is further improved by using a permutation equivariant
continuous normalizing flow. To accommodate intricate symmetries in real
synthesizers, we also propose a relaxed equivariance strategy that adaptively
discovers relevant symmetries from data. Applying our method to Surge XT, a
full-featured open source synthesizer used in real world audio production, we
find our method outperforms regression and generative baselines across audio
reconstruction metrics.

Conclusion: LeVo通过创新的令牌建模和偏好对齐方法，解决了歌词到歌曲生成中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models
have significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song
generation. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex
composition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to
limitations in sound quality, musicality, instruction following, and
vocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, an
LM-based framework consisting of LeLM and a music codec. LeLM is capable of
parallelly modeling two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the
combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve vocal-instrument harmony,
and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for
high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a
modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different
token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following, we
introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a
semi-automatic data construction process and DPO post-training. Experimental
results demonstrate that LeVo consistently outperforms existing methods on both
objective and subjective metrics. Ablation studies further justify the
effectiveness of our designs. Audio examples are available at

*Guibin Zhang,Muxin Fu,Guancheng Wan,Miao Yu,Kun Wang,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.MA

TLDR: 论文提出G-Memory，一种分层、代理化的记忆系统，用于解决多代理系统（MAS）中记忆机制过于简单和缺乏定制化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAS的记忆机制过于简单，忽视了代理间协作的复杂性，且缺乏跨任务和代理特定的定制化。

Method: 引入G-Memory，一种基于组织记忆理论的三层图层次结构（洞察图、查询图和交互图），通过双向记忆遍历检索高层次的通用见解和细粒度的协作轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，G-Memory在五个基准测试中显著提升了成功率（最高20.89%）和知识问答准确率（最高10.12%）。

Conclusion: G-Memory有效促进了代理团队的渐进式进化，且无需修改原有框架。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have
demonstrated cognitive and execution capabilities that far exceed those of
single LLM agents, yet their capacity for self-evolution remains hampered by
underdeveloped memory architectures. Upon close inspection, we are alarmed to
discover that prevailing MAS memory mechanisms (1) are overly simplistic,
completely disregarding the nuanced inter-agent collaboration trajectories, and
(2) lack cross-trial and agent-specific customization, in stark contrast to the
expressive memory developed for single agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce
G-Memory, a hierarchical, agentic memory system for MAS inspired by
organizational memory theory, which manages the lengthy MAS interaction via a
three-tier graph hierarchy: insight, query, and interaction graphs. Upon
receiving a new user query, G-Memory performs bi-directional memory traversal
to retrieve both $\textit{high-level, generalizable insights}$ that enable the
system to leverage cross-trial knowledge, and $\textit{fine-grained, condensed
interaction trajectories}$ that compactly encode prior collaboration
experiences. Upon task execution, the entire hierarchy evolves by assimilating
new collaborative trajectories, nurturing the progressive evolution of agent
teams. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, three LLM backbones, and
three popular MAS frameworks demonstrate that G-Memory improves success rates
in embodied action and accuracy in knowledge QA by up to $20.89\%$ and
$10.12\%$, respectively, without any modifications to the original frameworks.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种结合AI方法（如NLP和大型语言模型）的模型，用于在协作文档写作中生成多数支持的妥协提案，解决了传统工具的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在协作文档写作（如社区宪章起草）中如何有效找到多数支持的妥协提案这一开放性问题。

Method: 结合代理的有限理性和不确定性，利用NLP技术和大型语言模型构建语义度量空间，并设计算法生成妥协提案。

Result: 通过模拟联盟形成过程，验证了AI在大规模民主文本编辑中的有效性。

Conclusion: AI方法能够有效支持大规模民主文本编辑，弥补传统工具的不足。

Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental
to AI subfields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on
this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition
formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo,
using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. A crucial step in
this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent
coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains
an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates
agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to
generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document
writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our
approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models
to induce a semantic metric space over text. Based on this space, we design
algorithms to suggest compromise points likely to receive broad support. To
evaluate our methods, we simulate coalition formation processes and show that
AI can facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, a domain where
traditional tools are limited.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用LLM在医学影像应用中的幻觉、解释性不足和领域知识缺乏问题，提升临床报告的准确性和效率。

Result: MedChat提高了可靠性，减少幻觉风险，适用于临床审查和教育用途。

Conclusion: MedChat通过多智能体协作，有效解决了医学影像诊断中的LLM局限性，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language
models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist
shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general
LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited
interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can
potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining
imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely
on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse
and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address
these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and
platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific
LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances
reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic
reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational
use. Code available at https://github.com/Purdue-M2/MedChat.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的多智能体规划算法在具身环境中适应性不足，需要改进。

Method: 采用LIET范式，结合个体学习（局部效用函数）和团队进化（共享合作知识列表），提升LLM智能体的适应性和协作能力。

Result: 在Communicative Watch-And-Help和ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport基准测试中，LIET表现优于现有基线，展示了强大的协作规划能力。

Conclusion: LIET框架通过个体与团队的协同学习，显著提升了多智能体LLM在复杂环境中的适应性和协作效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge bases and strong
reasoning capabilities, making them promising tools for complex, multi-agent
planning in embodied environments. However, despite LLMs' advanced abilities
and the sophisticated modular design of agentic methods, existing LLM-based
planning algorithms remain limited by weak adaptation capabilities to
multi-agent embodied scenarios. We address this limitation by introducing a
framework that enables LLM agents to learn and evolve both before and during
test time, equipping them with environment-relevant knowledge for better
planning and enhanced communication for improved cooperation. Inspired by
centralized training with decentralized execution in multi-agent reinforcement
learning, we propose a \textit{Learn as Individuals, Evolve as a Team (LIET)}
paradigm for multi-agent LLMs adaptation. At the individual level, LLM agents
learn a local utility function from exploratory datasets to better comprehend
the embodied environment, which is then queried during test time to support
informed decision-making. At the team level, LLM agents collaboratively and
iteratively maintain and update a shared cooperation knowledge list based on
new experiences, using it to guide more effective communication. By combining
individual learning with team evolution, LIET enables comprehensive and
flexible adaptation for LLM agents. Our experiments on Communicative
Watch-And-Help and ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport benchmarks demonstrate
that LIET, instantiated with both LLaMA and GPT-4o, outperforms existing
baselines and exhibits strong cooperative planning abilities.

TLDR: Shapley-Coop是一个基于Shapley值的协作框架，通过定价机制和任务后奖励分配促进LLM代理在开放环境中的合作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏协调规则的开放环境中，LLM代理倾向于自私行为，导致协作困难。公平的信用分配和定价机制是关键挑战。

Method: 提出Shapley-Coop框架，结合Shapley Chain-of-Thought（基于边际贡献定价）和结构化谈判协议，实现任务时间和奖励的合理分配。

Result: 在多个多代理游戏和软件工程模拟中，Shapley-Coop显著提升了代理协作效果和信用分配的公平性。

Conclusion: Shapley-Coop通过有效的定价机制，成功解决了LLM代理在开放环境中的协作问题，并实现了公平的信用分配。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong collaborative performance in
multi-agent systems with predefined roles and workflows. However, in open-ended
environments lacking coordination rules, agents tend to act in self-interested
ways. The central challenge in achieving coordination lies in credit assignment
-- fairly evaluating each agent's contribution and designing pricing mechanisms
that align their heterogeneous goals. This problem is critical as LLMs
increasingly participate in complex human-AI collaborations, where fair
compensation and accountability rely on effective pricing mechanisms. Inspired
by how human societies address similar coordination challenges (e.g., through
temporary collaborations such as employment or subcontracting), we propose a
cooperative workflow, Shapley-Coop. Shapley-Coop integrates Shapley
Chain-of-Thought -- leveraging marginal contributions as a principled basis for
pricing -- with structured negotiation protocols for effective price matching,
enabling LLM agents to coordinate through rational task-time pricing and
post-task reward redistribution. This approach aligns agent incentives, fosters
cooperation, and maintains autonomy. We evaluate Shapley-Coop across two
multi-agent games and a software engineering simulation, demonstrating that it
consistently enhances LLM agent collaboration and facilitates equitable credit
assignment. These results highlight the effectiveness of Shapley-Coop's pricing
mechanisms in accurately reflecting individual contributions during task
execution.

Main category: cs.MA

TLDR: 论文研究了集体决策机制中责任扩散现象，证明避免责任扩散的唯一方式是让单一代理人独裁决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨集体决策中责任扩散问题，明确个体责任模糊的机制。

Method: 通过定义决策机制的互模拟，证明互模拟保留责任相关属性，并在最小互模拟机制中验证结果。

Result: 在两人决策中，避免责任扩散需独裁；多人决策中，需选举独裁者。

Conclusion: 责任扩散无法通过集体决策机制完全避免，除非采用独裁或选举独裁形式。

Abstract: The term "diffusion of responsibility'' refers to situations in which
multiple agents share responsibility for an outcome, obscuring individual
accountability. This paper examines this frequently undesirable phenomenon in
the context of collective decision-making mechanisms.
  The work shows that if a decision is made by two agents, then the only way to
avoid diffusion of responsibility is for one agent to act as a "dictator'',
making the decision unilaterally. In scenarios with more than two agents, any
diffusion-free mechanism is an "elected dictatorship'' where the agents elect a
single agent to make a unilateral decision.
  The technical results are obtained by defining a bisimulation of
decision-making mechanisms, proving that bisimulation preserves
responsibility-related properties, and establishing the results for a smallest
bisimular mechanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI深度伪造对生物识别认证构成快速演变的威胁，但专家与公众对此风险的认知存在显著差距，导致系统漏洞。研究旨在填补这一差距。

Method: 采用混合方法研究，调查了408名专业人士，并对37名参与者（25名专家，12名非专家）进行了深入访谈。提出了Deepfake Kill Chain模型和三层次缓解框架。

Result: 研究发现公众依赖生物识别的便利性，而专家对静态模态（如人脸和语音识别）的伪造表示严重担忧。不同行业和人群的认知和信任度存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究提出了动态生物信号、数据治理和教育倡议的三层次缓解框架，为防御AI生成的身份威胁提供了实证支持的路线图。

Abstract: Generative AI (Gen-AI) deepfakes pose a rapidly evolving threat to biometric
authentication, yet a significant gap exists between expert understanding of
these risks and public perception. This disconnection creates critical
vulnerabilities in systems trusted by millions. To bridge this gap, we
conducted a comprehensive mixed-method study, surveying 408 professionals
across key sectors and conducting in-depth interviews with 37 participants (25
experts, 12 general public [non-experts]). Our findings reveal a paradox: while
the public increasingly relies on biometrics for convenience, experts express
grave concerns about the spoofing of static modalities like face and voice
recognition. We found significant demographic and sector-specific divides in
awareness and trust, with finance professionals, for example, showing
heightened skepticism. To systematically analyze these threats, we introduce a
novel Deepfake Kill Chain model, adapted from Hutchins et al.'s cybersecurity
frameworks to map the specific attack vectors used by malicious actors against
biometric systems. Based on this model and our empirical findings, we propose a
tri-layer mitigation framework that prioritizes dynamic biometric signals
(e.g., eye movements), robust privacy-preserving data governance, and targeted
educational initiatives. This work provides the first empirically grounded
roadmap for defending against AI-generated identity threats by aligning
technical safeguards with human-centered insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM依赖的工具较少且基于传统行为成瘾症状，但LLM与人类的关系更为复杂，需要新的视角。

Method: 基于理论工作开发了12项问卷，收集了526名英国参与者的数据，通过探索性和验证性因子分析验证了两因素结构。

Result: 问卷显示出良好的内部一致性和区分效度，工具性依赖和关系性依赖两个维度得到验证。

Conclusion: LLM依赖不一定代表功能失调，但在某些情境下可能成为问题，LLM-D12为研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: There is growing interest in understanding how people interact with large
language models (LLMs) and whether such models elicit dependency or even
addictive behaviour. Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals
may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic
behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this
as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and
warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed
and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred
to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with
items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in
the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate
halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a
two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship
Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which
individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and
cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs
as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor
structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant
validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the
distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and
structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view
that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still
reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a dual challenge in
the fight against disinformation. These powerful tools, capable of generating
human-like text at scale, can be weaponised to produce sophisticated and
persuasive disinformation, yet they also hold promise for enhancing detection
and mitigation strategies. This paper investigates the complex dynamics between
LLMs and disinformation through a communication game that simulates online
forums, inspired by the game Werewolf, with 25 participants. We analyse how
Disinformers, Moderators, and Users leverage LLMs to advance their goals,
revealing both the potential for misuse and combating disinformation. Our
findings highlight the varying uses of LLMs depending on the participants'
roles and strategies, underscoring the importance of understanding their
effectiveness in this context. We conclude by discussing implications for
future LLM development and online platform design, advocating for a balanced
approach that empowers users and fosters trust while mitigating the risks of
LLM-assisted disinformation.

Method: 通过半结构化访谈，研究次要利益相关者如何实现参与式AI的三个理想（知情、同意和能动性），并提出了三种利益相关者原型。

Conclusion: 论文展望了一个次要利益相关者能够有意义地参与AI系统的未来，并强调了知情、同意和能动性的重要性。

Abstract: As AI technologies become more human-facing, there have been numerous calls
to adapt participatory approaches to AI development -- spurring the idea of
participatory AI. However, these calls often focus only on primary
stakeholders, such as end-users, and not secondary stakeholders. This paper
seeks to translate the ideals of participatory AI to a broader population of
secondary AI stakeholders through semi-structured interviews. We theorize that
meaningful participation involves three participatory ideals: (1) informedness,
(2) consent, and (3) agency. We also explore how secondary stakeholders realize
these ideals by traversing a complicated problem space. Like walking up the
rungs of a ladder, these ideals build on one another. We introduce three
stakeholder archetypes: the reluctant data contributor, the unsupported
activist, and the well-intentioned practitioner, who must navigate systemic
barriers to achieving agentic AI relationships. We envision an AI future where
secondary stakeholders are able to meaningfully participate with the AI systems
they influence and are influenced by.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测小分子在蛋白质结合位点的3D构象是药物设计的关键挑战，现有方法在模板相似性低或配体灵活性高时表现不佳。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段基于流匹配的分子对齐生成3D坐标；第二阶段通过可微位姿优化进一步优化构象。

Result: 在新基准测试中表现优于标准对接工具和开放对齐方法，尤其是在模板相似性低或配体灵活性高的情况下。

Conclusion: 该方法为药物设计中的3D构象预测提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting the 3D conformation of small molecules within protein binding
sites is a key challenge in drug design. When a crystallized reference ligand
(template) is available, it provides geometric priors that can guide 3D pose
prediction. We present a two-stage method for ligand conformation generation
guided by such templates. In the first stage, we introduce a molecular
alignment approach based on flow-matching to generate 3D coordinates for the
ligand, using the template structure as a reference. In the second stage, a
differentiable pose optimization procedure refines this conformation based on
shape and pharmacophore similarities, internal energy, and, optionally, the
protein binding pocket. We evaluate our approach on a new benchmark of ligand
pairs co-crystallized with the same target and show that it outperforms
standard docking tools and open-access alignment methods, especially in cases
involving low similarity to the template or high ligand flexibility.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的SAT编码方法，用于量子电路布局合成，重点优化电路深度或CX门深度，相比现有方法提速10-100倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子硬件对CX门的连接性有限制，且CX门噪声较大，因此需要优化布局合成以减少CX门数量或深度。

Method: 采用增量SAT求解和并行计划，提出新的SAT编码方法，保证找到深度或CX门深度最小的电路。

Result: 相比OLSQ2，新方法提速10-100倍；模拟显示优化CX门数量比优化深度更能减少噪声，但结合两者效果最佳。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了量子电路布局合成的效率，同时揭示了优化CX门数量和深度对噪声降低的综合影响。

Abstract: Quantum circuits consist of gates applied to qubits. Current quantum hardware
platforms impose connectivity restrictions on binary CX gates. Hence, Layout
Synthesis is an important step to transpile quantum circuits before they can be
executed. Since CX gates are noisy, it is important to reduce the CX count or
CX depth of the mapped circuits.
  We provide a new and efficient encoding of Quantum-circuit Layout Synthesis
in SAT. Previous SAT encodings focused on gate count and CX-gate count. Our
encoding instead guarantees that we find mapped circuits with minimal circuit
depth or minimal CX-gate depth. We use incremental SAT solving and parallel
plans for an efficient encoding. This results in speedups of more than 10-100x
compared to OLSQ2, which guarantees depth-optimality. But minimizing depth
still takes more time than minimizing gate count with Q-Synth.
  We correlate the noise reduction achieved by simulating circuits after
(CX)-count and (CX)-depth reduction. We find that minimizing for CX-count
correlates better with reducing noise than minimizing for CX-depth. However,
taking into account both CX-count and CX-depth provides the best noise
reduction.

Conclusion: 提出的量子加权同质集成方法在性能上表现出色，为量子计算在集成学习中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ensemble methods in machine learning aim to improve prediction accuracy by
combining multiple models. This is achieved by ensuring diversity among
predictors to capture different data aspects. Homogeneous ensembles use
identical models, achieving diversity through different data subsets, and
weighted-average ensembles assign higher influence to more accurate models
through a weight learning procedure. We propose a method to achieve a weighted
homogeneous quantum ensemble using quantum classifiers with indexing registers
for data encoding. This approach leverages instance-based quantum classifiers,
enabling feature and training point subsampling through superposition and
controlled unitaries, and allowing for a quantum-parallel execution of diverse
internal classifiers with different data compositions in superposition. The
method integrates a learning process involving circuit execution and classical
weight optimization, for a trained ensemble execution with weights encoded in
the circuit at test-time. Empirical evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method, offering insights into its performance.

Main category: math.OC

TLDR: 论文提出了一种量化黎曼梯度跟踪算法（Q-RGT），用于解决紧凑子流形上的分布式优化问题，通过量化梯度减少通信瓶颈，并保持与非量化方法相同的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式优化在紧凑子流形上的效率常受通信瓶颈限制，量化梯度可以缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出Q-RGT算法，利用量化梯度更新局部变量，绕过黎曼投影算子的限制。

Result: Q-RGT在量化情况下实现了与非量化方法相同的收敛速度（O(1/K)），并通过数值实验验证了其性能。

Conclusion: Q-RGT在减少通信开销的同时，保持了与非量化方法相当的优化性能。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of decentralized optimization on compact
submanifolds, where a finite sum of smooth (possibly non-convex) local
functions is minimized by $n$ agents forming an undirected and connected graph.
However, the efficiency of distributed optimization is often hindered by
communication bottlenecks. To mitigate this, we propose the Quantized
Riemannian Gradient Tracking (Q-RGT) algorithm, where agents update their local
variables using quantized gradients. The introduction of quantization noise
allows our algorithm to bypass the constraints of the accurate Riemannian
projection operator (such as retraction), further improving iterative
efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ convergence rate in the presence of quantization,
matching the convergence rate of methods without quantization. Additionally, we
explicitly derive lower bounds on decentralized consensus associated with a
function of quantization levels. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Q-RGT
performs comparably to non-quantized methods while reducing communication
bottlenecks and computational overhead.

Motivation: 子模函数在多个应用中具有重要意义，但之前的研究仅局限于集合函数。本文旨在扩展这一研究到更广泛的连续和离散域。

Method: 提出了一种新的DC算法变体（DCA），并将其应用于离散和连续域上的DS最小化问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在整数压缩感知和整数最小二乘问题中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 本文成功扩展了DS最小化的研究范围，并提出了一种有效的算法，验证了其实际性能。

Abstract: Submodular functions, defined on continuous or discrete domains, arise in
numerous applications. We study the minimization of the difference of two
submodular (DS) functions, over both domains, extending prior work restricted
to set functions. We show that all functions on discrete domains and all smooth
functions on continuous domains are DS. For discrete domains, we observe that
DS minimization is equivalent to minimizing the difference of two convex (DC)
functions, as in the set function case. We propose a novel variant of the DC
Algorithm (DCA) and apply it to the resulting DC Program, obtaining comparable
theoretical guarantees as in the set function case. The algorithm can be
applied to continuous domains via discretization. Experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms baselines in integer compressive sensing and integer
least squares.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术的发展，确保AI代理在现实世界中的安全性和规范性成为紧迫挑战，但相关领域的概念边界模糊，缺乏明确指导。

Method: 开发了一个结构化概念框架，区分对齐的目标（安全性、伦理性等）、范围（结果与执行）和选区（个体与集体）。

Result: 揭示了多种合理的对齐配置，为跨领域实践和哲学整合提供了基础，并明确了“全面对齐”的含义。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI对齐研究提供了清晰的指导，有助于解决跨领域整合的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI research make it increasingly plausible that artificial
agents with consequential real-world impact will soon operate beyond tightly
controlled environments. Ensuring that these agents are not only safe but that
they adhere to broader normative expectations is thus an urgent
interdisciplinary challenge. Multiple fields -- notably AI Safety, AI
Alignment, and Machine Ethics -- claim to contribute to this task. However, the
conceptual boundaries and interrelations among these domains remain vague,
leaving researchers without clear guidance in positioning their work.
  To address this meta-challenge, we develop a structured conceptual framework
for understanding AI alignment. Rather than focusing solely on alignment goals,
we introduce a taxonomy distinguishing the alignment aim (safety, ethicality,
legality, etc.), scope (outcome vs. execution), and constituency (individual
vs. collective). This structural approach reveals multiple legitimate alignment
configurations, providing a foundation for practical and philosophical
integration across domains, and clarifying what it might mean for an agent to
be aligned all-things-considered.

Abstract: Advances in AI portend a new era of sophisticated disinformation operations.
While individual AI systems already create convincing -- and at times
misleading -- information, an imminent development is the emergence of
malicious AI swarms. These systems can coordinate covertly, infiltrate
communities, evade traditional detectors, and run continuous A/B tests, with
round-the-clock persistence. The result can include fabricated grassroots
consensus, fragmented shared reality, mass harassment, voter micro-suppression
or mobilization, contamination of AI training data, and erosion of
institutional trust. With democratic processes worldwide increasingly
vulnerable, we urge a three-pronged response: (1) platform-side defenses --
always-on swarm-detection dashboards, pre-election high-fidelity
swarm-simulation stress-tests, transparency audits, and optional client-side
"AI shields" for users; (2) model-side safeguards -- standardized
persuasion-risk tests, provenance-authenticating passkeys, and watermarking;
and (3) system-level oversight -- a UN-backed AI Influence Observatory.

Conclusion: 为开发可靠的个性化电路分析辅导工具提供了基准，方法可推广至其他工程课程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize various
fields, including code development, robotics, finance, and education, due to
their extensive prior knowledge and rapid advancements. This paper investigates
how LLMs can be leveraged in engineering education. Specifically, we benchmark
the capabilities of different LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama
3 70B, in assessing homework for an undergraduate-level circuit analysis
course. We have developed a novel dataset consisting of official reference
solutions and real student solutions to problems from various topics in circuit
analysis. To overcome the limitations of image recognition in current
state-of-the-art LLMs, the solutions in the dataset are converted to LaTeX
format. Using this dataset, a prompt template is designed to test five metrics
of student solutions: completeness, method, final answer, arithmetic error, and
units. The results show that GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B perform significantly
better than GPT-3.5 Turbo across all five metrics, with GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B
each having distinct advantages in different evaluation aspects. Additionally,
we present insights into the limitations of current LLMs in several aspects of
circuit analysis. Given the paramount importance of ensuring reliability in
LLM-generated homework assessment to avoid misleading students, our results
establish benchmarks and offer valuable insights for the development of a
reliable, personalized tutor for circuit analysis -- a focus of our future
work. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation methods can be generalized to a
broader range of courses for engineering education in the future.

Motivation: 探究LLM在国际人道法框架下的合规性及回应质量，以推动更安全、透明的AI系统发展。

Method: 评估八种LLM对明确违反IHL的提示的拒绝能力，并分析其回应的清晰度和建设性。引入标准化安全提示以测试改进效果。

Result: 多数模型能拒绝违法请求，但回应质量参差不齐。标准化提示显著提升解释清晰度，但对复杂请求仍存在漏洞。

Conclusion: 标准化干预可有效提升LLM的合规性和透明度，但需进一步解决复杂请求的漏洞，为AI安全提供新基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across sectors, yet their
alignment with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is not well understood.
This study evaluates eight leading LLMs on their ability to refuse prompts that
explicitly violate these legal frameworks, focusing also on helpfulness - how
clearly and constructively refusals are communicated. While most models
rejected unlawful requests, the clarity and consistency of their responses
varied. By revealing the model's rationale and referencing relevant legal or
safety principles, explanatory refusals clarify the system's boundaries, reduce
ambiguity, and help prevent misuse. A standardised system-level safety prompt
significantly improved the quality of the explanations expressed within
refusals in most models, highlighting the effectiveness of lightweight
interventions. However, more complex prompts involving technical language or
requests for code revealed ongoing vulnerabilities. These findings contribute
to the development of safer, more transparent AI systems and propose a
benchmark to evaluate the compliance of LLM with IHL.

Method: 结合地理空间、社会经济、建筑和街景等多模态数据，使用LLMs生成MMI预测。

Result: 在2014年和2019年地震数据上，预测与USGS报告高度一致（相关性0.88，RMSE 0.77）。

Conclusion: LLMs在灾害影响模拟中具有潜力，可支持事前规划。

Abstract: Efficient simulation is essential for enhancing proactive preparedness for
sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) as world models show promise in simulating complex
scenarios. This study examines multiple LLMs to proactively estimate perceived
earthquake impacts. Leveraging multimodal datasets including geospatial,
socioeconomic, building, and street-level imagery data, our framework generates
Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) predictions at zip code and county scales.
Evaluations on the 2014 Napa and 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes using USGS ''Did
You Feel It? (DYFI)'' reports demonstrate significant alignment, as evidenced
by a high correlation of 0.88 and a low RMSE of 0.77 as compared to real
reports at the zip code level. Techniques such as RAG and ICL can improve
simulation performance, while visual inputs notably enhance accuracy compared
to structured numerical data alone. These findings show the promise of LLMs in
simulating disaster impacts that can help strengthen pre-event planning.

TLDR: 论文提出利用大型语言模型（LLMs）替代专家政治调查，以研究突发事件（如2025年DOGE裁员）的相关因素。通过案例研究，验证了LLMs在复制专家评分和预测目标机构方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突发事件后，专家判断受结果影响，难以还原事前认知。传统测量方法失效时，需要替代方案。

Method: 使用LLMs进行成对比较提示，生成联邦机构意识形态分数，并与专家评分对比。

Result: LLMs成功复制了裁员前的专家评分，并预测了目标机构。此外，某些机构的知识机构属性也能预测裁员目标。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为专家调查的替代方案，尤其在传统方法失效时。论文提出了使用LLMs的两部分标准。

Abstract: After a disruptive event or shock, such as the Department of Government
Efficiency (DOGE) federal layoffs of 2025, expert judgments are colored by
knowledge of the outcome. This can make it difficult or impossible to
reconstruct the pre-event perceptions needed to study the factors associated
with the event. This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast amounts of digital media data, can be a viable substitute for
expert political surveys when a shock disrupts traditional measurement. We
analyze the DOGE layoffs as a specific case study for this position. We use
pairwise comparison prompts with LLMs and derive ideology scores for federal
executive agencies. These scores replicate pre-layoff expert measures and
predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE. We also use this same approach
and find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge
institutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when
controlling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows
us to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the
shock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs
offer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional
measurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for
when researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys.

Abstract: The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the
labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency,
and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the
evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel
auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to
automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological
capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to
capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a
shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using
this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S.
Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain
workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks
spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological
capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation "Green Light"
Zone, Automation "Red Light" Zone, R&D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone.
This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development.
Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse
HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for
human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent
integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from
information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the
importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing
workers for evolving workplace dynamics.

Conclusion: 研究推动了从表面模仿到模拟思维的生成代理发展，为更可靠的社会模拟提供了新方向。

Abstract: Simulating society with large language models (LLMs), we argue, requires more
than generating plausible behavior -- it demands cognitively grounded reasoning
that is structured, revisable, and traceable. LLM-based agents are increasingly
used to emulate individual and group behavior -- primarily through prompting
and supervised fine-tuning. Yet they often lack internal coherence, causal
reasoning, and belief traceability -- making them unreliable for analyzing how
people reason, deliberate, or respond to interventions.
  To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds
(GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief
representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the
RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess
reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and
intervention consistency. These contributions advance a broader shift: from
surface-level mimicry to generative agents that simulate thought -- not just
language -- for social simulations.

Conclusion: LLMs适合辅助初步评审，但需人类监督以确保深度经济推理的准确性。

Abstract: This paper investigates Large Language Models (LLMs) ability to assess the
economic soundness and theoretical consistency of empirical findings in spatial
econometrics. We created original and deliberately altered "counterfactual"
summaries from 28 published papers (2005-2024), which were evaluated by a
diverse set of LLMs. The LLMs provided qualitative assessments and structured
binary classifications on variable choice, coefficient plausibility, and
publication suitability. The results indicate that while LLMs can expertly
assess the coherence of variable choices (with top models like GPT-4o achieving
an overall F1 score of 0.87), their performance varies significantly when
evaluating deeper aspects such as coefficient plausibility and overall
publication suitability. The results further revealed that the choice of LLM,
the specific characteristics of the paper and the interaction between these two
factors significantly influence the accuracy of the assessment, particularly
for nuanced judgments. These findings highlight LLMs' current strengths in
assisting with initial, more surface-level checks and their limitations in
performing comprehensive, deep economic reasoning, suggesting a potential
assistive role in peer review that still necessitates robust human oversight.
