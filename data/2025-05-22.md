### [1] [Efficient Privacy-Preserving Cross-Silo Federated Learning with Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14797)
*Abdullah Al Omar,Xin Yang,Euijin Choo,Omid Ardakanian*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: MASER是一种基于多密钥同态加密的高效隐私保护联邦学习框架，通过模型剪枝和切片技术显著降低了计算和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习易受隐私攻击，现有基于多密钥同态加密的方法因高开销难以实际部署。

Method: 结合共识模型剪枝和切片技术，优化计算和通信效率。

Result: MASER比现有方法效率高3.03至8.29倍，同时保持与标准联邦学习相当的分类精度。

Conclusion: MASER在隐私、准确性和效率之间取得了良好平衡，适用于IID和非IID场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is susceptible to privacy attacks, such as data
reconstruction attacks, in which a semi-honest server or a malicious client
infers information about other clients' datasets from their model updates or
gradients. To enhance the privacy of FL, recent studies combined Multi-Key
Homomorphic Encryption (MKHE) and FL, making it possible to aggregate the
encrypted model updates using different keys without having to decrypt them.
Despite the privacy guarantees of MKHE, existing approaches are not well-suited
for real-world deployment due to their high computation and communication
overhead. We propose MASER, an efficient MKHE-based Privacy-Preserving FL
framework that combines consensus-based model pruning and slicing techniques to
reduce this overhead. Our experimental results show that MASER is 3.03 to 8.29
times more efficient than existing MKHE-based FL approaches in terms of
computation and communication overhead while maintaining comparable
classification accuracy to standard FL algorithms. Compared to a vanilla FL
algorithm, the overhead of MASER is only 1.48 to 5 times higher, striking a
good balance between privacy, accuracy, and efficiency in both IID and non-IID
settings.

### [3] [On the (in)security of Proofs-of-Space based Longest-Chain Blockchains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14891)
*Mirza Ahad Baig,Krzysztof Pietrzak*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文探讨了基于PoSpace的区块链在动态可用性下的安全性问题，证明了没有额外假设时不存在安全协议，并量化了双花攻击所需的分叉长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PoSpace作为PoW的可持续替代方案，但发现其在动态可用性下缺乏安全的长链区块链协议。

Method: 通过安全游戏分析，量化敌手能力与分叉长度的关系，提出链选择规则。

Result: 证明敌手可创建长度为φ²·ρ/ε的分叉，并给出匹配上界的链选择规则。

Conclusion: 无额外假设时，PoSpace无法在动态可用性下实现安全的长链区块链。

Abstract: The Nakamoto consensus protocol underlying the Bitcoin blockchain uses proof
of work as a voting mechanism. Honest miners who contribute hashing power
towards securing the chain try to extend the longest chain they are aware of.
Despite its simplicity, Nakamoto consensus achieves meaningful security
guarantees assuming that at any point in time, a majority of the hashing power
is controlled by honest parties. This also holds under ``resource
variability'', i.e., if the total hashing power varies greatly over time.
  Proofs of space (PoSpace) have been suggested as a more sustainable
replacement for proofs of work. Unfortunately, no construction of a
``longest-chain'' blockchain based on PoSpace, that is secure under dynamic
availability, is known. In this work, we prove that without additional
assumptions no such protocol exists. We exactly quantify this impossibility
result by proving a bound on the length of the fork required for double
spending as a function of the adversarial capabilities. This bound holds for
any chain selection rule, and we also show a chain selection rule (albeit a
very strange one) that almost matches this bound.
  Concretely, we consider a security game in which the honest parties at any
point control $\phi>1$ times more space than the adversary. The adversary can
change the honest space by a factor $1\pm \varepsilon$ with every block
(dynamic availability), and ``replotting'' the space takes as much time as
$\rho$ blocks.
  We prove that no matter what chain selection rule is used, in this game the
adversary can create a fork of length $\phi^2\cdot \rho / \varepsilon$ that
will be picked as the winner by the chain selection rule.
  We also provide an upper bound that matches the lower bound up to a factor
$\phi$. There exists a chain selection rule which in the above game requires
forks of length at least $\phi\cdot \rho / \varepsilon$.

### [4] [Topology-aware Detection and Localization of Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks in Network-on-Chips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14898)
*Hansika Weerasena,Xiaoguo Jia,Prabhat Mishra*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的框架，用于在网络芯片（NoC）中检测和定位分布式拒绝服务（DDoS）攻击，通过分析时空流量特征实现高精度检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代SoC设计中，NoC作为共享通信结构面临多种安全威胁，尤其是DDoS攻击，其分布式特性和动态流量模式使得传统静态检测方法难以应对。

Method: 将NoC建模为图，利用GNN直接分析原始流量数据，学习复杂流量依赖关系，无需人工干预或手工特征提取。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种攻击策略下检测和定位DDoS攻击的准确率高达99%，且在不同恶意IP数量、位置、流量负载和架构配置下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来SoC设计提供了可扩展、灵活且架构无关的防御机制，显著提升了芯片通信的可用性和可信度。

Abstract: Network-on-Chip (NoC) enables on-chip communication between diverse cores in
modern System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. With its shared communication fabric, NoC
has become a focal point for various security threats, especially in
heterogeneous and high-performance computing platforms. Among these attacks,
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks occur when multiple malicious
entities collaborate to overwhelm and disrupt access to critical system
components, potentially causing severe performance degradation or complete
disruption of services. These attacks are particularly challenging to detect
due to their distributed nature and dynamic traffic patterns in NoC, which
often evade static detection rules or simple profiling. This paper presents a
framework to conduct topology-aware detection and localization of DDoS attacks
using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by analyzing NoC traffic patterns.
Specifically, by modeling the NoC as a graph, our method utilizes
spatiotemporal traffic features to effectively identify and localize DDoS
attacks. Unlike prior works that rely on handcrafted features or
threshold-based detection, our GNN-based approach operates directly on raw
inter-flit delay data, learning complex traffic dependencies without manual
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can detect and
localize DDoS attacks with high accuracy (up to 99\%) while maintaining
consistent performance under diverse attack strategies. Furthermore, the
proposed method exhibits strong robustness across varying numbers and
placements of malicious IPs, different packet injection rates, application
workloads, and architectural configurations, including both 2D mesh and 3D
TSV-based NoCs. Our work provides a scalable, flexible, and
architecture-agnostic defense mechanism, significantly improving the
availability and trustworthiness of on-chip communication in future SoC
designs.

### [5] [PsyScam: A Benchmark for Psychological Techniques in Real-World Scams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15017)
*Shang Ma,Tianyi Ma,Jiahao Liu,Wei Song,Zhenkai Liang,Xusheng Xiao,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: PsyScam是一个新的基准，旨在系统化捕捉和评估真实世界诈骗报告中嵌入的心理技巧（PTs），填补现有研究的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未能充分反映真实诈骗中的心理技巧，PsyScam旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过收集六个公共平台的诈骗报告，并基于认知和心理理论进行标注，构建PsyScam基准。

Result: 实验表明，PsyScam在检测和生成基于PTs的诈骗内容方面对现有模型提出了显著挑战。

Conclusion: PsyScam通过结合心理学和网络安全分析，为研究诈骗行为提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Online scams have become increasingly prevalent, with scammers using
psychological techniques (PTs) to manipulate victims. While existing research
has developed benchmarks to study scammer behaviors, these benchmarks do not
adequately reflect the PTs observed in real-world scams. To fill this gap, we
introduce PsyScam, a benchmark designed to systematically capture and evaluate
PTs embedded in real-world scam reports. In particular, PsyScam bridges
psychology and real-world cyber security analysis through collecting a wide
range of scam reports from six public platforms and grounding its annotations
in well-established cognitive and psychological theories. We further
demonstrate PsyScam's utility through three downstream tasks: PT
classification, scam completion, and scam augmentation. Experimental results
show that PsyScam presents significant challenges to existing models in both
detecting and generating scam content based on the PTs used by real-world
scammers. Our code and dataset are available at:

### [6] [An Empirical Analysis of EOS Blockchain: Architecture, Contract, and Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15051)
*Haiyang Liu,Yingjie Mao,Xiaoqi Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文对EOS区块链进行了全面研究，涵盖系统架构、去中心化、性能、智能合约和行为安全五个维度，揭示了其存在的问题和潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EOS作为区块链3.0的代表，学术研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 从五个维度分析EOS，包括系统架构、去中心化、性能、智能合约和行为安全，并基于XBlock平台数据进行评估。

Result: 发现EOS存在账户活跃度低、超级节点选举参与有限、性能与宣传差距大等问题，并识别了智能合约漏洞和实际攻击案例。

Conclusion: 研究为EOS的发展和安全机制改进提供了重要参考。

Abstract: With the rapid development of blockchain technology, various blockchain
systems are exhibiting vitality and potential. As a representative of
Blockchain 3.0, the EOS blockchain has been regarded as a strong competitor to
Ethereum. Nevertheless, compared with Bitcoin and Ethereum, academic research
and in-depth analyses of EOS remain scarce. To address this gap, this study
conducts a comprehensive investigation of the EOS blockchain from five key
dimensions: system architecture, decentralization, performance, smart
contracts, and behavioral security. The architectural analysis focuses on six
core components of the EOS system, detailing their functionalities and
operational workflows. The decentralization and performance evaluations, based
on data from the XBlock data-sharing platform, reveal several critical issues:
low account activity, limited participation in the supernode election process,
minimal variation in the set of block producers, and a substantial gap between
actual throughput and the claimed million-level performance. Five types of
contract vulnerabilities are identified in the smart contract dimension, and
four mainstream vulnerability detection platforms are introduced and
comparatively analyzed. In terms of behavioral security, four real-world
attacks targeting the structural characteristics of EOS are summarized. This
study contributes to the ongoing development of the EOS blockchain and provides
valuable insights for enhancing the security and regulatory mechanisms of
blockchain ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MPC与机器学习的结合，以解决隐私保护协作学习中的挑战，推动安全高效的计算解决方案。

Method: 通过调查现有文献，分析MPC在机器学习中的应用，包括专用软件框架、领域特定语言和加密协议。

Result: MPC与机器学习的结合显著提升了隐私保护能力，支持多方协作学习而不泄露敏感数据。

Conclusion: MPC在隐私敏感行业中具有巨大潜力，为安全高效的计算解决方案提供了重要进展。

Abstract: In this survey, we will explore the interaction between secure multiparty
computation and the area of machine learning. Recent advances in secure
multiparty computation (MPC) have significantly improved its applicability in
the realm of machine learning (ML), offering robust solutions for
privacy-preserving collaborative learning. This review explores key
contributions that leverage MPC to enable multiple parties to engage in ML
tasks without compromising the privacy of their data. The integration of MPC
with ML frameworks facilitates the training and evaluation of models on
combined datasets from various sources, ensuring that sensitive information
remains encrypted throughout the process. Innovations such as specialized
software frameworks and domain-specific languages streamline the adoption of
MPC in ML, optimizing performance and broadening its usage. These frameworks
address both semi-honest and malicious threat models, incorporating features
such as automated optimizations and cryptographic auditing to ensure compliance
and data integrity. The collective insights from these studies highlight MPC's
potential in fostering collaborative yet confidential data analysis, marking a
significant stride towards the realization of secure and efficient
computational solutions in privacy-sensitive industries. This paper
investigates a spectrum of SecureML libraries that includes cryptographic
protocols, federated learning frameworks, and privacy-preserving algorithms. By
surveying the existing literature, this paper aims to examine the efficacy of
these libraries in preserving data privacy, ensuring model confidentiality, and
fortifying ML systems against adversarial attacks. Additionally, the study
explores an innovative application domain for SecureML techniques: the
integration of these methodologies in gaming environments utilizing ML.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种隐私保护的社交化推荐协议，利用社交网络信息提升推荐质量，同时保护用户隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户偏好可能泄露敏感信息，需保护隐私。

Method: 通过计算用户相似性确定潜在关系和兴趣，防止隐私泄露给第三方。

Result: 安全分析和实验结果表明方案性能优异，适用于实际应用。

Conclusion: 该方案在保护隐私的同时提升了推荐质量，具有实际可行性。

Abstract: Recommendation as a service has improved the quality of our lives and plays a
significant role in variant aspects. However, the preference of users may
reveal some sensitive information, so that the protection of privacy is
required. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving, socialized,
recommendation protocol that introduces information collected from online
social networks to enhance the quality of the recommendation. The proposed
scheme can calculate the similarity between users to determine their potential
relationships and interests, and it also can protect the users' privacy from
leaking to an untrusted third party. The security analysis and experimental
results showed that our proposed scheme provides excellent performance and is
feasible for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了首个框架BountyBench，用于评估AI代理在网络安全中的攻防能力，通过25个真实系统测试了5种AI代理在漏洞检测、利用和修补任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI代理如何改变网络安全格局，并量化其在攻防任务中的能力。

Method: 构建BountyBench框架，定义三种任务类型（Detect、Exploit、Patch），并在25个真实系统中测试5种AI代理的表现。

Result: Claude Code和OpenAI Codex CLI在防御任务中表现较好，而自定义代理在攻防任务中表现均衡。

Conclusion: AI代理在网络安全中具备潜力，但不同代理在不同任务中表现差异显著。

Abstract: AI agents have the potential to significantly alter the cybersecurity
landscape. To help us understand this change, we introduce the first framework
to capture offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world
systems. Instantiating this framework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems
with complex, real-world codebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we
define three task types: Detect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit
(exploiting a specific vulnerability), and Patch (patching a specific
vulnerability). For Detect, we construct a new success indicator, which is
general across vulnerability types and provides localized evaluation. We
manually set up the environment for each system, including installing packages,
setting up server(s), and hydrating database(s). We add 40 bug bounties, which
are vulnerabilities with monetary awards from \$10 to \$30,485, and cover 9 of
the OWASP Top 10 Risks. To modulate task difficulty, we devise a new strategy
based on information to guide detection, interpolating from identifying a zero
day to exploiting a specific vulnerability. We evaluate 5 agents: Claude Code,
OpenAI Codex CLI, and custom agents with GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and
Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking. Given up to three attempts, the top-performing
agents are Claude Code (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,350), Custom Agent with
Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,025; 67.5% on
Exploit), and OpenAI Codex CLI (5% on Detect, mapping to \$2,400; 90% on Patch,
mapping to \$14,422). OpenAI Codex CLI and Claude Code are more capable at
defense, achieving higher Patch scores of 90% and 87.5%, compared to Exploit
scores of 32.5% and 57.5% respectively; in contrast, the custom agents are
relatively balanced between offense and defense, achieving Exploit scores of
40-67.5% and Patch scores of 45-60%.

### [10] [Adaptive Plan-Execute Framework for Smart Contract Security Auditing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15242)
*Zhiyuan Wei,Jing Sun,Zijian Zhang,Zhe Hou,Zixiao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: SmartAuditFlow是一个动态规划和执行框架，用于智能合约安全分析，通过动态调整审计计划和结构化执行，显著提高了漏洞检测的准确性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能合约审计方法存在幻觉和上下文感知不足的问题，需要更灵活和精确的解决方案。

Method: 采用Plan-Execute框架，动态生成和优化审计计划，结合迭代提示优化和外部知识源（如静态分析工具和RAG）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，100%准确检测常见和关键漏洞，41.2%覆盖已知弱点，并成功识别所有13个测试CVE。

Conclusion: SmartAuditFlow在自动化智能合约审计中展现出卓越的适应性、成本效益和准确性，优于传统方法和现有LLM方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in code analysis and
auditing; however, they still struggle with hallucinations and limited
context-aware reasoning. We introduce SmartAuditFlow, a novel Plan-Execute
framework that enhances smart contract security analysis through dynamic audit
planning and structured execution. Unlike conventional LLM-based auditing
approaches that follow fixed workflows and predefined steps, SmartAuditFlow
dynamically generates and refines audit plans based on the unique
characteristics of each smart contract. It continuously adjusts its auditing
strategy in response to intermediate LLM outputs and newly detected
vulnerabilities, ensuring a more adaptive and precise security assessment. The
framework then executes these plans step by step, applying a structured
reasoning process to enhance vulnerability detection accuracy while minimizing
hallucinations and false positives. To further improve audit precision,
SmartAuditFlow integrates iterative prompt optimization and external knowledge
sources, such as static analysis tools and Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). This ensures audit decisions are contextually informed and backed by
real-world security knowledge, producing comprehensive security reports.
Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
SmartAuditFlow outperforms existing methods, achieving 100 percent accuracy on
common and critical vulnerabilities, 41.2 percent accuracy for comprehensive
coverage of known smart contract weaknesses in real-world projects, and
successfully identifying all 13 tested CVEs. These results highlight
SmartAuditFlow's scalability, cost-effectiveness, and superior adaptability
over traditional static analysis tools and contemporary LLM-based approaches,
establishing it as a robust solution for automated smart contract auditing.

### [11] [An Efficient Private GPT Never Autoregressively Decodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15252)
*Zhengyi Li,Yue Guan,Kang Yang,Yu Feng,Ning Liu,Yu Yu,Jingwen Leng,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种结合公开解码和安全验证的方法，以加速GPT的安全推理，同时保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GPT部署中的隐私问题，同时减少加密原语带来的性能开销。

Method: 使用公开GPT模型生成令牌，并通过私有模型安全验证，优化采样协议和模型对齐。

Result: 实验显示速度提升2.1至6.0倍，隐私和生成质量与标准安全解码相同。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持隐私和质量的同时显著提升了安全解码效率。

Abstract: The wide deployment of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) has
raised privacy concerns for both clients and servers. While cryptographic
primitives can be employed for secure GPT inference to protect the privacy of
both parties, they introduce considerable performance overhead.To accelerate
secure inference, this study proposes a public decoding and secure verification
approach that utilizes public GPT models, motivated by the observation that
securely decoding one and multiple tokens takes a similar latency. The client
uses the public model to generate a set of tokens, which are then securely
verified by the private model for acceptance. The efficiency of our approach
depends on the acceptance ratio of tokens proposed by the public model, which
we improve from two aspects: (1) a private sampling protocol optimized for
cryptographic primitives and (2) model alignment using knowledge distillation.
Our approach improves the efficiency of secure decoding while maintaining the
same level of privacy and generation quality as standard secure decoding.
Experiments demonstrate a $2.1\times \sim 6.0\times$ speedup compared to
standard decoding across three pairs of public-private models and different
network conditions.

*Anas Ali,Mubashar Husain,Peter Hans*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种结合联邦学习和区块链的隐私保护入侵检测框架（FL-BCID），用于工业物联网（IIoT）环境，解决了传统集中式入侵检测系统的隐私、延迟和单点故障问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网系统的广泛连接带来了严重的网络安全威胁，传统集中式入侵检测系统存在隐私泄露、高延迟和单点故障等缺陷。

Method: 结合联邦学习（FL）实现去中心化模型训练，利用区块链技术确保数据完整性、信任和防篡改性，设计轻量级入侵检测模型并通过智能合约记录模型更新和异常分数。

Result: 实验结果表明，FL-BCID在ToN-IoT和N-BaIoT数据集上达到97.3%的准确率，通信开销比集中式方法减少41%。

Conclusion: FL-BCID框架为现代IIoT安全架构提供了隐私保护、可扩展性和鲁棒性，是增强信任和隐私的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems have become integral to smart
manufacturing, yet their growing connectivity has also exposed them to
significant cybersecurity threats. Traditional intrusion detection systems
(IDS) often rely on centralized architectures that raise concerns over data
privacy, latency, and single points of failure. In this work, we propose a
novel Federated Learning-Enhanced Blockchain Framework (FL-BCID) for
privacy-preserving intrusion detection tailored for IIoT environments. Our
architecture combines federated learning (FL) to ensure decentralized model
training with blockchain technology to guarantee data integrity, trust, and
tamper resistance across IIoT nodes. We design a lightweight intrusion
detection model collaboratively trained using FL across edge devices without
exposing sensitive data. A smart contract-enabled blockchain system records
model updates and anomaly scores to establish accountability. Experimental
evaluations using the ToN-IoT and N-BaIoT datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our framework, achieving 97.3% accuracy while reducing
communication overhead by 41% compared to baseline centralized methods. Our
approach ensures privacy, scalability, and robustness-critical for secure
industrial operations. The proposed FL-BCID system provides a promising
solution for enhancing trust and privacy in modern IIoT security architectures.

*Anas Ali,Mubashar Husain,Peter Hans*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种基于行为分析和深度证据聚类的新型框架，用于实时检测内部威胁，显著减少误报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全机制难以识别内部威胁，需要更智能、适应性强的检测方法。

Method: 结合行为分析和深度证据聚类模型，动态适应用户行为变化。

Result: 在CERT和TWOS数据集上平均检测准确率达94.7%，误报减少38%。

Conclusion: 该框架为部署智能、自适应的内部威胁检测系统提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Insider threats represent one of the most critical challenges in modern
cybersecurity. These threats arise from individuals within an organization who
misuse their legitimate access to harm the organization's assets, data, or
operations. Traditional security mechanisms, primarily designed for external
attackers, fall short in identifying these subtle and context-aware threats. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework for real-time detection of insider
threats using behavioral analytics combined with deep evidential clustering.
Our system captures and analyzes user activities, applies context-rich
behavioral features, and classifies potential threats using a deep evidential
clustering model that estimates both cluster assignment and epistemic
uncertainty. The proposed model dynamically adapts to behavioral changes and
significantly reduces false positives. We evaluate our framework on benchmark
insider threat datasets such as CERT and TWOS, achieving an average detection
accuracy of 94.7% and a 38% reduction in false positives compared to
traditional clustering methods. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty modeling in threat detection pipelines. This research
provides actionable insights for deploying intelligent, adaptive, and robust
insider threat detection systems across various enterprise environments.

Result: 实验表明，IKEA在提取效率和攻击成功率上分别超过基线方法80%和90%，且构建的替代RAG系统性能更优。

Conclusion: IKEA揭示了RAG系统存在的重大隐私风险，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge bases, but they are vulnerable to
privacy risks from data extraction attacks. Existing extraction methods
typically rely on malicious inputs such as prompt injection or jailbreaking,
making them easily detectable via input- or output-level detection. In this
paper, we introduce Implicit Knowledge Extraction Attack (IKEA), which conducts
knowledge extraction on RAG systems through benign queries. IKEA first
leverages anchor concepts to generate queries with the natural appearance, and
then designs two mechanisms to lead to anchor concept thoroughly 'explore' the
RAG's privacy knowledge: (1) Experience Reflection Sampling, which samples
anchor concepts based on past query-response patterns to ensure the queries'
relevance to RAG documents; (2) Trust Region Directed Mutation, which
iteratively mutates anchor concepts under similarity constraints to further
exploit the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate IKEA's
effectiveness under various defenses, surpassing baselines by over 80% in
extraction efficiency and 90% in attack success rate. Moreover, the substitute
RAG system built from IKEA's extractions consistently outperforms those based
on baseline methods across multiple evaluation tasks, underscoring the
significant privacy risk in RAG systems.

Abstract: Numerical data with bounded domains is a common data type in personal
devices, such as wearable sensors. While the collection of such data is
essential for third-party platforms, it raises significant privacy concerns.
Local differential privacy (LDP) has been shown as a framework providing
provable individual privacy, even when the third-party platform is untrusted.
For numerical data with bounded domains, existing state-of-the-art LDP
mechanisms are piecewise-based mechanisms, which are not optimal, leading to
reduced data utility.
  This paper investigates the optimal design of piecewise-based mechanisms to
maximize data utility under LDP. We demonstrate that existing piecewise-based
mechanisms are heuristic forms of the $3$-piecewise mechanism, which is far
from enough to study optimality. We generalize the $3$-piecewise mechanism to
its most general form, i.e. $m$-piecewise mechanism with no pre-defined form of
each piece. Under this form, we derive the closed-form optimal mechanism by
combining analytical proofs and off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Next, we
extend the generalized piecewise-based mechanism to the circular domain (along
with the classical domain), defined on a cyclic range where the distance
between the two endpoints is zero. By incorporating this property, we design
the optimal mechanism for the circular domain, achieving significantly improved
data utility compared with existing mechanisms.
  Our proposed mechanisms guarantee optimal data utility under LDP among all
generalized piecewise-based mechanisms. We show that they also achieve optimal
data utility in two common applications of LDP: distribution estimation and
mean estimation. Theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations prove and
validate the data utility advantages of our proposed mechanisms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闪电网络用于比特币支付通道，但其复杂性使得安全性难以评估，需通过形式化方法验证。

Method: 使用TLA+形式化协议，并通过时间模型抽象和单通道/多跳支付分离两步细化步骤，减少状态空间。

Result: 模型检查成功验证了最多四跳和两笔并发支付的闪电网络安全性。

Conclusion: 当前闪电网络规范是安全的，形式化验证方法可行。

Abstract: Payment channel networks are an approach to improve the scalability of
blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. The Lightning Network is a payment channel
network built for Bitcoin that is already used in practice. Because the
Lightning Network is used for transfer of financial value, its security in the
presence of adversarial participants should be verified. The Lightning
protocol's complexity makes it hard to assess whether the protocol is secure.
To enable computer-aided security verification of Lightning, we formalize the
protocol in TLA+ and formally specify the security property that honest users
are guaranteed to retrieve their correct balance. While model checking provides
a fully automated verification of the security property, the state space of the
protocol's specification is so large that model checking becomes unfeasible. We
make model checking the Lightning Network possible using two refinement steps
that we verify using proofs. In a first step, we prove that the model of time
used in the protocol can be abstracted using ideas from the research of timed
automata. In a second step, we prove that it suffices to model check the
protocol for single payment channels and the protocol for multi-hop payments
separately. These refinements reduce the state space sufficiently to allow for
model checking Lightning with models with payments over up to four hops and two
concurrent payments. These results indicate that the current specification of
Lightning is secure.

Result: 该方法在多种防御和模型上高效有效，甚至发现通用对抗后缀。

Conclusion: 当前对齐防御方法脆弱，需考虑更强威胁模型以确保LLM安全。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in real-world applications
ranging from chatbots to agentic systems. Alignment is one of the main
approaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and
jailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even
against Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates
adversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search
space over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding
successful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to
local minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we
assess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed
threat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment
process. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the
intermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting
as a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly
effective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show
our informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show
a gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack
performance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to
successfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective
across diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs,
effective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses,
that these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit
alignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together,
our results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and
the need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，SCR能有效防御已知和新兴的越狱攻击，表现优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: SCR为LLM安全提供了一种新的可扩展且鲁棒的防御范式，代码将在发表后公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking
attacks, wherein adversaries exploit carefully engineered prompts to induce
harmful or unethical responses. Such threats have raised critical concerns
about the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world deployment. While
existing defense mechanisms partially mitigate such risks, subsequent
advancements in adversarial techniques have enabled novel jailbreaking methods
to circumvent these protections, exposing the limitations of static defense
frameworks. In this work, we explore defending against evolving jailbreaking
threats through the lens of context retrieval. First, we conduct a preliminary
study demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against
a particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack
pattern. Building on this insight, we further leverage the retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) techniques and propose Safety Context Retrieval (SCR), a
scalable and robust safeguarding paradigm for LLMs against jailbreaking. Our
comprehensive experiments demonstrate how SCR achieves superior defensive
performance against both established and emerging jailbreaking tactics,
contributing a new paradigm to LLM safety. Our code will be available upon
publication.

Abstract: Voting is a cornerstone of democracy, allowing citizens to express their will
and make collective decisions. With advancing technology, online voting is
gaining popularity as it enables voting from anywhere with Internet access,
eliminating the need for printed ballots or polling stations. However, despite
its benefits, online voting carries significant risks. A single vulnerability
could be exploited to manipulate elections on a large scale. Centralized
systems can be secure but may lack transparency and confidentiality, especially
if those in power manipulate them. Blockchain-based voting offers a
transparent, tamper-resistant alternative with end-to-end verifiability and
strong security. Adding cryptographic layers can also ensure voter
confidentiality.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new class of neural network operators designed

this work, we introduce a new class of neural network operators designed to
handle problems where memory effects and randomness play a central role. These
operators merge symmetrized activation functions, Caputo-type fractional
derivatives, and stochastic perturbations introduced via It\^o type noise. The
result is a powerful framework capable of approximating functions that evolve
over time with both long-term memory and uncertain dynamics. We develop the
mathematical foundations of these operators, proving three key theorems of
Voronovskaya type. These results describe the asymptotic behavior of the
operators, their convergence in the mean-square sense, and their consistency
under fractional regularity assumptions. All estimates explicitly account for
the influence of the memory parameter $\alpha$ and the noise level $\sigma$. As
a practical application, we apply the proposed theory to the fractional
Navier-Stokes equations with stochastic forcing, a model often used to describe
turbulence in fluid flows with memory. Our approach provides theoretical
guarantees for the approximation quality and suggests that these neural
operators can serve as effective tools in the analysis and simulation of
complex systems. By blending ideas from neural networks, fractional calculus,
and stochastic analysis, this research opens new perspectives for modeling
turbulent phenomena and other multiscale processes where memory and randomness
are fundamental. The results lay the groundwork for hybrid learning-based
methods with strong analytical backing.

Abstract: Scaling large language models (LLMs) has driven significant advancements, yet
it faces diminishing returns and escalating energy demands. This work
introduces test-time compute (TTC)-allocating additional computational
resources during inference-as a compelling complement to conventional scaling
strategies. Specifically, we investigate whether employing TTC can achieve
superior accuracy-energy trade-offs compared to simply increasing model size.
Our empirical analysis reveals that TTC surpasses traditional model scaling in
accuracy/energy efficiency, with notable gains in tasks demanding complex
reasoning rather than mere factual recall. Further, we identify a critical
interaction between TTC performance and output sequence length, demonstrating
that strategically adjusting compute resources at inference time according to
query complexity can substantially enhance efficiency. Our findings advocate
for TTC as a promising direction, enabling more sustainable, accurate, and
adaptable deployment of future language models without incurring additional
pretraining costs.

Result: LMHR在平均预测范围上优于典型STGNN 10.72%，在多个数据集上优于SOTA方法4.12%。

Conclusion: LMHR有效捕捉长时空依赖，显著提升预测精度，尤其在快速变化模式上表现突出。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting has a wide range of applications
in both industry and academia. Recent advances in Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural
Network (STGNN) have achieved great progress in modelling spatial-temporal
correlations. Limited by computational complexity, most STGNNs for MTS
forecasting focus primarily on short-term and local spatial-temporal
dependencies. Although some recent methods attempt to incorporate univariate
history into modeling, they still overlook crucial long-term spatial-temporal
similarities and correlations across MTS, which are essential for accurate
forecasting. To fill this gap, we propose a framework called the Long-term
Multivariate History Representation (LMHR) Enhanced STGNN for MTS forecasting.
Specifically, a Long-term History Encoder (LHEncoder) is adopted to effectively
encode the long-term history into segment-level contextual representations and
reduce point-level noise. A non-parametric Hierarchical Representation
Retriever (HRetriever) is designed to include the spatial information in the
long-term spatial-temporal dependency modelling and pick out the most valuable
representations with no additional training. A Transformer-based Aggregator
(TAggregator) selectively fuses the sparsely retrieved contextual
representations based on the ranking positional embedding efficiently.
Experimental results demonstrate that LMHR outperforms typical STGNNs by 10.72%
on the average prediction horizons and state-of-the-art methods by 4.12% on
several real-world datasets. Additionally, it consistently improves prediction
accuracy by 9.8% on the top 10% of rapidly changing patterns across the
datasets.

Motivation: 由于去噪扩散概率模型在生成合成传感器信号时存在随机性和损失函数的局限性，难以评估生成数据的质量，因此需要改进相似性度量方法。

Method: 研究并改进了多种相似性度量方法，通过监控训练和合成过程，优化了损失函数，并使其适应分类任务需求。

Result: 显著减少了训练周期，同时未降低分类任务的性能，节省了资源和时间。

Conclusion: 改进的相似性度量方法有效优化了生成模型的训练过程，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are able to generate synthetic
sensor signals. The training process of such a model is controlled by a loss
function which measures the difference between the noise that was added in the
forward process and the noise that was predicted by the diffusion model. This
enables the generation of realistic data. However, the randomness within the
process and the loss function itself makes it difficult to estimate the quality
of the data. Therefore, we examine multiple similarity metrics and adapt an
existing metric to overcome this issue by monitoring the training and
synthetisation process using those metrics. The adapted metric can even be
fine-tuned on the input data to comply with the requirements of an underlying
classification task. We were able to significantly reduce the amount of
training epochs without a performance reduction in the classification task. An
optimized training process not only saves resources, but also reduces the time
for training generative models.

Conclusion: ParaStep是一种可扩展且通信高效的解决方案，特别适用于带宽受限环境中的扩散模型推理加速。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models across
various modalities, including image, video, and audio synthesis. However, their
deployment is often limited by significant inference latency, primarily due to
the inherently sequential nature of the denoising process. While existing
parallelization strategies attempt to accelerate inference by distributing
computation across multiple devices, they typically incur high communication
overhead, hindering deployment on commercial hardware. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{ParaStep}, a novel parallelization method based
on a reuse-then-predict mechanism that parallelizes diffusion inference by
exploiting similarity between adjacent denoising steps. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on layer-wise or stage-wise communication, ParaStep employs
lightweight, step-wise communication, substantially reducing overhead. ParaStep
achieves end-to-end speedups of up to \textbf{3.88}$\times$ on SVD,
\textbf{2.43}$\times$ on CogVideoX-2b, and \textbf{6.56}$\times$ on
AudioLDM2-large, while maintaining generation quality. These results highlight
ParaStep as a scalable and communication-efficient solution for accelerating
diffusion inference, particularly in bandwidth-constrained environments.

Conclusion: Quaff通过高效、性能和可部署性的平衡，使消费级GPU微调成为可能，推动了个性化LLM部署的普及。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made exciting achievements across various
domains, yet their deployment on resource-constrained personal devices remains
hindered by the prohibitive computational and memory demands of task-specific
fine-tuning. While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing
methods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high
computational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers, a
critical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
propose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH): During fine-tuning,
certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across
training iterations. Building on OSSH, we propose Quaff, a Quantized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision
activation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically
suppresses outliers exclusively in invariant channels using lightweight
operations, eliminating full-precision weight storage and global rescaling
while reducing quantization errors. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks
validate OSSH and demonstrate Quaff's efficacy. Specifically, on the GPQA
reasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves a 1.73x latency reduction and 30% memory
savings over full-precision fine-tuning while improving accuracy by 0.6% on the
Phi-3 model, reconciling the triple trade-off between efficiency, performance,
and deployability. By enabling consumer-grade GPU fine-tuning (e.g., RTX 2080
Super) without sacrificing model utility, Quaff democratizes personalized LLM
deployment. The code is available at https://github.com/Little0o0/Quaff.git.

Abstract: Composites are amongst the most important materials manufactured today, as
evidenced by their use in countless applications. In order to establish the
suitability of composites in specific applications, finite element (FE)
modelling, a numerical method based on partial differential equations, is the
industry standard for assessing their mechanical properties. However, FE
modelling is exceptionally costly from a computational viewpoint, a limitation
which has led to efforts towards applying AI models to this task. However, in
these approaches: the chosen model architectures were rudimentary, feed-forward
neural networks giving limited accuracy; the studies focus on predicting
elastic mechanical properties, without considering material strength limits;
and the models lacked transparency, hindering trustworthiness by users. In this
paper, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) equipped with methods
from explainable AI (XAI) can be successfully deployed to solve this problem.
Our approach uses customised CNNs trained on a dataset we generate using
transverse tension tests in FE modelling to predict composites' mechanical
properties, i.e., Young's modulus and yield strength. We show empirically that
our approach achieves high accuracy, outperforming a baseline, ResNet-34, in
estimating the mechanical properties. We then use SHAP and Integrated
Gradients, two post-hoc XAI methods, to explain the predictions, showing that
the CNNs use the critical geometrical features that influence the composites'
behaviour, thus allowing engineers to verify that the models are trustworthy by
representing the science of composites.

Conclusion: CoCa-sampling通过整合节点合作关系提升了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: GraphSAGE is a widely used graph neural network. The introduction of causal
inference has improved its robust performance and named as Causal GraphSAGE.
However, Causal GraphSAGE focuses on measuring causal weighting among
individual nodes, but neglecting the cooperative relationships among sampling
nodes as a whole. To address this issue, this paper proposes Cooperative Causal
GraphSAGE (CoCa-GraphSAGE), which combines cooperative game theory with Causal
GraphSAGE. Initially, a cooperative causal structure model is constructed in
the case of cooperation based on the graph structure. Subsequently, Cooperative
Causal sampling (CoCa-sampling) algorithm is proposed, employing the Shapley
values to calculate the cooperative contribution based on causal weights of the
nodes sets. CoCa-sampling guides the selection of nodes with significant
cooperative causal effects during the neighborhood sampling process, thus
integrating the selected neighborhood features under cooperative relationships,
which takes the sampled nodes as a whole and generates more stable target node
embeddings. Experiments on publicly available datasets show that the proposed
method has comparable classification performance to the compared methods and
outperforms under perturbations, demonstrating the robustness improvement by
CoCa-sampling.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks have achieved remarkable achievements across various
domains, however balancing performance and generalization still remains a
challenge while training these networks. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that uses a cyclic optimization strategy to concurrently optimize the
model and its input data for better training, rethinking the traditional
training paradigm. Central to our approach is Iterative Constructive
Perturbation (ICP), which leverages the model's loss to iteratively perturb the
input, progressively constructing an enhanced representation over some
refinement steps. This ICP input is then fed back into the model to produce
improved intermediate features, which serve as a target in a self-distillation
framework against the original features. By alternately altering the model's
parameters to the data and the data to the model, our method effectively
addresses the gap between fitting and generalization, leading to enhanced
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only
mitigates common performance bottlenecks in neural networks but also
demonstrates significant improvements across training variations.

Conclusion: LLMSynthor是经济学、社会科学等领域的有价值工具。

Abstract: Generating synthetic data that faithfully captures the statistical structure
of real-world distributions is a fundamental challenge in data modeling.
Classical approaches often depend on strong parametric assumptions or manual
structural design and struggle in high-dimensional or heterogeneous domains.
Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) reveals their potential as
flexible, high-dimensional priors over real-world distributions. However, when
applied to data synthesis, standard LLM-based sampling is inefficient,
constrained by fixed context limits, and fails to ensure statistical alignment.
Given this, we introduce LLMSynthor, a general framework for data synthesis
that transforms LLMs into structure-aware simulators guided by distributional
feedback. LLMSynthor treats the LLM as a nonparametric copula simulator for
modeling high-order dependencies and introduces LLM Proposal Sampling to
generate grounded proposal distributions that improve sampling efficiency
without requiring rejection. By minimizing discrepancies in the summary
statistics space, the iterative synthesis loop aligns real and synthetic data
while gradually uncovering and refining the latent generative structure. We
evaluate LLMSynthor in both controlled and real-world settings using
heterogeneous datasets in privacy-sensitive domains (e.g., e-commerce,
population, and mobility) that encompass both structured and unstructured
formats. The synthetic data produced by LLMSynthor shows high statistical
fidelity, practical utility, and cross-data adaptability, positioning it as a
valuable tool across economics, social science, urban studies, and beyond.

Result: 在3D打印的实际应用中验证了LLINBO的有效性。

Conclusion: LLINBO通过结合LLM和统计模型，实现了更可靠和高效的贝叶斯优化。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sequential decision-making tool widely used
for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable adaptability in low-data regimes, making them
promising tools for black-box optimization by leveraging contextual knowledge
to propose high-quality query points. However, relying solely on LLMs as
optimization agents introduces risks due to their lack of explicit surrogate
modeling and calibrated uncertainty, as well as their inherently opaque
internal mechanisms. This structural opacity makes it difficult to characterize
or control the exploration-exploitation trade-off, ultimately undermining
theoretical tractability and reliability. To address this, we propose LLINBO:
LLM-in-the-Loop BO, a hybrid framework for BO that combines LLMs with
statistical surrogate experts (e.g., Gaussian Processes (GP)). The core
philosophy is to leverage contextual reasoning strengths of LLMs for early
exploration, while relying on principled statistical models to guide efficient
exploitation. Specifically, we introduce three mechanisms that enable this
collaboration and establish their theoretical guarantees. We end the paper with
a real-life proof-of-concept in the context of 3D printing. The code to
reproduce the results can be found at

TLDR: 该研究开发了深度学习模型，利用非临床数据和上下文特征，提前六小时预测急诊科（ED）的候诊患者数量，以支持主动决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过预测ED候诊患者数量，帮助医院系统提前应对拥堵问题，优化运营决策。

Method: 从五个数据源收集数据，进行特征工程后，使用多种时间序列深度学习模型（如ResNetPlus、TSTPlus、TSiTPlus和N-BEATSx）进行训练和超参数调优。

Result: N-BEATSx表现最佳，平均绝对误差为2.10，决定系数为0.95，且在极端情况下仍保持稳定。

Conclusion: 研究表明，无需患者临床数据即可实现高精度预测，为医院系统提供了一种通用且实用的方法来缓解ED拥堵。

Abstract: This study develops deep learning models to forecast the number of patients
in the emergency department (ED) boarding phase six hours in advance, aiming to
support proactive operational decision-making using only non-clinical,
operational, and contextual features. Data were collected from five sources: ED
tracking systems, inpatient census records, weather reports, federal holiday
calendars, and local event schedules. After feature engineering, the data were
aggregated at an hourly level, cleaned, and merged into a unified dataset for
model training. Several time series deep learning models, including ResNetPlus,
TSTPlus, TSiTPlus (from the tsai library), and N-BEATSx, were trained using
Optuna and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. The average ED boarding count
was 28.7, with a standard deviation of 11.2. N-BEATSx achieved the best
performance, with a mean absolute error of 2.10, mean squared error of 7.08,
root mean squared error of 2.66, and a coefficient of determination of 0.95.
The model maintained stable accuracy even during periods of extremely high
boarding counts, defined as values exceeding one, two, or three standard
deviations above the mean. Results show that accurate six-hour-ahead forecasts
are achievable without using patient-level clinical data. While strong
performance was observed even with a basic feature set, the inclusion of
additional features improved prediction stability under extreme conditions.
This framework offers a practical and generalizable approach for hospital
systems to anticipate boarding levels and help mitigate ED overcrowding.

Conclusion: KO通过物理学原理优化神经网络参数，有效提升了性能，为优化算法设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: The design of optimization algorithms for neural networks remains a critical
challenge, with most existing methods relying on heuristic adaptations of
gradient-based approaches. This paper introduces KO (Kinetics-inspired
Optimizer), a novel neural optimizer inspired by kinetic theory and partial
differential equation (PDE) simulations. We reimagine the training dynamics of
network parameters as the evolution of a particle system governed by kinetic
principles, where parameter updates are simulated via a numerical scheme for
the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) that models stochastic particle
collisions. This physics-driven approach inherently promotes parameter
diversity during optimization, mitigating the phenomenon of parameter
condensation, i.e. collapse of network parameters into low-dimensional
subspaces, through mechanisms analogous to thermal diffusion in physical
systems. We analyze this property, establishing both a mathematical proof and a
physical interpretation. Extensive experiments on image classification
(CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and text classification (IMDB, Snips) tasks
demonstrate that KO consistently outperforms baseline optimizers (e.g., Adam,
SGD), achieving accuracy improvements while computation cost remains
comparable.

Motivation: 传统数据工程管道成本高且需要大量工程时间和领域知识，ADEPT旨在通过自动化解决这些问题。

Method: ADEPT采用两步法：(1)利用文本嵌入表示多样化数据源，(2)构建变分信息瓶颈标准以减少文本嵌入的熵方差。

Result: ADEPT在多种数据集上表现优于现有基准，尤其在处理缺失数据、格式错误等问题时表现突出。

Conclusion: ADEPT能够跳过传统数据管道的多个步骤，为数据科学应用提供高效、可扩展的自动化途径。

Abstract: Data engineering pipelines are essential - albeit costly - components of
predictive analytics frameworks requiring significant engineering time and
domain expertise for carrying out tasks such as data ingestion, preprocessing,
feature extraction, and feature engineering. In this paper, we propose ADEPT,
an automated data engineering pipeline via text embeddings. At the core of the
ADEPT framework is a simple yet powerful idea that the entropy of embeddings
corresponding to textually dense raw format representation of time series can
be intuitively viewed as equivalent (or in many cases superior) to that of
numerically dense vector representations obtained by data engineering
pipelines. Consequently, ADEPT uses a two step approach that (i) leverages text
embeddings to represent the diverse data sources, and (ii) constructs a
variational information bottleneck criteria to mitigate entropy variance in
text embeddings of time series data. ADEPT provides an end-to-end automated
implementation of predictive models that offers superior predictive performance
despite issues such as missing data, ill-formed records, improper or corrupted
data formats and irregular timestamps. Through exhaustive experiments, we show
that the ADEPT outperforms the best existing benchmarks in a diverse set of
datasets from large-scale applications across healthcare, finance, science and
industrial internet of things. Our results show that ADEPT can potentially
leapfrog many conventional data pipeline steps thereby paving the way for
efficient and scalable automation pathways for diverse data science
applications.

Conclusion: SurvUnc显著提升了生存模型的解释性和可靠性，为实际应用中的可信预测提供了新途径。

Abstract: Survival analysis, which estimates the probability of event occurrence over
time from censored data, is fundamental in numerous real-world applications,
particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and risk assessment.
Despite advances in numerous survival models, quantifying the uncertainty of
predictions from these models remains underexplored and challenging. The lack
of reliable uncertainty quantification limits the interpretability and
trustworthiness of survival models, hindering their adoption in clinical
decision-making and other sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, in this
work, we introduce SurvUnc, a novel meta-model based framework for post-hoc
uncertainty quantification for survival models. SurvUnc introduces an
anchor-based learning strategy that integrates concordance knowledge into
meta-model optimization, leveraging pairwise ranking performance to estimate
uncertainty effectively. Notably, our framework is model-agnostic, ensuring
compatibility with any survival model without requiring modifications to its
architecture or access to its internal parameters. Especially, we design a
comprehensive evaluation pipeline tailored to this critical yet overlooked
problem. Through extensive experiments on four publicly available benchmarking
datasets and five representative survival models, we demonstrate the
superiority of SurvUnc across multiple evaluation scenarios, including
selective prediction, misprediction detection, and out-of-domain detection. Our
results highlight the effectiveness of SurvUnc in enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, paving the way for more trustworthy survival
predictions in real-world applications.

Motivation: 传统模仿学习假设演示接近最优，但人类行为往往基于动态的满意度水平而非最优性。本文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 采用基于边际的目标函数指导深度强化学习，专注于超越演示者的满意度水平。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在模仿高质量演示部分上优于现有方法，提供更高的可接受率和竞争力强的真实回报。

Conclusion: 提出的满意度模仿学习方法有效提升了策略性能，尤其在满足演示者期望方面表现突出。

Abstract: Imitation learning often assumes that demonstrations are close to optimal
according to some fixed, but unknown, cost function. However, according to
satisficing theory, humans often choose acceptable behavior based on their
personal (and potentially dynamic) levels of aspiration, rather than achieving
(near-) optimality. For example, a lunar lander demonstration that successfully
lands without crashing might be acceptable to a novice despite being slow or
jerky. Using a margin-based objective to guide deep reinforcement learning, our
focused satisficing approach to imitation learning seeks a policy that
surpasses the demonstrator's aspiration levels -- defined over trajectories or
portions of trajectories -- on unseen demonstrations without explicitly
learning those aspirations. We show experimentally that this focuses the policy
to imitate the highest quality (portions of) demonstrations better than
existing imitation learning methods, providing much higher rates of guaranteed
acceptability to the demonstrator, and competitive true returns on a range of
environments.

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a principled framework
for sequential decision-making in environments where interactions evolve
continuously over time. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of CTRL remains limited, especially in settings with general
function approximation. In this work, we propose a model-based CTRL algorithm
that achieves both sample and computational efficiency. Our approach leverages
optimism-based confidence sets to establish the first sample complexity
guarantee for CTRL with general function approximation, showing that a
near-optimal policy can be learned with a suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d_{\mathcal{R}} + d_{\mathcal{F}}}N^{-1/2})$ using $N$
measurements, where $d_{\mathcal{R}}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ denote the
distributional Eluder dimensions of the reward and dynamic functions,
respectively, capturing the complexity of general function approximation in
reinforcement learning. Moreover, we introduce structured policy updates and an
alternative measurement strategy that significantly reduce the number of policy
updates and rollouts while maintaining competitive sample efficiency. We
implemented experiments to backup our proposed algorithms on continuous control
tasks and diffusion model fine-tuning, demonstrating comparable performance
with significantly fewer policy updates and rollouts.

Motivation: 传统时间序列方法仅能揭示时间平均意义上的因果关系，而现有方法在高维系统中受限。ACI旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ACI利用动态系统和贝叶斯数据同化，通过逆向问题解决因果关系，评估效应变量信息是否减少潜在原因变量的不确定性。

Result: ACI能动态捕捉变量间的相互作用，无需经验阈值确定CIR，适用于高维问题和短时间序列。

Conclusion: ACI是一种高效、灵活的因果推断方法，特别适用于复杂动态系统和极端事件分析。

Abstract: Causal inference determines cause-and-effect relationships between variables
and has broad applications across disciplines. Traditional time-series methods
often reveal causal links only in a time-averaged sense, while ensemble-based
information transfer approaches detect the time evolution of short-term causal
relationships but are typically limited to low-dimensional systems. In this
paper, a new causal inference framework, called assimilative causal inference
(ACI), is developed. Fundamentally different from the state-of-the-art methods,
ACI uses a dynamical system and a single realization of a subset of the state
variables to identify instantaneous causal relationships and the dynamic
evolution of the associated causal influence range (CIR). Instead of
quantifying how causes influence effects as done traditionally, ACI solves an
inverse problem via Bayesian data assimilation, thus tracing causes backward
from observed effects with an implicit Bayesian hypothesis. Causality is
determined by assessing whether incorporating the information of the effect
variables reduces the uncertainty in recovering the potential cause variables.
ACI has several desirable features. First, it captures the dynamic interplay of
variables, where their roles as causes and effects can shift repeatedly over
time. Second, a mathematically justified objective criterion determines the CIR
without empirical thresholds. Third, ACI is scalable to high-dimensional
problems by leveraging computationally efficient Bayesian data assimilation
techniques. Finally, ACI applies to short time series and incomplete datasets.
Notably, ACI does not require observations of candidate causes, which is a key
advantage since potential drivers are often unknown or unmeasured. The
effectiveness of ACI is demonstrated by complex dynamical systems showcasing
intermittency and extreme events.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在统计效率和计算成本之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach to adapting large
language models (LLMs) to new domains. In this work, we improve the statistical
efficiency of SFT by selecting an informative subset of training examples.
Specifically, for a fixed budget of training examples, which determines the
computational cost of fine-tuning, we determine the most informative ones. The
key idea in our method is to select examples that maximize information gain,
measured by the Hessian of the log-likelihood of the LLM. We approximate it
efficiently by linearizing the LLM at the last layer using multinomial logistic
regression models. Our approach is computationally efficient, analyzable, and
performs well empirically. We demonstrate this on several problems, and back
our claims with both quantitative results and an LLM evaluation.

Conclusion: Kausal算法适用于真实世界现象（如厄尔尼诺-南方振荡），代码已开源。

Abstract: We use a deep Koopman operator-theoretic formalism to develop a novel causal
discovery algorithm, Kausal. Causal discovery aims to identify cause-effect
mechanisms for better scientific understanding, explainable decision-making,
and more accurate modeling. Standard statistical frameworks, such as Granger
causality, lack the ability to quantify causal relationships in nonlinear
dynamics due to the presence of complex feedback mechanisms, timescale mixing,
and nonstationarity. This presents a challenge in studying many real-world
systems, such as the Earth's climate. Meanwhile, Koopman operator methods have
emerged as a promising tool for approximating nonlinear dynamics in a linear
space of observables. In Kausal, we propose to leverage this powerful idea for
causal analysis where optimal observables are inferred using deep learning.
Causal estimates are then evaluated in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and
defined as the distance between the marginal dynamics of the effect and the
joint dynamics of the cause-effect observables. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate Kausal's superior ability in discovering and characterizing causal
signals compared to existing approaches of prescribed observables. Lastly, we
extend our analysis to observations of El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation
highlighting our algorithm's applicability to real-world phenomena. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Attention计算的时间复杂度为二次，限制了其在大规模场景下的应用。研究旨在探索在更宽泛条件下（如任意温度）实现高效计算的可行性。

Method: 针对不同维度d和输入大小B，设计了次二次时间复杂度的算法，并分析了低秩矩阵的特殊情况。同时，探讨了梯度计算和LLM训练的高效实现。

Result: 提出了首个在常数d和大B条件下实现次二次时间复杂度的算法，并证明了在特定条件下算法的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究为高效Attention计算提供了理论支持，同时指出了进一步优化的边界条件。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Transformer architecture, the standard
algorithm for computing Attention suffers from quadratic time complexity in
context length $n$. Alman and Song [NeurIPS 2023] showed that when the head
dimension $d = \Theta(\log n)$, subquadratic Attention is possible if and only
if the inputs have small entries bounded by $B = o(\sqrt{\log n})$ in absolute
values, under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis ($\mathsf{SETH}$).
Equivalently, subquadratic Attention is possible if and only if the softmax is
applied with high temperature for $d=\Theta(\log n)$. Running times of these
algorithms depend exponentially on $B$ and thus they do not lead to even a
polynomial-time algorithm outside the specific range of $B$.
  This naturally leads to the question: when can Attention be computed
efficiently without strong assumptions on temperature? Are there fast attention
algorithms that scale polylogarithmically with entry size $B$? In this work, we
resolve this question and characterize when fast Attention for arbitrary
temperatures is possible. First, for all constant $d = O(1)$, we give the first
subquadratic $\tilde{O}(n^{2 - 1/d} \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(B))$ time algorithm
for Attention with large $B$. Our result holds even for matrices with large
head dimension if they have low rank. In this regime, we also give a similar
running time for Attention gradient computation, and therefore for the full LLM
training process. Furthermore, we show that any substantial improvement on our
algorithm is unlikely. In particular, we show that even when $d =
2^{\Theta(\log^* n)}$, Attention requires $n^{2 - o(1)}$ time under
$\mathsf{SETH}$.
  Finally, in the regime where $d = \mathrm{poly}(n)$, we show that the
standard algorithm is optimal under popular fine-grained complexity
assumptions.

Abstract: Over the last two decades, machine learning models have been widely applied
and have proven effective in classifying variable stars, particularly with the
adoption of deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks,
recurrent neural networks, and transformer models. While these models have
achieved high accuracy, they require high-quality, representative data and a
large number of labelled samples for each star type to generalise well, which
can be challenging in time-domain surveys. This challenge often leads to models
learning and reinforcing biases inherent in the training data, an issue that is
not easily detectable when validation is performed on subsamples from the same
catalogue. The problem of biases in variable star data has been largely
overlooked, and a definitive solution has yet to be established. In this paper,
we propose a new approach to improve the reliability of classifiers in variable
star classification by introducing a self-regulated training process. This
process utilises synthetic samples generated by a physics-enhanced latent space
variational autoencoder, incorporating six physical parameters from Gaia Data
Release 3. Our method features a dynamic interaction between a classifier and a
generative model, where the generative model produces ad-hoc synthetic light
curves to reduce confusion during classifier training and populate
underrepresented regions in the physical parameter space. Experiments conducted
under various scenarios demonstrate that our self-regulated training approach
outperforms traditional training methods for classifying variable stars on
biased datasets, showing statistically significant improvements.

Motivation: 解决多组数据分布未知时均值估计的公平性问题，适用于动态数据收集场景（如在线平台实验或医疗临床试验）。

Method: 采用主动学习框架，通过带反馈的bandit方法动态选择样本组，提出Variance-UCB算法，基于方差估计的上置信界选择组。

Result: 提供通用理论框架，显著改进现有边界，适用于多种分布和目标。

Conclusion: Variance-UCB算法在动态数据收集中有效减少估计噪声，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We study a fundamental learning problem over multiple groups with unknown
data distributions, where an analyst would like to learn the mean of each
group. Moreover, we want to ensure that this data is collected in a relatively
fair manner such that the noise of the estimate of each group is reasonable. In
particular, we focus on settings where data are collected dynamically, which is
important in adaptive experimentation for online platforms or adaptive clinical
trials for healthcare. In our model, we employ an active learning framework to
sequentially collect samples with bandit feedback, observing a sample in each
period from the chosen group. After observing a sample, the analyst updates
their estimate of the mean and variance of that group and chooses the next
group accordingly. The analyst's objective is to dynamically collect samples to
minimize the collective noise of the estimators, measured by the norm of the
vector of variances of the mean estimators.
  We propose an algorithm, Variance-UCB, that sequentially selects groups
according to an upper confidence bound on the variance estimate. We provide a
general theoretical framework for providing efficient bounds on learning from
any underlying distribution where the variances can be estimated reasonably.
This framework yields upper bounds on regret that improve significantly upon
all existing bounds, as well as a collection of new results for different
objectives and distributions than those previously studied.

Motivation: 提升大语言模型推理的吞吐量和延迟性能，解决上下文稀疏性在大批量处理时的扩展问题。

Method: 提出Polar Sparsity，重点从MLP层转向注意力层的稀疏性，开发高效的GPU内核。

Result: 在OPT、LLaMA-2和3等模型上实现2.2倍端到端加速，适用于大批量和长序列。

Conclusion: Polar Sparsity首次证明上下文稀疏性可扩展至大批量，为大规模部署提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Accelerating large language model (LLM) inference is critical for real-world
deployments requiring high throughput and low latency. Contextual sparsity,
where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model
parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union
of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar
Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention
layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more
compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast,
attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head
sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop hardware-efficient,
sparsity-aware GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations,
delivering up to \(2.2\times\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2
\& 3, across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising
accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that
contextual sparsity can scale effectively to large batch sizes, delivering
substantial inference acceleration with minimal changes, making Polar Sparsity
practical for large-scale, high-throughput LLM deployment systems. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DGA方法依赖启发式规则，结果不一致；ML方法虽改进准确性，但因变压器运行条件差异导致数据分布偏移，需领域自适应技术。

Method: 提出MCW方法，结合MMD和CORAL，利用K-S统计分配特征权重，优先处理分布差异大的特征。

Result: 实验显示MCW比微调方法提升7.9%，比MMD-CORAL提升2.2%，且在不同训练样本量下均表现稳健。

Conclusion: MCW方法有效解决了电力变压器故障诊断中的领域自适应问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Ensuring the reliable operation of power transformers is critical to grid
stability. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is widely used for fault diagnosis, but
traditional methods rely on heuristic rules, which may lead to inconsistent
results. Machine learning (ML)-based approaches have improved diagnostic
accuracy; however, power transformers operate under varying conditions, and
differences in transformer type, environmental factors, and operational
settings create distribution shifts in diagnostic data. Consequently, direct
model transfer between transformers often fails, making techniques for domain
adaptation a necessity. To tackle this issue, this work proposes a
feature-weighted domain adaptation technique that combines Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) and Correlation Alignment (CORAL) with feature-specific
weighting (MCW). Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistics are used to assign
adaptable weights, prioritizing features with larger distributional
discrepancies and thereby improving source and target domain alignment.
Experimental evaluations on datasets for power transformers demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves a 7.9% improvement over
Fine-Tuning and a 2.2% improvement over MMD-CORAL (MC). Furthermore, it
outperforms both techniques across various training sample sizes, confirming
its robustness for domain adaptation.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种结合小波去噪、小波包分解和多通道Swin Transformer模型（MCSFormer）的新框架，用于精确预测滚动轴承的剩余使用寿命（RUL），并在噪声抑制、泛化能力和早期故障检测方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 滚动轴承的RUL精确预测对避免意外故障、减少停机时间和提高工业系统安全性至关重要，但由于退化趋势复杂、噪声干扰和早期故障检测需求，RUL预测具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种结合小波去噪、小波包分解（WPD）和定制多通道Swin Transformer模型（MCSFormer）的框架，利用注意力机制进行特征融合，并开发了定制损失函数以区分早期和晚期预测。

Result: 在PRONOSTIA数据集上的实验表明，MCSFormer在多种工况下均优于现有模型（如Adaptive Transformer、MDAN和CNN-SRU），MAE平均降低41%、64%和69%。跨工况测试中泛化能力优于ViT和Swin Transformer，定制损失函数减少了晚期预测，评分指标提升6.3%。

Conclusion: MCSFormer在噪声抑制、泛化能力和安全性方面表现突出，是一种可靠且有效的工业预测性维护工具。

Abstract: Precise estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of rolling bearings is
an important consideration to avoid unexpected failures, reduce downtime, and
promote safety and efficiency in industrial systems. Complications in
degradation trends, noise presence, and the necessity to detect faults in
advance make estimation of RUL a challenging task. This paper introduces a
novel framework that combines wavelet-based denoising method, Wavelet Packet
Decomposition (WPD), and a customized multi-channel Swin Transformer model
(MCSFormer) to address these problems. With attention mechanisms incorporated
for feature fusion, the model is designed to learn global and local degradation
patterns utilizing hierarchical representations for enhancing predictive
performance. Additionally, a customized loss function is developed as a key
distinction of this work to differentiate between early and late predictions,
prioritizing accurate early detection and minimizing the high operation risks
of late predictions. The proposed model was evaluated with the PRONOSTIA
dataset using three experiments. Intra-condition experiments demonstrated that
MCSFormer outperformed state-of-the-art models, including the Adaptive
Transformer, MDAN, and CNN-SRU, achieving 41%, 64%, and 69% lower MAE on
average across different operating conditions, respectively. In terms of
cross-condition testing, it achieved superior generalization under varying
operating conditions compared to the adapted ViT and Swin Transformer. Lastly,
the custom loss function effectively reduced late predictions, as evidenced in
a 6.3% improvement in the scoring metric while maintaining competitive overall
performance. The model's robust noise resistance, generalization capability,
and focus on safety make MCSFormer a trustworthy and effective predictive
maintenance tool in industrial applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为机器学习模型的动态维护提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: A significant challenge in maintaining real-world machine learning models is
responding to the continuous and unpredictable evolution of data. Most
practitioners are faced with the difficult question: when should I retrain or
update my machine learning model? This seemingly straightforward problem is
particularly challenging for three reasons: 1) decisions must be made based on
very limited information - we usually have access to only a few examples, 2)
the nature, extent, and impact of the distribution shift are unknown, and 3) it
involves specifying a cost ratio between retraining and poor performance, which
can be hard to characterize. Existing works address certain aspects of this
problem, but none offer a comprehensive solution. Distribution shift detection
falls short as it cannot account for the cost trade-off; the scarcity of the
data, paired with its unusual structure, makes it a poor fit for existing
offline reinforcement learning methods, and the online learning formulation
overlooks key practical considerations. To address this, we present a
principled formulation of the retraining problem and propose an
uncertainty-based method that makes decisions by continually forecasting the
evolution of model performance evaluated with a bounded metric. Our experiments
addressing classification tasks show that the method consistently outperforms
existing baselines on 7 datasets.

Abstract: Accurately predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations is
essential for understanding disease mechanisms and designing effective
therapies. Yet exhaustively exploring the space of possible perturbations
(e.g., multi-gene perturbations or across tissues and cell types) is
prohibitively expensive, motivating methods that can generalize to unseen
conditions. In this work, we explore how knowledge graphs of gene-gene
relationships can improve out-of-distribution (OOD) prediction across three
challenging settings: unseen single perturbations; unseen double perturbations;
and unseen cell lines. In particular, we present: (i) TxPert, a new
state-of-the-art method that leverages multiple biological knowledge networks
to predict transcriptional responses under OOD scenarios; (ii) an in-depth
analysis demonstrating the impact of graphs, model architecture, and data on
performance; and (iii) an expanded benchmarking framework that strengthens
evaluation standards for perturbation modeling.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning models in open-world
deployment is a central challenge in AI safety. This thesis develops both
algorithmic and theoretical foundations to address key reliability issues
arising from distributional uncertainty and unknown classes, from standard
neural networks to modern foundation models like large language models (LLMs).
  Traditional learning paradigms, such as empirical risk minimization (ERM),
assume no distribution shift between training and inference, often leading to
overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This thesis
introduces novel frameworks that jointly optimize for in-distribution accuracy
and reliability to unseen data. A core contribution is the development of an
unknown-aware learning framework that enables models to recognize and handle
novel inputs without labeled OOD data.
  We propose new outlier synthesis methods, VOS, NPOS, and DREAM-OOD, to
generate informative unknowns during training. Building on this, we present
SAL, a theoretical and algorithmic framework that leverages unlabeled
in-the-wild data to enhance OOD detection under realistic deployment
conditions. These methods demonstrate that abundant unlabeled data can be
harnessed to recognize and adapt to unforeseen inputs, providing formal
reliability guarantees.
  The thesis also extends reliable learning to foundation models. We develop
HaloScope for hallucination detection in LLMs, MLLMGuard for defending against
malicious prompts in multimodal models, and data cleaning methods to denoise
human feedback used for better alignment. These tools target failure modes that
threaten the safety of large-scale models in deployment.
  Overall, these contributions promote unknown-aware learning as a new
paradigm, and we hope it can advance the reliability of AI systems with minimal
human efforts.

feedback about the accessibility of potentially concerning behaviors in a way
that may scale to powerful future models, including those which may otherwise

is extended with generalized conditional soft prompts to aid in constructing

Abstract: The growing enforcement of the right to be forgotten regulations has
propelled recent advances in certified (graph) unlearning strategies to comply
with data removal requests from deployed machine learning (ML) models.
Motivated by the well-documented bias amplification predicament inherent to
graph data, here we take a fresh look at graph unlearning and leverage it as a
bias mitigation tool. Given a pre-trained graph ML model, we develop a
training-free unlearning procedure that offers certifiable bias mitigation via
a single-step Newton update on the model weights. This way, we contribute a
computationally lightweight alternative to the prevalent training- and
optimization-based fairness enhancement approaches, with quantifiable
performance guarantees. We first develop a novel fairness-aware nodal feature
unlearning strategy along with refined certified unlearning bounds for this
setting, whose impact extends beyond the realm of graph unlearning. We then
design structural unlearning methods endowed with principled selection
mechanisms over nodes and edges informed by rigorous bias analyses. Unlearning
these judiciously selected elements can mitigate algorithmic biases with
minimal impact on downstream utility (e.g., node classification accuracy).
Experimental results over real networks corroborate the bias mitigation
efficacy of our unlearning strategies, and delineate markedly favorable
utility-complexity trade-offs relative to retraining from scratch using
augmented graph data obtained via removals.

Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, accurately predicting the conversion rate
(CVR) is crucial for enhancing advertising efficiency and user satisfaction.
This paper addresses the challenge of CVR prediction while adhering to user
privacy preferences and advertiser requirements. Traditional methods face
obstacles such as the reluctance of advertisers to share sensitive conversion
data and the limitations of model training in secure environments like data
clean rooms. We propose a novel model training framework that enables
collaborative model training without sharing sample-level gradients with the
advertising platform. Our approach introduces several innovative components:
(1) utilizing batch-level aggregated gradients instead of sample-level
gradients to minimize privacy risks; (2) applying adapter-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning and gradient compression to reduce
communication costs; and (3) employing de-biasing techniques to train the model
under label differential privacy, thereby maintaining accuracy despite
privacy-enhanced label perturbations. Our experimental results, conducted on
industrial datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves competitive ROCAUC
performance while significantly decreasing communication overhead and complying
with both advertiser privacy requirements and user privacy choices. This
framework establishes a new standard for privacy-preserving, high-performance
CVR prediction in the digital advertising landscape.

Abstract: AI systems in high-consequence domains such as defense, intelligence, and
disaster response must detect rare, high-impact events while operating under
tight resource constraints. Traditional annotation strategies that prioritize
label volume over informational value introduce redundancy and noise, limiting
model generalization. This paper introduces smart-sizing, a training data
strategy that emphasizes label diversity, model-guided selection, and marginal
utility-based stopping. We implement this through Adaptive Label Optimization
(ALO), combining pre-labeling triage, annotator disagreement analysis, and
iterative feedback to prioritize labels that meaningfully improve model
performance. Experiments show that models trained on 20 to 40 percent of
curated data can match or exceed full-data baselines, particularly in
rare-class recall and edge-case generalization. We also demonstrate how latent
labeling errors embedded in training and validation sets can distort
evaluation, underscoring the need for embedded audit tools and
performance-aware governance. Smart-sizing reframes annotation as a
feedback-driven process aligned with mission outcomes, enabling more robust
models with fewer labels and supporting efficient AI development pipelines for
frontier models and operational systems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are notoriously hard to understand and difficult
to defend. Extracting representative paths (including the neuron activation
values and the connections between neurons) from DNNs using software
engineering approaches has recently shown to be a promising approach in
interpreting the decision making process of blackbox DNNs, as the extracted
paths are often effective in capturing essential features. With this in mind,
this work investigates a novel approach that extracts critical paths from DNNs
and subsequently applies the extracted paths for the anomaly detection task,
based on the observation that outliers and adversarial inputs do not usually
induce the same activation pattern on those paths as normal (in-distribution)
inputs.
  In our approach, we first identify critical detection paths via genetic
evolution and mutation. Since different paths in a DNN often capture different
features for the same target class, we ensemble detection results from multiple
paths by integrating random subspace sampling and a voting mechanism. Compared
with state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results suggest that our method
not only outperforms them, but it is also suitable for the detection of a broad
range of anomaly types with high accuracy.

Result: 在三个基准测试中，该方法优于传统的推测解码方法，为SSM和混合模型的推理提供了进一步加速的可能。

Conclusion: 提出的算法为SSMs和混合模型的推测解码提供了高效解决方案，代码将在论文接受后发布。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a technique to leverage hardware concurrency to
improve the efficiency of large-scale autoregressive (AR) Transformer models by
enabling multiple steps of token generation in a single forward pass.
State-space models (SSMs) are already more efficient than AR Transformers,
since their state summarizes all past data with no need to cache or re-process
tokens in the sliding window context. However, their state can also comprise
thousands of tokens; so, speculative decoding has recently been extended to
SSMs. Existing approaches, however, do not leverage the tree-based verification
methods, since current SSMs lack the means to compute a token tree efficiently.
We propose the first scalable algorithm to perform tree-based speculative
decoding in state-space models (SSMs) and hybrid architectures of SSMs and
Transformer layers. We exploit the structure of accumulated state transition
matrices to facilitate tree-based speculative decoding with minimal overhead to
current SSM state update implementations. With the algorithm, we describe a
hardware-aware implementation that improves naive application of AR Transformer
tree-based speculative decoding methods to SSMs. Furthermore, we outperform
vanilla speculative decoding with SSMs even with a baseline drafting model and
tree structure on three different benchmarks, opening up opportunities for
further speed up with SSM and hybrid model inference. Code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: 该方法为离线GCRL提供了一种简单且可扩展的解决方案，适用于高维控制和大状态空间。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a promising
approach for pretraining generalist policies on large datasets of reward-free
trajectories, akin to the self-supervised objectives used to train foundation
models for computer vision and natural language processing. However, scaling
GCRL to longer horizons remains challenging due to the combination of sparse
rewards and discounting, which obscures the comparative advantages of primitive
actions with respect to distant goals. Hierarchical RL methods achieve strong
empirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks, but their reliance on
modular, timescale-specific policies and subgoal generation introduces
significant additional complexity and hinders scaling to high-dimensional goal
spaces. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to train a flat
(non-hierarchical) goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping on
subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. Our
approach eliminates the need for a generative model over the (sub)goal space,
which we find is key for scaling to high-dimensional control in large state
spaces. We further show that existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based
approaches correspond to specific design choices within our derivation. Across
a comprehensive suite of state- and pixel-based locomotion and manipulation
benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art offline GCRL
algorithms and scales to complex, long-horizon tasks where prior approaches
fail.

Conclusion: EORM通过轻量级后验验证，高效提升LLM推理可靠性，性能媲美暴力采样。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language
Models (LLMs), often requiring robust multi step logical consistency. While
Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting elicits reasoning steps, it doesn't guarantee
correctness, and improving reliability via extensive sampling is
computationally costly. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model
(EORM), an effective, lightweight, post hoc verifier. EORM leverages Energy
Based Models (EBMs) to simplify the training of reward models by learning to
assign a scalar energy score to CoT solutions using only outcome labels,
thereby avoiding detailed annotations. It achieves this by interpreting
discriminator output logits as negative energies, effectively ranking
candidates where lower energy is assigned to solutions leading to correct final
outcomes implicitly favoring coherent reasoning. On mathematical benchmarks
(GSM8k, MATH), EORM significantly improves final answer accuracy (e.g., with
Llama 3 8B, achieving 90.7% on GSM8k and 63.7% on MATH). EORM effectively
leverages a given pool of candidate solutions to match or exceed the
performance of brute force sampling, thereby enhancing LLM reasoning outcome
reliability through its streamlined post hoc verification process.

Result: 在视觉和语言任务中，新方法显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 似然比选择机制在协变量偏移下能有效提升选择性分类性能。

Abstract: Selective classification enhances the reliability of predictive models by
allowing them to abstain from making uncertain predictions. In this work, we
revisit the design of optimal selection functions through the lens of the
Neyman--Pearson lemma, a classical result in statistics that characterizes the
optimal rejection rule as a likelihood ratio test. We show that this
perspective not only unifies the behavior of several post-hoc selection
baselines, but also motivates new approaches to selective classification which
we propose here. A central focus of our work is the setting of covariate shift,
where the input distribution at test time differs from that at training. This
realistic and challenging scenario remains relatively underexplored in the
context of selective classification. We evaluate our proposed methods across a
range of vision and language tasks, including both supervised learning and
vision-language models. Our experiments demonstrate that our
Neyman--Pearson-informed methods consistently outperform existing baselines,
indicating that likelihood ratio-based selection offers a robust mechanism for
improving selective classification under covariate shifts. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/clear-nus/sc-likelihood-ratios.

TLDR: 研究单层Transformer在无噪声和有噪声上下文推理中的近似能力和收敛行为，填补了现有理论空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论仅关注无限样本或首次梯度步的上下文推理行为，缺乏收敛速率和泛化能力的分析。

Method: 通过有限样本分析，证明一类单层Transformer在梯度下降训练下以线性速率收敛至贝叶斯风险。

Result: 证明了这些模型在未见样本上的泛化能力，并通过实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 单层Transformer在特定条件下具有贝叶斯最优性，并能高效收敛和泛化。

Abstract: We study the approximation capabilities and on-convergence behaviors of
one-layer transformers on the noiseless and noisy in-context reasoning of
next-token prediction. Existing theoretical results focus on understanding the
in-context reasoning behaviors for either the first gradient step or when the
number of samples is infinite. Furthermore, no convergence rates nor
generalization abilities were known. Our work addresses these gaps by showing
that there exists a class of one-layer transformers that are provably
Bayes-optimal with both linear and ReLU attention. When being trained with
gradient descent, we show via a finite-sample analysis that the expected loss
of these transformers converges at linear rate to the Bayes risk. Moreover, we
prove that the trained models generalize to unseen samples as well as exhibit
learning behaviors that were empirically observed in previous works. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by extensive empirical validations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN无法识别细粒度和方向特定的特征相关性，限制了其表达能力。

Method: MSH-GNN通过动态投影邻居特征到频率敏感方向，并使用可学习的多频正弦编码调制，引入频率感知注意力池化机制。

Conclusion: MSH-GNN能够有效捕捉结构不对称性和高频调制，提升图分类准确性。

Abstract: Conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aggregate neighbor embeddings as
holistic vectors, lacking the ability to identify fine-grained,
direction-specific feature relevance. We propose MSH-GNN (Multi-Scale Harmonic
Graph Neural Network), a novel architecture that performs feature-wise adaptive
message passing through node-specific harmonic projections. For each node,
MSH-GNN dynamically projects neighbor features onto frequency-sensitive
directions determined by the target node's own representation. These
projections are further modulated using learnable sinusoidal encodings at
multiple frequencies, enabling the model to capture both smooth and oscillatory
structural patterns across scales. A frequency-aware attention pooling
mechanism is introduced to emphasize spectrally and structurally salient nodes
during readout. Theoretically, we prove that MSH-GNN approximates
shift-invariant kernels and matches the expressive power of the
1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Empirically, MSH-GNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models on a wide range of graph and node classification tasks.
Furthermore, in challenging classification settings involving joint variations
in graph topology and spectral frequency, MSH-GNN excels at capturing
structural asymmetries and high-frequency modulations, enabling more accurate
graph discrimination.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices,
driven by model advancements and hardware improvements, offers significant
privacy benefits. However, these on-device LLMs inherently face performance
limitations due to reduced model capacity and necessary compression techniques.
To address this, we introduce a systematic methodology -- encompassing model
capability, development efficiency, and system resources -- for evaluating
on-device LLMs. Our comprehensive evaluation, encompassing models from 0.5B to
14B parameters and seven post-training quantization (PTQ) methods on commodity
laptops, yields several critical insights: 1) System-level metrics exhibit
near-linear scaling with effective bits-per-weight (BPW). 2) A practical
threshold exists around $\sim$3.5 effective BPW, larger models subjected to
low-bit quantization consistently outperform smaller models utilizing higher
bit-precision. 3) Quantization with low BPW incurs marginal accuracy loss but
significant memory savings. 4) Determined by low-level implementation specifics
power consumption on CPU, where computation-intensive operations spend more
power than memory-intensive ones. These findings offer crucial insights and
practical guidelines for the efficient deployment and optimized configuration
of LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices. Our codebase is available at

Conclusion: Tango框架显著提升了生成器和验证器的性能，尤其在复杂数学问题上。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an
LLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However,
current RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are
fixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking
and generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently
train both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central
innovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is
trained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is
trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without
requiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained
verifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to
deterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual
reinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both
components of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models:
the generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level
math benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the
verifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit
particularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical
reasoning problems. Code is at: https://github.com/kaiwenzha/rl-tango.

performance; and (4) only Transformer-XL, Gated Transformer-XL, and Mamba-2
successfully solve the most challenging memory-intensive tasks, with Mamba-2
requiring 8x less memory than Transformer-XL. These findings provide insights
for researchers and practitioners, enabling more informed architecture

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏理性约束，导致假设与证据脱节，阻碍了系统性的不确定性减少。

Method: PiFlow将科学发现视为结构化不确定性减少问题，并引入科学定律等原则作为指导。

Result: 在三个科学领域的评估中，PiFlow显著提升了发现效率（AUC增加73.55%）和解决方案质量（提升94.06%）。

Conclusion: PiFlow为高效自动化科学发现提供了新的范式，推动了AI驱动研究的加速发展。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate
remarkable potential for scientific discovery. Existing approaches, however,
often automate scientific discovery using predefined workflows that lack
rationality constraints. This often leads to aimless hypothesizing and a
failure to consistently link hypotheses with evidence, thereby hindering
systematic uncertainty reduction. Overcoming these limitations fundamentally
requires systematic uncertainty reduction. We introduce \texttt{PiFlow}, an
information-theoretical framework, treating automated scientific discovery as a
structured uncertainty reduction problem guided by principles (e.g., scientific
laws). In evaluations across three distinct scientific domains -- discovering
nanomaterial structures, bio-molecules, and superconductor candidates with
targeted properties -- our method significantly improves discovery efficiency,
reflected by a 73.55\% increase in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of property
values versus exploration steps, and enhances solution quality by 94.06\%
compared to a vanilla agent system. Overall, \texttt{PiFlow} serves as a
Plug-and-Play method, establishing a novel paradigm shift in highly efficient
automated scientific discovery, paving the way for more robust and accelerated
AI-driven research. Code is publicly available at our

Conclusion: 该框架实现了架构无关和动态系统感知的泛化保证，适用于现代深度学习范式。

Abstract: Recent theory has reduced the depth dependence of generalization bounds from
exponential to polynomial and even depth-independent rates, yet these results
remain tied to specific architectures and Euclidean inputs. We present a
unified framework for arbitrary \blue{pseudo-metric} spaces in which a
depth-\(k\) network is the composition of continuous hidden maps
\(f:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}\) and an output map \(h:\mathcal{X}\to
\mathbb{R}\). The resulting bound $O(\sqrt{(\alpha + \log \beta(k))/n})$
isolates the sole depth contribution in \(\beta(k)\), the word-ball growth of
the semigroup generated by the hidden layers. By Gromov's theorem polynomial
(resp. exponential) growth corresponds to virtually nilpotent (resp. expanding)
dynamics, revealing a geometric dichotomy behind existing $O(\sqrt{k})$
(sublinear depth) and $\tilde{O}(1)$ (depth-independent) rates. We further
provide covering-number estimates showing that expanding dynamics yield an
exponential parameter saving via compositional expressivity. Our results
decouple specification from implementation, offering architecture-agnostic and
dynamical-systems-aware guarantees applicable to modern deep-learning paradigms
such as test-time inference and diffusion models.

Abstract: While multimodal data sources are increasingly available from real-world
forecasting, most existing research remains on unimodal time series. In this
work, we present MoTime, a suite of multimodal time series forecasting datasets
that pair temporal signals with external modalities such as text, metadata, and
images. Covering diverse domains, MoTime supports structured evaluation of
modality utility under two scenarios: 1) the common forecasting task, where
varying-length history is available, and 2) cold-start forecasting, where no
historical data is available. Experiments show that external modalities can
improve forecasting performance in both scenarios, with particularly strong
benefits for short series in some datasets, though the impact varies depending
on data characteristics. By making datasets and findings publicly available, we
aim to support more comprehensive and realistic benchmarks in future multimodal
time series forecasting research.

Abstract: As a widely-used and practical tool, feature engineering transforms raw data
into discriminative features to advance AI model performance. However, existing
methods usually apply feature selection and generation separately, failing to
strive a balance between reducing redundancy and adding meaningful dimensions.
To fill this gap, we propose an agentic feature augmentation concept, where the
unification of feature generation and selection is modeled as agentic teaming
and planning. Specifically, we develop a Multi-Agent System with Long and
Short-Term Memory (MAGS), comprising a selector agent to eliminate redundant
features, a generator agent to produce informative new dimensions, and a router
agent that strategically coordinates their actions. We leverage in-context
learning with short-term memory for immediate feedback refinement and long-term
memory for globally optimal guidance. Additionally, we employ offline Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement fine-tuning to train the router agent
for effective decision-making to navigate a vast discrete feature space.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that this unified agentic framework
consistently achieves superior task performance by intelligently orchestrating
feature selection and generation.

Motivation: 长序列中注意力机制的计算复杂度高，且大多数注意力权重很小，切断这些权重的反向传播可以显著减少计算量。

Method: 提出了一种基于概率的规则，通过参数c控制每个token和注意力头的反向传播交互数量，最多保留c个交互。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著减少反向传播的计算量，适用于长序列的Transformer训练。

Abstract: It is straightforward to design an unbiased gradient estimator that
stochastically cuts the backpropagation flow through any part of a
computational graph. By cutting the parts that have little effect on the
computation, one can potentially save a significant amount of back-propagation
computation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient
variance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention
mechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention
becomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically
with sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very
small, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small
fraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising
targets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule
controlled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts backpropagation through most
attention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention
head. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the
attention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear
complexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical
transformer model, cutting $99\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing
$c \sim 20-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about
$1\%$ for $n \sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$. This approach is amenable
to efficient sparse matrix implementation, thus being promising for making the
cost of a backward pass negligible relative to the cost of a forward pass when
training a transformer model on long sequences.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various applications,
particularly in healthcare, where accurate predictions of future health
trajectories can significantly impact clinical decision-making. Ensuring
transparency and explainability of the models responsible for these tasks is
essential for their adoption in critical settings. Recent work has explored a
top-down approach to bi-level transparency, focusing on understanding trends
and properties of predicted time series using static features. In this work, we
extend this framework by incorporating exogenous time series features alongside
static features in a structured manner, while maintaining cohesive
interpretation. Our approach leverages the insights of trajectory comprehension
to introduce an encoding mechanism for exogenous time series, where they are
decomposed into meaningful trends and properties, enabling the extraction of
interpretable patterns. Through experiments on several synthetic datasets, we
demonstrate that our approach remains predictive while preserving
interpretability and robustness. This work represents a step towards developing
robust, and generalized time series forecasting models. The code is available

Conclusion: CaMVo是一种高效且鲁棒的动态标注解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automated
dataset labeling with minimal human supervision. While majority voting across
multiple LLMs can improve label reliability by mitigating individual model
biases, it incurs high computational costs due to repeated querying. In this
work, we propose a novel online framework, Cost-aware Majority Voting (CaMVo),
for efficient and accurate LLM-based dataset annotation. CaMVo adaptively
selects a subset of LLMs for each data instance based on contextual embeddings,
balancing confidence and cost without requiring pre-training or ground-truth
labels. Leveraging a LinUCB-based selection mechanism and a Bayesian estimator
over confidence scores, CaMVo estimates a lower bound on labeling accuracy for
each LLM and aggregates responses through weighted majority voting. Our
empirical evaluation on the MMLU and IMDB Movie Review datasets demonstrates
that CaMVo achieves comparable or superior accuracy to full majority voting
while significantly reducing labeling costs. This establishes CaMVo as a
practical and robust solution for cost-efficient annotation in dynamic labeling
environments.

Conclusion: Khan-GCL通过增强表达能力和优化负样本生成，显著提升了图对比学习的效果。

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has demonstrated great promise for learning
generalizable graph representations from unlabeled data. However, conventional
GCL approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the restricted expressive
capacity of multilayer perceptron (MLP) based encoders, and (2) suboptimal
negative samples that either from random augmentations-failing to provide
effective 'hard negatives'-or generated hard negatives without addressing the
semantic distinctions crucial for discriminating graph data. To this end, we
propose Khan-GCL, a novel framework that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network (KAN) into the GCL encoder architecture, substantially enhancing its
representational capacity. Furthermore, we exploit the rich information
embedded within KAN coefficient parameters to develop two novel critical
feature identification techniques that enable the generation of semantically
meaningful hard negative samples for each graph representation. These
strategically constructed hard negatives guide the encoder to learn more
discriminative features by emphasizing critical semantic differences between
graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing GCL methods across a variety
of datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Graph-structured data pervades domains such as social networks, biological
systems, knowledge graphs, and recommender systems. While foundation models
have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning
through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these
capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex
relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To
this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose
intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric
tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs,
unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key
components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation
mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal,
task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key
innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology,
we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent
capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment,
heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of
graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational
infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data. This survey
consolidates current progress and outlines future directions to guide research
in this rapidly evolving field. Resources are available at

TLDR: AdvCLIP-LoRA是一种新算法，旨在提升CLIP模型在LoRA微调下的对抗鲁棒性，适用于少样本场景，并通过理论和实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在对抗攻击下表现脆弱，而参数高效微调（PEFT）技术（如LoRA）在少样本场景中广泛应用，但缺乏对抗鲁棒性研究。

Method: 提出AdvCLIP-LoRA，将对抗微调建模为极小极大优化问题，并提供理论收敛保证。

Result: 在8个数据集上实验表明，AdvCLIP-LoRA显著提升对抗攻击（如FGSM、PGD）下的鲁棒性，同时保持较高的干净准确率。

Conclusion: AdvCLIP-LoRA为资源受限场景下的视觉语言模型鲁棒微调提供了实用且理论支持的方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance
in cross-modal tasks through large-scale contrastive pre-training. To adapt
these large transformer-based models efficiently for downstream tasks,
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA have emerged as
scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning, especially in few-shot scenarios.
However, like traditional deep neural networks, VLMs are highly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations can significantly
degrade model performance. Adversarial training remains the most effective
strategy for improving model robustness in PEFT. In this work, we propose
AdvCLIP-LoRA, the first algorithm designed to enhance the adversarial
robustness of CLIP models fine-tuned with LoRA in few-shot settings. Our method
formulates adversarial fine-tuning as a minimax optimization problem and
provides theoretical guarantees for convergence under smoothness and
nonconvex-strong-concavity assumptions. Empirical results across eight datasets
using ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32 models show that AdvCLIP-LoRA significantly
improves robustness against common adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD),
without sacrificing much clean accuracy. These findings highlight AdvCLIP-LoRA
as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for robust adaptation of
VLMs in resource-constrained settings.

TLDR: 熵最小化（EM）通过无标签数据显著提升大语言模型在数学、物理和编程任务中的表现，探索了三种方法，并展示了其高效性和潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示预训练大语言模型未充分利用的推理能力，仅通过熵最小化即可激发，无需标签数据或参数更新。

Method: 提出三种熵最小化方法：EM-FT（指令微调类似）、EM-RL（强化学习）、EM-INF（推理时调整）。

Result: EM-RL在无标签数据下表现优于基线方法，EM-INF使模型在SciCode基准上媲美GPT-4o等专有模型，且效率更高。

Conclusion: 熵最小化是一种简单而高效的方法，可显著提升大语言模型的推理能力，无需额外资源。

Abstract: Entropy minimization (EM) trains the model to concentrate even more
probability mass on its most confident outputs. We show that this simple
objective alone, without any labeled data, can substantially improve large
language models' (LLMs) performance on challenging math, physics, and coding
tasks. We explore three approaches: (1) EM-FT minimizes token-level entropy
similarly to instruction finetuning, but on unlabeled outputs drawn from the
model; (2) EM-RL: reinforcement learning with negative entropy as the only
reward to maximize; (3) EM-INF: inference-time logit adjustment to reduce
entropy without any training data or parameter updates. On Qwen-7B, EM-RL,
without any labeled data, achieves comparable or better performance than strong
RL baselines such as GRPO and RLOO that are trained on 60K labeled examples.
Furthermore, EM-INF enables Qwen-32B to match or exceed the performance of
proprietary models like GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Pro on the
challenging SciCode benchmark, while being 3x more efficient than
self-consistency and sequential refinement. Our findings reveal that many
pretrained LLMs possess previously underappreciated reasoning capabilities that
can be effectively elicited through entropy minimization alone, without any
labeled data or even any parameter updates.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper investigates infinite-horizon average reward Constrained Markov
Decision Processes (CMDPs) with general parametrization. We propose a
Primal-Dual Natural Actor-Critic algorithm that adeptly manages constraints
while ensuring a high convergence rate. In particular, our algorithm achieves
global convergence and constraint violation rates of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ over a horizon of length $T$ when the mixing
time, $\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}$, is known to the learner. In absence of knowledge
of $\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}$, the achievable rates change to
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/T^{0.5-\epsilon})$ provided that $T \geq
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}^{2/\epsilon}\right)$. Our results
match the theoretical lower bound for Markov Decision Processes and establish a
new benchmark in the theoretical exploration of average reward CMDPs.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为EC-LDA的新型标签分布攻击方法，用于联邦图学习中推断客户端数据的标签分布，并通过压缩节点嵌入显著提高了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习（FGL）中客户端需上传模型参数，可能导致服务器推断数据隐私，尤其是标签分布。本文旨在研究并改进此类攻击。

Method: 通过分析节点嵌入的方差与攻击效果的关系，提出EC-LDA方法，压缩节点嵌入以提高攻击效果。

Result: 在六个图数据集上的实验表明，EC-LDA优于现有标签分布攻击方法，并在CoraFull和LastFM数据集上达到最优效果。

Conclusion: EC-LDA在标签分布攻击中表现优异，同时探讨了其在差分隐私保护下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for graph analysis.
Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to
collaboratively train graph data from various clients. However, since clients
are required to upload model parameters to the server in each round, this
provides the server with an opportunity to infer each client's data privacy. In
this paper, we focus on label distribution attacks(LDAs) that aim to infer the
label distributions of the clients' local data. We take the first step to
attack client's label distributions in FGL. Firstly, we observe that the
effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in
GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and we propose a new attack
named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by
compressing node embeddings. Thirdly, extensive experiments on node
classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets
show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. For example, EC-LDA attains optimal
values under both Cos-sim and JS-div evaluation metrics in the CoraFull and
LastFM datasets. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under
differential privacy protection.

Conclusion: BanditSpec框架及其算法在动态选择超参数方面表现优异，适用于实际LLM服务场景。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a popular method to accelerate the
inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) while retaining their superior text
generation performance. Previous methods either adopt a fixed speculative
decoding configuration regardless of the prefix tokens, or train draft models
in an offline or online manner to align them with the context. This paper
proposes a training-free online learning framework to adaptively choose the
configuration of the hyperparameters for speculative decoding as text is being
generated. We first formulate this hyperparameter selection problem as a
Multi-Armed Bandit problem and provide a general speculative decoding framework
BanditSpec. Furthermore, two bandit-based hyperparameter selection algorithms,
UCBSpec and EXP3Spec, are designed and analyzed in terms of a novel quantity,
the stopping time regret. We upper bound this regret under both stochastic and
adversarial reward settings. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility
result, it is shown that the regret performance of UCBSpec is optimal up to
universal constants. Finally, extensive empirical experiments with LLaMA3 and
Qwen2 demonstrate that our algorithms are effective compared to existing
methods, and the throughput is close to the oracle best hyperparameter in
simulated real-life LLM serving scenarios with diverse input prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在上下文强化学习中可能继承源算法/数据集的次优行为的问题。

Method: 提出学习历史过滤（LHF）方法，基于改进和稳定性特征对学习历史进行重新加权和过滤。

Result: LHF在多种次优场景和噪声数据下表现优异，显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: LHF是一种简单有效的方法，能够显著提升上下文强化学习的性能，尤其在噪声数据下表现突出。

Abstract: Transformer models (TMs) have exhibited remarkable in-context reinforcement
learning (ICRL) capabilities, allowing them to generalize to and improve in
previously unseen environments without re-training or fine-tuning. This is
typically accomplished by imitating the complete learning histories of a source
RL algorithm over a substantial amount of pretraining environments, which,
however, may transfer suboptimal behaviors inherited from the source
algorithm/dataset. Therefore, in this work, we address the issue of inheriting
suboptimality from the perspective of dataset preprocessing. Motivated by the
success of the weighted empirical risk minimization, we propose a simple yet
effective approach, learning history filtering (LHF), to enhance ICRL by
reweighting and filtering the learning histories based on their improvement and
stability characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, LHF is the first
approach to avoid source suboptimality by dataset preprocessing, and can be
combined with the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) ICRL algorithms. We
substantiate the effectiveness of LHF through a series of experiments conducted
on the well-known ICRL benchmarks, encompassing both discrete environments and
continuous robotic manipulation tasks, with three SOTA ICRL algorithms (AD,
DPT, DICP) as the backbones. LHF exhibits robust performance across a variety
of suboptimal scenarios, as well as under varying hyperparameters and sampling
strategies. Notably, the superior performance of LHF becomes more pronounced in
the presence of noisy data, indicating the significance of filtering learning
histories.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型在处理多样化的时间模式和复杂的多变量依赖时表现不足，尤其是忽略了序列间的依赖关系。

Method: 采用稀疏MoE技术处理多样化时间模式，提出Any-variate Attention支持单变量和多变量统一建模，并设计图学习模块从频域特征中捕获序列间依赖。

Result: Time Tracker在预测精度、模型泛化性和适应性上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Time Tracker通过创新设计有效解决了时间序列预测中的关键问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In the past few years, time series foundation models have achieved superior
predicting accuracy. However, real-world time series often exhibit significant
diversity in their temporal patterns across different time spans and domains,
making it challenging for a single model architecture to fit all complex
scenarios. In addition, time series data may have multiple variables exhibiting
complex correlations between each other. Recent mainstream works have focused
on modeling times series in a channel-independent manner in both pretraining
and finetuning stages, overlooking the valuable inter-series dependencies. To
this end, we propose \textbf{Time Tracker} for better predictions on
multivariate time series data. Firstly, we leverage sparse mixture of experts
(MoE) within Transformers to handle the modeling of diverse time series
patterns, thereby alleviating the learning difficulties of a single model while
improving its generalization. Besides, we propose Any-variate Attention,
enabling a unified model structure to seamlessly handle both univariate and
multivariate time series, thereby supporting channel-independent modeling
during pretraining and channel-mixed modeling for finetuning. Furthermore, we
design a graph learning module that constructs relations among sequences from
frequency-domain features, providing more precise guidance to capture
inter-series dependencies in channel-mixed modeling. Based on these
advancements, Time Tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting
accuracy, model generalization and adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征转换方法在离散搜索和连续搜索中存在组合空间大、初始化敏感和局部最优问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: DIFFT结合变分自编码器（VAE）和潜在扩散模型（LDM），通过奖励引导生成高质量特征嵌入，并使用半自回归解码器转换为离散特征。

Result: 在14个基准数据集上的实验表明，DIFFT在预测准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法，且训练和推理时间显著降低。

Conclusion: DIFFT通过全局分布学习和目标优化的结合，提供了一种高效且强大的特征转换解决方案。

Abstract: Feature Transformation (FT) crafts new features from original ones via
mathematical operations to enhance dataset expressiveness for downstream
models. However, existing FT methods exhibit critical limitations: discrete
search struggles with enormous combinatorial spaces, impeding practical use;
and continuous search, being highly sensitive to initialization and step sizes,
often becomes trapped in local optima, restricting global exploration. To
overcome these limitations, DIFFT redefines FT as a reward-guided generative
task. It first learns a compact and expressive latent space for feature sets
using a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). A Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) then
navigates this space to generate high-quality feature embeddings, its
trajectory guided by a performance evaluator towards task-specific optima. This
synthesis of global distribution learning (from LDM) and targeted optimization
(reward guidance) produces potent embeddings, which a novel semi-autoregressive
decoder efficiently converts into structured, discrete features, preserving
intra-feature dependencies while allowing parallel inter-feature generation.
Extensive experiments on 14 benchmark datasets show DIFFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy and robustness,
with significantly lower training and inference times.

Motivation: 观察到OOD图样本的拉普拉斯矩阵最大和第二大特征值之间的差异（谱间隙）异常，这启发了SpecGap的提出。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能，并通过消融研究和理论分析验证。

Conclusion: SpecGap是一种无需参数的后处理方法，易于集成到现有图神经网络中，无需额外训练。

Abstract: The task of graph-level out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for
deploying graph neural networks in real-world settings. In this paper, we
observe a significant difference in the relationship between the largest and
second-largest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix for in-distribution (ID) and
OOD graph samples: \textit{OOD samples often exhibit anomalous spectral gaps
(the difference between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues)}. This
observation motivates us to propose SpecGap, an effective post-hoc approach for
OOD detection on graphs. SpecGap adjusts features by subtracting the component
associated with the second-largest eigenvalue, scaled by the spectral gap, from
the high-level features (i.e., $\mathbf{X}-\left(\lambda_n-\lambda_{n-1}\right)
\mathbf{u}_{n-1} \mathbf{v}_{n-1}^T$). SpecGap achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets. We present extensive ablation
studies and comprehensive theoretical analyses to support our empirical
results. As a parameter-free post-hoc method, SpecGap can be easily integrated
into existing graph neural network models without requiring any additional
training or model modification.

Conclusion: 该研究为动态合规智能系统提供了理论基础和方法支持，扩展了CLU的应用场景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep models have highlighted the need for intelligent
systems that combine continual learning (CL) for knowledge acquisition with
machine unlearning (MU) for data removal, forming the Continual
Learning-Unlearning (CLU) paradigm. While existing work treats CL and MU as
separate processes, we reveal their intrinsic connection through a unified
optimization framework based on Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization. This
framework decomposes gradient updates for approximate CLU into four components:
learning new knowledge, unlearning targeted data, preserving existing
knowledge, and modulation via weight saliency. A critical challenge lies in
balancing knowledge update and retention during sequential learning-unlearning
cycles. To resolve this stability-plasticity dilemma, we introduce a
remain-preserved manifold constraint to induce a remaining Hessian compensation
for CLU iterations. A fast-slow weight adaptation mechanism is designed to
efficiently approximate the second-order optimization direction, combined with
adaptive weighting coefficients and a balanced weight saliency mask, proposing
a unified implementation framework for gradient-based CLU. Furthermore, we
pioneer task-agnostic CLU scenarios that support fine-grained unlearning at the
cross-task category and random sample levels beyond the traditional task-aware
setups. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UG-CLU framework effectively
coordinates incremental learning, precise unlearning, and knowledge stability
across multiple datasets and model architectures, providing a theoretical
foundation and methodological support for dynamic, compliant intelligent
systems.

Conclusion: NeuBM不仅调整最终预测，还通过表示平衡影响网络学习，提供了一种高效且轻量级的偏差缓解方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance across various
domains, yet they often struggle with model bias, particularly in the presence
of class imbalance. This bias can lead to suboptimal performance and unfair
predictions, especially for underrepresented classes. We introduce NeuBM
(Neutral Bias Mitigation), a novel approach to mitigate model bias in GNNs
through neutral input calibration. NeuBM leverages a dynamically updated
neutral graph to estimate and correct the inherent biases of the model. By
subtracting the logits obtained from the neutral graph from those of the input
graph, NeuBM effectively recalibrates the model's predictions, reducing bias
across different classes. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing GNN
architectures and training procedures, requiring minimal computational
overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
NeuBM significantly improves the balanced accuracy and recall of minority
classes, while maintaining strong overall performance. The effectiveness of
NeuBM is particularly pronounced in scenarios with severe class imbalance and
limited labeled data, where traditional methods often struggle. We provide
theoretical insights into how NeuBM achieves bias mitigation, relating it to
the concept of representation balancing. Our analysis reveals that NeuBM not
only adjusts the final predictions but also influences the learning of balanced
feature representations throughout the network.

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了最优聚合函数在迭代重训练中的有效性。

Abstract: Retraining a model using its own predictions together with the original,
potentially noisy labels is a well-known strategy for improving the model
performance. While prior works have demonstrated the benefits of specific
heuristic retraining schemes, the question of how to optimally combine the
model's predictions and the provided labels remains largely open. This paper
addresses this fundamental question for binary classification tasks. We develop
a principled framework based on approximate message passing (AMP) to analyze
iterative retraining procedures for two ground truth settings: Gaussian mixture
model (GMM) and generalized linear model (GLM). Our main contribution is the
derivation of the Bayes optimal aggregator function to combine the current
model's predictions and the given labels, which when used to retrain the same
model, minimizes its prediction error. We also quantify the performance of this
optimal retraining strategy over multiple rounds. We complement our theoretical
results by proposing a practically usable version of the theoretically-optimal
aggregator function for linear probing with the cross-entropy loss, and
demonstrate its superiority over baseline methods in the high label noise
regime.

*Christian Walder,Deep Karkhanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO)，通过优化pass@k性能而非pass@1，提升样本集的多样性和集体效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL算法独立奖励每个样本，忽略了样本集的联合效用，限制了探索能力。

Method: 提出PKPO，通过低方差无偏估计器优化pass@k性能，支持任意k≤n，并可动态调整k。

Result: 实验验证PKPO能有效优化目标k，解决更难题，且动态调整k可同时提升pass@1和pass@k。

Conclusion: PKPO通过优化样本集的联合效用，解决了传统方法在难题上的学习停滞问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms sample multiple n>1 solution attempts
for each problem and reward them independently. This optimizes for pass@1
performance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of
the diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes
the sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder
examples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a
transformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of
pass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward
when considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance
unbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and
continuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to
standard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and
efficient transformation function.
  While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable
robust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of
trading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k
during training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1
numbers alongside significant pass@k gains.
  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the
variance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world
examples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation
effectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable
solving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and
pass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1
optimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to
better exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual
samples.

*Haomin Bai,Dingzhi Yu,Shuai Li,Haipeng Luo,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种支持动态样本量的GDRO算法，通过两玩家博弈框架和新型PLA算法，实现了高概率优化误差界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GDRO算法仅支持固定样本量（1或m），无法适应动态样本量场景，因此需要一种更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 将GDRO建模为两玩家博弈，提出新型PLA算法，构建损失估计器并采用正则化跟随策略更新决策。

Result: 实现了高概率优化误差界O(1/t√(∑(m/r_j)log m)，样本复杂度为O(m log m/ε²)。

Conclusion: 新算法在动态样本量下表现优异，理论结果与固定样本量情况一致，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) aims to develop models that
perform well across $m$ distributions simultaneously. Existing GDRO algorithms
can only process a fixed number of samples per iteration, either 1 or $m$, and
therefore can not support scenarios where the sample size varies dynamically.
To address this limitation, we investigate GDRO with flexible sample queries
and cast it as a two-player game: one player solves an online convex
optimization problem, while the other tackles a prediction with limited advice
(PLA) problem. Within such a game, we propose a novel PLA algorithm,
constructing appropriate loss estimators for cases where the sample size is
either 1 or not, and updating the decision using follow-the-regularized-leader.
Then, we establish the first high-probability regret bound for non-oblivious
PLA. Building upon the above approach, we develop a GDRO algorithm that allows
an arbitrary and varying sample size per round, achieving a high-probability
optimization error bound of $O\left(\frac{1}{t}\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^t
\frac{m}{r_j}\log m}\right)$, where $r_t$ denotes the sample size at round $t$.
This result demonstrates that the optimization error decreases as the number of
samples increases and implies a consistent sample complexity of $O(m\log
(m)/\epsilon^2)$ for any fixed sample size $r\in[m]$, aligning with existing
bounds for cases of $r=1$ or $m$. We validate our approach on synthetic binary
and real-world multi-class datasets.

Abstract: Efficient task scheduling is paramount in the Linux kernel, where the
Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) meticulously manages CPU resources to balance
high utilization with interactive responsiveness. This research pioneers the
use of deep learning techniques to predict the sequence of tasks selected by
CFS, aiming to evaluate the feasibility of a more generalized and potentially
more adaptive task scheduler for diverse workloads. Our core contributions are
twofold: first, the systematic generation and curation of a novel scheduling
dataset from a running Linux kernel, capturing real-world CFS behavior; and
second, the development, training, and evaluation of a Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) network designed to accurately forecast the next task to be scheduled.
This paper further discusses the practical pathways and implications of
integrating such a predictive model into the kernel's scheduling framework. The
findings and methodologies presented herein open avenues for data-driven
advancements in kernel scheduling, with the full source code provided for

Conclusion: CP-KAN在数据效率和数值稳定性要求高的场景中，性能优于传统架构，并提供了理论支持与实现方案。

Abstract: We introduce cumulative polynomial Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (CP-KAN), a
neural architecture combining Chebyshev polynomial basis functions and
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Our primary contribution
involves reformulating the degree selection problem as a QUBO task, reducing
the complexity from $O(D^N)$ to a single optimization step per layer. This
approach enables efficient degree selection across neurons while maintaining
computational tractability. The architecture performs well in regression tasks
with limited data, showing good robustness to input scales and natural
regularization properties from its polynomial basis. Additionally, theoretical
analysis establishes connections between CP-KAN's performance and properties of
financial time series. Our empirical validation across multiple domains
demonstrates competitive performance compared to several traditional
architectures tested, especially in scenarios where data efficiency and
numerical stability are important. Our implementation, including strategies for
managing computational overhead in larger networks is available in

Motivation: 现有工具主要描述稳定平衡点附近的行为，但在高维环境中表征分界线（分隔不同吸引盆的流形）仍具挑战性。

Method: 利用Koopman特征函数（KEFs）和深度神经网络近似分界线，并通过优化方法定位分界线。

Result: 在合成基准、生态网络模型和神经科学任务训练的循环神经网络中验证了方法的有效性，并设计了跨越分界线的最优扰动。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维动力系统的分界线表征提供了实用工具，尤其在神经科学的光遗传刺激实验中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Many natural systems, including neural circuits involved in decision making,
can be modeled as high-dimensional dynamical systems with multiple stable
states. While existing analytical tools primarily describe behavior near stable
equilibria, characterizing separatrices -- the manifolds that delineate
boundaries between different basins of attraction -- remains challenging,
particularly in high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce a numerical
framework leveraging Koopman Theory combined with Deep Neural Networks to
effectively characterize separatrices. Specifically, we approximate Koopman
Eigenfunctions (KEFs) associated with real positive eigenvalues, which vanish
precisely at the separatrices. Utilizing these scalar KEFs, optimization
methods efficiently locate separatrices even in complex systems. We demonstrate
our approach on synthetic benchmarks, ecological network models, and recurrent
neural networks trained on neuroscience-inspired tasks. Moreover, we illustrate
the practical utility of our method by designing optimal perturbations that can
shift systems across separatrices, enabling predictions relevant to optogenetic
stimulation experiments in neuroscience.

Result: 随着网络深度增加，神经崩溃现象更加显著，理论结果在计算机视觉和语言数据集上得到支持。

Conclusion: 论文为神经崩溃现象提供了更广泛的理论支持，并验证了其在现代架构中的普遍性。

Abstract: The empirical emergence of neural collapse -- a surprising symmetry in the
feature representations of the training data in the penultimate layer of deep
neural networks -- has spurred a line of theoretical research aimed at its
understanding. However, existing work focuses on data-agnostic models or, when
data structure is taken into account, it remains limited to multi-layer
perceptrons. Our paper fills both these gaps by analyzing modern architectures
in a data-aware regime: we prove that global optima of deep regularized
transformers and residual networks (ResNets) with LayerNorm trained with cross
entropy or mean squared error loss are approximately collapsed, and the
approximation gets tighter as the depth grows. More generally, we formally
reduce any end-to-end large-depth ResNet or transformer training into an
equivalent unconstrained features model, thus justifying its wide use in the
literature even beyond data-agnostic settings. Our theoretical results are
supported by experiments on computer vision and language datasets showing that,
as the depth grows, neural collapse indeed becomes more prominent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VFL在5G核心网络中被3GPP研究并认可，但其性能因网络数据分析功能（NWDAF）的可靠性问题而显著下降。

Method: 通过优化客户端间的垂直特征分割，并基于可靠性指标集中定义本地模型。

Result: 实验证明，该算法优于传统基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了核心网络的数据处理灵活性，提升了VFL性能。

Abstract: This work proposes a new algorithm to mitigate model generalization loss in
Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) operating under client reliability
constraints within 5G Core Networks (CNs). Recently studied and endorsed by
3GPP, VFL enables collaborative and load-balanced model training and inference
across the CN. However, the performance of VFL significantly degrades when the
Network Data Analytics Functions (NWDAFs) - which serve as primary clients for
VFL model training and inference - experience reliability issues stemming from
resource constraints and operational overhead. Unlike edge environments, CN
environments adopt fundamentally different data management strategies,
characterized by more centralized data orchestration capabilities. This
presents opportunities to implement better distributed solutions that take full
advantage of the CN data handling flexibility. Leveraging this flexibility, we
propose a method that optimizes the vertical feature split among clients while
centrally defining their local models based on reliability metrics. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm,
showing improved performance over traditional baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在多个领域取得成功，但某些方法存在非鲁棒性问题，依赖虚假相关性进行预测。解决这一问题至关重要，需要开发能够消除虚假相关性的方法。

Method: 通过logit扰动实现因果模型，提出CLP框架，利用扰动网络生成样本级别的logit扰动，并通过在线元学习算法优化框架，同时结合人类因果知识增强元数据。

Result: 在四种典型偏差学习场景（长尾学习、噪声标签学习、广义长尾学习和子群体偏移学习）中，CLP均表现出最先进的性能，可视化结果验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CLP框架能有效消除虚假关联，将模型注意力重新导向因果属性，为深度学习模型的鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning has seen widespread success in various domains such as science,
industry, and society. However, it is acknowledged that certain approaches
suffer from non-robustness, relying on spurious correlations for predictions.
Addressing these limitations is of paramount importance, necessitating the
development of methods that can disentangle spurious correlations. {This study
attempts to implement causal models via logit perturbations and introduces a
novel Causal Logit Perturbation (CLP) framework to train classifiers with
generated causal logit perturbations for individual samples, thereby mitigating
the spurious associations between non-causal attributes (i.e., image
backgrounds) and classes.} {Our framework employs a} perturbation network to
generate sample-wise logit perturbations using a series of training
characteristics of samples as inputs. The whole framework is optimized by an
online meta-learning-based learning algorithm and leverages human causal
knowledge by augmenting metadata in both counterfactual and factual manners.
Empirical evaluations on four typical biased learning scenarios, including
long-tail learning, noisy label learning, generalized long-tail learning, and
subpopulation shift learning, demonstrate that CLP consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, visualization results support the
effectiveness of the generated causal perturbations in redirecting model
attention towards causal image attributes and dismantling spurious
associations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FRFS算法主要关注降低不确定性，但未直接关联分类性能提升，MAFRFS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出Margin-aware Fuzzy Rough Feature Selection（MAFRFS）框架，结合标签类的紧凑性和分离性进行特征选择。

Result: 在15个公开数据集上验证，MAFRFS优于FRFS及其他六种先进特征选择算法。

Conclusion: MAFRFS通过更全面的特征选择策略，显著提升了分类性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Fuzzy rough feature selection (FRFS) is an effective means of addressing the
curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional data. By removing redundant and
irrelevant features, FRFS helps mitigate classifier overfitting, enhance
generalization performance, and lessen computational overhead. However, most
existing FRFS algorithms primarily focus on reducing uncertainty in pattern
classification, neglecting that lower uncertainty does not necessarily result
in improved classification performance, despite it commonly being regarded as a
key indicator of feature selection effectiveness in the FRFS literature. To
bridge uncertainty characterization and pattern classification, we propose a
Margin-aware Fuzzy Rough Feature Selection (MAFRFS) framework that considers
both the compactness and separation of label classes. MAFRFS effectively
reduces uncertainty in pattern classification tasks, while guiding the feature
selection towards more separable and discriminative label class structures.
Extensive experiments on 15 public datasets demonstrate that MAFRFS is highly
scalable and more effective than FRFS. The algorithms developed using MAFRFS
outperform six state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GFlowNets在实践中易陷入模式崩溃，依赖启发式探索信号，难以高效发现多样解。

Method: 提出Loss-Guided GFlowNets (LGGFN)，利用主GFlowNet的训练损失直接驱动辅助网络的探索，优先采样高损失区域。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LGGFN显著提升了探索效率和样本多样性，例如在序列生成任务中发现40倍以上的独特有效模式。

Conclusion: LGGFN通过损失引导的探索，有效解决了模式崩溃问题，提升了GFlowNets的多样性和效率。

Abstract: Although Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are designed to capture
multiple modes of a reward function, they often suffer from mode collapse in
practice, getting trapped in early discovered modes and requiring prolonged
training to find diverse solutions. Existing exploration techniques may rely on
heuristic novelty signals. We propose Loss-Guided GFlowNets (LGGFN), a novel
approach where an auxiliary GFlowNet's exploration is directly driven by the
main GFlowNet's training loss. By prioritizing trajectories where the main
model exhibits high loss, LGGFN focuses sampling on poorly understood regions
of the state space. This targeted exploration significantly accelerates the
discovery of diverse, high-reward samples. Empirically, across various
benchmarks including grid environments, structured sequence generation, and
Bayesian structure learning, LGGFN consistently enhances exploration efficiency
and sample diversity compared to baselines. For instance, on a challenging
sequence generation task, it discovered over 40 times more unique valid modes
while simultaneously reducing the exploration error metric by approximately
99\%.

Conclusion: ReGUIDE为数据高效的GUI元素定位提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
autonomous agents to interact with computers via Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs), where accurately localizing the coordinates of interface elements
(e.g., buttons) is often required for fine-grained actions. However, this
remains significantly challenging, leading prior works to rely on large-scale
web datasets to improve the grounding accuracy. In this work, we propose
Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a
novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn
data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism.
More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning
process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii)
criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under
input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance
through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with
coordinate aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that ReGUIDE significantly
advances web grounding performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming
baselines with substantially fewer training data points (e.g., only 0.2%
samples compared to the best open-sourced baselines).

Motivation: 扩散Transformer在视觉生成模型中具有重要地位，但其超参数调优成本高昂，限制了可扩展性。μP方法在普通Transformer中已证明有效，但尚未在扩散Transformer中验证。

Method: 将标准μP方法推广到扩散Transformer（如DiT、U-ViT等），并通过实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: μP是一种高效且原则性的框架，可显著降低扩散Transformer的超参数调优成本，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative
models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter
(HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P)
was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from
small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However,
it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion
Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we
generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its
effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that
$\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT,
PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer,
enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging
this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP
transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate
achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling
PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases,
models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small
tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of
consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a
principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.

Conclusion: 非线性特征子空间为OoD检测提供了新视角，核函数设计和高效计算技术具有实用价值。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection is vital for the reliability of deep
neural networks, the key of which lies in effectively characterizing the
disparities between OoD and In-Distribution (InD) data. In this work, such
disparities are exploited through a fresh perspective of non-linear feature
subspace. That is, a discriminative non-linear subspace is learned from InD
features to capture representative patterns of InD, while informative patterns
of OoD features cannot be well captured in such a subspace due to their
different distribution. Grounded on this perspective, we exploit the deviations
of InD and OoD features in such a non-linear subspace for effective OoD
detection. To be specific, we leverage the framework of Kernel Principal
Component Analysis (KPCA) to attain the discriminative non-linear subspace and
deploy the reconstruction error on such subspace to distinguish InD and OoD
data. Two challenges emerge: (i) the learning of an effective non-linear
subspace, i.e., the selection of kernel function in KPCA, and (ii) the
computation of the kernel matrix with large-scale InD data. For the former, we
reveal two vital non-linear patterns that closely relate to the InD-OoD
disparity, leading to the establishment of a Cosine-Gaussian kernel for
constructing the subspace. For the latter, we introduce two techniques to
approximate the Cosine-Gaussian kernel with significantly cheap computations.
In particular, our approximation is further tailored by incorporating the InD
data confidence, which is demonstrated to promote the learning of
discriminative subspaces for OoD data. Our study presents new insights into the
non-linear feature subspace for OoD detection and contributes practical
explorations on the associated kernel design and efficient computations,
yielding a KPCA detection method with distinctively improved efficacy and
efficiency.

Result: 在Atari和MuJoCo基准测试中，性能平均提升37.27%。

Conclusion: LLM-Explorer是一种兼容多种RL算法的插件模块，能显著提升策略探索效果。

Abstract: Policy exploration is critical in reinforcement learning (RL), where existing
approaches include greedy, Gaussian process, etc. However, these approaches
utilize preset stochastic processes and are indiscriminately applied in all
kinds of RL tasks without considering task-specific features that influence
policy exploration. Moreover, during RL training, the evolution of such
stochastic processes is rigid, which typically only incorporates a decay in the
variance, failing to adjust flexibly according to the agent's real-time
learning status. Inspired by the analyzing and reasoning capability of large
language models (LLMs), we design LLM-Explorer to adaptively generate
task-specific exploration strategies with LLMs, enhancing the policy
exploration in RL. In our design, we sample the learning trajectory of the
agent during the RL training in a given task and prompt the LLM to analyze the
agent's current policy learning status and then generate a probability
distribution for future policy exploration. Updating the probability
distribution periodically, we derive a stochastic process specialized for the
particular task and dynamically adjusted to adapt to the learning process. Our
design is a plug-in module compatible with various widely applied RL
algorithms, including the DQN series, DDPG, TD3, and any possible variants
developed based on them. Through extensive experiments on the Atari and MuJoCo
benchmarks, we demonstrate LLM-Explorer's capability to enhance RL policy
exploration, achieving an average performance improvement up to 37.27%. Our

Abstract: Accurately estimating the informativeness of individual samples in a dataset
is an important objective in deep learning, as it can guide sample selection,
which can improve model efficiency and accuracy by removing redundant or
potentially harmful samples. We propose Laplace Sample Information (LSI)
measure of sample informativeness grounded in information theory widely
applicable across model architectures and learning settings. LSI leverages a
Bayesian approximation to the weight posterior and the KL divergence to measure
the change in the parameter distribution induced by a sample of interest from
the dataset. We experimentally show that LSI is effective in ordering the data
with respect to typicality, detecting mislabeled samples, measuring class-wise
informativeness, and assessing dataset difficulty. We demonstrate these
capabilities of LSI on image and text data in supervised and unsupervised
settings. Moreover, we show that LSI can be computed efficiently through probes
and transfers well to the training of large models.

Conclusion: LLM-Ens通过任务语义理解和动态代理选择，显著提升了RL模型集成的效果。

Abstract: Model ensemble is a useful approach in reinforcement learning (RL) for
training effective agents. Despite wide success of RL, training effective
agents remains difficult due to the multitude of factors requiring careful
tuning, such as algorithm selection, hyperparameter settings, and even random
seed choices, all of which can significantly influence an agent's performance.
Model ensemble helps overcome this challenge by combining multiple weak agents
into a single, more powerful one, enhancing overall performance. However,
existing ensemble methods, such as majority voting and Boltzmann addition, are
designed as fixed strategies and lack a semantic understanding of specific
tasks, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness. To address this, we
propose LLM-Ens, a novel approach that enhances RL model ensemble with
task-specific semantic understandings driven by large language models (LLMs).
Given a task, we first design an LLM to categorize states in this task into
distinct 'situations', incorporating high-level descriptions of the task
conditions. Then, we statistically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each
individual agent to be used in the ensemble in each situation. During the
inference time, LLM-Ens dynamically identifies the changing task situation and
switches to the agent that performs best in the current situation, ensuring
dynamic model selection in the evolving task condition. Our approach is
designed to be compatible with agents trained with different random seeds,
hyperparameter settings, and various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments on
the Atari benchmark show that LLM-Ens significantly improves the RL model
ensemble, surpassing well-known baselines by up to 20.9%. For reproducibility,

*Yurun Yuan,Fan Chen,Zeyu Jia,Alexander Rakhlin,Tengyang Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: TBRM是一种基于贝尔曼残差最小化的价值强化学习方法，适用于大语言模型，无需评论家或重要性采样，实验表现优于策略基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索价值强化学习在大语言模型推理中的潜力，弥补当前策略方法主导的不足。

Method: 提出TBRM算法，通过轨迹级贝尔曼目标优化，利用模型自身logits作为Q值，简化了流程。

Result: TBRM在数学推理基准测试中优于PPO和GRPO，计算和内存开销更低。

Conclusion: 价值强化学习可能是提升大语言模型推理能力的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines
for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches
largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual
Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an
algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet
effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman
objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for
critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one
rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized
policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved
change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard
mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms
policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower
computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL
might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning
capabilities in LLMs.

*Yuxuan Shu,Vasileios Lampos*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Sonnet的新架构，结合可学习的小波变换和Koopman算子的谱分析，通过多变量相干注意力（MVCA）建模变量依赖关系，显著提升了多变量时间序列预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Transformer架构在多变量时间序列预测中难以有效建模变量间的复杂关系，因此需要一种更高效的架构来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Sonnet架构，应用可学习的小波变换和Koopman算子进行谱分析，并引入MVCA操作，利用谱相干性建模变量依赖关系。

Result: 在47项预测任务中，Sonnet在34项中表现最佳，平均MAE降低1.1%；MVCA替换传统注意力机制后，在最具挑战性的任务中平均MAE降低10.7%。

Conclusion: Sonnet和MVCA显著提升了多变量时间序列预测的准确性，为解决复杂变量关系建模提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multivariable time series forecasting methods can integrate information from
exogenous variables, leading to significant prediction accuracy gains.
Transformer architecture has been widely applied in various time series
forecasting models due to its ability to capture long-range sequential
dependencies. However, a na\"ive application of transformers often struggles to
effectively model complex relationships among variables over time. To mitigate
against this, we propose a novel architecture, namely the Spectral Operator
Neural Network (Sonnet). Sonnet applies learnable wavelet transformations to
the input and incorporates spectral analysis using the Koopman operator. Its
predictive skill relies on the Multivariable Coherence Attention (MVCA), an
operation that leverages spectral coherence to model variable dependencies. Our
empirical analysis shows that Sonnet yields the best performance on $34$ out of
$47$ forecasting tasks with an average mean absolute error (MAE) reduction of
$1.1\%$ against the most competitive baseline (different per task). We further
show that MVCA -- when put in place of the na\"ive attention used in various
deep learning models -- can remedy its deficiencies, reducing MAE by $10.7\%$
on average in the most challenging forecasting tasks.

Motivation: 研究可逆神经架构的紧凑性、可解释性和信息保留特性，以改进物理数据集的表示学习。

Method: 提出FINE架构，结合可逆单调激活函数和可逆滤波器结构，支持傅里叶截断以实现降维。

Result: FINE在重建精度上显著优于DFT、POD和传统CNN自编码器，同时模型更小且更具物理可解释性。

Conclusion: 可逆单神经元网络结合谱截断为物理数据集提供了紧凑且可解释的表示学习框架。

Abstract: Invertible neural architectures have recently attracted attention for their
compactness, interpretability, and information-preserving properties. In this
work, we propose the Fourier-Invertible Neural Encoder (FINE), which combines
invertible monotonic activation functions with reversible filter structures,
and could be extended using Invertible ResNets. This architecture is examined
in learning low-dimensional representations of one-dimensional nonlinear wave
interactions and exact circular translation symmetry. Dimensionality is
preserved across layers, except for a Fourier truncation step in the latent
space, which enables dimensionality reduction while maintaining shift
equivariance and interpretability. Our results demonstrate that FINE
significantly outperforms classical linear methods such as Discrete Fourier
Transformation (DFT) and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and achieves
reconstruction accuracy better than conventional deep autoencoders with
convolutional layers (CNN) - while using substantially smaller models and
offering superior physical interpretability. These findings suggest that
invertible single-neuron networks, when combined with spectral truncation,
offer a promising framework for learning compact and interpretable
representations of physics datasets, and symmetry-aware representation learning
in physics-informed machine learning.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在多步数学推理中计算开销高的问题，尤其是并行解码方法效率低下的挑战。

Method: 结合选择性并行模块（SPM）和步骤级推测解码（SSD），通过模型内部评分选择推理策略，并加速细粒度推理。

Result: 在三个数学基准测试中表现优异，例如LiveMathBench上pass@1准确率提升13.84%，计算量降至80.5%；MATH-500上计算量降至30%且无精度损失。

Conclusion: SSR有效平衡效率与准确性，为多步数学推理提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on multi-step
mathematical reasoning, yet at the cost of high computational overhead. This
challenge is particularly acute for test-time scaling methods such as parallel
decoding, which increase answer diversity but scale poorly in efficiency. To
address this efficiency-accuracy trade-off, we propose SSR (Speculative
Parallel Scaling Reasoning), a training-free framework that leverages a key
insight: by introducing speculative decoding at the step level, we can
accelerate reasoning without sacrificing correctness. SSR integrates two
components: a Selective Parallel Module (SPM) that identifies a small set of
promising reasoning strategies via model-internal scoring, and Step-level
Speculative Decoding (SSD), which enables efficient draft-target collaboration
for fine-grained reasoning acceleration. Experiments on three mathematical
benchmarks-AIME 2024, MATH-500, and LiveMathBench - demonstrate that SSR
achieves strong gains over baselines. For instance, on LiveMathBench, SSR
improves pass@1 accuracy by 13.84% while reducing computation to 80.5% of the
baseline FLOPs. On MATH-500, SSR reduces compute to only 30% with no loss in
accuracy.

Result: 在多个基准测试（如电力、天气、交通）中，显著提升预测精度，计算开销极小。

Conclusion: 该框架为实际预测系统提供了一种高效、可解释且可扩展的新方向。

Abstract: Time series forecasting models often produce systematic, predictable errors
even in critical domains such as energy, finance, and healthcare. We introduce
a novel post training adaptive optimization framework that improves forecast
accuracy without retraining or architectural changes. Our method automatically
applies expressive transformations optimized via reinforcement learning,
contextual bandits, or genetic algorithms to correct model outputs in a
lightweight and model agnostic way. Theoretically, we prove that affine
corrections always reduce the mean squared error; practically, we extend this
idea with dynamic action based optimization. The framework also supports an
optional human in the loop component: domain experts can guide corrections
using natural language, which is parsed into actions by a language model.
Across multiple benchmarks (e.g., electricity, weather, traffic), we observe
consistent accuracy gains with minimal computational overhead. Our interactive
demo shows the framework's real time usability. By combining automated post hoc
refinement with interpretable and extensible mechanisms, our approach offers a
powerful new direction for practical forecasting systems.

Conclusion: DRDM是一种高效且鲁棒的联邦学习算法，适用于异构数据环境，并能自适应调整以最小化能耗。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces critical challenges, particularly in
heterogeneous environments where non-independent and identically distributed
data across clients can lead to unfair and inefficient model performance. In
this work, we introduce \textit{DRDM}, a novel algorithm that addresses these
issues by combining a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework with
dynamic regularization to mitigate client drift. \textit{DRDM} frames the
training as a min-max optimization problem aimed at maximizing performance for
the worst-case client, thereby promoting robustness and fairness. This robust
objective is optimized through an algorithm leveraging dynamic regularization
and efficient local updates, which significantly reduces the required number of
communication rounds. Moreover, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis
for convex smooth objectives under partial participation. Extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets, covering various model architectures and data
heterogeneity levels, demonstrate that \textit{DRDM} significantly improves
worst-case test accuracy while requiring fewer communication rounds than
existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bandwidth on the energy consumption of
participating clients, demonstrating that the number of local update steps can
be adaptively selected to achieve a target worst-case test accuracy with
minimal total energy cost across diverse communication environments.

Conclusion: 整数推理适合嵌入式系统和边缘计算，支持超低功耗设备运行决策树。

Abstract: Integer quantization has emerged as a critical technique to facilitate
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Although they do reduce the
complexity of the learning models, their inference performance is often prone
to quantization-induced errors. To this end, we introduce InTreeger: an
end-to-end framework that takes a training dataset as input, and outputs an
architecture-agnostic integer-only C implementation of tree-based machine
learning model, without loss of precision. This framework enables anyone, even
those without prior experience in machine learning, to generate a highly
optimized integer-only classification model that can run on any hardware simply
by providing an input dataset and target variable. We evaluated our generated
implementations across three different architectures (ARM, x86, and RISC-V),
resulting in significant improvements in inference latency. In addition, we
show the energy efficiency compared to typical decision tree implementations
that rely on floating-point arithmetic. The results underscore the advantages
of integer-only inference, making it particularly suitable for energy- and
area-constrained devices such as embedded systems and edge computing platforms,
while also enabling the execution of decision trees on existing ultra-low power
devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TDL方法因消息传递的组合爆炸和复杂性难以扩展，无法高效处理高阶关系。

Method: 提出HOPSE框架，利用Hasse图分解实现高效编码，避免消息传递。

Result: HOPSE在性能和速度上优于现有方法，最高可达7倍加速。

Conclusion: HOPSE为可扩展的TDL提供了新路径。

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective at modeling
relational data, pairwise connections cannot fully capture multi-way
relationships naturally present in complex real-world systems. In response to
this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial
representations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate
higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through
Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability
challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing
routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation
mechanism. To overcome these limitations, we propose HOPSE (Higher-Order
Positional and Structural Encoder) -- a \emph{message passing-free} framework
that uses Hasse graph decompositions to derive efficient and expressive
encodings over \emph{arbitrary higher-order domains}. Notably, HOPSE scales
linearly with dataset size while preserving expressive power and permutation
equivariance. Experiments on molecular, expressivity and topological benchmarks
show that HOPSE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while
achieving up to 7 $times$ speedups over HOMP-based models, opening a new path
for scalable TDL.

Conclusion: 该方法为LRR优化提供了高效、可微分的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Low-rank regularization (LRR) has been widely applied in various machine
learning tasks, but the associated optimization is challenging. Directly
optimizing the rank function under constraints is NP-hard in general. To
overcome this difficulty, various relaxations of the rank function were
studied. However, optimization of these relaxed LRRs typically depends on
singular value decomposition, which is a time-consuming and nondifferentiable
operator that cannot be optimized with gradient-based techniques. To address
these challenges, in this paper we propose an efficient differentiable
approximation of the generalized LRR. The considered LRR form subsumes many
popular choices like the nuclear norm, the Schatten-$p$ norm, and various
nonconvex relaxations. Our method enables LRR terms to be appended to loss
functions in a plug-and-play fashion, and the GPU-friendly operations enable
efficient and convenient implementation. Furthermore, convergence analysis is
presented, which rigorously shows that both the bias and the variance of our
rank estimator rapidly reduce with increased sample size and iteration steps.
In the experimental study, the proposed method is applied to various tasks,
which demonstrates its versatility and efficiency. Code is available at

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in partially observable environments poses
significant challenges due to the complexity of learning under uncertainty.
While additional information, such as that available in simulations, can
enhance training, effectively leveraging it remains an open problem. To address
this, we introduce Guided Policy Optimization (GPO), a framework that co-trains
a guider and a learner. The guider takes advantage of privileged information
while ensuring alignment with the learner's policy that is primarily trained
via imitation learning. We theoretically demonstrate that this learning scheme
achieves optimality comparable to direct RL, thereby overcoming key limitations
inherent in existing approaches. Empirical evaluations show strong performance
of GPO across various tasks, including continuous control with partial
observability and noise, and memory-based challenges, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SplitWise在保持透明度的同时灵活捕获非线性效应，是一种有效的回归建模工具。

Abstract: Capturing nonlinear relationships without sacrificing interpretability
remains a persistent challenge in regression modeling. We introduce SplitWise,
a novel framework that enhances stepwise regression. It adaptively transforms
numeric predictors into threshold-based binary features using shallow decision
trees, but only when such transformations improve model fit, as assessed by the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
This approach preserves the transparency of linear models while flexibly
capturing nonlinear effects. Implemented as a user-friendly R package,
SplitWise is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results
show that it consistently produces more parsimonious and generalizable models
than traditional stepwise and penalized regression techniques.

Conclusion: Set-LLM为LLM的顺序敏感性问题提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across
numerous applications, their robustness remains a critical concern. This paper
is motivated by a specific vulnerability: the order sensitivity of LLMs. This
vulnerability manifests itself as the order bias observed when LLMs decide
between possible options (for example, a preference for the first option) and
the tendency of LLMs to provide different answers when options are reordered.
The use cases for this scenario extend beyond the classical case of
multiple-choice question answering to the use of LLMs as automated evaluators
in AI pipelines, comparing output generated by different models. We introduce
Set-LLM, a novel architectural adaptation for pretrained LLMs that enables the
processing of mixed set-text inputs with permutation invariance guarantees. The
adaptations involve a new attention mask and new positional encodings
specifically designed for sets. We provide a theoretical proof of invariance
and demonstrate through experiments that Set-LLM can be trained effectively,
achieving comparable or improved performance and maintaining the runtime of the
original model, while eliminating order sensitivity.

Result: 新界限在不平衡设置中提供了更强的保证，并揭示了不平衡与平衡情况的不同统计特性。

Conclusion: 不平衡设置允许两种多任务风险定义，且其统计特性与平衡情况不同。

Abstract: We present new fast-rate generalization bounds for multi-task and
meta-learning in the unbalanced setting, i.e. when the tasks have training sets
of different sizes, as is typically the case in real-world scenarios.
Previously, only standard-rate bounds were known for this situation, while
fast-rate bounds were limited to the setting where all training sets are of
equal size. Our new bounds are numerically computable as well as interpretable,
and we demonstrate their flexibility in handling a number of cases where they
give stronger guarantees than previous bounds. Besides the bounds themselves,
we also make conceptual contributions: we demonstrate that the unbalanced
multi-task setting has different statistical properties than the balanced
situation, specifically that proofs from the balanced situation do not carry
over to the unbalanced setting. Additionally, we shed light on the fact that
the unbalanced situation allows two meaningful definitions of multi-task risk,
depending on whether if all tasks should be considered equally important or if
sample-rich tasks should receive more weight than sample-poor ones.

Abstract: Neural networks hold great potential to act as approximate models of
nonlinear dynamical systems, with the resulting neural approximations enabling
verification and control of such systems. However, in safety-critical contexts,
the use of neural approximations requires formal bounds on their closeness to
the underlying system. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a
novel, adaptive, and parallelizable verification method based on certified
first-order models. Our approach provides formal error bounds on the neural
approximations of dynamical systems, allowing them to be safely employed as
surrogates by interpreting the error bound as bounded disturbances acting on
the approximated dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of
our method on a range of established benchmarks from the literature, showing
that it outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight the
flexibility of our framework by applying it to two novel scenarios not
previously explored in this context: neural network compression and an
autoencoder-based deep learning architecture for learning Koopman operators,
both yielding compelling results.

Abstract: We introduce a new algebraic structure for multi-dimensional compositional
embeddings, built on directional non-commutative monoidal operators. The core
contribution of this work is this novel framework, which exhibits appealing
theoretical properties (associativity along each dimension and an interchange
law ensuring global consistency) while remaining compatible with modern machine
learning architectures. Our construction defines a distinct composition
operator circ_i for each axis i, ensuring associative combination along each
axis without imposing global commutativity. Importantly, all axis-specific
operators commute with one another, enforcing a global interchange law that
enables consistent crossaxis compositions. This is, to our knowledge, the first
approach that provides a common foundation that generalizes classical
sequence-modeling paradigms (e.g., structured state-space models (SSMs) and
transformer self-attention) to a unified multi-dimensional framework. For
example, specific one-dimensional instances of our framework can recover the
familiar affine transformation algebra, vanilla self-attention, and the
SSM-style recurrence. The higher-dimensional generalizations naturally support
recursive, structure-aware operations in embedding spaces. We outline several
potential applications unlocked by this structure-including structured
positional encodings in Transformers, directional image embeddings, and
symbolic modeling of sequences or grids-indicating that it could inform future
deep learning model designs. We formally establish the algebraic properties of
our framework and discuss efficient implementations. Finally, as our focus is
theoretical, we include no experiments here and defer empirical validation to
future work, which we plan to undertake.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为NOMAD Projection的新方法，用于解决传统非线性降维方法（如t-SNE和UMAP）在大规模数据集上的性能瓶颈问题。该方法支持多GPU训练，并在理论和实验上展示了其优越性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的快速发展，传统的数据可视化方法（如t-SNE和UMAP）无法应对大规模数据集的挑战，影响了AI的可解释性。

Method: 提出NOMAD Projection，一种支持多GPU训练的非线性降维方法，理论证明其近似于InfoNC-t-SNE损失的上界。

Result: 实验结果表明，NOMAD Projection在性能和速度上优于现有方法，并成功应用于Multilingual Wikipedia的完整数据映射。

Conclusion: NOMAD Projection为大规模数据集的可视化提供了高效解决方案，推动了AI可解释性的发展。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI has driven an explosion in the size of
datasets consumed and produced by AI models. Traditional methods for
unstructured data visualization, such as t-SNE and UMAP, have not kept up with
the pace of dataset scaling. This presents a significant challenge for AI
explainability, which relies on methods such as t-SNE and UMAP for exploratory
data analysis. In this paper, we introduce Negative Or Mean Affinity
Discrimination (NOMAD) Projection, the first method for unstructured data
visualization via nonlinear dimensionality reduction that can run on multiple
GPUs at train time. We provide theory that situates NOMAD Projection as an
approximate upper bound on the InfoNC-t-SNE loss, and empirical results that
demonstrate NOMAD Projection's superior performance and speed profile compared
to existing state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the scalability of NOMAD
Projection by computing the first complete data map of Multilingual Wikipedia.

*Soham Sane*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: AM-PPO通过动态非线性缩放机制优化PPO的优势估计，提升训练稳定性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始优势信号存在方差、噪声和尺度问题，影响PPO的性能。

Method: 引入动态alpha控制器和tanh门控函数，自适应调整优势信号的缩放因子。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，AM-PPO表现更优，减少优化器裁剪需求。

Conclusion: 优势调制是增强强化学习优化的通用技术。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning
algorithm that heavily relies on accurate advantage estimates for stable and
efficient training. However, raw advantage signals can exhibit significant
variance, noise, and scale-related issues, impeding optimal learning
performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Advantage Modulation PPO
(AM-PPO), a novel enhancement of PPO that adaptively modulates advantage
estimates using a dynamic, non-linear scaling mechanism. This adaptive
modulation employs an alpha controller that dynamically adjusts the scaling
factor based on evolving statistical properties of the advantage signals, such
as their norm, variance, and a predefined target saturation level. By
incorporating a tanh-based gating function driven by these adaptively scaled
advantages, AM-PPO reshapes the advantage signals to stabilize gradient updates
and improve the conditioning of the policy gradient landscape. Crucially, this
modulation also influences value function training by providing consistent and
adaptively conditioned learning targets. Empirical evaluations across standard
continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that AM-PPO achieves superior reward
trajectories, exhibits sustained learning progression, and significantly
reduces the clipping required by adaptive optimizers. These findings underscore
the potential of advantage modulation as a broadly applicable technique for
enhancing reinforcement learning optimization.

TLDR: Distance Explainer是一种新颖的XAI方法，用于解释嵌入空间中的相似性或差异性，通过选择性掩码和距离排序的掩码过滤生成局部解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XAI方法在解释嵌入向量空间（维度表示复杂抽象）方面存在不足，需要一种能够透明解释嵌入空间中数据点相似性或差异性的方法。

Method: 基于RISE的显著性技术，通过选择性掩码和距离排序的掩码过滤生成解释，评估指标包括Faithfulness、Sensitivity/Robustness和Randomization。

Result: 在ImageNet和CLIP模型上的实验表明，该方法能有效识别嵌入数据点间的相似性或差异性特征，同时保持高鲁棒性和一致性。

Conclusion: Distance Explainer填补了XAI研究的空白，提升了深度学习应用中嵌入空间的透明性和可信度。

Abstract: While eXplainable AI (XAI) has advanced significantly, few methods address
interpretability in embedded vector spaces where dimensions represent complex
abstractions. We introduce Distance Explainer, a novel method for generating
local, post-hoc explanations of embedded spaces in machine learning models. Our
approach adapts saliency-based techniques from RISE to explain the distance
between two embedded data points by assigning attribution values through
selective masking and distance-ranked mask filtering. We evaluate Distance
Explainer on cross-modal embeddings (image-image and image-caption pairs) using
established XAI metrics including Faithfulness, Sensitivity/Robustness, and
Randomization. Experiments with ImageNet and CLIP models demonstrate that our
method effectively identifies features contributing to similarity or
dissimilarity between embedded data points while maintaining high robustness
and consistency. We also explore how parameter tuning, particularly mask
quantity and selection strategy, affects explanation quality. This work
addresses a critical gap in XAI research and enhances transparency and
trustworthiness in deep learning applications utilizing embedded spaces.

TLDR: 提出了一种针对HJB方程的无模型强化学习方法，克服了传统方法需要已知动态模型的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HJB-based RL方法需要已知动态方程系数函数，限制了其应用范围。本文旨在解决这一限制。

Method: 提出了一种无模型方法，仍以HJB方程为理论目标，并设计了相应的时间差分方法。

Result: 实验证明该方法在过渡核基础方法上具有潜在优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为随机最优控制与无模型强化学习的结合提供了新途径。

Abstract: For continuous systems modeled by dynamical equations such as ODEs and SDEs,
Bellman's principle of optimality takes the form of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
(HJB) equation, which provides the theoretical target of reinforcement learning
(RL). Although recent advances in RL successfully leverage this formulation,
the existing methods typically assume the underlying dynamics are known a
priori because they need explicit access to the coefficient functions of
dynamical equations to update the value function following the HJB equation. We
address this inherent limitation of HJB-based RL; we propose a model-free
approach still targeting the HJB equation and propose the corresponding
temporal difference method. We demonstrate its potential advantages over
transition kernel-based formulations, both qualitatively and empirically. The
proposed formulation paves the way toward bridging stochastic optimal control
and model-free reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图机器学习社区对消息传递的优缺点进行了深入研究，但快速进展中形成的共识和假设可能模糊了问题的本质，导致研究方向的混乱。

Method: 通过提出简单但有力的反例，明确常见的误解，并鼓励对这些主题进行批判性思考。

Result: 揭示了消息传递研究中存在的问题，澄清了不同问题之间的区别。

Conclusion: 希望通过明确误解和推动独立但相互关联的研究方向，促进图机器学习领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: After a renaissance phase in which researchers revisited the message-passing
paradigm through the lens of deep learning, the graph machine learning
community shifted its attention towards a deeper and practical understanding of
message-passing's benefits and limitations. In this position paper, we notice
how the fast pace of progress around the topics of oversmoothing and
oversquashing, the homophily-heterophily dichotomy, and long-range tasks, came
with the consolidation of commonly accepted beliefs and assumptions that are
not always true nor easy to distinguish from each other. We argue that this has
led to ambiguities around the investigated problems, preventing researchers
from focusing on and addressing precise research questions while causing a good
amount of misunderstandings. Our contribution wants to make such common beliefs
explicit and encourage critical thinking around these topics, supported by
simple but noteworthy counterexamples. The hope is to clarify the distinction
between the different issues and promote separate but intertwined research
directions to address them.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种分解自注意力机制的方法（LS-attention），通过分离局部和全局注意力头来解决训练不稳定的问题，显著提升了训练效率和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在短距离依赖任务中存在局限性，导致训练不稳定（如损失值突增或发散）。

Method: 将自注意力分解为局部（短距离）和全局（长距离）注意力头，称为LS-attention。

Result: LS-attention显著降低了验证困惑度（降至其他方法的2/5），并减少GPU计算时间（仅为其他方法的1/20），同时推理延迟降低36%。

Conclusion: LS-attention通过优化注意力机制，有效解决了训练不稳定性，提升了模型性能和效率。

Abstract: Transformer language models have driven significant progress across various
fields, including natural language processing and computer vision. A central
component of these models is the self-attention (SA) mechanism, which learns
rich vector representations of tokens by modeling their relationships with
others in a sequence. However, despite extensive research, transformers
continue to suffer from training instability -- often manifesting as spikes or
divergence in the training loss during a run.
  In this work, we identify one source of this instability: SA's limited
ability to capture short-range dependencies, especially in tasks like language
modeling, where almost every token heavily relies on its nearby neighbors. This
limitation causes the pre-softmax logits of SA to grow rapidly, destabilizing
training. To address this, we propose decomposing the SA into local
(short-range) and global (long-range) attention heads. This decomposed
attention, referred to as Long Short-attention (LS-attention), mitigates logit
explosion and results in more stable training compared to an equivalent
multi-head self-attention (MHSA). Empirical comparisons with two alternative
training stabilization methods show that LS-attention reduces the validation
perplexity to nearly 2/5 of that achieved by one method and reaches a similar
perplexity as the other method using only 1/20 of the GPU hours. Additionally,
our experiments demonstrate that LS-attention reduces inference latency by up
to 36% compared to a state-of-the-art implementation of equivalent MHSA.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种评估数据稀疏性对基于机器学习的电力系统故障检测（FD）和故障线路识别（FLI）性能影响的框架，结果显示FD模型对数据稀疏性具有鲁棒性，而FLI性能受显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德国向可再生能源转型的电力系统需要先进监控技术，但数据稀疏性（如传感器故障或通信中断）对基于机器学习的保护方法的影响尚未系统验证。

Method: 通过模拟现实数据稀疏场景，评估其对FD和FLI性能的影响，并应用于现有ML框架进行验证。

Result: FD模型在数据减少50倍后F1分数仍为0.999±0.000，而FLI性能因电压测量缺失和关键点通信故障分别下降55.61%和9.73%。

Conclusion: 研究为优化电力系统保护中的ML模型提供了实用建议，支持FD的高效性和FLI的针对性改进。

Abstract: Germany's transition to a renewable energy-based power system is reshaping
grid operations, requiring advanced monitoring and control to manage
decentralized generation. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool
for power system protection, particularly for fault detection (FD) and fault
line identification (FLI) in transmission grids. However, ML model reliability
depends on data quality and availability. Data sparsity resulting from sensor
failures, communication disruptions, or reduced sampling rates poses a
challenge to ML-based FD and FLI. Yet, its impact has not been systematically
validated prior to this work. In response, we propose a framework to assess the
impact of data sparsity on ML-based FD and FLI performance. We simulate
realistic data sparsity scenarios, evaluate their impact, derive quantitative
insights, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this evaluation strategy by
applying it to an existing ML-based framework. Results show the ML model
remains robust for FD, maintaining an F1-score of 0.999 $\pm$ 0.000 even after
a 50x data reduction. In contrast, FLI is more sensitive, with performance
decreasing by 55.61% for missing voltage measurements and 9.73% due to
communication failures at critical network points. These findings offer
actionable insights for optimizing ML models for real-world grid protection.
This enables more efficient FD and supports targeted improvements in FLI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常关注单个神经元或人类可解释的特征，而忽略了分布式的层级模式。本文旨在通过NAP方法填补这一空白，以更好地理解和解释神经网络的行为。

Method: 采用NAP方法，对全层激活分布进行聚类，改进了归一化、分布估计、距离度量等技术，并在视觉对象识别和无线电接收器模型中进行实验。

Result: 在无线电接收器模型中，未发现离散概念，而是观察到由信噪比（SNR）塑造的连续激活流形，表明SNR是关键学习因素。改进后的NAP方法提高了分布内与分布外的分离效果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了聚类设计和激活流形在解释和调试神经网络行为中的重要性，改进的NAP方法有助于提升模型的泛化能力和聚类质量。

Abstract: Concept discovery in neural networks often targets individual neurons or
human-interpretable features, overlooking distributed layer-wide patterns. We
study the Neural Activation Pattern (NAP) methodology, which clusters
full-layer activation distributions to identify such layer-level concepts.
Applied to visual object recognition and radio receiver models, we propose
improved normalization, distribution estimation, distance metrics, and varied
cluster selection. In the radio receiver model, distinct concepts did not
emerge; instead, a continuous activation manifold shaped by Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (SNR) was observed -- highlighting SNR as a key learned factor,
consistent with classical receiver behavior and supporting physical
plausibility. Our enhancements to NAP improved in-distribution vs.
out-of-distribution separation, suggesting better generalization and indirectly
validating clustering quality. These results underscore the importance of
clustering design and activation manifolds in interpreting and troubleshooting
neural network behavior.

Method: 采用强化学习微调预训练模型，通过下游数值适应度生成奖励信号，直接优化生成策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂数据分布下提高了方程生成的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了基础模型在Data2Eqn任务中的领域适应性问题，并生成了更具数学意义的方程。

Abstract: The data-to-equation (Data2Eqn) task aims to discover interpretable
mathematical equations that map observed values to labels, offering physical
insights and broad applicability across academic and industrial domains.
Genetic programming and traditional deep learning-based approaches suffer from
search inefficiency and poor generalization on small task-specific datasets.
Foundation models showed promise in this area, but existing approaches suffer
from: 1) They are pretrained on general-purpose data distributions, making them
less effective for domain-specific tasks; and 2) their training objectives
focus on token-level alignment, overlooking mathematical semantics, which can
lead to inaccurate equations. To address these issues, we aim to enhance the
domain adaptability of foundation models for Data2Eqn tasks. In this work, we
propose a reinforcement learning-based finetuning framework that directly
optimizes the generation policy of a pretrained model through reward signals
derived from downstream numerical fitness. Our method allows the model to adapt
to specific and complex data distributions and generate mathematically
meaningful equations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
improves both the accuracy and robustness of equation generation under complex
distributions.

Result: 实验证明FLowDUP在多种异构数据集上表现优异，并通过消融研究验证方法有效性。

Conclusion: FLowDUP为无标签数据的客户端提供了高效且理论支持的个性化模型生成方法。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning has emerged as a popular approach to training
on devices holding statistically heterogeneous data, known as clients. However,
most existing approaches require a client to have labeled data for training or
finetuning in order to obtain their own personalized model. In this paper we
address this by proposing FLowDUP, a novel method that is able to generate a
personalized model using only a forward pass with unlabeled data. The generated
model parameters reside in a low-dimensional subspace, enabling efficient
communication and computation. FLowDUP's learning objective is theoretically
motivated by our new transductive multi-task PAC-Bayesian generalization bound,
that provides performance guarantees for unlabeled clients. The objective is
structured in such a way that it allows both clients with labeled data and
clients with only unlabeled data to contribute to the training process. To
supplement our theoretical results we carry out a thorough experimental
evaluation of FLowDUP, demonstrating strong empirical performance on a range of
datasets with differing sorts of statistically heterogeneous clients. Through
numerous ablation studies, we test the efficacy of the individual components of
the method.

Conclusion: RWM结合了强化学习的灵活性和快速纠错能力，为高维连续控制任务在动态变化中保持性能提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Deploying learned control policies in real-world environments poses a
fundamental challenge. When system dynamics change unexpectedly, performance
degrades until models are retrained on new data. We introduce Reflexive World
Models (RWM), a dual control framework that uses world model predictions as
implicit reference trajectories for rapid adaptation. Our method separates the
control problem into long-term reward maximization through reinforcement
learning and robust motor execution through rapid latent control. This dual
architecture achieves significantly faster adaptation with low online
computational cost compared to model-based RL baselines, while maintaining
near-optimal performance. The approach combines the benefits of flexible policy
learning through reinforcement learning with rapid error correction
capabilities, providing a principled approach to maintaining performance in
high-dimensional continuous control tasks under varying dynamics.

Result: 高噪声扩散显著降低性能（57%），低噪声无法全面防御，新攻击策略可绕过低噪声防御。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性与性能的权衡仍需解决。

Abstract: While foundation models demonstrate impressive performance across various
tasks, they remain vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Current research explores
various approaches to enhance model robustness, with Diffusion Denoised
Smoothing emerging as a particularly promising technique. This method employs a
pretrained diffusion model to preprocess inputs before model inference. Yet,
its effectiveness remains largely unexplored beyond classification. We aim to
address this gap by analyzing three datasets with four distinct downstream
tasks under three different adversarial attack algorithms. Our findings reveal
that while foundation models maintain resilience against conventional
transformations, applying high-noise diffusion denoising to clean images
without any distortions significantly degrades performance by as high as 57%.
Low-noise diffusion settings preserve performance but fail to provide adequate
protection across all attack types. Moreover, we introduce a novel attack
strategy specifically targeting the diffusion process itself, capable of
circumventing defenses in the low-noise regime. Our results suggest that the
trade-off between adversarial robustness and performance remains a challenge to
be addressed.

Abstract: The rise of IoT has increased the need for on-edge machine learning, with
TinyML emerging as a promising solution for resource-constrained devices such
as MCU. However, evaluating their performance remains challenging due to
diverse architectures and application scenarios. Current solutions have many
non-negligible limitations. This work introduces an alternative benchmarking
methodology that integrates energy and latency measurements while
distinguishing three execution phases pre-inference, inference, and
post-inference. Additionally, the setup ensures that the device operates
without being powered by an external measurement unit, while automated testing
can be leveraged to enhance statistical significance. To evaluate our setup, we
tested the STM32N6 MCU, which includes a NPU for executing neural networks. Two
configurations were considered: high-performance and Low-power. The variation
of the EDP was analyzed separately for each phase, providing insights into the
impact of hardware configurations on energy efficiency. Each model was tested
1000 times to ensure statistically relevant results. Our findings demonstrate
that reducing the core voltage and clock frequency improve the efficiency of
pre- and post-processing without significantly affecting network execution
performance. This approach can also be used for cross-platform comparisons to
determine the most efficient inference platform and to quantify how pre- and
post-processing overhead varies across different hardware implementations.

Result: 嵌入是延迟泛化的关键因素，提出的方法能有效加速收敛并改善训练动态。

Conclusion: 嵌入的动态和双线性耦合机制是延迟泛化的核心，优化方法可推广至Transformer训练。

Abstract: Grokking, a delayed generalization in neural networks after perfect training
performance, has been observed in Transformers and MLPs, but the components
driving it remain underexplored. We show that embeddings are central to
grokking: introducing them into MLPs induces delayed generalization in modular
arithmetic tasks, whereas MLPs without embeddings can generalize immediately.
Our analysis identifies two key mechanisms: (1) Embedding update dynamics,
where rare tokens stagnate due to sparse gradient updates and weight decay, and
(2) Bilinear coupling, where the interaction between embeddings and downstream
weights introduces saddle points and increases sensitivity to initialization.
To confirm these mechanisms, we investigate frequency-aware sampling, which
balances token updates by minimizing gradient variance, and embedding-specific
learning rates, derived from the asymmetric curvature of the bilinear loss
landscape. We prove that an adaptive learning rate ratio,
\(\frac{\eta_E}{\eta_W} \propto \frac{\sigma_{\max}(E)}{\sigma_{\max}(W)} \cdot
\frac{f_W}{f_E}\), mitigates bilinear coupling effects, accelerating
convergence. Our methods not only improve grokking dynamics but also extend to
broader challenges in Transformer optimization, where bilinear interactions
hinder efficient training.

Abstract: Machine learning explainability aims to make the decision-making process of
black-box models more transparent by finding the most important input features
for a given prediction task. Recent works have proposed composing explanations
from semantic concepts (e.g., colors, patterns, shapes) that are inherently
interpretable to the user of a model. However, these methods generally ignore
the communicative context of explanation-the ability of the user to understand
the prediction of the model from the explanation. For example, while a medical
doctor might understand an explanation in terms of clinical markers, a patient
may need a more accessible explanation to make sense of the same diagnosis. In
this paper, we address this gap with listener-adaptive explanations. We propose
an iterative procedure grounded in principles of pragmatic reasoning and the
rational speech act to generate explanations that maximize communicative
utility. Our procedure only needs access to pairwise preferences between
candidate explanations, relevant in real-world scenarios where a listener model
may not be available. We evaluate our method in image classification tasks,
demonstrating improved alignment between explanations and listener preferences
across three datasets. Furthermore, we perform a user study that demonstrates
our explanations increase communicative utility.

Motivation: 神经架构搜索（NAS）在深度学习中的广泛应用导致能源消耗增加，需要能量感知基准测试来平衡模型能耗与准确性。

Method: 提出三个设计原则（可靠功率测量、广泛的GPU使用范围、全面成本报告），分析EA-HAS-Bench，并建议校准实验。

Result: 发现GPU测量API选择对结果质量影响显著，校准实验将最大不准确性从10.3%降至6.6%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了能量感知基准测试的关键考虑因素，并提供了设计新基准的初步指南。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) accelerates progress in deep learning
through systematic refinement of model architectures. The downside is
increasingly large energy consumption during the search process.
Surrogate-based benchmarking mitigates the cost of full training by querying a
pre-trained surrogate to obtain an estimate for the quality of the model.
Specifically, energy-aware benchmarking aims to make it possible for NAS to
favourably trade off model energy consumption against accuracy. Towards this
end, we propose three design principles for such energy-aware benchmarks: (i)
reliable power measurements, (ii) a wide range of GPU usage, and (iii) holistic
cost reporting. We analyse EA-HAS-Bench based on these principles and find that
the choice of GPU measurement API has a large impact on the quality of results.
Using the Nvidia System Management Interface (SMI) on top of its underlying
library influences the sampling rate during the initial data collection,
returning faulty low-power estimations. This results in poor correlation with
accurate measurements obtained from an external power meter. With this study,
we bring to attention several key considerations when performing energy-aware
surrogate-based benchmarking and derive first guidelines that can help design
novel benchmarks. We show a narrow usage range of the four GPUs attached to our
device, ranging from 146 W to 305 W in a single-GPU setting, and narrowing down
even further when using all four GPUs. To improve holistic energy reporting, we
propose calibration experiments over assumptions made in popular tools, such as
Code Carbon, thus achieving reductions in the maximum inaccuracy from 10.3 % to
8.9 % without and to 6.6 % with prior estimation of the expected load on the
device.

Motivation: 解决贝叶斯集成学习在在线、持续学习环境中的优化问题，揭示BMA的局限性，并通过新视角重新解释现有方法。

Method: 提出OBS方法，通过优化预测分布的对数分数自适应组合贝叶斯模型，并与投资组合选择理论建立联系。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，OBS在某些场景下优于在线BMA，并提供了选择方法的指导原则。

Conclusion: OBS为贝叶斯集成学习提供了高效且理论支持的新方法，明确了其与BMA的适用场景。

Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of Bayesian ensembles and address the
challenge of learning optimal combinations of Bayesian models in an online,
continual learning setting. To this end, we reinterpret existing approaches
such as Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and Bayesian stacking through a novel
empirical Bayes lens, shedding new light on the limitations and pathologies of
BMA. Further motivated by insights from online optimization, we propose Online
Bayesian Stacking (OBS), a method that optimizes the log-score over predictive
distributions to adaptively combine Bayesian models. A key contribution of our
work is establishing a novel connection between OBS and portfolio selection,
bridging Bayesian ensemble learning with a rich, well-studied theoretical
framework that offers efficient algorithms and extensive regret analysis. We
further clarify the relationship between OBS and online BMA, showing that they
optimize related but distinct cost functions. Through theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluation, we identify scenarios where OBS outperforms online BMA
and provide principled guidance on when practitioners should prefer one
approach over the other.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Track-and-Stop算法在存在多个最优臂时性能不足，需要改进以实现实例最优性。

Method: 提出了一种改进的停止规则，并引入新的信息理论下界，明确考虑多个最优臂。

Result: 改进的停止规则紧密匹配新的信息理论下界，证明了其最优性。

Conclusion: 改进的Track-and-Stop算法在多个最优臂情况下仍能保持实例最优性。

Abstract: We study the problem of best-arm identification in stochastic multi-armed
bandits under the fixed-confidence setting, with a particular focus on
instances that admit multiple optimal arms. While the Track-and-Stop algorithm
of Garivier and Kaufmann (2016) is widely conjectured to be instance-optimal,
its performance in the presence of multiple optima has remained insufficiently
understood. In this work, we revisit the Track-and-Stop strategy and propose a
modified stopping rule that ensures instance-optimality even when the set of
optimal arms is not a singleton. Our analysis introduces a new
information-theoretic lower bound that explicitly accounts for multiple optimal
arms, and we demonstrate that our stopping rule tightly matches this bound.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于高斯噪声注入的扰动随机梯度下降（PSGD）框架，解决了差分隐私（DP）随机非凸优化中二阶平稳点（SOSP）收敛误差率高和依赖辅助私有模型选择的问题。

Motivation: 现有方法在DP随机非凸优化中存在收敛误差率高和依赖辅助私有模型选择的局限性，影响了实用性和分布式环境下的性能。

Method: 提出PSGD框架，利用模型漂移距离判断鞍点逃逸，结合自适应DP-SPIDER梯度估计器，开发了新的DP算法，并扩展到分布式学习。

Conclusion: 该框架避免了二阶信息或额外DP-SOSP识别，显著提升了实用性和分布式环境下的性能。

Abstract: We investigate the problem of finding second-order stationary points (SOSP)
in differentially private (DP) stochastic non-convex optimization. Existing
methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) inaccurate convergence error rate
due to overlooking gradient variance in the saddle point escape analysis, and
(ii) dependence on auxiliary private model selection procedures for identifying
DP-SOSP, which can significantly impair utility, particularly in distributed
settings. To address these issues, we propose a generic perturbed stochastic
gradient descent (PSGD) framework built upon Gaussian noise injection and
general gradient oracles. A core innovation of our framework is using model
drift distance to determine whether PSGD escapes saddle points, ensuring
convergence to approximate local minima without relying on second-order
information or additional DP-SOSP identification. By leveraging the adaptive
DP-SPIDER estimator as a specific gradient oracle, we develop a new DP
algorithm that rectifies the convergence error rates reported in prior work. We
further extend this algorithm to distributed learning with arbitrarily
heterogeneous data, providing the first formal guarantees for finding DP-SOSP
in such settings. Our analysis also highlights the detrimental impacts of
private selection procedures in distributed learning under high-dimensional
models, underscoring the practical benefits of our design. Numerical
experiments on real-world datasets validate the efficacy of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策树是机器学习中的基础工具，但构建小型决策树（最小化大小或深度）是一个重要问题。研究其参数化复杂性有助于理解问题的计算难度。

Method: 通过参数化分析，研究了DTSO和DTDO问题，分别关注决策树的大小和深度。引入了参数δ_max和t，并分析了问题的W[1]-难性和FPT性质。

Result: 证明了DTSO和DTDO在参数s+δ_max和d+δ_max下是W[1]-难的，但在引入参数t后变为FPT。同时给出了核化复杂性的正负结果。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了决策树学习问题的计算复杂性，为后续算法设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Decision trees are a fundamental tool in machine learning for representing,
classifying, and generalizing data. It is desirable to construct ``small''
decision trees, by minimizing either the \textit{size} ($s$) or the
\textit{depth} $(d)$ of the \textit{decision tree} (\textsc{DT}). Recently, the
parameterized complexity of \textsc{Decision Tree Learning} has attracted a lot
of attention. We consider a generalization of \textsc{Decision Tree Learning}
where given a \textit{classification instance} $E$ and an integer $t$, the task
is to find a ``small'' \textsc{DT} that disagrees with $E$ in at most $t$
examples. We consider two problems: \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO}, where the
goal is to construct a \textsc{DT} minimizing $s$ and $d$, respectively. We
first establish that both \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO} are W[1]-hard when
parameterized by $s+\delta_{max}$ and $d+\delta_{max}$, respectively, where
$\delta_{max}$ is the maximum number of features in which two differently
labeled examples can differ. We complement this result by showing that these
problems become \textsc{FPT} if we include the parameter $t$. We also consider
the kernelization complexity of these problems and establish several positive
and negative results for both \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO}.

Motivation: 研究学习曲线的行为特性，验证其是否如假设般单调且凸，并量化其异常行为的发生频率。

Method: 构建LCDB 1.1数据库，使用统计方法分析学习曲线的行为，识别异常曲线及其影响因素。

Result: 14%的学习曲线表现异常，某些学习器更易导致异常，特征缩放对改善异常行为效果有限。

Conclusion: 学习曲线的异常行为对下游任务有显著影响，LCDB 1.1为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Sample-wise learning curves plot performance versus training set size. They
are useful for studying scaling laws and speeding up hyperparameter tuning and
model selection. Learning curves are often assumed to be well-behaved: monotone
(i.e. improving with more data) and convex. By constructing the Learning Curves
Database 1.1 (LCDB 1.1), a large-scale database with high-resolution learning
curves, we show that learning curves are less often well-behaved than
previously thought. Using statistically rigorous methods, we observe
significant ill-behavior in approximately 14% of the learning curves, almost
twice as much as in previous estimates. We also identify which learners are to
blame and show that specific learners are more ill-behaved than others.
Additionally, we demonstrate that different feature scalings rarely resolve
ill-behavior. We evaluate the impact of ill-behavior on downstream tasks, such
as learning curve fitting and model selection, and find it poses significant
challenges, underscoring the relevance and potential of LCDB 1.1 as a
challenging benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Gradient-based learning imposes (deep) neural networks to be differentiable
at all steps. This includes model-based architectures constructed by unrolling
iterations of an iterative algorithm onto layers of a neural network, known as
algorithm unrolling. However, greedy sparse recovery algorithms depend on the
non-differentiable argsort operator, which hinders their integration into
neural networks. In this paper, we address this challenge in Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), two popular
representative algorithms in this class. We propose permutation-based variants
of these algorithms and approximate permutation matrices using "soft"
permutation matrices derived from softsort, a continuous relaxation of argsort.
We demonstrate -- both theoretically and numerically -- that Soft-OMP and
Soft-IHT, as differentiable counterparts of OMP and IHT and fully compatible
with neural network training, effectively approximate these algorithms with a
controllable degree of accuracy. This leads to the development of OMP- and
IHT-Net, fully trainable network architectures based on Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT,
respectively. Finally, by choosing weights as "structure-aware" trainable
parameters, we connect our approach to structured sparse recovery and
demonstrate its ability to extract latent sparsity patterns from data.

Conclusion: 该方法灵活且表达性强，能够支持复杂结构的关系数据集生成。

Abstract: Data synthesis is gaining momentum as a privacy-enhancing technology. While
single-table tabular data generation has seen considerable progress, current
methods for multi-table data often lack the flexibility and expressiveness
needed to capture complex relational structures. In particular, they struggle
with long-range dependencies and complex foreign-key relationships, such as
tables with multiple parent tables or multiple types of links between the same
pair of tables. We propose a generative model for relational data that
generates the content of a relational dataset given the graph formed by the
foreign-key relationships. We do this by learning a deep generative model of
the content of the whole relational database by flow matching, where the neural
network trained to denoise records leverages a graph neural network to obtain
information from connected records. Our method is flexible, as it can support
relational datasets with complex structures, and expressive, as the generation
of each record can be influenced by any other record within the same connected
component. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that
it achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of synthetic data fidelity.

Result: 证明了非分割、非不可知高元PAC学习隐含高元Haussler打包性质，进而推出VCNk维度的有限性。

Conclusion: 完成了高元PAC学习理论的特征化，为相关领域提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Recently, the authors introduced the theory of high-arity PAC learning, which
is well-suited for learning graphs, hypergraphs and relational structures. In
the same initial work, the authors proved a high-arity analogue of the
Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning that almost completely
characterizes all notions of high-arity PAC learning in terms of a
combinatorial dimension, called the Vapnik--Chervonenkis--Natarajan (VCN${}_k$)
$k$-dimension, leaving as an open problem only the characterization of
non-partite, non-agnostic high-arity PAC learnability.
  In this work, we complete this characterization by proving that non-partite
non-agnostic high-arity PAC learnability implies a high-arity version of the
Haussler packing property, which in turn implies finiteness of
VCN${}_k$-dimension. This is done by obtaining direct proofs that classic PAC
learnability implies classic Haussler packing property, which in turn implies
finite Natarajan dimension and noticing that these direct proofs nicely lift to
high-arity.

Result: 发现LTC比CTL更具挑战性，并推进了隐私或对抗性单独场景下的理论结果。

Conclusion: 研究为离线对齐中的隐私与鲁棒性提供了新的理论见解，并展示了不同场景下的性能差异。

Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate the effects of noisy labels in
offline alignment, with a focus on the interplay between privacy and robustness
against adversarial corruption. Specifically, under linear modeling
assumptions, we present a unified analysis covering both reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) under
different privacy-corruption scenarios, such as Local differential
privacy-then-Corruption (LTC), where human preference labels are privatized
before being corrupted by an adversary, and Corruption-then-Local differential
privacy (CTL), where labels are corrupted before privacy protection. Our
analysis leverages a reduction framework that reduces the offline alignment
problem under linear modeling assumptions to parameter estimation in logistic
regression. This framework allows us to establish an interesting separation
result between LTC and CTL, demonstrating that LTC presents a greater challenge
than CTL in offline alignment, even under linear models. As important
by-products, our findings also advance the state-of-the-art theoretical results
in offline alignment under privacy-only or corruption-only scenarios.

TLDR: 论文提出两种在本地差分隐私（LDP）下的方法，解决传统共形预测（CP）依赖干净标签校准集的问题，适用于隐私敏感场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共形预测需要干净的校准标签，但在隐私敏感场景中，聚合者不可信且只能访问扰动后的标签。

Method: 1. 用户提供输入特征和扰动标签（k-ary随机响应）；2. 用户对共形分数加噪（二分搜索响应），需访问分类模型。

Result: 两种方法直接从噪声数据计算共形阈值，无需真实标签，证明了有限样本覆盖保证，且在严重随机化下仍稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法将强本地隐私与预测不确定性控制结合，适用于医疗影像或大语言模型查询等敏感场景。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides sets of candidate classes with a
guaranteed probability of containing the true class. However, it typically
relies on a calibration set with clean labels. We address privacy-sensitive
scenarios where the aggregator is untrusted and can only access a perturbed
version of the true labels. We propose two complementary approaches under local
differential privacy (LDP). In the first approach, users do not access the
model but instead provide their input features and a perturbed label using a
k-ary randomized response. In the second approach, which enforces stricter
privacy constraints, users add noise to their conformity score by binary search
response. This method requires access to the classification model but preserves
both data and label privacy. Both approaches compute the conformal threshold
directly from noisy data without accessing the true labels. We prove
finite-sample coverage guarantees and demonstrate robust coverage even under
severe randomization. This approach unifies strong local privacy with
predictive uncertainty control, making it well-suited for sensitive
applications such as medical imaging or large language model queries,
regardless of whether users can (or are willing to) compute their own scores.

Result: 实验证明HTGN在动态链接预测中表现优异，内存成本降低50%。

Conclusion: HTGN通过引入高阶结构和优化内存使用，显著提升了时间图神经网络的表达能力和效率。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have gained growing attention for
modeling and predicting structures in temporal graphs. However, existing TGNNs
primarily focus on pairwise interactions while overlooking higher-order
structures that are integral to link formation and evolution in real-world
temporal graphs. Meanwhile, these models often suffer from efficiency
bottlenecks, further limiting their expressive power. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Higher-order structure Temporal Graph Neural Network,
which incorporates hypergraph representations into temporal graph learning. In
particular, we develop an algorithm to identify the underlying higher-order
structures, enhancing the model's ability to capture the group interactions.
Furthermore, by aggregating multiple edge features into hyperedge
representations, HTGN effectively reduces memory cost during training. We
theoretically demonstrate the enhanced expressiveness of our approach and
validate its effectiveness and efficiency through extensive experiments on
various real-world temporal graphs. Experimental results show that HTGN
achieves superior performance on dynamic link prediction while reducing memory
costs by up to 50\% compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for integrating fragmented multi-modal data in
Alzheimer's disease (AD) research using large language models (LLMs) and
knowledge graphs. While traditional multimodal analysis requires matched
patient IDs across datasets, our approach demonstrates population-level
integration of MRI, gene expression, biomarkers, EEG, and clinical indicators
from independent cohorts. Statistical analysis identified significant features
in each modality, which were connected as nodes in a knowledge graph. LLMs then
analyzed the graph to extract potential correlations and generate hypotheses in
natural language. This approach revealed several novel relationships, including
a potential pathway linking metabolic risk factors to tau protein abnormalities
via neuroinflammation (r>0.6, p<0.001), and unexpected correlations between
frontal EEG channels and specific gene expression profiles (r=0.42-0.58,
p<0.01). Cross-validation with independent datasets confirmed the robustness of
major findings, with consistent effect sizes across cohorts (variance <15%).
The reproducibility of these findings was further supported by expert review
(Cohen's k=0.82) and computational validation. Our framework enables cross
modal integration at a conceptual level without requiring patient ID matching,
offering new possibilities for understanding AD pathology through fragmented
data reuse and generating testable hypotheses for future research.

Abstract: Continuous time systems are often modeled using discrete time dynamics but
this requires a small simulation step to maintain accuracy. In turn, this
requires a large planning horizon which leads to computationally demanding
planning problems and reduced performance. Previous work in model free
reinforcement learning has partially addressed this issue using action repeats
where a policy is learned to determine a discrete action duration. Instead we
propose to control the continuous decision timescale directly by using
temporally-extended actions and letting the planner treat the duration of the
action as an additional optimization variable along with the standard action
variables. This additional structure has multiple advantages. It speeds up
simulation time of trajectories and, importantly, it allows for deep horizon
search in terms of primitive actions while using a shallow search depth in the
planner. In addition, in the model based reinforcement learning (MBRL) setting,
it reduces compounding errors from model learning and improves training time
for models. We show that this idea is effective and that the range for action
durations can be automatically selected using a multi-armed bandit formulation
and integrated into the MBRL framework. An extensive experimental evaluation
both in planning and in MBRL, shows that our approach yields faster planning,
better solutions, and that it enables solutions to problems that are not solved
in the standard formulation.

Abstract: Deep learning-based models have demonstrated remarkable success in solving
illposed inverse problems; however, many fail to strictly adhere to the
physical constraints imposed by the measurement process. In this work, we
introduce a projection-based correction method to enhance the inference of deep
inverse networks by ensuring consistency with the forward model. Specifically,
given an initial estimate from a learned reconstruction network, we apply a
projection step that constrains the solution to lie within the valid solution
space of the inverse problem. We theoretically demonstrate that if the recovery
model is a well-trained deep inverse network, the solution can be decomposed
into range-space and null-space components, where the projection-based
correction reduces to an identity transformation. Extensive simulations and
experiments validate the proposed method, demonstrating improved reconstruction
accuracy across diverse inverse problems and deep network architectures.

Abstract: In this work, we contribute the first approach to solve infinite-horizon
discounted general-utility Markov decision processes (GUMDPs) in the
single-trial regime, i.e., when the agent's performance is evaluated based on a
single trajectory. First, we provide some fundamental results regarding policy
optimization in the single-trial regime, investigating which class of policies
suffices for optimality, casting our problem as a particular MDP that is
equivalent to our original problem, as well as studying the computational
hardness of policy optimization in the single-trial regime. Second, we show how
we can leverage online planning techniques, in particular a Monte-Carlo tree
search algorithm, to solve GUMDPs in the single-trial regime. Third, we provide
experimental results showcasing the superior performance of our approach in
comparison to relevant baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文通过算法信息理论（AIT）为大型语言模型（LLM）的成功提供了统一的理论框架，揭示了训练过程与Solomonoff先验的近似关系，并提出了基于预测置信度的少样本学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论框架对LLM行为的解释较为分散，缺乏统一的数学视角。研究旨在填补这一空白，为LLM的成功提供理论基础。

Method: 通过算法信息理论（AIT）证明LLM训练过程近似Solomonoff先验，并提出基于预测置信度的少样本示例选择方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样本分类任务中显著提升了性能，尤其是对小模型架构。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM的理论基础与实践行为搭建了桥梁，兼具解释力和实用性，为未来模型开发提供了指导。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) calls for a rigorous
theoretical framework to explain their empirical success. While significant
progress has been made in understanding LLM behaviors, existing theoretical
frameworks remain fragmented in explaining emergent phenomena through a unified
mathematical lens. We establish the first formal connection between LLM
architectures and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) by proving two
fundamental results: (1) the training process computationally approximates
Solomonoff prior through loss minimization interpreted as program length
optimization, and (2) next-token prediction implements approximate Solomonoff
induction. We leverage AIT to provide a unified theoretical explanation for
in-context learning, few-shot learning, and scaling laws. Furthermore, our
theoretical insights lead to a principled method for few-shot example selection
that prioritizes samples where models exhibit lower predictive confidence. We
demonstrate through experiments on diverse text classification benchmarks that
this strategy yields significant performance improvements, particularly for
smaller model architectures, when compared to selecting high-confidence
examples. Our framework bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and
practical LLM behaviors, providing both explanatory power and actionable
insights for future model development.

### [152] [Fair Supervised Learning Through Constraints on Smooth Nonconvex Unfairness-Measure Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15788)
*Zahra Khatti,Daniel P. Robinson,Frank E. Curtis*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出了一种新的公平监督机器学习策略，通过平滑非凸替代函数和硬约束解决现有方法的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平监督学习方法中，不连续不公平度量的Heaviside函数难以处理，且正则化方法导致优化问题复杂且参数调优成本高。

Method: 引入平滑非凸替代函数近似Heaviside函数，并采用硬约束而非正则化，以强制不公平度量的容忍度。

Result: 提出的策略能有效确保模型公平性，且优化问题易于求解，调优成本低。

Conclusion: 新策略通过平滑替代和硬约束，解决了公平监督学习中的关键问题，具有实际应用优势。

Abstract: A new strategy for fair supervised machine learning is proposed. The main
advantages of the proposed strategy as compared to others in the literature are
as follows. (a) We introduce a new smooth nonconvex surrogate to approximate
the Heaviside functions involved in discontinuous unfairness measures. The
surrogate is based on smoothing methods from the optimization literature, and
is new for the fair supervised learning literature. The surrogate is a tight
approximation which ensures the trained prediction models are fair, as opposed
to other (e.g., convex) surrogates that can fail to lead to a fair prediction
model in practice. (b) Rather than rely on regularizers (that lead to
optimization problems that are difficult to solve) and corresponding
regularization parameters (that can be expensive to tune), we propose a
strategy that employs hard constraints so that specific tolerances for
unfairness can be enforced without the complications associated with the use of
regularization. (c)~Our proposed strategy readily allows for constraints on
multiple (potentially conflicting) unfairness measures at the same time.
Multiple measures can be considered with a regularization approach, but at the
cost of having even more difficult optimization problems to solve and further
expense for tuning. By contrast, through hard constraints, our strategy leads
to optimization models that can be solved tractably with minimal tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中（如医学和安全），验证深度学习网络的IID泛化能力至关重要，但现有方法难以在小规模数据上提供非平凡的泛化保证。

Method: 通过模型融合而非微调的方式学习下游任务，使泛化差距变小且独立于基础网络规模。

Result: 首次在仅100个样本的情况下，为VIT-B和mistral-7B等大型模型提供了非平凡的泛化保证。

Conclusion: 该方法为现有系统的可信认证提供了直接支持，并为实践与理论的结合研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Certifying the IID generalisation ability of deep networks is the first of
many requirements for trusting AI in high-stakes applications from medicine to
security. However, when instantiating generalisation bounds for deep networks
it remains challenging to obtain non-vacuous guarantees, especially when
applying contemporary large models on the small scale data prevalent in such
high-stakes fields. In this paper, we draw a novel connection between a family
of learning methods based on model fusion and generalisation certificates, and
surprisingly show that with minor adjustment several existing learning
strategies already provide non-trivial generalisation guarantees. Essentially,
by focusing on data-driven learning of downstream tasks by fusion rather than
fine-tuning, the certified generalisation gap becomes tiny and independent of
the base network size, facilitating its certification. Our results show for the
first time non-trivial generalisation guarantees for learning with as low as
100 examples, while using vision models such as VIT-B and language models such
as mistral-7B. This observation is significant as it has immediate implications
for facilitating the certification of existing systems as trustworthy, and
opens up new directions for research at the intersection of practice and
theory.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the refractive environment over multiple frequencies
within the marine atmospheric boundary layer is crucial for the effective
deployment of radar technologies. Traditional parabolic equation simulations,
while effective, can be computationally expensive and time-intensive, limiting
their practical application. This communication explores a novel approach using
deep neural networks to estimate the pattern propagation factor, a critical
parameter for characterizing environmental impacts on signal propagation.
Image-to-image translation generators designed to ingest modified refractivity
data and generate predictions of pattern propagation factors over the same
domain were developed. Findings demonstrate that deep neural networks can be
trained to analyze multiple frequencies and reasonably predict the pattern
propagation factor, offering an alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of estimation and learning under temporal
distribution shift. Consider an observation sequence of length $n$, which is a
noisy realization of a time-varying groundtruth sequence. Our focus is to
develop methods to estimate the groundtruth at the final time-step while
providing sharp point-wise estimation error rates. We show that, without prior
knowledge on the level of temporal shift, a wavelet soft-thresholding estimator
provides an optimal estimation error bound for the groundtruth. Our proposed
estimation method generalizes existing researches Mazzetto and Upfal (2023) by
establishing a connection between the sequence's non-stationarity level and the
sparsity in the wavelet-transformed domain. Our theoretical findings are
validated by numerical experiments. Additionally, we applied the estimator to
derive sparsity-aware excess risk bounds for binary classification under
distribution shift and to develop computationally efficient training
objectives. As a final contribution, we draw parallels between our results and
the classical signal processing problem of total-variation denoising (Mammen
and van de Geer,1997; Tibshirani, 2014), uncovering novel optimal algorithms
for such task.

This work advances the state-of-the-art in conditional optimal transport,
enabling broader application of optimal transport principles to complex,

Abstract: We study the problem of creating strong, yet narrow, AI systems. While recent
AI progress has been driven by the training of large general-purpose foundation
models, the creation of smaller models specialized for narrow domains could be
valuable for both efficiency and safety. In this work, we explore two
challenges involved in creating such systems, having to do with basic
properties of how neural networks learn and structure their representations.
The first challenge regards when it is possible to train narrow models from
scratch. Through experiments on a synthetic task, we find that it is sometimes
necessary to train networks on a wide distribution of data to learn certain
narrow skills within that distribution. This effect arises when skills depend
on each other hierarchically, and training on a broad distribution introduces a
curriculum which substantially accelerates learning. The second challenge
regards how to transfer particular skills from large general models into small
specialized models. We find that model skills are often not perfectly localized
to a particular set of prunable components. However, we find that methods based
on pruning can still outperform distillation. We investigate the use of a
regularization objective to align desired skills with prunable components while
unlearning unnecessary skills.

Conclusion: BraInCoRL为视觉皮层建模提供高效、可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding functional representations within higher visual cortex is a
fundamental question in computational neuroscience. While artificial neural
networks pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit striking representational
alignment with human neural responses, learning image-computable models of
visual cortex relies on individual-level, large-scale fMRI datasets. The
necessity for expensive, time-intensive, and often impractical data acquisition
limits the generalizability of encoders to new subjects and stimuli. BraInCoRL
uses in-context learning to predict voxelwise neural responses from few-shot
examples without any additional finetuning for novel subjects and stimuli. We
leverage a transformer architecture that can flexibly condition on a variable
number of in-context image stimuli, learning an inductive bias over multiple
subjects. During training, we explicitly optimize the model for in-context
learning. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, our
model learns to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher
visual cortex. We demonstrate that BraInCoRL consistently outperforms existing
voxelwise encoder designs in a low-data regime when evaluated on entirely novel
images, while also exhibiting strong test-time scaling behavior. The model also
generalizes to an entirely new visual fMRI dataset, which uses different
subjects and fMRI data acquisition parameters. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates
better interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending
to semantically relevant stimuli. Finally, we show that our framework enables
interpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity.

Result: 反馈和验证方法使性能提升了一倍以上，而其他直观方法反而降低性能。

Conclusion: 反馈和验证是提升小规模LLM生成PDDL性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Using LLMs to generate formal planning languages such as PDDL that invokes
symbolic solvers to deterministically derive plans has been shown to outperform
generating plans directly. While this success has been limited to
closed-sourced models or particular LLM pipelines, we design and evaluate 8
different PDDL generation pipelines with open-source models under 50 billion
parameters previously shown to be incapable of this task. We find that
intuitive approaches such as using a high-resource language wrapper or
constrained decoding with grammar decrease performance, yet inference-time
scaling approaches such as revision with feedback from the solver and plan
validator more than double the performance.

Abstract: Instruction-following is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with user intent. While recent reasoning-oriented models exhibit impressive
performance on complex mathematical problems, their ability to adhere to
natural language instructions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
MathIF, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating instruction-following in
mathematical reasoning tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals a consistent
tension between scaling up reasoning capacity and maintaining controllability,
as models that reason more effectively often struggle to comply with user
directives. We find that models tuned on distilled long chains-of-thought or
trained with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning often degrade in
instruction adherence, especially when generation length increases.
Furthermore, we show that even simple interventions can partially recover
obedience, though at the cost of reasoning performance. These findings
highlight a fundamental tension in current LLM training paradigms and motivate
the need for more instruction-aware reasoning models. We release the code and
data at https://github.com/TingchenFu/MathIF.

Conclusion: 研究为优化多语言推理提供了实用建议，并为构建更可解释和适应性强的RLMs开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) excel at complex tasks by leveraging a
chain-of-thought process to generate structured intermediate steps. However,
language mixing, i.e., reasoning steps containing tokens from languages other
than the prompt, has been observed in their outputs and shown to affect
performance, though its impact remains debated. We present the first systematic
study of language mixing in RLMs, examining its patterns, impact, and internal
causes across 15 languages, 7 task difficulty levels, and 18 subject areas, and
show how all three factors influence language mixing. Moreover, we demonstrate
that the choice of reasoning language significantly affects performance:
forcing models to reason in Latin or Han scripts via constrained decoding
notably improves accuracy. Finally, we show that the script composition of
reasoning traces closely aligns with that of the model's internal
representations, indicating that language mixing reflects latent processing
preferences in RLMs. Our findings provide actionable insights for optimizing
multilingual reasoning and open new directions for controlling reasoning
languages to build more interpretable and adaptable RLMs.

Result: 准确性和一致性随预训练提升，主要由事实频率驱动；低频率非英语事实可通过跨语言迁移正确回忆。

Conclusion: 多语言事实获取通过频率驱动和跨语言迁移两种途径实现，前者为主，后者为辅且限于特定关系类型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of recalling multilingual factual
knowledge present in their pretraining data. However, most studies evaluate
only the final model, leaving the development of factual recall and
crosslingual consistency throughout pretraining largely unexplored. In this
work, we trace how factual recall and crosslingual consistency evolve during
pretraining, focusing on OLMo-7B as a case study. We find that both accuracy
and consistency improve over time for most languages. We show that this
improvement is primarily driven by the fact frequency in the pretraining
corpus: more frequent facts are more likely to be recalled correctly,
regardless of language. Yet, some low-frequency facts in non-English languages
can still be correctly recalled. Our analysis reveals that these instances
largely benefit from crosslingual transfer of their English counterparts -- an
effect that emerges predominantly in the early stages of pretraining. We
pinpoint two distinct pathways through which multilingual factual knowledge
acquisition occurs: (1) frequency-driven learning, which is dominant and
language-agnostic, and (2) crosslingual transfer, which is limited in scale and
typically constrained to relation types involving named entities. We release
our code and data to facilitate further research at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标准的自回归生成中，模型预测下一个标记的分布后仅采样离散标记，丢弃了分布信息。MoI旨在保留这些信息以提升生成质量。

Method: MoI在生成离散标记后，将其与丢弃的标记分布混合，使用贝叶斯估计方法生成连续后验期望作为新输入。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和博士级QA任务中，MoI在多个模型上均显著提升了性能，且无需额外训练和计算开销。

Conclusion: MoI通过保留标记分布信息，显著提升了自回归生成模型的性能，是一种高效且无需训练的方法。

Abstract: In standard autoregressive generation, an LLM predicts the next-token
distribution, samples a discrete token, and then discards the distribution,
passing only the sampled token as new input. To preserve this distribution's
rich information, we propose Mixture of Inputs (MoI), a training-free method
for autoregressive generation. After generating a token following the standard
paradigm, we construct a new input that blends the generated discrete token
with the previously discarded token distribution. Specifically, we employ a
Bayesian estimation method that treats the token distribution as the prior, the
sampled token as the observation, and replaces the conventional one-hot vector
with the continuous posterior expectation as the new model input. MoI allows
the model to maintain a richer internal representation throughout the
generation process, resulting in improved text quality and reasoning
capabilities. On mathematical reasoning, code generation, and PhD-level QA
tasks, MoI consistently improves performance across multiple models including
QwQ-32B, Nemotron-Super-49B, Gemma-3-27B, and DAPO-Qwen-32B, with no additional
training and negligible computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘指标无法捕捉真实场景中遗忘和保留查询共存的情况，导致评估不准确。

Method: 提出Mixed Prompt (MP)遗忘策略，将遗忘和保留查询整合为统一训练目标。

Result: 实验表明，MP策略显著提升了遗忘效果，即使在复杂场景中也能保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SEPS和MP方法为机器遗忘提供了更有效的评估和实现途径。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove targeted knowledge from Large
Language Models (LLMs), ensuring they forget specified content while retaining
essential information. Existing unlearning metrics assess whether a model
correctly answers retain queries and rejects forget queries, but they fail to
capture real-world scenarios where forget queries rarely appear in isolation.
In fact, forget and retain queries often coexist within the same prompt, making
mixed-query evaluation crucial.
  We introduce SEPS, an evaluation framework that explicitly measures a model's
ability to both forget and retain information within a single prompt. Through
extensive experiments across three benchmarks, we identify two key failure
modes in existing unlearning methods: (1) untargeted unlearning
indiscriminately erases both forget and retain content once a forget query
appears, and (2) targeted unlearning overfits to single-query scenarios,
leading to catastrophic failures when handling multiple queries. To address
these issues, we propose Mixed Prompt (MP) unlearning, a strategy that
integrates both forget and retain queries into a unified training objective.
Our approach significantly improves unlearning effectiveness, demonstrating
robustness even in complex settings with up to eight mixed forget and retain
queries in a single prompt.

TLDR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否表现出类似人类的性格特征，发现其性格动态且依赖外部输入，提出了分布式性格框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否具有类似人类的性格特征，以及传统性格评估工具的适用性。

Method: 采用行为基础方法，通过三项实证研究分析LLMs的性格稳定性、一致性和角色扮演中的表现。

Result: LLMs的性格特征动态且输入敏感，缺乏长期稳定性，内部一致性低，受提示和参数设置影响。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出流动、外部依赖的性格模式，为构建LLM专用性格框架和推动人机交互提供了见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like capabilities in
language comprehension and generation, becoming active participants in social
and cognitive domains. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit
personality-like traits and how these traits compare with human personality,
focusing on the applicability of conventional personality assessment tools. A
behavior-based approach was used across three empirical studies. Study 1
examined test-retest stability and found that LLMs show higher variability and
are more input-sensitive than humans, lacking long-term stability. Based on
this, we propose the Distributed Personality Framework, conceptualizing LLM
traits as dynamic and input-driven. Study 2 analyzed cross-variant consistency
in personality measures and found LLMs' responses were highly sensitive to item
wording, showing low internal consistency compared to humans. Study 3 explored
personality retention during role-playing, showing LLM traits are shaped by
prompt and parameter settings. These findings suggest that LLMs express fluid,
externally dependent personality patterns, offering insights for constructing
LLM-specific personality frameworks and advancing human-AI interaction. This
work contributes to responsible AI development and extends the boundaries of
personality psychology in the age of intelligent systems.

*Xi Wang,Jiaqian Hu,Safinah Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: MAATS是一种多代理自动翻译系统，利用MQM框架进行错误检测和翻译优化，显著优于传统单代理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单代理翻译系统依赖自我修正，无法充分捕捉多维度翻译错误，MAATS旨在通过多代理分工优化翻译质量。

Method: MAATS使用多个专注于不同MQM类别（如准确性、流畅性、风格等）的AI代理，并通过合成代理整合标注迭代优化翻译。

Result: MAATS在多语言对和LLM评估中表现优于零样本和单代理基线，尤其在语义准确性、本地化适应和远距离语言对中表现突出。

Conclusion: MAATS通过模块化代理角色与可解释的MQM维度结合，缩小了黑盒LLM与人工翻译工作流的差距，提升了语义和上下文保真度。

Abstract: We present MAATS, a Multi Agent Automated Translation System that leverages
the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework as a fine-grained signal
for error detection and refinement. MAATS employs multiple specialized AI
agents, each focused on a distinct MQM category (e.g., Accuracy, Fluency,
Style, Terminology), followed by a synthesis agent that integrates the
annotations to iteratively refine translations. This design contrasts with
conventional single-agent methods that rely on self-correction.
  Evaluated across diverse language pairs and Large Language Models (LLMs),
MAATS outperforms zero-shot and single-agent baselines with statistically
significant gains in both automatic metrics and human assessments. It excels
particularly in semantic accuracy, locale adaptation, and linguistically
distant language pairs. Qualitative analysis highlights its strengths in
multi-layered error diagnosis, omission detection across perspectives, and
context-aware refinement. By aligning modular agent roles with interpretable
MQM dimensions, MAATS narrows the gap between black-box LLMs and human
translation workflows, shifting focus from surface fluency to deeper semantic
and contextual fidelity.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Saten的低秩张量网络框架，用于压缩预训练大语言模型（LLMs），在微调阶段提升性能和压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练LLMs的高秩特性及缺乏预训练数据访问权，使得其压缩在微调阶段具有挑战性。

Method: 采用稀疏增强张量网络（Saten）框架，实现全模型压缩。

Result: 实验表明，Saten在张量化语言模型中提升了准确性和压缩效率，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Saten框架为资源受限设备部署LLMs提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: The efficient implementation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Low-rank tensor compression
techniques, such as tensor-train (TT) networks, have been widely studied for
over-parameterized neural networks. However, their applications to compress
pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks (post-training)
remains challenging due to the high-rank nature of pre-trained LLMs and the
lack of access to pretraining data. In this study, we investigate low-rank
tensorized LLMs during fine-tuning and propose sparse augmented tensor networks
(Saten) to enhance their performance. The proposed Saten framework enables full
model compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Saten enhances both
accuracy and compression efficiency in tensorized language models, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非英语构音障碍语音数据稀缺问题，提升ASR模型在构音障碍语音识别中的表现。

Method: 使用英语构音障碍语音微调语音转换模型，生成非英语构音障碍语音数据，用于微调多语言ASR模型MMS。

Result: 在西班牙语、意大利语和泰米尔语数据集上，该方法显著优于现成MMS模型和传统数据增强技术。

Conclusion: 生成的语音成功模拟构音障碍特征，有效提升了非英语构音障碍语音识别性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for dysarthric speech remains challenging
due to data scarcity, particularly in non-English languages. To address this,
we fine-tune a voice conversion model on English dysarthric speech (UASpeech)
to encode both speaker characteristics and prosodic distortions, then apply it
to convert healthy non-English speech (FLEURS) into non-English dysarthric-like
speech. The generated data is then used to fine-tune a multilingual ASR model,
Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS), for improved dysarthric speech
recognition. Evaluation on PC-GITA (Spanish), EasyCall (Italian), and SSNCE
(Tamil) demonstrates that VC with both speaker and prosody conversion
significantly outperforms the off-the-shelf MMS performance and conventional
augmentation techniques such as speed and tempo perturbation. Objective and
subjective analyses of the generated data further confirm that the generated
speech simulates dysarthric characteristics.

TLDR: 论文提出Big-$O_{tok}$框架和Token Cost指标，强调提示策略的效率（性能与token用量的平衡）比单纯性能更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的性能依赖于提示策略，但现有研究多关注性能而忽视效率，实际应用中需平衡性能与token用量。

Method: 提出Big-$O_{tok}$理论框架描述token用量增长，并引入Token Cost（每性能的token用量）作为实证指标，分析常见提示策略。

Result: 发现token用量增加会导致性能回报急剧递减，验证了Big-$O_{tok}$框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 效率评估（性能与token用量的平衡）对实际应用至关重要，Big-$O_{tok}$和Token Cost为提示策略提供了实用分析工具。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models have demonstrated remarkable
performance across diverse tasks. However, their task effectiveness is heavily
dependent on the prompting strategy used to elicit output, which can vary
widely in both performance and token usage. While task performance is often
used to determine prompting strategy success, we argue that
efficiency--balancing performance and token usage--can be a more practical
metric for real-world utility. To enable this, we propose Big-$O_{tok}$, a
theoretical framework for describing the token usage growth of prompting
strategies, and analyze Token Cost, an empirical measure of tokens per
performance. We apply these to several common prompting strategies and find
that increased token usage leads to drastically diminishing performance
returns. Our results validate the Big-$O_{tok}$ analyses and reinforce the need
for efficiency-aware evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: TreeDebater是一个新颖的辩论框架，通过引入Rehearsal Tree和Debate Flow Tree来优化竞争性辩论中的策略选择和时间分配，表现优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性辩论中存在时间限制和互动性挑战，需要更高效的辩论策略和框架。

Method: 提出TreeDebater框架，包含Rehearsal Tree和Debate Flow Tree，用于评估论点强度和跟踪辩论状态，并通过时间分配和观众反馈优化表现。

Result: TreeDebater在人类评估中优于现有多智能体辩论系统，且在时间分配策略上与人类专家一致。

Conclusion: TreeDebater通过树结构和动态时间管理，显著提升了竞争性辩论的表现。

Abstract: Winning competitive debates requires sophisticated reasoning and argument
skills. There are unique challenges in the competitive debate: (1) The time
constraints force debaters to make strategic choices about which points to
pursue rather than covering all possible arguments; (2) The persuasiveness of
the debate relies on the back-and-forth interaction between arguments, which a
single final game status cannot evaluate. To address these challenges, we
propose TreeDebater, a novel debate framework that excels in competitive
debate. We introduce two tree structures: the Rehearsal Tree and Debate Flow
Tree. The Rehearsal Tree anticipates the attack and defenses to evaluate the
strength of the claim, while the Debate Flow Tree tracks the debate status to
identify the active actions. TreeDebater allocates its time budget among
candidate actions and uses the speech time controller and feedback from the
simulated audience to revise its statement. The human evaluation on both the
stage-level and the debate-level comparison shows that our TreeDebater
outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-agent debate system. Further
investigation shows that TreeDebater shows better strategies in limiting time
to important debate actions, aligning with the strategies of human debate
experts.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种可扩展的框架，通过上下文学习（ICL）提升Phi-4多模态模型对陌生说话者和语言变体的适应能力，仅需少量示例即可显著降低词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类听众对陌生说话者和语言变体的适应能力是否适用于最先进的语音语言模型，并探索如何通过上下文学习提升模型性能。

Method: 引入一个可扩展框架，在Phi-4多模态模型中通过交错任务提示和音频-文本对实现上下文学习。

Result: 仅需12个示例（约50秒）即可将词错误率相对降低19.7%，在低资源变体中效果最显著。

Conclusion: 该ICL方案展示了与人类听众相似的性能特征，显著提升了ASR的鲁棒性，但仍存在某些变体的适应差距。

Abstract: Human listeners readily adjust to unfamiliar speakers and language varieties
through exposure, but do these adaptation benefits extend to state-of-the-art
spoken language models? We introduce a scalable framework that allows for
in-context learning (ICL) in Phi-4 Multimodal using interleaved task prompts
and audio-text pairs, and find that as few as 12 example utterances (~50
seconds) at inference time reduce word error rates by a relative 19.7% (1.2
pp.) on average across diverse English corpora. These improvements are most
pronounced in low-resource varieties, when the context and target speaker
match, and when more examples are provided--though scaling our procedure yields
diminishing marginal returns to context length. Overall, we find that our novel
ICL adaptation scheme (1) reveals a similar performance profile to human
listeners, and (2) demonstrates consistent improvements to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) robustness across diverse speakers and language backgrounds.
While adaptation succeeds broadly, significant gaps remain for certain
varieties, revealing where current models still fall short of human
flexibility. We release our prompts and code on GitHub.

TLDR: LLMs在状态追踪任务中的表现受状态空间大小和稀疏性影响，准确率随复杂度增加而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在确定性状态动态建模中的能力，填补对其状态转换动态理解的空白。

Method: 在三个领域（Box Tracking、Abstract DFA Sequences、Complex Text Games）测试LLMs的状态预测准确性，并通过激活修补技术识别关键注意力头。

Result: GPT-2 XL和Pythia-1B在低复杂度任务中表现尚可，但在高复杂度任务中准确率显著下降；发现特定注意力头负责状态信息传播。

Conclusion: LLMs的状态追踪能力源于分布式交互而非显式符号计算，状态-动作联合推理较弱。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in tasks requiring
internal state tracking, yet their ability to model state transition dynamics
remains poorly understood. We evaluate how well LLMs capture deterministic
state dynamics across 3 domains: Box Tracking, Abstract DFA Sequences, and
Complex Text Games, each formalizable as a finite-state system. Across tasks,
we find that next-state prediction accuracy degrades with increasing
state-space size and sparse transitions. GPT-2 XL reaches about 70% accuracy in
low-complexity settings but drops below 30% when the number of boxes or states
exceeds 5 or 10, respectively. In DFA tasks, Pythia-1B fails to exceed 50%
accuracy when the number of states is > 10 and transitions are < 30. Through
activation patching, we identify attention heads responsible for propagating
state information: GPT-2 XL Layer 22 Head 20, and Pythia-1B Heads at Layers 10,
11, 12, and 14. While these heads successfully move relevant state features,
action information is not reliably routed to the final token, indicating weak
joint state-action reasoning. Our results suggest that state tracking in LLMs
emerges from distributed interactions of next-token heads rather than explicit
symbolic computation.

TLDR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在遇到概念冲突时的行为，提出了概念不一致性（concept incongruence）的定义，并通过实验分析了模型在角色扮演场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解LLMs在面对用户提示或模型内部概念冲突时的行为，例如用户要求画一只“双角独角兽”时是否应纠正或直接执行。

Method: 方法包括定义概念不一致性，提出三个行为指标（回避率、条件准确率和回答率），并通过角色扮演实验分析模型在角色死亡后的表现。

Result: 结果显示模型在角色死亡后无法有效回避回答，且准确率下降。探针实验发现原因包括死亡状态编码不可靠和角色扮演导致的时间表征偏移。

Conclusion: 结论指出概念不一致性会导致模型行为异常，并提出了改进模型行为的方向。

Abstract: Consider this prompt "Draw a unicorn with two horns". Should large language
models (LLMs) recognize that a unicorn has only one horn by definition and ask
users for clarifications, or proceed to generate something anyway? We introduce
concept incongruence to capture such phenomena where concept boundaries clash
with each other, either in user prompts or in model representations, often
leading to under-specified or mis-specified behaviors. In this work, we take
the first step towards defining and analyzing model behavior under concept
incongruence. Focusing on temporal boundaries in the Role-Play setting, we
propose three behavioral metrics--abstention rate, conditional accuracy, and
answer rate--to quantify model behavior under incongruence due to the role's
death. We show that models fail to abstain after death and suffer from an
accuracy drop compared to the Non-Role-Play setting. Through probing
experiments, we identify two main causes: (i) unreliable encoding of the
"death" state across different years, leading to unsatisfactory abstention
behavior, and (ii) role playing causes shifts in the model's temporal
representations, resulting in accuracy drops. We leverage these insights to
improve consistency in the model's abstention and answer behaviors. Our
findings suggest that concept incongruence leads to unexpected model behaviors
and point to future directions on improving model behavior under concept
incongruence.

Result: TeleSEE在准确性和处理速度上优于基线方法，实验验证其高效性。

Conclusion: TeleSEE为电信领域提供了一种高效的结构化实体提取方案，支持6G网络智能化发展。

Abstract: Knowledge understanding is a foundational part of envisioned 6G networks to
advance network intelligence and AI-native network architectures. In this
paradigm, information extraction plays a pivotal role in transforming
fragmented telecom knowledge into well-structured formats, empowering diverse
AI models to better understand network terminologies. This work proposes a
novel language model-based information extraction technique, aiming to extract
structured entities from the telecom context. The proposed telecom structured
entity extraction (TeleSEE) technique applies a token-efficient representation
method to predict entity types and attribute keys, aiming to save the number of
output tokens and improve prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, TeleSEE involves a
hierarchical parallel decoding method, improving the standard encoder-decoder
architecture by integrating additional prompting and decoding strategies into
entity extraction tasks. In addition, to better evaluate the performance of the
proposed technique in the telecom domain, we further designed a dataset named
6GTech, including 2390 sentences and 23747 words from more than 100 6G-related
technical publications. Finally, the experiment shows that the proposed TeleSEE
method achieves higher accuracy than other baseline techniques, and also
presents 5 to 9 times higher sample processing speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）可能生成或伪装阴谋论内容，传统检测方法依赖人类文本的情感特征，可能无法识别LLM生成的内容。

Method: 开发了ConDID-v2数据集，包含人类和LLM重写的阴谋论推文，并训练了改进的检测模型ConspEmoLLM-v2。

Result: ConspEmoLLM-v2在原始人类内容上表现与ConspEmoLLM相当，在情感转换内容上显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 改进的数据集和模型能有效检测LLM生成的伪装阴谋论内容。

Abstract: Despite the many benefits of large language models (LLMs), they can also
cause harm, e.g., through automatic generation of misinformation, including
conspiracy theories. Moreover, LLMs can also ''disguise'' conspiracy theories
by altering characteristic textual features, e.g., by transforming their
typically strong negative emotions into a more positive tone. Although several
studies have proposed automated conspiracy theory detection methods, they are
usually trained using human-authored text, whose features can vary from
LLM-generated text. Furthermore, several conspiracy detection models, including
the previously proposed ConspEmoLLM, rely heavily on the typical emotional
features of human-authored conspiracy content. As such, intentionally disguised
content may evade detection. To combat such issues, we firstly developed an
augmented version of the ConDID conspiracy detection dataset, ConDID-v2, which
supplements human-authored conspiracy tweets with versions rewritten by an LLM
to reduce the negativity of their original sentiment. The quality of the
rewritten tweets was verified by combining human and LLM-based assessment. We
subsequently used ConDID-v2 to train ConspEmoLLM-v2, an enhanced version of
ConspEmoLLM. Experimental results demonstrate that ConspEmoLLM-v2 retains or
exceeds the performance of ConspEmoLLM on the original human-authored content
in ConDID, and considerably outperforms both ConspEmoLLM and several other
baselines when applied to sentiment-transformed tweets in ConDID-v2. The
project will be available at https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的快速部署，其安全性风险加剧，但现有评估多基于人工图像，缺乏对真实用户分享的表情包图像的考察。

Method: 研究引入MemeSafetyBench基准，包含50,430个实例，结合真实表情包图像与有害/无害指令，通过安全分类法和LLM生成指令，评估多款VLMs在单轮和多轮交互中的表现。

Result: VLMs对表情包有害提示的脆弱性显著高于合成或文字图像，有害回答增加且拒绝率下降，多轮交互仅部分缓解问题。

Conclusion: 研究强调需进行生态有效性评估并加强安全机制，以应对VLMs在真实场景中的安全风险。

Abstract: Rapid deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) magnifies safety risks, yet
most evaluations rely on artificial images. This study asks: How safe are
current VLMs when confronted with meme images that ordinary users share? To
investigate this question, we introduce MemeSafetyBench, a 50,430-instance
benchmark pairing real meme images with both harmful and benign instructions.
Using a comprehensive safety taxonomy and LLM-based instruction generation, we
assess multiple VLMs across single and multi-turn interactions. We investigate
how real-world memes influence harmful outputs, the mitigating effects of
conversational context, and the relationship between model scale and safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs show greater vulnerability to
meme-based harmful prompts than to synthetic or typographic images. Memes
significantly increase harmful responses and decrease refusals compared to
text-only inputs. Though multi-turn interactions provide partial mitigation,
elevated vulnerability persists. These results highlight the need for
ecologically valid evaluations and stronger safety mechanisms.

Abstract: This study introduces a framework for evaluating consistency in large
language model (LLM) binary text classification, addressing the lack of
established reliability assessment methods. Adapting psychometric principles,
we determine sample size requirements, develop metrics for invalid responses,
and evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability. Our case study examines
financial news sentiment classification across 14 LLMs (including
claude-3-7-sonnet, gpt-4o, deepseek-r1, gemma3, llama3.2, phi4, and
command-r-plus), with five replicates per model on 1,350 articles. Models
demonstrated high intra-rater consistency, achieving perfect agreement on
90-98% of examples, with minimal differences between expensive and economical
models from the same families. When validated against StockNewsAPI labels,
models achieved strong performance (accuracy 0.76-0.88), with smaller models
like gemma3:1B, llama3.2:3B, and claude-3-5-haiku outperforming larger
counterparts. All models performed at chance when predicting actual market
movements, indicating task constraints rather than model limitations. Our
framework provides systematic guidance for LLM selection, sample size planning,
and reliability assessment, enabling organizations to optimize resources for
classification tasks.

Method: 通过TLDM基准测试，测试模型对情节摘要、故事世界配置和叙事时间的理解能力。

Result: 测试的七个前沿大语言模型在超过64k tokens后理解能力不稳定。

Conclusion: 需要超越传统基准测试，评估模型在复杂长上下文中的表现，并发布了TLDM基准以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Although the context length of large language models (LLMs) has increased to
millions of tokens, evaluating their effectiveness beyond needle-in-a-haystack
approaches has proven difficult. We argue that novels provide a case study of
subtle, complicated structure and long-range semantic dependencies often over
128k tokens in length. Inspired by work on computational novel analysis, we
release the Too Long, Didn't Model (TLDM) benchmark, which tests a model's
ability to report plot summary, storyworld configuration, and elapsed narrative
time. We find that none of seven tested frontier LLMs retain stable
understanding beyond 64k tokens. Our results suggest language model developers
must look beyond "lost in the middle" benchmarks when evaluating model
performance in complex long-context scenarios. To aid in further development we
release the TLDM benchmark together with reference code and data.

TLDR: MedBrowseComp是一个新基准，用于测试语言模型在临床环境中检索和综合多跳医学事实的能力，揭示了当前模型与临床需求之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需要整合多种知识来源，现有评估方法未能充分测试语言模型在真实场景中的实用性。

Method: 开发了MedBrowseComp基准，包含1000多个人类策划的问题，模拟临床场景中需要综合碎片化或冲突信息的情况。

Result: 前沿代理系统在MedBrowseComp上的表现低至10%，显示当前模型能力与临床需求之间的显著差距。

Conclusion: MedBrowseComp为可靠的医学信息检索提供了测试平台，并为未来模型改进设定了具体目标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as decision-support
tools in clinical practice, yet safe clinical reasoning demands integrating
heterogeneous knowledge bases -- trials, primary studies, regulatory documents,
and cost data -- under strict accuracy constraints. Existing evaluations often
rely on synthetic prompts, reduce the task to single-hop factoid queries, or
conflate reasoning with open-ended generation, leaving their real-world utility
unclear. To close this gap, we present MedBrowseComp, the first benchmark that
systematically tests an agent's ability to reliably retrieve and synthesize
multi-hop medical facts from live, domain-specific knowledge bases.
MedBrowseComp contains more than 1,000 human-curated questions that mirror
clinical scenarios where practitioners must reconcile fragmented or conflicting
information to reach an up-to-date conclusion. Applying MedBrowseComp to
frontier agentic systems reveals performance shortfalls as low as ten percent,
exposing a critical gap between current LLM capabilities and the rigor demanded
in clinical settings. MedBrowseComp therefore offers a clear testbed for
reliable medical information seeking and sets concrete goals for future model
and toolchain upgrades. You can visit our project page at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在NLP领域表现优异，但其存在强化社会偏见的风险，尤其是印度边缘化种姓群体的偏见问题尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出多维度框架DECASTE，从社会文化、经济、教育和政治四个维度评估种姓偏见，采用定制化提示策略。

Result: 研究发现主流大型语言模型系统性强化种姓偏见，边缘化种姓群体（如Dalits和Shudras）的偏见评分显著高于主导种姓群体。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大型语言模型中隐蔽但普遍的种姓偏见，强调需要更全面和包容的偏见评估方法以减少实际应用中的风险。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing (NLP) and expanded their applications across
diverse domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have been
shown to reflect and perpetuate harmful societal biases, including those based
on ethnicity, gender, and religion. A critical and underexplored issue is the
reinforcement of caste-based biases, particularly towards India's marginalized
caste groups such as Dalits and Shudras. In this paper, we address this gap by
proposing DECASTE, a novel, multi-dimensional framework designed to detect and
assess both implicit and explicit caste biases in LLMs. Our approach evaluates
caste fairness across four dimensions: socio-cultural, economic, educational,
and political, using a range of customized prompting strategies. By
benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that these models
systematically reinforce caste biases, with significant disparities observed in
the treatment of oppressed versus dominant caste groups. For example, bias
scores are notably elevated when comparing Dalits and Shudras with dominant
caste groups, reflecting societal prejudices that persist in model outputs.
These results expose the subtle yet pervasive caste biases in LLMs and
emphasize the need for more comprehensive and inclusive bias evaluation
methodologies that assess the potential risks of deploying such models in
real-world contexts.

TLDR: 论文提出了CROSS基准，用于评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的文化安全推理能力，发现现有模型在文化意识和合规性方面表现不足，并提出两种优化方法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态安全基准主要关注物理安全，忽视了文化规范导致的符号性伤害，因此需要专门评估LVLMs的文化安全能力。

Method: 提出CROSS基准和CROSS-Eval框架，评估21种LVLMs的文化安全能力，并开发了基于监督微调和偏好优化的两种增强策略。

Result: 最佳模型在文化意识和合规性上仅达61.79%和37.73%，优化方法显著提升GPT-4o的性能（文化意识+60.14%，合规性+55.2%）。

Conclusion: LVLMs在文化安全方面存在显著不足，但通过针对性优化可显著改善，同时保持通用多模态能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in globally
distributed applications, such as tourism assistants, yet their ability to
produce culturally appropriate responses remains underexplored. Existing
multimodal safety benchmarks primarily focus on physical safety and overlook
violations rooted in cultural norms, which can result in symbolic harm. To
address this gap, we introduce CROSS, a benchmark designed to assess the
cultural safety reasoning capabilities of LVLMs. CROSS includes 1,284
multilingual visually grounded queries from 16 countries, three everyday
domains, and 14 languages, where cultural norm violations emerge only when
images are interpreted in context. We propose CROSS-Eval, an intercultural
theory-based framework that measures four key dimensions: cultural awareness,
norm education, compliance, and helpfulness. Using this framework, we evaluate
21 leading LVLMs, including mixture-of-experts models and reasoning models.
Results reveal significant cultural safety gaps: the best-performing model
achieves only 61.79% in awareness and 37.73% in compliance. While some
open-source models reach GPT-4o-level performance, they still fall notably
short of proprietary models. Our results further show that increasing reasoning
capacity improves cultural alignment but does not fully resolve the issue. To
improve model performance, we develop two enhancement strategies: supervised
fine-tuning with culturally grounded, open-ended data and preference tuning
with contrastive response pairs that highlight safe versus unsafe behaviors.
These methods substantially improve GPT-4o's cultural awareness (+60.14%) and
compliance (+55.2%), while preserving general multimodal capabilities with
minimal performance reduction on general multimodal understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: CRAFT在表格问答任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) involves retrieving relevant tables from a
large corpus to answer natural language queries. Traditional dense retrieval
models, such as DTR and ColBERT, not only incur high computational costs for
large-scale retrieval tasks but also require retraining or fine-tuning on new
datasets, limiting their adaptability to evolving domains and knowledge. In
this work, we propose $\textbf{CRAFT}$, a cascaded retrieval approach that
first uses a sparse retrieval model to filter a subset of candidate tables
before applying more computationally expensive dense models and neural
re-rankers. Our approach achieves better retrieval performance than
state-of-the-art (SOTA) sparse, dense, and hybrid retrievers. We further
enhance table representations by generating table descriptions and titles using
Gemini Flash 1.5. End-to-end TQA results using various Large Language Models
(LLMs) on NQ-Tables, a subset of the Natural Questions Dataset, demonstrate
$\textbf{CRAFT}$ effectiveness.

Result: 模型在某些语言（包括低资源语言）中表现更优，平均准确率提升10%。

Conclusion: 研究推动了语言模型的开源发展，使其更符合文化和语言背景。

Abstract: Code-switching is a common phenomenon of alternating between different
languages in the same utterance, thought, or conversation. We posit that humans
code-switch because they feel more comfortable talking about certain topics and
domains in one language than another. With the rise of knowledge-intensive
language models, we ask ourselves the next, natural question: Could models hold
more knowledge on some topics in some language X? More importantly, could we
improve reasoning by changing the language that reasoning is performed in? We
coin the term Language Specific Knowledge (LSK) to represent this phenomenon.
As ethnic cultures tend to develop alongside different languages, we employ
culture-specific datasets (that contain knowledge about cultural and social
behavioral norms). We find that language models can perform better when using
chain-of-thought reasoning in some languages other than English, sometimes even
better in low-resource languages. Paired with previous works showing that
semantic similarity does not equate to representational similarity, we
hypothesize that culturally specific texts occur more abundantly in
corresponding languages, enabling specific knowledge to occur only in specific
"expert" languages. Motivated by our initial results, we design a simple
methodology called LSKExtractor to benchmark the language-specific knowledge
present in a language model and, then, exploit it during inference. We show our
results on various models and datasets, showing an average relative improvement
of 10% in accuracy. Our research contributes to the open-source development of
language models that are inclusive and more aligned with the cultural and
linguistic contexts in which they are deployed.

Result: 在多个信息提取数据集上的实验表明，DLISC在效果和效率上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: DLISC是一种高效且有效的方法，适用于资源受限设备上的信息提取任务。

Abstract: Information extraction (IE) plays a crucial role in natural language
processing (NLP) by converting unstructured text into structured knowledge.
Deploying computationally intensive large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained devices for information extraction is challenging,
particularly due to issues like hallucinations, limited context length, and
high latency-especially when handling diverse extraction schemas. To address
these challenges, we propose a two-stage information extraction approach
adapted for on-device LLMs, called Dual-LoRA with Incremental Schema Caching
(DLISC), which enhances both schema identification and schema-aware extraction
in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, DLISC adopts an
Identification LoRA module for retrieving the most relevant schemas to a given
query, and an Extraction LoRA module for performing information extraction
based on the previously selected schemas. To accelerate extraction inference,
Incremental Schema Caching is incorporated to reduce redundant computation,
substantially improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple
information extraction datasets demonstrate notable improvements in both
effectiveness and efficiency.

Motivation: 当前MAS依赖手动设计的角色和通信协议，难以适应新任务且未充分利用LLM潜力。自动MAS方法通常需要验证集且缺乏推理时适应性。

Method: SELF-MAS采用元级设计，迭代生成、评估和优化MAS配置，支持动态智能体组合和问题分解。

Result: 在数学、研究生级QA和软件工程基准测试中，SELF-MAS平均准确率提升7.44%，优于手动和自动基线。

Conclusion: 元级自监督设计为创建高效、自适应MAS提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) leveraging the impressive capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for tackling complex tasks.
However, most current MAS depend on manually designed agent roles and
communication protocols. These manual designs often fail to align with the
underlying LLMs' strengths and struggle to adapt to novel tasks. Recent
automatic MAS approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations but typically
necessitate a validation-set for tuning and yield static MAS designs lacking
adaptability during inference. We introduce SELF-MAS, the first
self-supervised, inference-time only framework for automatic MAS design.
SELF-MAS employs meta-level design to iteratively generate, evaluate, and
refine MAS configurations tailored to each problem instance, without requiring
a validation set. Critically, it enables dynamic agent composition and problem
decomposition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness.
Experiments across math, graduate-level QA, and software engineering
benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM back-bones of varying
sizes, demonstrate that SELF-MAS outperforms both manual and automatic MAS
baselines, achieving a 7.44% average accuracy improvement over the next
strongest baseline while maintaining cost-efficiency. These findings underscore
the promise of meta-level self-supervised design for creating effective and
adaptive MAS.

Result: 语音LLMs在上下文推理任务中表现良好，但在直接算术和口头数学表达上表现较差，数学知识推理能力显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前语音LLMs在数学推理任务中存在局限性，需进一步改进以提升对口头数学表达和直接算术的处理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
have led to strong reasoning ability across a wide range of tasks. However,
their ability to perform mathematical reasoning from spoken input remains
underexplored. Prior studies on speech modality have mostly focused on factual
speech understanding or simple audio reasoning tasks, providing limited insight
into logical step-by-step reasoning, such as that required for mathematical
problem solving. To address this gap, we introduce Spoken Math Question
Answering (Spoken-MQA), a new benchmark designed to evaluate the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of speech-based models, including both cascade models
(ASR + LLMs) and end-to-end speech LLMs. Spoken-MQA covers a diverse set of
math problems, including pure arithmetic, single-step and multi-step contextual
reasoning, and knowledge-oriented reasoning problems, all presented in
unambiguous natural spoken language. Through extensive experiments, we find
that: (1) while some speech LLMs perform competitively on contextual reasoning
tasks involving basic arithmetic, they still struggle with direct arithmetic
problems; (2) current LLMs exhibit a strong bias toward symbolic mathematical
expressions written in LaTex and have difficulty interpreting verbalized
mathematical expressions; and (3) mathematical knowledge reasoning abilities
are significantly degraded in current speech LLMs.

Method: 通过MedLingo数据集评估LLMs对临床术语的理解，并分析预训练数据中临床术语和无支持医学声明的频率及其来源。

Result: 临床术语在预训练数据中的频率与模型性能相关，但实际临床笔记中的术语在预训练数据中较少出现。模型可能重复无支持的医学声明。

Conclusion: 预训练数据与实际临床需求存在不匹配，需优化数据来源以提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have performed well across various clinical
natural language processing tasks, despite not being directly trained on
electronic health record (EHR) data. In this work, we examine how popular
open-source LLMs learn clinical information from large mined corpora through
two crucial but understudied lenses: (1) their interpretation of clinical
jargon, a foundational ability for understanding real-world clinical notes, and
(2) their responses to unsupported medical claims. For both use cases, we
investigate the frequency of relevant clinical information in their
corresponding pretraining corpora, the relationship between pretraining data
composition and model outputs, and the sources underlying this data. To isolate
clinical jargon understanding, we evaluate LLMs on a new dataset MedLingo.
Unsurprisingly, we find that the frequency of clinical jargon mentions across
major pretraining corpora correlates with model performance. However, jargon
frequently appearing in clinical notes often rarely appears in pretraining
corpora, revealing a mismatch between available data and real-world usage.
Similarly, we find that a non-negligible portion of documents support disputed
claims that can then be parroted by models. Finally, we classified and analyzed
the types of online sources in which clinical jargon and unsupported medical
claims appear, with implications for future dataset composition.

We employ deep learning to detect hedge sentences and aspects, then analyze
report length, hedge word/sentence frequency, aspect mentions, and sentiment to
evaluate text-score alignment. Correlation, significance, and regression tests
examine confidence scores' impact on paper outcomes. Results show high
text-score consistency across all levels, with regression revealing higher

Abstract: Linear Concept Vectors have proven effective for steering large language

difference-in-means derive these vectors from LLM hidden representations,
diverse data introduces noises (i.e., irrelevant features) that challenge
steering robustness. To address this, we propose Sparse Autoencoder-Denoised
Concept Vectors (SDCV), which uses Sparse Autoencoders to filter out noisy
features from hidden representations. When applied to linear probing and
difference-in-means, our method improves their steering success rates. We
validate our noise hypothesis through counterfactual experiments and feature

Conclusion: 双向注意力机制对长文本和复杂文本的全局上下文编码至关重要，扩散语言模型为文本嵌入任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based embedding models, benefiting from large
scale pre-training and post-training, have begun to surpass BERT and T5-based
models on general-purpose text embedding tasks such as document retrieval.
However, a fundamental limitation of LLM embeddings lies in the unidirectional
attention used during autoregressive pre-training, which misaligns with the
bidirectional nature of text embedding tasks. To this end, We propose adopting
diffusion language models for text embeddings, motivated by their inherent
bidirectional architecture and recent success in matching or surpassing LLMs
especially on reasoning tasks. We present the first systematic study of the
diffusion language embedding model, which outperforms the LLM-based embedding
model by 20% on long-document retrieval, 8% on reasoning-intensive retrieval,
2% on instruction-following retrieval, and achieve competitive performance on
traditional text embedding benchmarks. Our analysis verifies that bidirectional
attention is crucial for encoding global context in long and complex text.

Conclusion: ChartCards和MetaChart为图表理解任务提供了高效解决方案，显著降低数据需求并提升模型性能。

Abstract: The emergence of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents new
opportunities for chart understanding. However, due to the fine-grained nature
of these tasks, applying MLLMs typically requires large, high-quality datasets
for task-specific fine-tuning, leading to high data collection and training
costs. To address this, we propose ChartCards, a unified chart-metadata
generation framework for multi-task chart understanding. ChartCards
systematically synthesizes various chart information, including data tables,
visualization code, visual elements, and multi-dimensional semantic captions.
By structuring this information into organized metadata, ChartCards enables a
single chart to support multiple downstream tasks, such as text-to-chart
retrieval, chart summarization, chart-to-table conversion, chart description,
and chart question answering. Using ChartCards, we further construct MetaChart,
a large-scale high-quality dataset containing 10,862 data tables, 85K charts,
and 170 K high-quality chart captions. We validate the dataset through
qualitative crowdsourcing evaluations and quantitative fine-tuning experiments
across various chart understanding tasks. Fine-tuning six different models on
MetaChart resulted in an average performance improvement of 5% across all
tasks. The most notable improvements are seen in text-to-chart retrieval and
chart-to-table tasks, with Long-CLIP and Llama 3.2-11B achieving improvements
of 17% and 28%, respectively.

Abstract: Automated fact-checking is a crucial task in this digital age. To verify a
claim, current approaches majorly follow one of two strategies i.e. (i) relying
on embedded knowledge of language models, and (ii) fine-tuning them with
evidence pieces. While the former can make systems to hallucinate, the later
have not been very successful till date. The primary reason behind this is that
fact verification is a complex process. Language models have to parse through
multiple pieces of evidence before making a prediction. Further, the evidence
pieces often contradict each other. This makes the reasoning process even more
complex. We proposed a simple yet effective approach where we relied on
entailment and the generative ability of language models to produce
''supporting'' and ''refuting'' justifications (for the truthfulness of a
claim). We trained language models based on these justifications and achieved
superior results. Apart from that, we did a systematic comparison of different
prompting and fine-tuning strategies, as it is currently lacking in the
literature. Some of our observations are: (i) training language models with raw
evidence sentences registered an improvement up to 8.20% in macro-F1, over the
best performing baseline for the RAW-FC dataset, (ii) similarly, training
language models with prompted claim-evidence understanding (TBE-2) registered
an improvement (with a margin up to 16.39%) over the baselines for the same
dataset, (iii) training language models with entailed justifications (TBE-3)
outperformed the baselines by a huge margin (up to 28.57% and 44.26% for
LIAR-RAW and RAW-FC, respectively). We have shared our code repository to
reproduce the results.

TLDR: MolLangBench是一个评估分子-语言接口任务的基准，包括分子结构识别、编辑和生成。当前最先进模型的性能有限，表明AI在化学任务中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为化学家和AI系统提供精确的分子识别、编辑和生成能力，推动化学应用中的AI研究。

Method: 使用自动化化学信息学工具构建识别任务，通过专家标注和验证编辑与生成任务，支持多种分子表示形式。

Result: 最强模型在识别和编辑任务中准确率约79%，生成任务仅29%，显示当前AI系统的局限性。

Conclusion: MolLangBench有望推动更有效和可靠的化学AI系统研究。

Abstract: Precise recognition, editing, and generation of molecules are essential
prerequisites for both chemists and AI systems tackling various chemical tasks.
We present MolLangBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
fundamental molecule-language interface tasks: language-prompted molecular
structure recognition, editing, and generation. To ensure high-quality,
unambiguous, and deterministic outputs, we construct the recognition tasks
using automated cheminformatics tools, and curate editing and generation tasks
through rigorous expert annotation and validation. MolLangBench supports the
evaluation of models that interface language with different molecular
representations, including linear strings, molecular images, and molecular
graphs. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal significant limitations:
the strongest model (o3) achieves $79.2\%$ and $78.5\%$ accuracy on recognition
and editing tasks, which are intuitively simple for humans, and performs even
worse on the generation task, reaching only $29.0\%$ accuracy. These results
highlight the shortcomings of current AI systems in handling even preliminary
molecular recognition and manipulation tasks. We hope MolLangBench will
catalyze further research toward more effective and reliable AI systems for
chemical applications.

TLDR: 本文批判性分析了主流大语言模型（LLM）基准测试的有效性，提出了一种新框架PSN-IRT，用于更准确评估模型能力，并揭示现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估大语言模型时存在不一致性和区分度不足的问题，无法真实反映模型能力。

Method: 提出PSN-IRT框架，结合项目反应理论（IRT）和伪孪生网络，增强项目参数和模型能力评估。

Result: 分析显示当前基准测试存在显著缺陷，PSN-IRT能构建更小但更符合人类偏好的基准。

Conclusion: PSN-IRT为基准测试提供了更可靠的评估方法，揭示了现有基准的局限性。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) via benchmarks is widespread,
yet inconsistencies between different leaderboards and poor separability among
top models raise concerns about their ability to accurately reflect authentic
model capabilities. This paper provides a critical analysis of benchmark
effectiveness, examining main-stream prominent LLM benchmarks using results
from diverse models. We first propose a new framework for accurate and reliable
estimations of item characteristics and model abilities. Specifically, we
propose Pseudo-Siamese Network for Item Response Theory (PSN-IRT), an enhanced
Item Response Theory framework that incorporates a rich set of item parameters
within an IRT-grounded architecture. Based on PSN-IRT, we conduct extensive
analysis which reveals significant and varied shortcomings in the measurement
quality of current benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that leveraging
PSN-IRT is able to construct smaller benchmarks while maintaining stronger
alignment with human preference.

TLDR: Self-GIVE通过强化学习增强LLMs的自动联想能力，解决了GIVE在效率、通用性和准确性上的限制，显著提升了小规模LLMs在生物医学QA任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GIVE方法在知识推理中的效率低、通用性差以及LLM调用开销大的问题。

Method: 提出Self-GIVE框架，结合检索和强化学习，自动提取结构化信息辅助LLMs联想推理。

Result: 在3B和7B模型上性能提升显著（最高71.4%和90.5%），并减少90%以上的token使用。

Conclusion: Self-GIVE有效整合了结构化检索与联想推理，提升了小规模LLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: When addressing complex questions that require new information, people often
associate the question with existing knowledge to derive a sensible answer. For
instance, when evaluating whether melatonin aids insomnia, one might associate
"hormones helping mental disorders" with "melatonin being a hormone and
insomnia a mental disorder" to complete the reasoning. Large Language Models
(LLMs) also require such associative thinking, particularly in resolving
scientific inquiries when retrieved knowledge is insufficient and does not
directly answer the question. Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE)
addresses this by using a knowledge graph (KG) to extrapolate structured
knowledge. However, it involves the construction and pruning of many
hypothetical triplets, which limits efficiency and generalizability. We propose
Self-GIVE, a retrieve-RL framework that enhances LLMs with automatic
associative thinking through reinforcement learning. Self-GIVE extracts
structured information and entity sets to assist the model in linking to the
queried concepts. We address GIVE's key limitations: (1) extensive LLM calls
and token overhead for knowledge extrapolation, (2) difficulty in deploying on
smaller LLMs (3B or 7B) due to complex instructions, and (3) inaccurate
knowledge from LLM pruning. Specifically, after fine-tuning using self-GIVE
with a 135 node UMLS KG, it improves the performance of the Qwen2.5 3B and 7B
models by up to $\textbf{28.5%$\rightarrow$71.4%}$ and
$\textbf{78.6$\rightarrow$90.5%}$ in samples $\textbf{unseen}$ in challenging
biomedical QA tasks. In particular, Self-GIVE allows the 7B model to match or
outperform GPT3.5 turbo with GIVE, while cutting token usage by over 90\%.
Self-GIVE enhances the scalable integration of structured retrieval and
reasoning with associative thinking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在低资源语言（如乌尔都语）中的事实可靠性问题亟待解决，现有解决方案主要针对英语。

Method: 开发了动态多策略证据检索管道，结合单语和翻译方法，并发布了两个新标注数据集。

Result: UrduFactCheck在多项指标上优于基线模型，翻译增强版本表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: UrduFactCheck为乌尔都语事实核查提供了有效工具，开源代码和数据集促进了进一步研究。

Abstract: The rapid use of large language models (LLMs) has raised critical concerns
regarding the factual reliability of their outputs, especially in low-resource
languages such as Urdu. Existing automated fact-checking solutions
overwhelmingly focus on English, leaving a significant gap for the 200+ million
Urdu speakers worldwide. In this work, we introduce UrduFactCheck, the first
comprehensive, modular fact-checking framework specifically tailored for Urdu.
Our system features a dynamic, multi-strategy evidence retrieval pipeline that
combines monolingual and translation-based approaches to address the scarcity
of high-quality Urdu evidence. We curate and release two new hand-annotated
benchmarks: UrduFactBench for claim verification and UrduFactQA for evaluating
LLM factuality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UrduFactCheck,
particularly its translation-augmented variants, consistently outperforms
baselines and open-source alternatives on multiple metrics. We further
benchmark twelve state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on factual question answering in
Urdu, highlighting persistent gaps between proprietary and open-source models.

TLDR: 研究探讨小型语言模型（0.5B-5B参数）是否能有效进行创伤知情、共情对话，并引入TIDE数据集进行评估。结果显示微调提升共情感知，但效果因场景和用户而异，小型模型存在共情上限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索小型语言模型在创伤知情共情对话中的潜力，为心理健康领域提供资源高效且伦理安全的AI辅助工具。

Method: 引入TIDE数据集（10,000对话，500 PTSD用户角色），基于三因素共情模型，评估8个小型模型微调前后的表现，并与前沿模型对比。

Result: 微调提升共情感知，但效果受场景和用户影响；小型模型共情能力有限；不同用户群体偏好不同。

Conclusion: 小型模型在共情对话中表现有限，需结合用户和场景设计；TIDE数据集为安全、高效的AI辅助心理健康工具奠定基础。

Abstract: Can small language models with 0.5B to 5B parameters meaningfully engage in
trauma-informed, empathetic dialogue for individuals with PTSD? We address this
question by introducing TIDE, a dataset of 10,000 two-turn dialogues spanning
500 diverse PTSD client personas and grounded in a three-factor empathy model:
emotion recognition, distress normalization, and supportive reflection. All
scenarios and reference responses were reviewed for realism and trauma
sensitivity by a clinical psychologist specializing in PTSD. We evaluate eight
small language models before and after fine-tuning, comparing their outputs to
a frontier model (Claude Sonnet 3.5). Our IRB-approved human evaluation and
automatic metrics show that fine-tuning generally improves perceived empathy,
but gains are highly scenario- and user-dependent, with smaller models facing
an empathy ceiling. Demographic analysis shows older adults value distress
validation and graduate-educated users prefer nuanced replies, while gender
effects are minimal. We highlight the limitations of automatic metrics and the
need for context- and user-aware system design. Our findings, along with the
planned release of TIDE, provide a foundation for building safe,
resource-efficient, and ethically sound empathetic AI to supplement, not
replace, clinical mental health care.

Motivation: 低资源语言的神经机器翻译面临数据不足和模型泛化能力差的问题，尤其在领域适应任务中，选择合适的模型至关重要。

Method: 采用基于bandit的算法（如Upper Confidence Bound、Linear UCB、Neural Linear Bandit和Thompson Sampling）进行模型选择。

Result: 在三种非洲语言和领域中验证了方法的有效性，无论目标数据是否可用。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效解决资源限制问题，实现高置信度的最优模型选择。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems face significant challenges when
working with low-resource languages, particularly in domain adaptation tasks.
These difficulties arise due to limited training data and suboptimal model
generalization, As a result, selecting an optimal model for translation is
crucial for achieving strong performance on in-domain data, particularly in
scenarios where fine-tuning is not feasible or practical. In this paper, we
investigate strategies for selecting the most suitable NMT model for a given
domain using bandit-based algorithms, including Upper Confidence Bound, Linear
UCB, Neural Linear Bandit, and Thompson Sampling. Our method effectively
addresses the resource constraints by facilitating optimal model selection with
high confidence. We evaluate the approach across three African languages and
domains, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in both scenarios where
target data is available and where it is absent.

Abstract: The massive user-generated content (UGC) available in Chinese social media is
giving rise to the possibility of studying internet buzzwords. In this paper,
we study if large language models (LLMs) can generate accurate definitions for
these buzzwords based on UGC as examples. Our work serves a threefold
contribution. First, we introduce CHEER, the first dataset of Chinese internet
buzzwords, each annotated with a definition and relevant UGC. Second, we
propose a novel method, called RESS, to effectively steer the comprehending
process of LLMs to produce more accurate buzzword definitions, mirroring the
skills of human language learning. Third, with CHEER, we benchmark the
strengths and weaknesses of various off-the-shelf definition generation methods
and our RESS. Our benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of RESS while
revealing crucial shared challenges: over-reliance on prior exposure,
underdeveloped inferential abilities, and difficulty identifying high-quality
UGC to facilitate comprehension. We believe our work lays the groundwork for
future advancements in LLM-based definition generation. Our dataset and code
are available at https://github.com/SCUNLP/Buzzword.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在多域不平衡数据中表现不佳，倾向于优化主导域，忽视少数域，导致泛化差和公平性问题。

Method: DISCO引入域感知奖励缩放和难度感知奖励缩放，分别解决频率偏见和优先学习高价值提示。

Result: DISCO在Qwen3模型上比GRPO变体提升5%，在多域对齐基准上达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: DISCO通过改进GRPO，显著提升了多域不平衡数据下的泛化能力和公平性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences
through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods,
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its
simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned
value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution
and uniform semantic alignment across groups - assumptions that rarely hold in
real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO
disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented
ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose
Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled
extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key
innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by
reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward
scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize
uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies
promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that
DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on
Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment
benchmarks.

TLDR: HopWeaver是一个自动生成多跳问题的框架，无需人工干预，能够从非结构化文本中合成高质量的多跳问题，其效果媲美或优于人工标注数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答（MHQA）需要整合多源信息，但构建高质量数据集成本高且现有方法依赖人工。HopWeaver旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HopWeaver通过识别跨文档的互补信息，自动合成桥接和比较两类多跳问题，构建真实的推理路径。

Result: 实验表明，合成的问题质量与人工标注数据集相当或更好，且成本更低。

Conclusion: HopWeaver为资源稀缺领域提供了一种高效构建MHQA数据集的方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) is crucial for evaluating the model's
capability to integrate information from diverse sources. However, creating
extensive and high-quality MHQA datasets is challenging: (i) manual annotation
is expensive, and (ii) current synthesis methods often produce simplistic
questions or require extensive manual guidance. This paper introduces
HopWeaver, the first automatic framework synthesizing authentic multi-hop
questions from unstructured text corpora without human intervention. HopWeaver
synthesizes two types of multi-hop questions (bridge and comparison) using an
innovative approach that identifies complementary documents across corpora. Its
coherent pipeline constructs authentic reasoning paths that integrate
information across multiple documents, ensuring synthesized questions
necessitate authentic multi-hop reasoning. We further present a comprehensive
system for evaluating synthesized multi-hop questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that the synthesized questions achieve comparable or superior
quality to human-annotated datasets at a lower cost. Our approach is valuable
for developing MHQA datasets in specialized domains with scarce annotated
resources. The code for HopWeaver is publicly available.

TLDR: DeFT-X通过去噪和稀疏微调提升跨语言迁移效果，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高资源语言向低资源语言迁移的挑战。

Method: 使用奇异值分解去噪预训练模型权重矩阵，再进行稀疏微调。

Result: 在极低资源语言任务中表现优于SFT及其他基线方法。

Conclusion: DeFT-X是一种有效的跨语言迁移方法。

Abstract: Effective cross-lingual transfer remains a critical challenge in scaling the
benefits of large language models from high-resource to low-resource languages.
Towards this goal, prior studies have explored many approaches to combine task
knowledge from task-specific data in a (high-resource) source language and
language knowledge from unlabeled text in a (low-resource) target language. One
notable approach proposed composable sparse fine-tuning (SFT) for cross-lingual
transfer that learns task-specific and language-specific sparse masks to select
a subset of the pretrained model's parameters that are further fine-tuned.
These sparse fine-tuned vectors (SFTs) are subsequently composed with the
pretrained model to facilitate zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to a task in a
target language, using only task-specific data from a source language. These
sparse masks for SFTs were identified using a simple magnitude-based pruning.
In our work, we introduce DeFT-X, a novel composable SFT approach that denoises
the weight matrices of a pretrained model before magnitude pruning using
singular value decomposition, thus yielding more robust SFTs. We evaluate
DeFT-X on a diverse set of extremely low-resource languages for sentiment
classification (NusaX) and natural language inference (AmericasNLI) and
demonstrate that it performs at par or outperforms SFT and other prominent
cross-lingual transfer baselines.

Conclusion: SciCUEval为科学领域LLMs的未来发展提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in contextual
understanding and reasoning. However, evaluating their performance across
diverse scientific domains remains underexplored, as existing benchmarks
primarily focus on general domains and fail to capture the intricate complexity
of scientific data. To bridge this gap, we construct SciCUEval, a comprehensive
benchmark dataset tailored to assess the scientific context understanding
capability of LLMs. It comprises ten domain-specific sub-datasets spanning
biology, chemistry, physics, biomedicine, and materials science, integrating
diverse data modalities including structured tables, knowledge graphs, and
unstructured texts. SciCUEval systematically evaluates four core competencies:
Relevant information identification, Information-absence detection,
Multi-source information integration, and Context-aware inference, through a
variety of question formats. We conduct extensive evaluations of
state-of-the-art LLMs on SciCUEval, providing a fine-grained analysis of their
strengths and limitations in scientific context understanding, and offering
valuable insights for the future development of scientific-domain LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺对情感分析构成挑战，尤其是当隐含情感与特定国家或地区相关时。

Method: 利用PMP技术，结合BESSTIE和FLUTE数据集，在GEMMA和LLAMA模型上进行评估。

Result: PMP方法在所有任务和数据集上均显著优于其他提示策略。

Conclusion: PMP能有效生成针对不同英语变体的讽刺解释，且外部知识检索可缓解上下文相关失败。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a challenge to sentiment analysis because of the incongruity
between stated and implied sentiment. The challenge is exacerbated when the
implication may be relevant to a specific country or geographical region.
Pragmatic metacognitive prompting (PMP) is a cognition-inspired technique that
has been used for pragmatic reasoning. In this paper, we harness PMP for
explainable sarcasm detection for Australian and Indian English, alongside a
benchmark dataset for standard English. We manually add sarcasm explanations to
an existing sarcasm-labeled dataset for Australian and Indian English called
BESSTIE, and compare the performance for explainable sarcasm detection for them
with FLUTE, a standard English dataset containing sarcasm explanations. Our
approach utilising PMP when evaluated on two open-weight LLMs (GEMMA and LLAMA)
achieves statistically significant performance improvement across all tasks and
datasets when compared with four alternative prompting strategies. We also find
that alternative techniques such as agentic prompting mitigate context-related
failures by enabling external knowledge retrieval. The focused contribution of
our work is utilising PMP in generating sarcasm explanations for varieties of
English.

Motivation: 探索SSMs在语言建模中的性能差异，尤其是其在上下文信息召回上的不足，以理解不同架构的机制。

Method: 在关联召回（AR）任务上进行实验，使用因果干预分析机制，并引入新的合成任务Associative Treecall（ATR）。

Result: 仅Transformers和Based SSM模型完全成功，Mamba次之，其他SSMs失败；机制分析显示成功模型通过归纳头存储关联。

Conclusion: 不同架构在性能相似时机制可能不同，支持采用机制性评估方法。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) for language modelling promise an efficient and
performant alternative to quadratic-attention Transformers, yet show variable
performance on recalling basic information from the context. While performance
on synthetic tasks like Associative Recall (AR) can point to this deficiency,
behavioural metrics provide little information as to why--on a mechanistic
level--certain architectures fail and others succeed. To address this, we
conduct experiments on AR and find that only Transformers and Based SSM models
fully succeed at AR, with Mamba a close third, whereas the other SSMs (H3,
Hyena) fail. We then use causal interventions to explain why. We find that
Transformers and Based learn to store key-value associations in-context using
induction heads. By contrast, the SSMs compute these associations only at the
last state, with only Mamba succeeding because of its short convolution
component. To extend and deepen these findings, we introduce Associative
Treecall (ATR), a synthetic task similar to AR based on PCFG induction. ATR
introduces language-like hierarchical structure into the AR setting. We find
that all architectures learn the same mechanism as they did for AR, and the
same three models succeed at the task. These results reveal that architectures
with similar accuracy may still have substantive differences, motivating the
adoption of mechanistic evaluations.

Conclusion: 细粒度的逐步监督能有效优化深度搜索LLMs，提升多跳推理能力。

Abstract: Efficient multi-hop reasoning requires Large Language Models (LLMs) based
agents to acquire high-value external knowledge iteratively. Previous work has
explored reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to perform search-based
document retrieval, achieving notable improvements in QA performance, but
underperform on complex, multi-hop QA resulting from the sparse rewards from
global signal only. To address this gap in existing research, we introduce
StepSearch, a framework for search LLMs that trained with step-wise proximal
policy optimization method. It consists of richer and more detailed
intermediate search rewards and token-level process supervision based on
information gain and redundancy penalties to better guide each search step. We
constructed a fine-grained question-answering dataset containing
sub-question-level search trajectories based on open source datasets through a
set of data pipeline method. On standard multi-hop QA benchmarks, it
significantly outperforms global-reward baselines, achieving 11.2% and 4.2%
absolute improvements for 3B and 7B models over various search with RL
baselines using only 19k training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision in optimizing deep search LLMs. Our
implementation is publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型和智能虚拟代理作为心理治疗师的普及带来了心理健康服务的扩展机会，但也伴随着用户伤害和自杀等严重风险，现有评估方法无法捕捉治疗互动中的细微风险。

Method: 通过文献综述、专家访谈，并结合临床标准（如DSM-5）和评估工具（如NEQ、UE-ATR），开发了一种风险分类法。

Conclusion: 该分类法是实现AI驱动心理健康支持更安全、更负责任创新的重要基础。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Intelligent Virtual
Agents acting as psychotherapists presents significant opportunities for
expanding mental healthcare access. However, their deployment has also been
linked to serious adverse outcomes, including user harm and suicide,
facilitated by a lack of standardized evaluation methodologies capable of
capturing the nuanced risks of therapeutic interaction. Current evaluation
techniques lack the sensitivity to detect subtle changes in patient cognition
and behavior during therapy sessions that may lead to subsequent
decompensation. We introduce a novel risk taxonomy specifically designed for
the systematic evaluation of conversational AI psychotherapists. Developed
through an iterative process including review of the psychotherapy risk
literature, qualitative interviews with clinical and legal experts, and
alignment with established clinical criteria (e.g., DSM-5) and existing
assessment tools (e.g., NEQ, UE-ATR), the taxonomy aims to provide a structured
approach to identifying and assessing user/patient harms. We provide a
high-level overview of this taxonomy, detailing its grounding, and discuss
potential use cases. We discuss two use cases in detail: monitoring cognitive
model-based risk factors during a counseling conversation to detect unsafe
deviations, in both human-AI counseling sessions and in automated benchmarking
of AI psychotherapists with simulated patients. The proposed taxonomy offers a
foundational step towards establishing safer and more responsible innovation in

*Xuanliang Zhang,Dingzirui Wang,Keyan Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

TLDR: 论文提出Row-of-Thought (RoT)方法，通过逐行遍历表格进行推理，减少幻觉并提升效率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Long CoT在表格推理中训练成本高和可靠性低的问题。

Method: 采用逐行遍历表格的方式，结合LLM的反思能力，实现无需训练的推理扩展与优化。

Result: RoT在非推理模型上平均优于RLLMs 4.3%，在WikiTableQuestions和TableBench上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: RoT通过逐行遍历和反思机制，显著提升表格推理的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: The table reasoning task, crucial for efficient data acquisition, aims to
answer questions based on the given table. Recently, reasoning large language
models (RLLMs) with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) significantly enhance
reasoning capabilities, leading to brilliant performance on table reasoning.
However, Long CoT suffers from high cost for training and exhibits low
reliability due to table content hallucinations. Therefore, we propose
Row-of-Thought (RoT), which performs iteratively row-wise table traversal,
allowing for reasoning extension and reflection-based refinement at each
traversal. Scaling reasoning length by row-wise traversal and leveraging
reflection capabilities of LLMs, RoT is training-free. The sequential traversal
encourages greater attention to the table, thus reducing hallucinations.
Experiments show that RoT, using non-reasoning models, outperforms RLLMs by an
average of 4.3%, and achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiTableQuestions
and TableBench with comparable models, proving its effectiveness. Also, RoT
outperforms Long CoT with fewer reasoning tokens, indicating higher efficiency.

TLDR: 该论文研究了强化学习在训练基于大型语言模型的搜索代理中的关键因素，包括奖励设计、LLM选择和搜索引擎的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何优化基于强化学习的搜索代理设计，以提升其在现实问题解决中的表现。

Method: 通过全面的实证研究，系统分析了奖励设计、LLM选择和搜索引擎对RL训练的影响。

Result: 发现格式化奖励能显著提升性能，LLM的规模和初始化对结果影响重大，搜索引擎的选择对训练动态和代理鲁棒性至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究为构建和部署基于LLM的搜索代理提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated strong potential in training
large language models (LLMs) capable of complex reasoning for real-world
problem solving. More recently, RL has been leveraged to create sophisticated
LLM-based search agents that adeptly combine reasoning with search engine use.
While the use of RL for training search agents is promising, the optimal design
of such agents remains not fully understood. In particular, key factors -- such
as (1) reward formulation, (2) the choice and characteristics of the underlying
LLM, and (3) the role of the search engine in the RL process -- require further
investigation. In this work, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to
systematically investigate these and offer actionable insights. We highlight
several key findings: format rewards are effective in improving final
performance, whereas intermediate retrieval rewards have limited impact; the
scale and initialization of the LLM (general-purpose vs. reasoning-specialized)
significantly influence RL outcomes; and the choice of search engine plays a
critical role in shaping RL training dynamics and the robustness of the trained
agent during inference. These establish important guidelines for successfully
building and deploying LLM-based search agents in real-world applications. Code

TLDR: 提出了一种基于确定性的自适应推理框架（CAR），动态切换简短答案和长推理，以平衡准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过度依赖链式思维推理（CoT）会降低模型性能并导致冗长输出，而长时间推理并不总能提升准确性。

Method: CAR首先生成简短答案并评估其困惑度，仅在模型置信度低时触发长推理。

Result: 在多模态VQA/KIE基准测试和文本推理数据集中，CAR在准确性和效率上优于简短答案和长推理方法。

Conclusion: CAR通过动态调整推理长度，有效平衡了模型性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning have significantly enhanced the capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
across diverse tasks. However, excessive reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning can impair model performance and brings unnecessarily lengthened
outputs, reducing efficiency. Our work reveals that prolonged reasoning does
not universally improve accuracy and even degrade performance on simpler tasks.
To address this, we propose Certainty-based Adaptive Reasoning (CAR), a novel
framework that dynamically switches between short answers and long-form
reasoning based on the model perplexity. CAR first generates a short answer and
evaluates its perplexity, triggering reasoning only when the model exhibits low
confidence (i.e., high perplexity). Experiments across diverse multimodal
VQA/KIE benchmarks and text reasoning datasets show that CAR outperforms both
short-answer and long-form reasoning approaches, striking an optimal balance
between accuracy and efficiency.

TLDR: ReflAct是一种新的LLM代理推理框架，通过持续反思代理状态与目标的对齐，显著提升了推理的可靠性和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReAct在复杂环境中容易产生不连贯的推理步骤，导致代理状态与目标不一致，引发错误和幻觉。

Method: ReflAct通过持续反思代理状态与目标的对齐，显式地将决策基于状态，并强制目标对齐。

Result: ReflAct在ALFWorld中平均比ReAct提升27.7%，成功率达到93.3%，甚至优于增强版的ReAct。

Conclusion: 强化核心推理框架是提升代理性能的关键，ReflAct为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM agents have largely built on reasoning backbones like
ReAct, which interleave thought and action in complex environments. However,
ReAct often produces ungrounded or incoherent reasoning steps, leading to
misalignment between the agent's actual state and goal. Our analysis finds that
this stems from ReAct's inability to maintain consistent internal beliefs and
goal alignment, causing compounding errors and hallucinations. To address this,
we introduce ReflAct, a novel backbone that shifts reasoning from merely
planning next actions to continuously reflecting on the agent's state relative
to its goal. By explicitly grounding decisions in states and enforcing ongoing
goal alignment, ReflAct dramatically improves strategic reliability. This
design delivers substantial empirical gains: ReflAct surpasses ReAct by 27.7%
on average, achieving a 93.3% success rate in ALFWorld. Notably, ReflAct even
outperforms ReAct with added enhancement modules (e.g., Reflexion, WKM),
showing that strengthening the core reasoning backbone is key to reliable agent
performance.

Motivation: 电子商务中，顾客需要LLM助手生成脚本并推荐产品，但现有技术面临脚本规划与产品检索难以同时进行、语义匹配困难以及缺乏评估方法和数据的问题。

Method: 论文将EcomScript定义为三个子任务，提出一个框架，通过语义相似性将产品与脚本步骤关联，并构建了包含605,229个脚本的大规模数据集EcomScriptBench。

Result: 实验表明，当前LLM在EcomScript任务上表现不佳，但通过注入产品购买意图可以提升性能。

Conclusion: 论文为电子商务脚本规划提供了首个大规模数据集和框架，展示了LLM在此任务上的局限性及改进方向。

Abstract: Goal-oriented script planning, or the ability to devise coherent sequences of
actions toward specific goals, is commonly employed by humans to plan for
typical activities. In e-commerce, customers increasingly seek LLM-based
assistants to generate scripts and recommend products at each step, thereby
facilitating convenient and efficient shopping experiences. However, this
capability remains underexplored due to several challenges, including the
inability of LLMs to simultaneously conduct script planning and product
retrieval, difficulties in matching products caused by semantic discrepancies
between planned actions and search queries, and a lack of methods and benchmark
data for evaluation. In this paper, we step forward by formally defining the
task of E-commerce Script Planning (EcomScript) as three sequential subtasks.
We propose a novel framework that enables the scalable generation of
product-enriched scripts by associating products with each step based on the
semantic similarity between the actions and their purchase intentions. By
applying our framework to real-world e-commerce data, we construct the very
first large-scale EcomScript dataset, EcomScriptBench, which includes 605,229
scripts sourced from 2.4 million products. Human annotations are then conducted
to provide gold labels for a sampled subset, forming an evaluation benchmark.
Extensive experiments reveal that current (L)LMs face significant challenges
with EcomScript tasks, even after fine-tuning, while injecting product purchase
intentions improves their performance.

TLDR: 论文提出了DUSK基准，用于评估在数据重叠的现实场景下的机器学习遗忘方法，揭示了现有方法在选择性遗忘方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决现有机器学习遗忘方法在数据重叠场景下的局限性，尤其是如何选择性遗忘特定内容而不损害共享信息。

Method: 方法是通过DUSK基准构建描述相同事实但风格不同的文档集，定义七项评估指标来测试选择性遗忘能力。

Result: 结果显示，现有方法虽能移除表层文本，但难以在不损害共享内容的情况下彻底删除深层知识。

Conclusion: 结论是DUSK基准有助于开发更精确的遗忘技术，并揭示了当前方法的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, raising concerns about the unauthorized use of copyrighted or
sensitive data. Machine unlearning aims to remove such 'forget' data while
preserving utility and information from the 'retain' set. However, existing
evaluations typically assume that forget and retain sets are fully disjoint,
overlooking realistic scenarios where they share overlapping content. For
instance, a news article may need to be unlearned, even though the same event,
such as an earthquake in Japan, is also described factually on Wikipedia.
Effective unlearning should remove the specific phrasing of the news article
while preserving publicly supported facts. In this paper, we introduce DUSK, a
benchmark designed to evaluate unlearning methods under realistic data overlap.
DUSK constructs document sets that describe the same factual content in
different styles, with some shared information appearing across all sets and
other content remaining unique to each. When one set is designated for
unlearning, an ideal method should remove its unique content while preserving
shared facts. We define seven evaluation metrics to assess whether unlearning
methods can achieve this selective removal. Our evaluation of nine recent
unlearning methods reveals a key limitation: while most can remove
surface-level text, they often fail to erase deeper, context-specific knowledge
without damaging shared content. We release DUSK as a public benchmark to
support the development of more precise and reliable unlearning techniques for
real-world applications.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Deliberation over Priors（DP）的可信推理框架，通过充分利用知识图谱中的先验知识，提升大语言模型的推理忠实性和响应可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用知识图谱中的结构信息和约束，导致大语言模型在知识不足或过时时产生幻觉。

Method: DP采用渐进式知识蒸馏策略，结合监督微调和Kahneman-Tversky优化，将结构先验整合到模型中；并通过推理-自省策略验证约束先验，确保响应可靠性。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，DP实现了新的最优性能，尤其在ComplexWebQuestions数据集上Hit@1提升了13%。

Conclusion: DP框架显著提升了模型的忠实性和可靠性，具有灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation seeks to mitigate
hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) caused by insufficient or
outdated knowledge. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the
prior knowledge embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), particularly their
structural information and explicit or implicit constraints. The former can
enhance the faithfulness of LLMs' reasoning, while the latter can improve the
reliability of response generation. Motivated by these, we propose a
trustworthy reasoning framework, termed Deliberation over Priors (DP), which
sufficiently utilizes the priors contained in KGs. Specifically, DP adopts a
progressive knowledge distillation strategy that integrates structural priors
into LLMs through a combination of supervised fine-tuning and Kahneman-Tversky
optimization, thereby improving the faithfulness of relation path generation.
Furthermore, our framework employs a reasoning-introspection strategy, which
guides LLMs to perform refined reasoning verification based on extracted
constraint priors, ensuring the reliability of response generation. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DP achieves new
state-of-the-art performance, especially a Hit@1 improvement of 13% on the
ComplexWebQuestions dataset, and generates highly trustworthy responses. We
also conduct various analyses to verify its flexibility and practicality. The
code is available at https://github.com/reml-group/Deliberation-on-Priors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法在LRMs中难以彻底清除多步推理中的私有或版权信息，需专门基准评估。

Method: 引入R-TOFU基准，结合梯度优化和偏好优化方法，提出Reasoned IDK改进遗忘效果。

Result: 传统方法在推理中残留知识，Reasoned IDK更平衡遗忘与效用。解码变体仍可能泄露遗忘内容。

Conclusion: R-TOFU为LRMs遗忘研究提供系统基础，需多解码设置评估。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) embed private or copyrighted information not
only in their final answers but also throughout multi-step chain-of-thought
(CoT) traces, making reliable unlearning far more demanding than in standard
LLMs. We introduce Reasoning-TOFU (R-TOFU), the first benchmark tailored to
this setting. R-TOFU augments existing unlearning tasks with realistic CoT
annotations and provides step-wise metrics that expose residual knowledge
invisible to answer-level checks. Using R-TOFU, we carry out a comprehensive
comparison of gradient-based and preference-optimization baselines and show
that conventional answer-only objectives leave substantial forget traces in
reasoning. We further propose Reasoned IDK, a preference-optimization variant
that preserves coherent yet inconclusive reasoning, achieving a stronger
balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility than earlier refusal
styles. Finally, we identify a failure mode: decoding variants such as
ZeroThink and LessThink can still reveal forgotten content despite seemingly
successful unlearning, emphasizing the need to evaluate models under diverse
decoding settings. Together, the benchmark, analysis, and new baseline
establish a systematic foundation for studying and improving unlearning in LRMs
while preserving their reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 解决LLM在文化和多样性表达上的不足。

Method: 多语言提示：生成带有文化和语言线索的提示变体，结合生成结果。

Result: 多语言提示在多样性和减少幻觉方面优于现有技术，效果受语言资源和模型大小影响。

Conclusion: 多语言提示是提升LLM文化多样性的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to lack cultural representation and
overall diversity in their generations, from expressing opinions to answering
factual questions. To mitigate this problem, we propose multilingual prompting:
a prompting method which generates several variations of a base prompt with
added cultural and linguistic cues from several cultures, generates responses,
and then combines the results. Building on evidence that LLMs have
language-specific knowledge, multilingual prompting seeks to increase diversity
by activating a broader range of cultural knowledge embedded in model training
data. Through experiments across multiple models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA
70B, and LLaMA 8B), we show that multilingual prompting consistently
outperforms existing diversity-enhancing techniques such as high-temperature
sampling, step-by-step recall, and personas prompting. Further analyses show
that the benefits of multilingual prompting vary with language resource level
and model size, and that aligning the prompting language with the cultural cues
reduces hallucination about culturally-specific information.

Result: GETER在实验中表现优异，具备强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GETER为可解释时间推理提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show great potential in temporal
reasoning, most existing work focuses heavily on enhancing performance, often
neglecting the explainable reasoning processes underlying the results. To
address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering a wide range
of temporal granularities, designed to systematically evaluate LLMs'
capabilities in explainable temporal reasoning. Furthermore, our findings
reveal that LLMs struggle to deliver convincing explanations when relying
solely on textual information. To address challenge, we propose GETER, a novel
structure-aware generative framework that integrates Graph structures with text
for Explainable TEmporal Reasoning. Specifically, we first leverage temporal
knowledge graphs to develop a temporal encoder that captures structural
information for the query. Subsequently, we introduce a structure-text prefix
adapter to map graph structure features into the text embedding space. Finally,
LLMs generate explanation text by seamlessly integrating the soft graph token
with instruction-tuning prompt tokens. Experimental results indicate that GETER
achieves state-of-the-art performance while also demonstrating its
effectiveness as well as strong generalization capabilities. Our dataset and
code are available at https://github.com/carryTatum/GETER.

Result: 所有测试的LVLMs均表现出脆弱性，评分被操纵图像显著抬高，且多重偏差叠加效果更强。

Conclusion: 当前LVLM评估系统存在明显漏洞，亟需更鲁棒的模型。

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have emerged as the preferred
tools for judging text-image alignment, yet their robustness along the visual
modality remains underexplored. This work is the first study to address a key
research question: Can adversarial visual manipulations systematically fool
LVLM judges into assigning unfairly inflated scores? We define potential image
induced biases within the context of T2I evaluation and examine how these
biases affect the evaluations of LVLM judges. Moreover, we introduce a novel,
fine-grained, multi-domain meta-evaluation benchmark named FRAME, which is
deliberately constructed to exhibit diverse score distributions. By introducing
the defined biases into the benchmark, we reveal that all tested LVLM judges
exhibit vulnerability across all domains, consistently inflating scores for
manipulated images. Further analysis reveals that combining multiple biases
amplifies their effects, and pairwise evaluations are similarly susceptible.
Moreover, we observe that visual biases persist under prompt-based mitigation
strategies, highlighting the vulnerability of current LVLM evaluation systems
and underscoring the urgent need for more robust LVLM judges.

Conclusion: MentalMAC有效提升心理操纵检测能力，相关资源将公开。

Abstract: Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of psychological abuse
that poses serious threats to mental health. Its covert nature and the
complexity of manipulation strategies make it challenging to detect, even for
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). This concealment also hinders
the manual collection of large-scale, high-quality annotations essential for
training effective models. Although recent efforts have sought to improve LLM's
performance on this task, progress remains limited due to the scarcity of
real-world annotated datasets. To address these challenges, we propose
MentalMAC, a multi-task anti-curriculum distillation method that enhances LLMs'
ability to detect mental manipulation in multi-turn dialogue. Our approach
includes: (i) EvoSA, an unsupervised data expansion method based on
evolutionary operations and speech act theory; (ii) teacher-model-generated
multi-task supervision; and (iii) progressive knowledge distillation from
complex to simpler tasks. We then constructed the ReaMent dataset with 5,000
real-world dialogue samples, using a MentalMAC-distilled model to assist human
annotation. Vast experiments demonstrate that our method significantly narrows
the gap between student and teacher models and outperforms competitive LLMs
across key evaluation metrics. All code, datasets, and checkpoints will be
released upon paper acceptance. Warning: This paper contains content that may

Result: 消融显著提升多语言推理性能，语言与推理表示可解耦，且保留语言特征对语言保真度至关重要。

Conclusion: 该方法为轻量级、可解释的提升跨语言泛化策略，揭示了LLM多语言推理的内部机制。

Abstract: Multilingual reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language
models (LLMs), with performance disproportionately favoring high-resource
languages. Drawing inspiration from cognitive neuroscience, which suggests that
human reasoning functions largely independently of language processing, we
hypothesize that LLMs similarly encode reasoning and language as separable
components that can be disentangled to enhance multilingual reasoning. To
evaluate this, we perform a causal intervention by ablating language-specific
representations at inference time. Experiments on 10 open-source LLMs spanning
11 typologically diverse languages show that this language-specific ablation
consistently boosts multilingual reasoning performance. Layer-wise analyses
further confirm that language and reasoning representations can be effectively
decoupled throughout the model, yielding improved multilingual reasoning
capabilities, while preserving top-layer language features remains essential
for maintaining linguistic fidelity. Compared to post-training such as
supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, our training-free ablation
achieves comparable or superior results with minimal computational overhead.
These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms underlying multilingual
reasoning in LLMs and suggest a lightweight and interpretable strategy for
improving cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: Existing AI-generated text detection methods heavily depend on large
annotated datasets and external threshold tuning, restricting interpretability,
adaptability, and zero-shot effectiveness. To address these limitations, we
propose AGENT-X, a zero-shot multi-agent framework informed by classical
rhetoric and systemic functional linguistics. Specifically, we organize
detection guidelines into semantic, stylistic, and structural dimensions, each
independently evaluated by specialized linguistic agents that provide explicit
reasoning and robust calibrated confidence via semantic steering. A meta agent
integrates these assessments through confidence-aware aggregation, enabling
threshold-free, interpretable classification. Additionally, an adaptive
Mixture-of-Agent router dynamically selects guidelines based on inferred
textual characteristics. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that
AGENT-X substantially surpasses state-of-the-art supervised and zero-shot
approaches in accuracy, interpretability, and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网页导航需要长序列决策，现有MLLM奖励模型效率低且成本高。

Method: 构建WebPRM数据集和WebRewardBench基准，开发Web-Shepherd模型。

Result: Web-Shepherd比GPT-4o准确率高30分，成本降低10倍。

Conclusion: Web-Shepherd为网页导航提供高效、低成本的奖励模型。

Abstract: Web navigation is a unique domain that can automate many repetitive real-life
tasks and is challenging as it requires long-horizon sequential decision making
beyond typical multimodal large language model (MLLM) tasks. Yet, specialized
reward models for web navigation that can be utilized during both training and
test-time have been absent until now. Despite the importance of speed and
cost-effectiveness, prior works have utilized MLLMs as reward models, which
poses significant constraints for real-world deployment. To address this, in
this work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd
which could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level. To achieve
this, we first construct the WebPRM Collection, a large-scale dataset with 40K
step-level preference pairs and annotated checklists spanning diverse domains
and difficulty levels. Next, we also introduce the WebRewardBench, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for evaluating PRMs. In our experiments, we observe

10.9 points better performance, in 10 less cost compared to using GPT-4o-mini
as the verifier. Our model, dataset, and code are publicly available at LINK.

*Yanzhi Tian,Zeming Liu,Zhengyang Liu,Yuhang Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为DebackX的模型，用于解决复杂场景下的图像内机器翻译（IIMT）问题，通过分离背景与文本并直接翻译文本图像，显著提升了翻译质量和视觉效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IIMT研究多基于简化场景（如白底黑字单行文本），与实际应用场景差距较大，缺乏实用价值。因此，需研究复杂场景（如真实世界背景下的文本）下的IIMT。

Method: 提出DebackX模型，通过分离背景与文本图像、直接翻译文本图像，再将翻译后的文本与背景融合，生成目标图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型在翻译质量和视觉效果上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: DebackX模型为复杂场景下的IIMT提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate texts within images
from one language to another. Previous research on IIMT was primarily conducted
on simplified scenarios such as images of one-line text with black font in
white backgrounds, which is far from reality and impractical for applications
in the real world. To make IIMT research practically valuable, it is essential
to consider a complex scenario where the text backgrounds are derived from
real-world images. To facilitate research of complex scenario IIMT, we design
an IIMT dataset that includes subtitle text with real-world background. However
previous IIMT models perform inadequately in complex scenarios. To address the
issue, we propose the DebackX model, which separates the background and
text-image from the source image, performs translation on text-image directly,
and fuses the translated text-image with the background, to generate the target
image. Experimental results show that our model achieves improvements in both
translation quality and visual effect.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在文本生成方面表现优异，但其生成的文本中幻觉问题仍然显著，尤其是在长文本的后半部分，这一问题尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 通过长文档摘要作为案例，研究幻觉在长文本生成中的位置分布，并探讨注意力机制和解码过程对幻觉分布的影响。

Result: 发现幻觉在生成长文本的后半部分更为集中，揭示了注意力机制和解码动态可能是主要原因。

Conclusion: 研究提出改进方法，旨在减少长文本后半部分的幻觉，提高生成文本的忠实性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text generation
capabilities, including tasks like summarization, often producing coherent and
fluent outputs. However, faithfulness to source material remains a significant
challenge due to the generation of hallucinations. While extensive research
focuses on detecting and reducing these inaccuracies, less attention has been
paid to the positional distribution of hallucination within generated text,
particularly in long outputs. In this work, we investigate where hallucinations
occur in LLM-based long response generation, using long document summarization
as a key case study. Focusing on the challenging setting of long context-aware
long response generation, we find a consistent and concerning phenomenon:
hallucinations tend to concentrate disproportionately in the latter parts of
the generated long response. To understand this bias, we explore potential
contributing factors related to the dynamics of attention and decoding over
long sequences. Furthermore, we investigate methods to mitigate this positional
hallucination, aiming to improve faithfulness specifically in the concluding
segments of long outputs.

TLDR: ToxiRewriteCN是首个专注于中文去毒化并保留情感极性的数据集，包含1,556个标注三元组，覆盖多种现实场景。评估17种LLM显示，商业和MoE模型表现最佳，但所有模型在复杂场景中难以平衡安全性与情感保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中，去毒化内容的同时保留原意和情感极性是一个关键挑战，尤其在中文中，毒性常隐含于表情符号、谐音或上下文。

Method: 构建ToxiRewriteCN数据集，包含标注的三元组（有毒句子、情感对齐的非毒改写、毒性标注），并评估17种LLM在四个维度上的表现。

Result: 商业和MoE模型整体表现最佳，但所有模型在表情符号、谐音和对话等复杂场景中难以平衡安全性与情感保真度。

Conclusion: ToxiRewriteCN为中文可控、情感感知的去毒化研究提供了支持，未来需进一步优化模型在复杂场景中的表现。

Abstract: Detoxifying offensive language while preserving the speaker's original intent
is a challenging yet critical goal for improving the quality of online
interactions. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in rewriting
toxic content, they often default to overly polite rewrites, distorting the
emotional tone and communicative intent. This problem is especially acute in
Chinese, where toxicity often arises implicitly through emojis, homophones, or
discourse context. We present ToxiRewriteCN, the first Chinese detoxification
dataset explicitly designed to preserve sentiment polarity. The dataset
comprises 1,556 carefully annotated triplets, each containing a toxic sentence,
a sentiment-aligned non-toxic rewrite, and labeled toxic spans. It covers five
real-world scenarios: standard expressions, emoji-induced and homophonic
toxicity, as well as single-turn and multi-turn dialogues. We evaluate 17 LLMs,
including commercial and open-source models with variant architectures, across
four dimensions: detoxification accuracy, fluency, content preservation, and
sentiment polarity. Results show that while commercial and MoE models perform
best overall, all models struggle to balance safety with emotional fidelity in
more subtle or context-heavy settings such as emoji, homophone, and
dialogue-based inputs. We release ToxiRewriteCN to support future research on
controllable, sentiment-aware detoxification for Chinese.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种双视角关键词引导（DPKG）框架，用于多跳问题生成（MQG），通过区分问题关键词和文档关键词，有效整合关键词信息以生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用关键词的引导潜力，且未区分问题特定和文档特定关键词的不同作用。

Method: 定义了双视角关键词（问题和文档关键词），并提出了DPKG框架，结合扩展的Transformer编码器和两个答案感知的解码器分别生成关键词和问题。

Result: 实验证明DPKG框架在多跳问题生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: DPKG框架通过区分和整合双视角关键词，显著提升了多跳问题生成的性能。

Abstract: Multi-hop question generation (MQG) aims to generate questions that require
synthesizing multiple information snippets from documents to derive target
answers. The primary challenge lies in effectively pinpointing crucial
information snippets related to question-answer (QA) pairs, typically relying
on keywords. However, existing works fail to fully utilize the guiding
potential of keywords and neglect to differentiate the distinct roles of
question-specific and document-specific keywords. To address this, we define
dual-perspective keywords (i.e., question and document keywords) and propose a
Dual-Perspective Keyword-Guided (DPKG) framework, which seamlessly integrates
keywords into the multi-hop question generation process. We argue that question
keywords capture the questioner's intent, whereas document keywords reflect the
content related to the QA pair. Functionally, question and document keywords
work together to pinpoint essential information snippets in the document, with
question keywords required to appear in the generated question. The DPKG
framework consists of an expanded transformer encoder and two answer-aware
transformer decoders for keyword and question generation, respectively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our work, showcasing its
promising performance and underscoring its significant value in the MQG task.

TLDR: 论文重新定义了情感支持对话（ESC）任务，提出支持者可能在单次对话中连续使用多种策略，并引入新模型方法，实验显示大型语言模型（LLM）表现优于监督模型和人类支持者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ESC任务定义过于简化支持性响应的结构，忽略了支持者在单次对话中可能连续使用多种策略的现象。

Method: 通过分析ESConv数据集，重新定义ESC任务，并引入监督深度学习模型和大型语言模型（LLM）进行建模。

Result: 实验表明，在重新定义的任务下，LLM表现优于监督模型和人类支持者，且展现出更全面的支持能力。

Conclusion: 论文提出ESC任务的新定义和建模方法，验证了LLM在情感支持对话中的优势。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversations (ESC) are crucial for providing empathy,
validation, and actionable guidance to individuals in distress. However,
existing definitions of the ESC task oversimplify the structure of supportive
responses, typically modelling them as single strategy-utterance pairs. Through
a detailed corpus analysis of the ESConv dataset, we identify a common yet
previously overlooked phenomenon: emotional supporters often employ multiple
strategies consecutively within a single turn. We formally redefine the ESC
task to account for this, proposing a revised formulation that requires
generating the full sequence of strategy-utterance pairs given a dialogue
history. To facilitate this refined task, we introduce several modelling
approaches, including supervised deep learning models and large language
models. Our experiments show that, under this redefined task, state-of-the-art
LLMs outperform both supervised models and human supporters. Notably, contrary
to some earlier findings, we observe that LLMs frequently ask questions and
provide suggestions, demonstrating more holistic support capabilities.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为*prefilling attack*的简单方法，通过在模型输出前添加结构化自然语言前缀（如“*The correct option is:*”），显著提高了大型语言模型（LLMs）在多项选择题任务中的评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于*first-token probability*（FTP）的评估方法存在脆弱性，可能导致模型选择无关标记（*misalignment*）或误解标记用途（*misinterpretation*），影响评估的可靠性。

Method: 提出*prefilling attack*方法，即在模型输出前添加结构化前缀，无需修改模型参数即可引导模型生成清晰有效的选项。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了准确性、校准性和输出一致性，优于标准FTP，并接近需要完整解码和外部分类器的开放生成方法的性能。

Conclusion: *prefilling attack*是一种简单、鲁棒且低成本的改进FTP评估可靠性的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on multiple-choice
question answering (MCQA) tasks using *first-token probability* (FTP), which
selects the answer option whose initial token has the highest likelihood. While
efficient, FTP can be fragile: models may assign high probability to unrelated
tokens (*misalignment*) or use a valid token merely as part of a generic
preamble rather than as a clear answer choice (*misinterpretation*),
undermining the reliability of symbolic evaluation. We propose a simple
solution: the *prefilling attack*, a structured natural-language prefix (e.g.,
"*The correct option is:*") prepended to the model output. Originally explored
in AI safety, we repurpose prefilling to steer the model to respond with a
clean, valid option, without modifying its parameters. Empirically, the FTP
with prefilling strategy substantially improves accuracy, calibration, and
output consistency across a broad set of LLMs and MCQA benchmarks. It
outperforms standard FTP and often matches the performance of open-ended
generation approaches that require full decoding and external classifiers,
while being significantly more efficient. Our findings suggest that prefilling
is a simple, robust, and low-cost method to enhance the reliability of
FTP-based evaluation in multiple-choice settings.

Conclusion: 单元语言和任务提示建模有效提升了语音到语音翻译的性能。

Abstract: The success of building textless speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) models
has attracted much attention. However, S2ST still faces two main challenges: 1)
extracting linguistic features for various speech signals, called cross-modal
(CM), and 2) learning alignment of difference languages in long sequences,
called cross-lingual (CL). We propose the unit language to overcome the two
modeling challenges. The unit language can be considered a text-like
representation format, constructed using $n$-gram language modeling. We
implement multi-task learning to utilize the unit language in guiding the
speech modeling process. Our initial results reveal a conflict when applying
source and target unit languages simultaneously. We propose task prompt
modeling to mitigate this conflict. We conduct experiments on four languages of
the Voxpupil dataset. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over a
strong baseline and achieves performance comparable to models trained with
text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有改写攻击方法需要大量数据和计算资源，且对先进检测算法效果不佳。

Method: 通过设计指令引导LLM生成人类化文本，并构建机器化词汇分布作为对比，解码时去除机器化特征。

Result: 实验证明CoPA能有效欺骗多种文本检测器。

Conclusion: CoPA是一种高效且无需训练的改写攻击方法。

Abstract: The misuse of large language models (LLMs), such as academic plagiarism, has
driven the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. To bypass
these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these
texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require
substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser,
and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection
algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive
\textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that
effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is
to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like
texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can
still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes
that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an
auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like
distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns
from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to
produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical
analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: FlowKV提出了一种多轮隔离机制，用于优化LLM中的KV Cache管理，避免重复压缩旧上下文，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV Cache在多轮对话中线性增长，导致计算成本高，现有策略因重复压缩早期上下文而性能下降。

Method: FlowKV采用多轮隔离机制，仅对新生成的KV对进行压缩，避免旧上下文的重复压缩。

Result: FlowKV在指令跟随准确性和用户偏好保留上显著优于基线策略，提升幅度从10.90%到75.40%。

Conclusion: FlowKV有效解决了KV Cache管理中的信息丢失和上下文遗忘问题，适用于任何无需训练的KV Cache压缩方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn
conversational applications, where the management of the Key-Value (KV) Cache
presents a significant bottleneck. The linear growth of the KV Cache with
dialogue history imposes substantial computational costs, and existing eviction
strategies often degrade performance by repeatedly compressing early
conversational context, leading to information loss and context forgetting.
This paper introduces FlowKV, a novel \textbf{multi-turn isolation mechanism}
for KV Cache management, which can be applied to any KV Cache compression
method without training. FlowKV's core innovation is a multi-turn isolation
mechanism that preserves the accumulated compressed KV cache from past turns.
Compression is then strategically applied only to the newly generated KV pairs
of the latest completed turn, effectively preventing the re-compression of
older context and thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our results
demonstrate that FlowKV consistently and significantly outperforms baseline
strategies in maintaining instruction-following accuracy and user preference
retention from 10.90\% to 75.40\%, particularly in later conversational turns.

Abstract: Despite the wide-scale usage and development of emotion classification
datasets in NLP, the field lacks a standardized, large-scale resource that
follows a psychologically grounded taxonomy. Existing datasets either use
inconsistent emotion categories, suffer from limited sample size, or focus on

Conclusion: 该方法能有效估计KL散度，揭示了语言模型在预训练和层间的行为特征。

Abstract: A recently proposed method enables efficient estimation of the KL divergence
between language models, including models with different architectures, by
assigning coordinates based on log-likelihood vectors. To better understand the
behavior of this metric, we systematically evaluate KL divergence across a wide
range of conditions using publicly available language models. Our analysis
covers comparisons between pretraining checkpoints, fine-tuned and base models,
and layers via the logit lens. We find that trajectories of language models, as
measured by KL divergence, exhibit a spiral structure during pretraining and
thread-like progressions across layers. Furthermore, we show that, in terms of
diffusion exponents, model trajectories in the log-likelihood space are more
constrained than those in weight space.

Conclusion: 研究强调了语音产生范式的重要性，为改进脑机接口以帮助严重言语障碍患者提供了机会。

Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential
for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical
communication technologies. In this study, we investigated
magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during
speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks.
Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone
classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine
learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network
architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding
phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding
accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and
playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available
during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently
outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of
traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and
high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency
bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz)
and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy,
suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural
processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether
decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement
artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological
refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of
examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity,
offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals
with severe speech impairments.

Conclusion: 自然语言推理在自动化代码调试和解决复杂编程问题中具有潜力。

Abstract: Debugging is a critical aspect of LLM's coding ability. Early debugging
efforts primarily focused on code-level analysis, which often falls short when
addressing complex programming errors that require a deeper understanding of
algorithmic logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
shifted attention toward leveraging natural language reasoning to enhance
code-related tasks. However, two fundamental questions remain unanswered: What
type of natural language format is most effective for debugging tasks? And what
specific benefits does natural language reasoning bring to the debugging
process? In this paper, we introduce NL-DEBUGGING, a novel framework that
employs natural language as an intermediate representation to improve code
debugging. By debugging at a natural language level, we demonstrate that
NL-DEBUGGING outperforms traditional debugging methods and enables a broader
modification space through direct refinement guided by execution feedback. Our
findings highlight the potential of natural language reasoning to advance
automated code debugging and address complex programming challenges.

Result: 研究发现，即使是GPT-4o等先进模型结合跨语言技术，也无法取得令人满意的结果。

Conclusion: X-WebAgentBench有望成为现实应用中多语言代理场景的重要基准测试工具。

Abstract: Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have achieved significant
success in interactive environments, attracting significant academic and
industrial attention. Despite these advancements, current research
predominantly focuses on English scenarios. In reality, there are over 7,000
languages worldwide, all of which demand access to comparable agentic services.
Nevertheless, the development of language agents remains inadequate for meeting
the diverse requirements of multilingual agentic applications. To fill this
gap, we introduce X-WebAgentBench, a novel multilingual agent benchmark in an
interactive web environment, which evaluates the planning and interaction
performance of language agents across multiple languages, thereby contributing
to the advancement of global agent intelligence. Additionally, we assess the
performance of various LLMs and cross-lingual alignment methods, examining
their effectiveness in enhancing agents. Our findings reveal that even advanced
models like GPT-4o, when combined with cross-lingual techniques, fail to
achieve satisfactory results. We hope that X-WebAgentBench can serve as a
valuable benchmark for multilingual agent scenario in real-world applications.

Conclusion: RePPL不仅提升了幻觉检测性能，还揭示了幻觉的混沌模式，展示了其潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful, but hallucinations remain
a vital obstacle to their trustworthy use. While previous works improved the
capability of hallucination detection by measuring uncertainty, they all lack
the ability to explain the provenance behind why hallucinations occur, i.e.,
which part of the inputs tends to trigger hallucinations. Recent works on the
prompt attack indicate that uncertainty exists in semantic propagation, where
attention mechanisms gradually fuse local token information into high-level
semantics across layers. Meanwhile, uncertainty also emerges in language
generation, due to its probability-based selection of high-level semantics for
sampled generations. Based on that, we propose RePPL to recalibrate uncertainty
measurement by these two aspects, which dispatches explainable uncertainty
scores to each token and aggregates in Perplexity-style Log-Average form as
total score. Experiments show that our method achieves the best comprehensive
detection performance across various QA datasets on advanced models (average
AUC of 0.833), and our method is capable of producing token-level uncertainty
scores as explanations for the hallucination. Leveraging these scores, we
preliminarily find the chaotic pattern of hallucination and showcase its
promising usage.

paper, we investigate the anchoring effect, a cognitive bias where the mind
relies heavily on the first information as anchors to make affected judgments.
We explore whether LLMs are affected by anchoring, the underlying mechanisms,
and potential mitigation strategies. To facilitate studies at scale on the
anchoring effect, we introduce a new dataset, SynAnchors. Combining refined
evaluation metrics, we benchmark current widely used LLMs. Our findings show
that LLMs' anchoring bias exists commonly with shallow-layer acting and is not
eliminated by conventional strategies, while reasoning can offer some
mitigation. This recontextualization via cognitive psychology urges that LLM
evaluations focus not on standard benchmarks or over-optimized robustness
tests, but on cognitive-bias-aware trustworthy evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在数学和编程等任务中表现出色，但其推理能力提升不一定带来安全性改善，甚至可能降低安全性，因此需研究如何增强LRMs的安全性。

Method: 通过监督微调（SFT）进行实证研究，分析直接蒸馏安全响应的失败模式，并提出解决方法。探索短或模板化推理链的效果，并尝试混合数学推理数据。

Result: 解决失败模式后，安全性显著提升；短或模板化推理链可达到类似安全性且更易学习；混合数学推理数据有助于平衡安全性与过度拒绝。

Conclusion: 研究为提升LRMs安全性提供了全面视角，揭示了推理在安全性中的角色，并提出了实用方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success on
reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, their
enhanced reasoning capabilities do not necessarily translate to improved safety
performance-and in some cases, may even degrade it. This raises an important
research question: how can we enhance the safety of LRMs? In this paper, we
present a comprehensive empirical study on how to enhance the safety of LRMs
through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our investigation begins with an
unexpected observation: directly distilling safe responses from DeepSeek-R1
fails to significantly enhance safety. We analyze this phenomenon and identify
three key failure patterns that contribute to it. We then demonstrate that
explicitly addressing these issues during the data distillation process can
lead to substantial safety improvements. Next, we explore whether a long and
complex reasoning process is necessary for achieving safety. Interestingly, we
find that simply using short or template-based reasoning process can attain
comparable safety performance-and are significantly easier for models to learn
than more intricate reasoning chains. These findings prompt a deeper reflection
on the role of reasoning in ensuring safety. Finally, we find that mixing math
reasoning data during safety fine-tuning is helpful to balance safety and
over-refusal. Overall, we hope our empirical study could provide a more
holistic picture on enhancing the safety of LRMs. The code and data used in our
experiments are released in https://github.com/thu-coai/LRM-Safety-Study.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为GainLoRA的新方法，通过引入门控模块整合新旧LoRA分支，有效缓解持续学习中的遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的持续学习方法通常强制新旧分支对旧任务贡献相同，可能导致遗忘。

Method: GainLoRA为每个新任务扩展新LoRA分支，并引入门控模块整合新旧分支，最小化新分支对旧任务的贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明，GainLoRA在持续学习基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GainLoRA通过门控模块有效缓解遗忘问题，提升了模型整体性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), which requires the model to learn multiple tasks
sequentially, is crucial for language models (LMs). Recently, low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), one of the most representative parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, has gained increasing attention in CL of LMs.
However, most existing CL methods based on LoRA typically expand a new LoRA
branch to learn each new task and force the new and old LoRA branches to
contribute equally to old tasks, potentially leading to forgetting. In this
work, we propose a new method, called gated integration of low-rank adaptation
(GainLoRA), for CL of LMs. GainLoRA expands a new LoRA branch for each new task
and introduces gating modules to integrate the new and old LoRA branches.
Furthermore, GainLoRA leverages the new gating module to minimize the
contribution from the new LoRA branch to old tasks, effectively mitigating
forgetting and improving the model's overall performance. Experimental results
on CL benchmarks demonstrate that GainLoRA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 扩散模型生成高保真图像的能力使其广泛应用，但存在NSFW内容和社交偏见问题，现有方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出自发现方法，识别嵌入空间中的语义方向向量，限制文本嵌入在安全区域，并结合LoRA初始化以减少对其他语义的影响。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效减少NSFW内容和社交偏见，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了扩散模型的社会责任，且可与现有方法结合使用。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of diffusion models to generate high-fidelity images
has led to their widespread adoption. However, concerns have also arisen
regarding their potential to produce Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content and
exhibit social biases, hindering their practical use in real-world
applications. In response to this challenge, prior work has focused on
employing security filters to identify and exclude toxic text, or
alternatively, fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models to erase sensitive
concepts. Unfortunately, existing methods struggle to achieve satisfactory
performance in the sense that they can have a significant impact on the normal
model output while still failing to prevent the generation of harmful content
in some cases. In this paper, we propose a novel self-discovery approach to
identifying a semantic direction vector in the embedding space to restrict text
embedding within a safe region. Our method circumvents the need for correcting
individual words within the input text and steers the entire text prompt
towards a safe region in the embedding space, thereby enhancing model
robustness against all possibly unsafe prompts. In addition, we employ Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) for semantic direction vector initialization to reduce the
impact on the model performance for other semantics. Furthermore, our method
can also be integrated with existing methods to improve their social
responsibility. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our method can effectively reduce NSFW content and mitigate social bias
generated by diffusion models compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决构建语言模型映射时因依赖大量文本而带来的高计算成本问题。

Method: 通过重采样选择重要文本，权重与各模型对文本的log-likelihood方差成正比。

Result: 实验表明，该方法仅需约一半文本即可达到与均匀采样相当的性能，并能高效整合新模型。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了语言模型映射的可扩展和高效构建。

Abstract: We address the computational cost of constructing a model map, which embeds
diverse language models into a common space for comparison via KL divergence.
The map relies on log-likelihoods over a large text set, making the cost
proportional to the number of texts. To reduce this cost, we propose a
resampling method that selects important texts with weights proportional to the
variance of log-likelihoods across models for each text. Our method
significantly reduces the number of required texts while preserving the
accuracy of KL divergence estimates. Experiments show that it achieves
comparable performance to uniform sampling with about half as many texts, and
also facilitates efficient incorporation of new models into an existing map.
These results enable scalable and efficient construction of language model
maps.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly advance, we introduce Hunyuan-TurboS,
a novel large hybrid Transformer-Mamba Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. It
synergistically combines Mamba's long-sequence processing efficiency with
Transformer's superior contextual understanding. Hunyuan-TurboS features an
adaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching
between rapid responses for simple queries and deep "thinking" modes for
complex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B
activated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention,
FFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear
complexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE
structure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context
length and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our
comprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised
Fine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method,
Multi-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage
Large-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general
instruction-following. Evaluations show strong performance: overall top 7 rank
on LMSYS Chatbot Arena with a score of 1356, outperforming leading models like
Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 (1352) and o4-mini-2025-04-16 (1345). TurboS also achieves
an average of 77.9% across 23 automated benchmarks. Hunyuan-TurboS balances
high performance and efficiency, offering substantial capabilities at lower
inference costs than many reasoning models, establishing a new paradigm for
efficient large-scale pre-trained models.

TLDR: 知识蒸馏（KD）可将大语言模型压缩为小模型并保持性能，但对小模型效果及机制研究不足。本文通过大规模实验发现，KD对小模型（0.5B-7B参数）在14个复杂推理任务中平均提升10%，但对大模型效果有限（1.3%）。教师模型性能影响小，任务专长更关键。KD提升准确性但可能牺牲推理一致性。

Motivation: 探索知识蒸馏对小语言模型的效果及机制，填补研究空白。

Method: 对0.5B-7B参数模型在14个零样本复杂推理任务中进行大规模实证与统计分析。

Result: KD对小模型平均提升10%，峰值22%；大模型仅1.3%。教师任务专长比性能更关键，且KD可能降低推理一致性。

Conclusion: KD对小模型效果显著，但需权衡准确性提升与推理一致性，教师信号与平滑策略对性能影响大。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large language
models into smaller ones while preserving performance. Despite the recent
traction of KD research, its effectiveness for smaller language models (LMs)
and the mechanisms driving knowledge transfer remain underexplored. In this
work, we present the first large-scale empirical and statistical analysis of KD
across models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters on 14 complex reasoning tasks
in a zero-shot setting. Our findings reveal that KD can improve the average
performance of smaller models by up to $10\%$, with a peak task specific gain
of $22\%$, while providing only marginal benefits ($\sim 1.3\%$) for larger
models. Surprisingly, teacher performance has a minimal impact on student
outcomes, while teacher task expertise impacts KD effectiveness. A correlation
study indicates that smaller LMs benefit more from KD, whereas larger LMs show
diminished gains. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between improvements
in student performance and reasoning fidelity, suggesting that while KD
enhances accuracy, it does not always maintain the structured decision-making
processes of the teacher. Our ablation study further highlights the importance
of teacher signals and logit smoothing in influencing students' performance
after distillation. Overall, our study offers a comprehensive empirical and
statistical assessment of KD, highlighting both its benefits and trade-offs
when distilling knowledge from larger to smaller LMs.

Motivation: 预训练语言模型在参数高效微调（如适配器）下进行不确定性估计仍具挑战性，现有方法（如Mahalanobis距离和softmax响应）表现不足。

Method: 1. 使用可微的最大函数近似；2. 通过L2-SP正则化锚定微调头权重并正则化模型。

Result: 在五个NLP分类数据集和四种语言模型上，AdUE1优于基线方法，且无需修改基础模型，置信度校准更优。

Conclusion: AdUE1是一种轻量级且高效的不确定性估计方法，显著提升了预训练语言模型在分类任务中的表现。

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation remains a critical challenge in adapting pre-trained
language models to classification tasks, particularly under parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approaches such as adapters. We introduce AdUE1, an efficient
post-hoc uncertainty estimation (UE) method, to enhance softmax-based
estimates. Our approach (1) uses a differentiable approximation of the maximum
function and (2) applies additional regularization through L2-SP, anchoring the
fine-tuned head weights and regularizing the model. Evaluations on five NLP
classification datasets across four language models (RoBERTa, ELECTRA, LLaMA-2,
Qwen) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms established
baselines such as Mahalanobis distance and softmax response. Our approach is
lightweight (no base-model changes) and produces better-calibrated confidence.

Result: 实验表明，即使是先进的MLLMs（包括专有模型）在跨语言一致性上仍有困难。

Conclusion: 需开发更鲁棒的方法以构建真正多语言且具备文化意识的模型。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving
consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural
knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we
introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate
cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering
benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages,
focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall
assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark
appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results
reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle
to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust
approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

Motivation: 现有研究在检索增强生成的各个子任务上进行了优化，但将这些优化整合到一个统一框架中仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: RoleRAG通过动态激活单一LLM实例中的不同模块，简化部署并减少资源消耗。

Abstract: Existing studies have optimized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) across
various sub-tasks, such as query understanding and retrieval refinement, but
integrating these optimizations into a unified framework remains challenging.
To tackle this problem, this work proposes RoleRAG, a unified RAG framework
that achieves efficient multi-task processing through role-specific token
optimization. RoleRAG comprises six modules, each handling a specific sub-task
within the RAG process. Additionally, we introduce a query graph to represent
the decomposition of the query, which can be dynamically resolved according to
the decomposing state. All modules are driven by the same underlying LLM,
distinguished by task-specific role tokens that are individually optimized.
This design allows RoleRAG to dynamically activate different modules within a
single LLM instance, thereby streamlining deployment and reducing resource
consumption. Experimental results on five open-domain question-answering
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generalizability, and flexibility of
our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示和离线优化的方法在冷启动和长期个性化方面表现不足，需要更动态和深入的设计。

Method: RLPA框架通过模拟用户模型与LLM交互，利用双层次奖励结构（画像奖励和响应奖励）迭代优化用户画像。

Result: 实验表明，Qwen-RLPA在个性化对话中优于提示和离线微调基线，甚至超过Claude-3.5和GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 动态画像推断是构建个性化对话系统的更有效范式。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is essential for enabling large language models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric dialogue. While recent prompt-based and
offline optimization methods offer preliminary solutions, they fall short in
cold-start scenarios and long-term personalization due to their inherently
static and shallow designs. In this work, we introduce the Reinforcement
Learning for Personalized Alignment (RLPA) framework, in which an LLM interacts
with a simulated user model to iteratively infer and refine user profiles
through dialogue. The training process is guided by a dual-level reward
structure: the Profile Reward encourages accurate construction of user
representations, while the Response Reward incentivizes generation of responses
consistent with the inferred profile. We instantiate RLPA by fine-tuning
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, resulting in Qwen-RLPA, which achieves state-of-the-art
performance in personalized dialogue. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
Qwen-RLPA consistently outperforms prompting and offline fine-tuning baselines,
and even surpasses advanced commercial models such as Claude-3.5 and GPT-4o.
Further analysis highlights Qwen-RLPA's robustness in reconciling conflicting
user preferences, sustaining long-term personalization and delivering more
efficient inference compared to recent reasoning-focused LLMs. These results
emphasize the potential of dynamic profile inference as a more effective
paradigm for building personalized dialogue systems.

Conclusion: Joint Flashback Adaptation是一种高效且任务无关的方法，仅需少量flashbacks即可实现平滑适应。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks.
However, it is challenging for them to learn new tasks incrementally due to
catastrophic forgetting. Existing approaches rely on experience replay,
optimization constraints, or task differentiation, which encounter strict
limitations in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose Joint
Flashback Adaptation. We first introduce flashbacks -- a limited number of
prompts from old tasks -- when adapting to new tasks and constrain the
deviations of the model outputs compared to the original one. We then
interpolate latent tasks between flashbacks and new tasks to enable jointly
learning relevant latent tasks, new tasks, and flashbacks, alleviating data
sparsity in flashbacks and facilitating knowledge sharing for smooth
adaptation. Our method requires only a limited number of flashbacks without
access to the replay data and is task-agnostic. We conduct extensive
experiments on state-of-the-art large language models across 1000+
instruction-following tasks, arithmetic reasoning tasks, and general reasoning
tasks. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in
improving generalization on new tasks and reducing forgetting in old tasks.

Abstract: The scaling law of Large Language Models (LLMs) reveals a power-law
relationship, showing diminishing return on performance as model scale
increases. While training LLMs from scratch is resource-intensive, fine-tuning
a pre-trained model for specific tasks has become a practical alternative. Full
fine-tuning (FFT) achieves strong performance; however, it is computationally
expensive and inefficient. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, like
LoRA, have been proposed to address these challenges by freezing the
pre-trained model and adding lightweight task-specific modules. LoRA, in
particular, has proven effective, but its application to multi-task scenarios
is limited by interference between tasks. Recent approaches, such as
Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) and asymmetric LoRA, have aimed to mitigate these
issues but still struggle with sample scarcity and noise interference due to
their fixed structure. In response, we propose CoLA, a more flexible LoRA
architecture with an efficient initialization scheme, and introduces three
collaborative strategies to enhance performance by better utilizing the
quantitative relationships between matrices $A$ and $B$. Our experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of CoLA, outperforming existing
PEFT methods, especially in low-sample scenarios. Our data and code are fully
publicly available at https://github.com/zyy-2001/CoLA.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in diverse reasoning tasks, yet their application to complex
physics reasoning remains underexplored. Physics reasoning presents unique
challenges, requiring grounding in physical conditions and the interpretation
of multimodal information. Current physics benchmarks are limited, often
focusing on text-only inputs or solely on problem-solving, thereby overlooking
the critical intermediate steps of variable identification and process
formulation. To address these limitations, we introduce PhysicsArena, the first
multimodal physics reasoning benchmark designed to holistically evaluate MLLMs
across three critical dimensions: variable identification, physical process
formulation, and solution derivation. PhysicsArena aims to provide a
comprehensive platform for assessing and advancing the multimodal physics
reasoning abilities of MLLMs.

Result: 实验证明LFTF算法显著减少LLMs的性别偏见，同时保持其通用能力。

Conclusion: LFTF算法有效缓解LLMs的性别偏见，提出的数据集和指标为量化偏见提供工具。

Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted widespread attention
due to their powerful performance. However, due to the unavoidable exposure to
socially biased data during training, LLMs tend to exhibit social biases,
particularly gender bias. To better explore and quantifying the degree of
gender bias in LLMs, we propose a pair of datasets named GenBiasEval and
GenHintEval, respectively. The GenBiasEval is responsible for evaluating the
degree of gender bias in LLMs, accompanied by an evaluation metric named
AFGB-Score (Absolutely Fair Gender Bias Score). Meanwhile, the GenHintEval is
used to assess whether LLMs can provide responses consistent with prompts that
contain gender hints, along with the accompanying evaluation metric UB-Score
(UnBias Score). Besides, in order to mitigate gender bias in LLMs more
effectively, we present the LFTF (Locating First and Then Fine-Tuning)
algorithm.The algorithm first ranks specific LLM blocks by their relevance to
gender bias in descending order using a metric called BMI (Block Mitigating
Importance Score). Based on this ranking, the block most strongly associated
with gender bias is then fine-tuned using a carefully designed loss function.
Numerous experiments have shown that our proposed LFTF algorithm can
significantly mitigate gender bias in LLMs while maintaining their general
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型内部知识与训练数据上下文知识之间的冲突，传统的监督微调方法效果不佳，因此需要一种更有效的微调策略。

Method: 设计了查询多样化策略以检测知识冲突，并提出KaFT方法，根据冲突程度为训练样本分配不同的奖励权重。

Result: 实验表明，KaFT在四种大型语言模型上均带来显著性能提升，并有效改善了模型泛化能力和减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: KaFT是一种简单而有效的方法，能够通过知识冲突感知显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a common approach to improve the
domain-specific question-answering (QA) performance of large language models
(LLMs). However, recent literature reveals that due to the conflicts between
LLMs' internal knowledge and the context knowledge of training data, vanilla
SFT using the full QA training set is usually suboptimal. In this paper, we
first design a query diversification strategy for robust conflict detection and
then conduct a series of experiments to analyze the impact of knowledge
conflict. We find that 1) training samples with varied conflicts contribute
differently, where SFT on the data with large conflicts leads to catastrophic
performance drops; 2) compared to directly filtering out the conflict data,
appropriately applying the conflict data would be more beneficial. Motivated by
this, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Fine-tuning (namely
KaFT) approach to effectively boost LLMs' performance. The core of KaFT is to
adapt the training weight by assigning different rewards for different training
samples according to conflict level. Extensive experiments show that KaFT
brings consistent and significant improvements across four LLMs. More analyses
prove that KaFT effectively improves the model generalization and alleviates
the hallucination.

Conclusion: protoknowledge概念和分析框架为理解LLMs的知识利用提供了新视角，并具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce the concept of protoknowledge to formalize and measure how
sequences of tokens encoding Knowledge Graphs are internalized during
pretraining and utilized at inference time by Large Language Models (LLMs).
Indeed, LLMs have demonstrated the ability to memorize vast amounts of token
sequences during pretraining, and a central open question is how they leverage
this memorization as reusable knowledge through generalization. We then
categorize protoknowledge into lexical, hierarchical, and topological forms,
varying on the type of knowledge that needs to be activated. We measure
protoknowledge through Knowledge Activation Tasks (KATs), analyzing its general
properties such as semantic bias. We then investigate the impact of
protoknowledge on Text-to-SPARQL performance by varying prompting strategies
depending on input conditions. To this end, we adopt a novel analysis framework
that assesses whether model predictions align with the successful activation of
the relevant protoknowledge for each query. This methodology provides a
practical tool to explore Semantic-Level Data Contamination and serves as an
effective strategy for Closed-Pretraining models.

Conclusion: MITT是一种轻量级方法，能有效提升多语言环境下的推理性能，尤其是低资源语言。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a widely adopted inference-time strategy for
boosting reasoning performance. However, its effectiveness has been studied
almost exclusively in English, leaving its behavior in other languages largely
unexplored. We present the first systematic study of test-time scaling in
multilingual settings, evaluating DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLama-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B across both high- and low-resource Latin-script
languages. Our findings reveal that the relative gains from test-time scaling
vary significantly across languages. Additionally, models frequently switch to
English mid-reasoning, even when operating under strictly monolingual prompts.
We further show that low-resource languages not only produce initial reasoning
thoughts that differ significantly from English but also have lower internal
consistency across generations in their early reasoning. Building on our
findings, we introduce MITT (Multilingual Initial Thought Transfer), an
unsupervised and lightweight reasoning prefix-tuning approach that transfers
high-resource reasoning prefixes to enhance test-time scaling across all
languages, addressing inconsistencies in multilingual reasoning performance.
MITT significantly boosts DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B's reasoning performance,
especially for underrepresented languages.

Conclusion: BiasLens为LLM的偏差发现提供了可扩展、可解释且高效的解决方案，有助于提升公平性和透明度。

Abstract: Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly undermines their
reliability and fairness. We focus on a common form of bias: when two reference
concepts in the model's concept space, such as sentiment polarities (e.g.,
"positive" and "negative"), are asymmetrically correlated with a third, target
concept, such as a reviewing aspect, the model exhibits unintended bias. For
instance, the understanding of "food" should not skew toward any particular
sentiment. Existing bias evaluation methods assess behavioral differences of
LLMs by constructing labeled data for different social groups and measuring
model responses across them, a process that requires substantial human effort
and captures only a limited set of social concepts. To overcome these
limitations, we propose BiasLens, a test-set-free bias analysis framework based
on the structure of the model's vector space. BiasLens combines Concept
Activation Vectors (CAVs) with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract
interpretable concept representations, and quantifies bias by measuring the
variation in representational similarity between the target concept and each of
the reference concepts. Even without labeled data, BiasLens shows strong
agreement with traditional bias evaluation metrics (Spearman correlation r >
0.85). Moreover, BiasLens reveals forms of bias that are difficult to detect
using existing methods. For example, in simulated clinical scenarios, a
patient's insurance status can cause the LLM to produce biased diagnostic
assessments. Overall, BiasLens offers a scalable, interpretable, and efficient
paradigm for bias discovery, paving the way for improving fairness and
transparency in LLMs.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLM）在知识检索和再现方面的能力需要无偏见的QA和RC基准，但现有基准存在偏见和代表性不足的问题。

Method: 通过定性分析30篇基准论文和定量分析20个基准数据集，研究基准创建中的参与者、社会偏见处理及偏见与创建者人口统计的关系。

Result: 大多数基准论文未充分说明创建者和标注者的信息，仅一篇明确报告了解决社会代表性问题的措施，数据中普遍存在性别、宗教和地理偏见。

Conclusion: 需要更透明和偏见过滤的基准创建实践，以促进公平LLM的发展。

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) and reading comprehension (RC) benchmarks are
essential for assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
retrieving and reproducing knowledge. However, we demonstrate that popular QA
and RC benchmarks are biased and do not cover questions about different
demographics or regions in a representative way, potentially due to a lack of
diversity of those involved in their creation. We perform a qualitative content
analysis of 30 benchmark papers and a quantitative analysis of 20 respective
benchmark datasets to learn (1) who is involved in the benchmark creation, (2)
how social bias is addressed or prevented, and (3) whether the demographics of
the creators and annotators correspond to particular biases in the content.
Most analyzed benchmark papers provided insufficient information regarding the
stakeholders involved in benchmark creation, particularly the annotators.
Notably, just one of the benchmark papers explicitly reported measures taken to
address social representation issues. Moreover, the data analysis revealed
gender, religion, and geographic biases across a wide range of encyclopedic,
commonsense, and scholarly benchmarks. More transparent and bias-aware QA and
RC benchmark creation practices are needed to facilitate better scrutiny and
incentivize the development of fairer LLMs.

Abstract: Critical questions are essential resources to provoke critical thinking when
encountering an argumentative text. We present our system for the Critical
Questions Generation (CQs-Gen) Shared Task at ArgMining 2025. Our approach
leverages large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought prompting to
generate critical questions guided by Walton's argumentation schemes. For each
input intervention, we conversationally prompt LLMs to instantiate the
corresponding argument scheme template to first obtain structured arguments,
and then generate relevant critical questions. Following this, we rank all the
available critical questions by prompting LLMs to select the top 3 most helpful
questions based on the original intervention text. This combination of
structured argumentation theory and step-by-step reasoning enables the
generation of contextually relevant and diverse critical questions. Our
pipeline achieves competitive performance in the final test set, showing its
potential to foster critical thinking given argumentative text and detect
missing or uninformed claims. Code available at

TLDR: 检索增强生成（RAG）通过外部语料库检索的段落提升LLM准确性。本文研究发现，LLM的位置偏差（信息权重因位置不同而异）不仅影响其利用相关段落的能力，还增加其受干扰段落的影响。实验表明，检索管道虽试图获取相关段落，但60%的查询在前10检索结果中包含高干扰段落。因此，位置偏差的实际影响较小，因为相关和干扰段落均被削弱。尝试基于位置偏好重排段落的策略效果不优于随机重排。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM accuracy by adding passages
retrieved from an external corpus to the LLM prompt. This paper investigates
how positional bias - the tendency of LLMs to weight information differently
based on its position in the prompt - affects not only the LLM's capability to
capitalize on relevant passages, but also its susceptibility to distracting
passages. Through extensive experiments on three benchmarks, we show how
state-of-the-art retrieval pipelines, while attempting to retrieve relevant
passages, systematically bring highly distracting ones to the top ranks, with
over 60% of queries containing at least one highly distracting passage among
the top-10 retrieved passages. As a result, the impact of the LLM positional
bias, which in controlled settings is often reported as very prominent by
related works, is actually marginal in real scenarios since both relevant and
distracting passages are, in turn, penalized. Indeed, our findings reveal that
sophisticated strategies that attempt to rearrange the passages based on LLM
positional preferences do not perform better than random shuffling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can transform education, but their optimization
for direct question-answering often undermines effective pedagogy which
requires strategically withholding answers. To mitigate this, we propose an
online reinforcement learning (RL)-based alignment framework that can quickly
adapt LLMs into effective tutors using simulated student-tutor interactions by
emphasizing pedagogical quality and guided problem-solving over simply giving
away answers. We use our method to train a 7B parameter tutor model without
human annotations which reaches similar performance to larger proprietary
models like LearnLM. We introduce a controllable reward weighting to balance
pedagogical support and student solving accuracy, allowing us to trace the
Pareto frontier between these two objectives. Our models better preserve
reasoning capabilities than single-turn SFT baselines and can optionally
enhance interpretability through thinking tags that expose the model's
instructional planning.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
complex problems through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly by
generating long reasoning traces. However, these extended outputs often exhibit
substantial redundancy, which limits the efficiency of LRMs. In this paper, we
investigate RL-based approaches to promote reasoning efficiency. Specifically,
we first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient
reasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on
this perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method
(LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target
length. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal
balance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based
on two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during
training, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and
dynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of
thought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be
difficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries.
This approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow
thinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. The resulting method is termed
LASER-D (Dynamic and Difficulty-aware). Experiments on
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B show that our approach significantly enhances both
reasoning performance and response length efficiency. For instance, LASER-D and
its variant achieve a +6.1 improvement on AIME2024 while reducing token usage
by 63%. Further analysis reveals our RL-based compression produces more concise
reasoning patterns with less redundant "self-reflections". Resources are at

TLDR: 该研究提出了一种名为MAPLE的新型评估框架，用于全面量化大型语言模型在数学推理中的表现，而不仅仅是基于最终答案的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学推理中面临多步逻辑执行的挑战，但现有评估框架仅关注最终答案的准确性，忽略了推理过程中的问题。

Method: 研究提出了一种名为MAPLE的评估指标，通过整合错误率、冗余性和有效性来量化推理偏差。

Result: MAPLE评分能够更全面地评估大型语言模型在数学推理中的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力提供了一种更全面的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate considerable potential in various
natural language tasks but face significant challenges in mathematical
reasoning, particularly in executing precise, multi-step logic. However,
current evaluation frameworks judge their performance solely based on accuracy,
which only accounts for the final answer. This study explores these pitfalls by
employing a novel evaluation framework. We propose an evaluation metric called
the MAPLE score, which holistically quantifies reasoning misalignment by
integrating error rates, redundancy, and validity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决检索增强生成模型中输出与检索内容不一致的问题，提升气候科学领域大语言模型的可靠性。

Method: 通过自动评估模型输出的忠实性，排除不忠实训练数据子集，优化ClimateGPT的训练。

Result: 优化后的ClimateGPT Faithful+在支持的原子声明中忠实性从30%提升至57%。

Conclusion: 排除不忠实训练数据可显著提升模型输出的忠实性，为气候科学领域提供更可靠的语言模型。

Abstract: Large language models that use retrieval augmented generation have the
potential to unlock valuable knowledge for researchers, policymakers, and the
public by making long and technical climate-related documents more accessible.
While this approach can help alleviate factual hallucinations by relying on
retrieved passages as additional context, its effectiveness depends on whether
the model's output remains faithful to these passages. To address this, we
explore the automatic assessment of faithfulness of different models in this
setting. We then focus on ClimateGPT, a large language model specialised in
climate science, to examine which factors in its instruction fine-tuning impact
the model's faithfulness. By excluding unfaithful subsets of the model's
training data, we develop ClimateGPT Faithful+, which achieves an improvement
in faithfulness from 30% to 57% in supported atomic claims according to our
automatic metric.

TLDR: 通过引导技术增强LLM的推理能力，无需外部数据集，提出基于SAE和无SAE的两种算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长CoT数据需求高且成本高的问题，提升LLM推理能力。

Method: 使用SAE提取特征引导LLM内部状态，并开发无SAE的直接计算算法。

Result: 实验表明两种算法均显著提升LLM推理能力。

Conclusion: 引导技术可有效增强LLM推理，无需依赖外部数据或SAE。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to solve reasoning and
mathematical problems using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. Expanding CoT
length, as seen in models such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly enhances this
reasoning for complex problems, but requires costly and high-quality long CoT
data and fine-tuning. This work, inspired by the deep thinking paradigm of
DeepSeek-R1, utilizes a steering technique to enhance the reasoning ability of
an LLM without external datasets. Our method first employs Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to extract interpretable features from vanilla CoT. These features are
then used to steer the LLM's internal states during generation. Recognizing
that many LLMs do not have corresponding pre-trained SAEs, we further introduce
a novel SAE-free steering algorithm, which directly computes steering
directions from the residual activations of an LLM, obviating the need for an
explicit SAE. Experimental results demonstrate that both our SAE-based and
subsequent SAE-free steering algorithms significantly enhance the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

TLDR: 提出了一种数据驱动的方法，直接在Canary模型中实现单词级时间戳预测，无需外部对齐机制，精度和召回率在80%-90%之间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的时间戳信息对语音内容检索和定时字幕等下游任务至关重要，传统方法需要外部模块，而新方法简化了这一过程。

Method: 利用NeMo Forced Aligner作为教师模型生成时间戳，并引入<|timestamp|>标记训练Canary模型直接预测时间戳。

Result: 在四种语言中，时间戳预测误差为20-120毫秒，WER影响极小；在自动语音翻译任务中，误差约为200毫秒。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，适用于多种语言和任务，显著简化了时间戳预测流程。

Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach for enabling word-level timestamp
prediction in the Canary model. Accurate timestamp information is crucial for a
variety of downstream tasks such as speech content retrieval and timed
subtitles. While traditional hybrid systems and end-to-end (E2E) models may
employ external modules for timestamp prediction, our approach eliminates the
need for separate alignment mechanisms. By leveraging the NeMo Forced Aligner
(NFA) as a teacher model, we generate word-level timestamps and train the
Canary model to predict timestamps directly. We introduce a new <|timestamp|>
token, enabling the Canary model to predict start and end timestamps for each
word. Our method demonstrates precision and recall rates between 80% and 90%,
with timestamp prediction errors ranging from 20 to 120 ms across four
languages, with minimal WER degradation. Additionally, we extend our system to
automatic speech translation (AST) tasks, achieving timestamp prediction errors
around 200 milliseconds.

TLDR: 研究发现，开源大语言模型（LLMs）在微调后存在数据泄露风险，模型创建者可通过后门训练提取私有数据。实验表明，提取成功率高达76.3%至94.9%。防御策略可能被绕过，需进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示开源LLMs微调后私有数据被提取的风险，引发对数据安全的关注。

Method: 通过后门训练，仅需黑盒访问微调后的下游模型，即可提取私有数据。实验覆盖4种开源模型和2个数据集。

Result: 提取成功率高达76.3%（实际场景）和94.9%（理想场景）。防御策略可能被绕过。

Conclusion: 开源LLMs微调存在严重数据泄露风险，需更多研究解决。代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Fine-tuning on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with proprietary data
is now a standard practice for downstream developers to obtain task-specific
LLMs. Surprisingly, we reveal a new and concerning risk along with the
practice: the creator of the open-source LLMs can later extract the private
downstream fine-tuning data through simple backdoor training, only requiring
black-box access to the fine-tuned downstream model. Our comprehensive
experiments, across 4 popularly used open-source models with 3B to 32B
parameters and 2 downstream datasets, suggest that the extraction performance
can be strikingly high: in practical settings, as much as 76.3% downstream
fine-tuning data (queries) out of a total 5,000 samples can be perfectly
extracted, and the success rate can increase to 94.9% in more ideal settings.
We also explore a detection-based defense strategy but find it can be bypassed
with improved attack. Overall, we highlight the emergency of this newly
identified data breaching risk in fine-tuning, and we hope that more follow-up
research could push the progress of addressing this concerning risk. The code
and data used in our experiments are released at

TLDR: 提出了一种新型的双工语音到语音（S2S）架构，支持连续用户输入和代理输出，无需语音预训练，显著简化了构建过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音语言模型局限于轮换式交互，缺乏实时适应性（如用户打断）。

Method: 采用双工S2S架构，分别建模用户和代理流，使用预训练流编码器，优化代理语音编码。

Result: 模型在推理、轮换和打断能力上优于现有双工模型，比特率减半（0.6 kbps），且所需语音数据更少。

Conclusion: 该模型是首个公开可用的双工S2S模型，简化了构建流程并促进了可复现性。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue is an intuitive form of human-computer interaction, yet
current speech language models often remain constrained to turn-based
exchanges, lacking real-time adaptability such as user barge-in. We propose a
novel duplex speech to speech (S2S) architecture featuring continuous user
inputs and codec agent outputs with channel fusion that directly models
simultaneous user and agent streams. Using a pretrained streaming encoder for
user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech
pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec
fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared
to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in
abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech
pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex
S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S
model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.

### [277] [UniErase: Unlearning Token as a Universal Erasure Primitive for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15674)

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: UniErase是一种新的语言模型遗忘范式，通过可学习的参数后缀（遗忘标记）实现目标遗忘行为，在遗忘效果和模型能力上均达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有遗忘方法在遗忘效果和模型能力之间的不平衡问题，以及上下文遗忘方法的泛化性不足。

Method: UniErase分为两个阶段：(I)通过标记优化将目标遗忘输出绑定到模型的自回归概率分布；(II)通过轻量级模型编辑激活学习到的标记以概率性诱导遗忘目标。

Result: 在TOFU基准测试中，UniErase仅修改约3.66%的LLM参数，遗忘效果提升4.01倍，同时模型能力保持更好。

Conclusion: UniErase在遗忘领域展示了双重顶级性能，为标记学习诱导遗忘目标提供了新研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models require iterative updates to address challenges such as
knowledge conflicts and outdated information (e.g., incorrect, private, or
illegal contents). Machine unlearning provides a systematic methodology for
targeted knowledge removal from trained models, enabling elimination of
sensitive information influences. However, mainstream fine-tuning-based
unlearning methods often fail to balance unlearning efficacy and model ability,
frequently resulting in catastrophic model collapse under extensive knowledge
removal. Meanwhile, in-context unlearning, which relies solely on contextual
prompting without modifying the model's intrinsic mechanisms, suffers from
limited generalizability and struggles to achieve true unlearning. In this
work, we introduce UniErase, a novel unlearning paradigm that employs learnable
parametric suffix (unlearning token) to steer language models toward targeted
forgetting behaviors. UniErase operates through two key phases: (I) an
optimization stage that binds desired unlearning outputs to the model's
autoregressive probability distribution via token optimization, followed by
(II) a lightweight model editing phase that activates the learned token to
probabilistically induce specified forgetting objective. Serving as a new
research direction for token learning to induce unlearning target, UniErase
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across batch, sequential, and
precise unlearning under fictitious and real-world knowledge settings.
Remarkably, in terms of TOFU benchmark, UniErase, modifying only around 3.66%
of the LLM parameters, outperforms previous forgetting SOTA baseline by around
4.01 times for model ability with even better unlearning efficacy. Similarly,
UniErase, maintaining more ability, also surpasses previous retaining SOTA by
35.96% for unlearning efficacy, showing dual top-tier performances in current
unlearing domain.

*Cosimo Iaia,Bhavin Choksi,Emily Wiebers,Gemma Roig,Christian J. Fiebach*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究探讨了人类和语言模型在表示名词具体性（concreteness）时的相似性，发现两者在具体性维度上显著对齐，但在其他心理语言学维度上不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解具体性在心理和大脑中的表征是心理学、神经科学和计算语言学的核心问题，但目前语言模型如何表示具体性尚不明确。

Method: 通过行为判断估计人类隐含的语义距离，并使用表征相似性分析（RSA）比较人类和语言模型的语义表征。

Result: 人类和语言模型的表征空间在具体性维度上显著对齐，且这种对齐主要由具体性驱动，而非其他词特征。

Conclusion: 人类和语言模型在具体性维度上趋同，但在其他维度上不一致，揭示了具体性在语义表征中的独特作用。

Abstract: The nouns of our language refer to either concrete entities (like a table) or
abstract concepts (like justice or love), and cognitive psychology has
established that concreteness influences how words are processed. Accordingly,
understanding how concreteness is represented in our mind and brain is a
central question in psychology, neuroscience, and computational linguistics.
While the advent of powerful language models has allowed for quantitative
inquiries into the nature of semantic representations, it remains largely
underexplored how they represent concreteness. Here, we used behavioral
judgments to estimate semantic distances implicitly used by humans, for a set
of carefully selected abstract and concrete nouns. Using Representational
Similarity Analysis, we find that the implicit representational space of
participants and the semantic representations of language models are
significantly aligned. We also find that both representational spaces are
implicitly aligned to an explicit representation of concreteness, which was
obtained from our participants using an additional concreteness rating task.
Importantly, using ablation experiments, we demonstrate that the human-to-model
alignment is substantially driven by concreteness, but not by other important
word characteristics established in psycholinguistics. These results indicate
that humans and language models converge on the concreteness dimension, but not
on other dimensions.

TLDR: FL-LLaMA是一个基于LLaMA2的安全、高效且自适应的联邦分割框架，解决了私有数据分散和计算需求高的问题，通过噪声注入、并行训练和动态分区点优化了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 私有数据质量高但分散，传统联邦学习在安全、效率和适应性上存在挑战，FL-LLaMA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用噪声注入隐藏状态、并行训练策略（客户端批次和服务器分层）、动态分区点调整，以及注意力掩码压缩和KV缓存机制。

Result: 在NLU、摘要和对话QA任务中，FL-LLaMA性能接近集中式LLaMA2，训练速度提升2倍，推理速度提升8倍。

Conclusion: FL-LLaMA在安全性、效率和适应性上表现优异，为联邦学习中的LLM部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Private data is typically larger and of higher quality than public data,
offering great potential to improve LLM. However, its scattered distribution
across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their
deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based
split learning model has emerged, offloading most model parameters to the
server while retaining only the embedding and output layers on clients to
ensure privacy. However, it still faces significant challenges in security,
efficiency, and adaptability: 1) embedding gradients are vulnerable to attacks,
leading to reverse engineering of private data; 2) the autoregressive nature of
LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially,
causing high communication overhead; 3) fixed partition points lack
adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FL-LLaMA, a
secure, efficient, and adaptive federated split framework based on LLaMA2.
First, we place some input and output blocks on the local client and inject
Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states, enabling secure end-to-end
propagation. Second, we employ client-batch and server-hierarchical strategies
to achieve parallel training, along with attention-mask compression and KV
cache mechanisms to accelerate inference, reducing communication costs
effectively. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points
for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements and hardware
limitations. Experiments on NLU, summarization and conversational QA tasks show
that FL-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2, and
achieves up to 2x train speedups and 8x inference speedups. Further analysis of
privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the
effectiveness of FL-LLaMA in security and adaptability.

*Gengyang Li,Yifeng Gao,Yuming Li,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: ThinkLess框架通过提前终止推理生成减少延迟和内存使用，同时保持输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示中推理令牌过长导致的延迟、内存占用和答案截断问题。

Method: 插入终止令牌提前结束冗余推理，利用注意力分析信息迁移，并通过后调节机制保持答案结构。

Result: 在不微调或无辅助数据的情况下，ThinkLess在减少解码时间和内存消耗的同时，达到与完整CoT解码相当的准确性。

Conclusion: ThinkLess是一种高效推理框架，显著提升推理效率而不影响模型性能。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), the excessive length of reasoning tokens increases latency and
KV cache memory usage, and may even truncate final answers under context
limits. We propose ThinkLess, an inference-efficient framework that terminates
reasoning generation early and maintains output quality without modifying the
model. Atttention analysis reveals that answer tokens focus minimally on
earlier reasoning steps and primarily attend to the reasoning terminator token,
due to information migration under causal masking. Building on this insight,
ThinkLess inserts the terminator token at earlier positions to skip redundant
reasoning while preserving the underlying knowledge transfer. To prevent format
discruption casued by early termination, ThinkLess employs a lightweight
post-regulation mechanism, relying on the model's natural instruction-following
ability to produce well-structured answers. Without fine-tuning or auxiliary
data, ThinkLess achieves comparable accuracy to full-length CoT decoding while
greatly reducing decoding time and memory consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法偏向奖励最大化路径，缺乏外部知识，限制了探索能力和推理边界。

Method: TAPO通过自适应整合结构化思维模式，平衡内部探索与外部指导利用。

Result: 实验显示TAPO在AIME、AMC和Minerva Math上分别优于GRPO 99%、41%和17%。

Conclusion: TAPO展示了在多任务和多领域中的广泛应用潜力，并提升了模型的可解释性和输出可读性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective method for training
reasoning models. However, existing RL approaches typically bias the model's
output distribution toward reward-maximizing paths without introducing external
knowledge. This limits their exploration capacity and results in a narrower
reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. To address this
limitation, we propose TAPO (Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization), a novel
framework that augments RL by incorporating external high-level guidance
("thought patterns"). By adaptively integrating structured thoughts during
training, TAPO effectively balances model-internal exploration and external
guidance exploitation. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME, 41% on AMC, and 17% on Minerva
Math. Notably, these high-level thought patterns, abstracted from only 500
prior samples, generalize effectively across various tasks and models. This
highlights TAPO's potential for broader applications across multiple tasks and
domains. Our further analysis reveals that introducing external guidance
produces powerful reasoning models with superior explainability of inference
behavior and enhanced output readability.

Abstract: The surge of user-generated online content presents a wealth of insights into
customer preferences and market trends. However, the highly diverse, complex,
and context-rich nature of such contents poses significant challenges to
traditional opinion mining approaches. To address this, we introduce Online
Opinion Mining Benchmark (OOMB), a novel dataset and evaluation protocol
designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to mine opinions
effectively from diverse and intricate online environments. OOMB provides
extensive (entity, feature, opinion) tuple annotations and a comprehensive
opinion-centric summary that highlights key opinion topics within each content,
thereby enabling the evaluation of both the extractive and abstractive
capabilities of models. Through our proposed benchmark, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of which aspects remain challenging and where LLMs
exhibit adaptability, to explore whether they can effectively serve as opinion
miners in realistic online scenarios. This study lays the foundation for
LLM-based opinion mining and discusses directions for future research in this
field.

Motivation: 现有研究表明BERT的[CLS]令牌和其他令牌及中间层均包含有价值的信息，但未充分利用。

Method: 提出三种改进：跨层最大池化[CLS]、[CLS]通过MHA关注最终层、结合序列最大池化与MHA。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中，MaxPoolBERT性能优于标准BERT-base，尤其在低资源任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: MaxPoolBERT无需预训练或显著增加模型规模，即可有效提升BERT的分类准确性。

Abstract: The [CLS] token in BERT is commonly used as a fixed-length representation for
classification tasks, yet prior work has shown that both other tokens and
intermediate layers encode valuable contextual information. In this work, we
propose MaxPoolBERT, a lightweight extension to BERT that refines the [CLS]
representation by aggregating information across layers and tokens.
Specifically, we explore three modifications: (i) max-pooling the [CLS] token
across multiple layers, (ii) enabling the [CLS] token to attend over the entire
final layer using an additional multi-head attention (MHA) layer, and (iii)
combining max-pooling across the full sequence with MHA. Our approach enhances
BERT's classification accuracy (especially on low-resource tasks) without
requiring pre-training or significantly increasing model size. Experiments on
the GLUE benchmark show that MaxPoolBERT consistently achieves a better
performance on the standard BERT-base model.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the process of efficiently removing specific information

However, few studies have explored the effectiveness of unlearning methods on
complex tasks, particularly speech-related ones. This paper introduces
UnSLU-BENCH, the first benchmark for machine unlearning in spoken language

address the unlearning of data from specific speakers as a way to evaluate the
quality of potential "right to be forgotten" requests. We assess eight

capture their efficacy, utility, and efficiency. UnSLU-BENCH sets a foundation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型中的知识可能不准确或过时，现有编辑方法在连续编辑中性能下降，缺乏长期知识保留机制。

Method: 将连续编辑建模为约束随机规划，结合排队论和Lyapunov优化，分解为可处理的子问题。

Result: 实验表明，LyapLock支持超过10,000次编辑，稳定通用能力，编辑效率提升11.89%。

Conclusion: LyapLock是首个具有理论保证的模型编辑框架，显著提升了连续编辑的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Large Language Models often contain factually incorrect or outdated
knowledge, giving rise to model editing methods for precise knowledge updates.
However, current mainstream locate-then-edit approaches exhibit a progressive
performance decline during sequential editing, due to inadequate mechanisms for
long-term knowledge preservation. To tackle this, we model the sequential
editing as a constrained stochastic programming. Given the challenges posed by
the cumulative preservation error constraint and the gradually revealed editing
tasks, \textbf{LyapLock} is proposed. It integrates queuing theory and Lyapunov
optimization to decompose the long-term constrained programming into tractable
stepwise subproblems for efficient solving. This is the first model editing
framework with rigorous theoretical guarantees, achieving asymptotic optimal
editing performance while meeting the constraints of long-term knowledge
preservation. Experimental results show that our framework scales sequential
editing capacity to over 10,000 edits while stabilizing general capabilities
and boosting average editing efficacy by 11.89\% over SOTA baselines.
Furthermore, it can be leveraged to enhance the performance of baseline
methods. Our code is released on https://github.com/caskcsg/LyapLock.

overlooking the rich information embedded in the model's internal
representations. In this paper, we propose Safety Representation Ranking (SRR),
a listwise ranking framework that selects safe responses using hidden states
from the LLM itself. SRR encodes both instructions and candidate completions
using intermediate transformer representations and ranks candidates via a
lightweight similarity-based scorer. Our approach directly leverages internal
model states and supervision at the list level to capture subtle safety
signals. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SRR significantly
improves robustness to adversarial prompts. Our code will be available upon
publication.

TLDR: TurnaboutLLM是一个评估大型语言模型（LLMs）演绎推理能力的新框架和数据集，基于侦探游戏Ace Attorney和Danganronpa的交互式玩法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过复杂叙事环境中的矛盾识别任务，评估LLMs在演绎推理方面的能力，揭示现有推理增强策略的局限性。

Method: 利用侦探游戏中的证词和证据，构建长叙事背景下的矛盾识别任务，评估12种先进LLMs的表现。

Result: 发现广泛使用的推理增强策略（如扩展思维和思维链提示）效果有限，且上下文大小、推理步骤数和答案空间大小对模型性能有不同影响。

Conclusion: TurnaboutLLM为LLMs在复杂叙事环境中的演绎推理能力提供了重要挑战，揭示了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: This paper introduces TurnaboutLLM, a novel framework and dataset for
evaluating the deductive reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
leveraging the interactive gameplay of detective games Ace Attorney and
Danganronpa. The framework tasks LLMs with identifying contradictions between
testimonies and evidences within long narrative contexts, a challenging task
due to the large answer space and diverse reasoning types presented by its
questions. We evaluate twelve state-of-the-art LLMs on the dataset, hinting at
limitations of popular strategies for enhancing deductive reasoning such as
extensive thinking and Chain-of-Thought prompting. The results also suggest
varying effects of context size, the number of reasoning step and answer space
size on model performance. Overall, TurnaboutLLM presents a substantial
challenge for LLMs' deductive reasoning abilities in complex, narrative-rich
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的心理健康支持方法缺乏临床基础，无法满足实际心理咨询需求，特别是在诊断和治疗推理方面。

Method: 提出自动化数据合成管道，处理真实心理健康帖子，生成多轮对话结构，并利用国际诊断标准和多种治疗框架指导LLM模拟临床推理。

Result: PsyLLM在全面性、专业性、真实性和安全性四个维度上显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: PsyLLM为心理健康咨询提供了一种系统化的解决方案，填补了现有LLM在临床推理方面的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold significant potential for mental health
support, capable of generating empathetic responses and simulating therapeutic
conversations. However, existing LLM-based approaches often lack the clinical
grounding necessary for real-world psychological counseling, particularly in
explicit diagnostic reasoning aligned with standards like the DSM/ICD and
incorporating diverse therapeutic modalities beyond basic empathy or single
strategies. To address these critical limitations, we propose PsyLLM, the first
large language model designed to systematically integrate both diagnostic and
therapeutic reasoning for mental health counseling. To develop the PsyLLM, we
propose a novel automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline processes
real-world mental health posts, generates multi-turn dialogue structures, and
leverages LLMs guided by international diagnostic standards (e.g., DSM/ICD) and
multiple therapeutic frameworks (e.g., CBT, ACT, psychodynamic) to simulate
detailed clinical reasoning processes. Rigorous multi-dimensional filtering
ensures the generation of high-quality, clinically aligned dialogue data. In
addition, we introduce a new benchmark and evaluation protocol, assessing
counseling quality across four key dimensions: comprehensiveness,
professionalism, authenticity, and safety. Our experiments demonstrate that
PsyLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models on this
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文首次全面研究了多语言大语言模型（MLLMs）的记忆行为，分析了95种语言，发现语言相似性对记忆模式有显著影响，并提出了一种基于图的度量方法。


<details>

Motivation: 随着MLLMs的广泛应用，理解其记忆行为变得至关重要，但以往研究主要关注单语言模型，多语言记忆行为尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究分析了不同规模、架构和记忆定义的MLLMs，并提出了一种基于语言相似性的图相关度量方法。

Result: 研究发现，语言相似性显著影响记忆模式，训练数据较少的相似语言表现出更高的记忆性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了语言相似性在评估和缓解MLLMs记忆漏洞中的重要性，并为多语言NLP提供了实证依据。

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of Memorization in Multilingual
Large Language Models (MLLMs), analyzing 95 languages using models across
diverse model scales, architectures, and memorization definitions. As MLLMs are
increasingly deployed, understanding their memorization behavior has become
critical. Yet prior work has focused primarily on monolingual models, leaving
multilingual memorization underexplored, despite the inherently long-tailed
nature of training corpora. We find that the prevailing assumption, that
memorization is highly correlated with training data availability, fails to
fully explain memorization patterns in MLLMs. We hypothesize that treating
languages in isolation - ignoring their similarities - obscures the true
patterns of memorization. To address this, we propose a novel graph-based
correlation metric that incorporates language similarity to analyze
cross-lingual memorization. Our analysis reveals that among similar languages,
those with fewer training tokens tend to exhibit higher memorization, a trend
that only emerges when cross-lingual relationships are explicitly modeled.
These findings underscore the importance of a language-aware perspective in
evaluating and mitigating memorization vulnerabilities in MLLMs. This also
constitutes empirical evidence that language similarity both explains
Memorization in MLLMs and underpins Cross-lingual Transferability, with broad
implications for multilingual NLP.

Conclusion: VocalBench为语音交互模型的评估提供了全面工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并指明了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the
development of multi-modal models capable of vocal communication. Unlike
text-based interactions, speech conveys rich and diverse information, including
semantic content, acoustic variations, paralanguage cues, and environmental
context. However, existing evaluations of speech interaction models
predominantly focus on the quality of their textual responses, often
overlooking critical aspects of vocal performance and lacking benchmarks with
vocal-specific test instances. To address this gap, we propose VocalBench, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate speech interaction models'
capabilities in vocal communication. VocalBench comprises 9,400 carefully
curated instances across four key dimensions: semantic quality, acoustic
performance, conversational abilities, and robustness. It covers 16 fundamental
skills essential for effective vocal interaction. Experimental results reveal
significant variability in current model capabilities, each exhibiting distinct
strengths and weaknesses, and provide valuable insights to guide future
research in speech-based interaction systems. Code and evaluation instances are

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型依赖大量数据提升推理能力，但仅靠数据扩展已不切实际，需要模型自主提升推理能力。

Method: 提出DTE框架，利用多智能体辩论轨迹训练单一模型，并引入Reflect-Critique-Refine提示策略优化辩论质量。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，DTE框架平均准确率提升8.92%（GSM-PLUS数据集），并展现出跨领域泛化能力（平均提升5.8%）。

Conclusion: DTE框架能有效提升语言模型的推理能力，且具备通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have improved significantly in their reasoning
through extensive training on massive datasets. However, relying solely on
additional data for improvement is becoming increasingly impractical,
highlighting the need for models to autonomously enhance their reasoning
without external supervision. In this paper, we propose Debate, Train, Evolve
(DTE), a novel ground truth-free training framework that uses multi-agent
debate traces to evolve a single language model. We also introduce a new
prompting strategy Reflect-Critique-Refine, to improve debate quality by
explicitly instructing agents to critique and refine their reasoning. Extensive
evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks with six open-weight models show that
our DTE framework achieve substantial improvements, with an average accuracy
gain of 8.92% on the challenging GSM-PLUS dataset. Furthermore, we observe
strong cross-domain generalization, with an average accuracy gain of 5.8% on
all other benchmarks, suggesting that our method captures general reasoning
capabilities.

TLDR: HyCo$_2$是一种混合上下文压缩方法，结合全局和局部视角优化LLM的长序列推理，显著提升性能并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文压缩方法因忽略文本内容相关性的不均匀分布和用户指令多样性，导致信息丢失。HyCo$_2$旨在平衡全局语义和局部细节的保留。

Method: HyCo$_2$通过混合适配器优化全局语义，并结合分类层基于局部视角决定token保留概率。通过辅助预训练促进全局与局部压缩的协同整合。

Result: HyCo$_2$在七个知识密集型QA基准上平均提升LLM性能13.1%，同时减少88.8%的token消耗，性能与未压缩方法相当。

Conclusion: HyCo$_2$有效解决了长序列推理中的信息保留问题，显著提升了LLM的效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges in
long-sequence inference due to computational inefficiency and redundant
processing, driving interest in context compression techniques. Existing
methods often rely on token importance to perform hard local compression or
encode context into latent representations for soft global compression.
However, the uneven distribution of textual content relevance and the diversity
of demands for user instructions mean these approaches frequently lead to the
loss of potentially valuable information. To address this, we propose
$\textbf{Hy}$brid $\textbf{Co}$ntext $\textbf{Co}$mpression (HyCo$_2$) for
LLMs, which integrates both global and local perspectives to guide context
compression while retaining both the essential semantics and critical details
for task completion. Specifically, we employ a hybrid adapter to refine global
semantics with the global view, based on the observation that different
adapters excel at different tasks. Then we incorporate a classification layer
that assigns a retention probability to each context token based on the local
view, determining whether it should be retained or discarded. To foster a
balanced integration of global and local compression, we introduce auxiliary
paraphrasing and completion pretraining before instruction tuning. This
promotes a synergistic integration that emphasizes instruction-relevant
information while preserving essential local details, ultimately balancing
local and global information retention in context compression. Experiments show
that our HyCo$_2$ method significantly enhances long-text reasoning while
reducing token usage. It improves the performance of various LLM series by an
average of 13.1\% across seven knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks. Moreover,
HyCo$_2$ matches the performance of uncompressed methods while reducing token
consumption by 88.8\%.

TLDR: ConvSearch-R1是一个自驱动的对话查询重构框架，通过强化学习直接优化检索信号，无需外部监督，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有对话查询重构方法对外部监督的高依赖以及与下游检索器对齐不足的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：自驱动策略预热和检索引导的强化学习，结合排名激励奖励机制。

Result: 在TopiOCQA和QReCC数据集上表现优异，TopiOCQA提升超10%，且无需外部监督。

Conclusion: ConvSearch-R1通过自驱动优化检索信号，显著提升了对话查询重构的效果。

Abstract: Conversational search systems require effective handling of context-dependent
queries that often contain ambiguity, omission, and coreference. Conversational
Query Reformulation (CQR) addresses this challenge by transforming these
queries into self-contained forms suitable for off-the-shelf retrievers.
However, existing CQR approaches suffer from two critical constraints: high
dependency on costly external supervision from human annotations or large
language models, and insufficient alignment between the rewriting model and
downstream retrievers. We present ConvSearch-R1, the first self-driven
framework that completely eliminates dependency on external rewrite supervision
by leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize reformulation directly through
retrieval signals. Our novel two-stage approach combines Self-Driven Policy
Warm-Up to address the cold-start problem through retrieval-guided
self-distillation, followed by Retrieval-Guided Reinforcement Learning with a
specially designed rank-incentive reward shaping mechanism that addresses the
sparsity issue in conventional retrieval metrics. Extensive experiments on
TopiOCQA and QReCC datasets demonstrate that ConvSearch-R1 significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 10% improvement
on the challenging TopiOCQA dataset while using smaller 3B parameter models
without any external supervision.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Soft Thinking的训练无关方法，通过生成连续的抽象概念令牌来模拟人类的“软”推理，突破了传统离散语言推理的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理模型受限于离散语言令牌的表达能力，无法充分探索推理路径，而人类认知则更依赖于抽象和连续的概念。

Method: Soft Thinking通过概率加权的令牌嵌入混合生成连续概念令牌，形成连续概念空间，实现平滑过渡和更丰富的表示。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，Soft Thinking显著提高了推理准确性（最高提升2.48分）并减少了令牌使用（最高减少22.4%）。

Conclusion: Soft Thinking突破了离散语言推理的瓶颈，同时保持了输出的可解释性和可读性，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Human cognition typically involves thinking through abstract, fluid concepts
rather than strictly using discrete linguistic tokens. Current reasoning
models, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human
language, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in
the semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and
upper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration
of reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling
one token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free
method that emulates human-like "soft" reasoning by generating soft, abstract
concept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created
by the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the
continuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer
representations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence,
each generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related
discrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge
effectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse
mathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness
and efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points
while simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard
CoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain
highly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking
to break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning. Code is

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为延迟KV-Cache的机制，用于加速扩散语言模型（DLMs）的推理过程，解决了其非自回归架构和双向注意力导致的慢推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型（DLMs）因非自回归架构和双向注意力而推理速度慢，缺乏自回归模型中的键值缓存机制。论文旨在通过设计一种类似KV-Cache的机制来加速DLMs的推理。

Method: 提出了延迟KV-Cache机制，包括两种变体：dKV-Cache-Decode（几乎无损加速）和dKV-Cache-Greedy（更高速度但性能略有下降）。该机制根据扩散过程中不同token的动态特性，延迟并条件化地缓存键值状态。

Result: 实验表明，延迟KV-Cache在推理速度上实现了2-10倍的提升，缩小了自回归模型与DLMs之间的差距，并在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 延迟KV-Cache机制成功解决了DLMs推理速度慢的问题，证明了缓存机制在DLMs中的可行性，甚至可以在不重新训练现有模型的情况下应用。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have been seen as a promising competitor for
autoregressive language models. However, diffusion language models have long
been constrained by slow inference. A core challenge is that their
non-autoregressive architecture and bidirectional attention preclude the
key-value cache that accelerates decoding. We address this bottleneck by
proposing a KV-cache-like mechanism, delayed KV-Cache, for the denoising
process of DLMs. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different
tokens have distinct representation dynamics throughout the diffusion process.
Accordingly, we propose a delayed and conditioned caching strategy for key and
value states. We design two complementary variants to cache key and value
step-by-step: (1) dKV-Cache-Decode, which provides almost lossless
acceleration, and even improves performance on long sequences, suggesting that
existing DLMs may under-utilise contextual information during inference. (2)
dKV-Cache-Greedy, which has aggressive caching with reduced lifespan, achieving
higher speed-ups with quadratic time complexity at the cost of some performance
degradation. dKV-Cache, in final, achieves from 2-10x speedup in inference,
largely narrowing the gap between ARs and DLMs. We evaluate our dKV-Cache on
several benchmarks, delivering acceleration across general language
understanding, mathematical, and code-generation benchmarks. Experiments
demonstrate that cache can also be used in DLMs, even in a training-free manner
from current DLMs.

Motivation: 现有细粒度评估方法（如FactScore）验证单个事实但忽略事实间依赖关系，导致潜在漏洞。

Method: 提出MontageLie基准测试，构建欺骗性叙述；开发DoveScore框架，建模事实间关系。

Result: DoveScore在AUC-ROC上比现有方法提升8%，提供更鲁棒的长文本对齐评估。

Conclusion: DoveScore通过建模事实间关系，显著提升评估鲁棒性，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Information alignment evaluators are vital for various NLG evaluation tasks
and trustworthy LLM deployment, reducing hallucinations and enhancing user
trust. Current fine-grained methods, like FactScore, verify facts individually
but neglect inter-fact dependencies, enabling subtle vulnerabilities. In this
work, we introduce MontageLie, a challenging benchmark that constructs
deceptive narratives by "montaging" truthful statements without introducing
explicit hallucinations. We demonstrate that both coarse-grained LLM-based
evaluators and current fine-grained frameworks are susceptible to this attack,
with AUC-ROC scores falling below 65%. To enable more robust fine-grained
evaluation, we propose DoveScore, a novel framework that jointly verifies
factual accuracy and event-order consistency. By modeling inter-fact
relationships, DoveScore outperforms existing fine-grained methods by over 8%,
providing a more robust solution for long-form text alignment evaluation. Our
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/dannalily/DoveScore.

Motivation: 现有LLM-as-a-judge框架易受恶意利用，需探索更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 利用judge-LLM的信号作为奖励，通过强化学习优化生成文本前导的模型。

Result: 优化的前导生成模型显著提升评估分数，且方法难以检测，具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了LLM-as-a-judge框架的潜在漏洞，并展示了强化学习在优化任务中的潜力。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely evaluated by
other LLMs trained to predict human preferences. This framework--known as
LLM-as-a-judge--is highly scalable and relatively low cost. However, it is also
vulnerable to malicious exploitation, as LLM responses can be tuned to overfit
the preferences of the judge. Previous work shows that the answers generated by
a candidate-LLM can be edited post hoc to maximise the score assigned to them
by a judge-LLM. In this study, we adopt a different approach and use the signal
provided by judge-LLMs as a reward to adversarially tune models that generate
text preambles designed to boost downstream performance. We find that frozen
LLMs pipelined with these models attain higher LLM-evaluation scores than
existing frameworks. Crucially, unlike other frameworks which intervene
directly on the model's response, our method is virtually undetectable. We also
demonstrate that the effectiveness of the tuned preamble generator transfers
when the candidate-LLM and the judge-LLM are replaced with models that are not
used during training. These findings raise important questions about the design
of more reliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluation settings. They also demonstrate that
human preferences can be reverse engineered effectively, by pipelining LLMs to
optimise upstream preambles via reinforcement learning--an approach that could
find future applications in diverse tasks and domains beyond adversarial
attacks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved
remarkable performance in the domain of reasoning. A key component of their
training is the incorporation of verifiable rewards within reinforcement
learning (RL). However, existing reward benchmarks do not evaluate
reference-based reward systems, leaving researchers with limited understanding
of the accuracy of verifiers used in RL. In this paper, we introduce two
benchmarks, VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, designed to assess the
performance of reference-based reward systems. These benchmarks are constructed
through meticulous data collection and curation, followed by careful human
annotation to ensure high quality. Current models still show considerable room
for improvement on both VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, especially
smaller-scale models. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough and comprehensive
analysis of evaluation results, offering insights for understanding and
developing reference-based reward systems. Our proposed benchmarks serve as
effective tools for guiding the development of verifier accuracy and the
reasoning capabilities of models trained via RL in reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在敏感领域（如企业和政府）的部署增加，确保其在上下文中遵守用户定义的安全政策（尤其是信息非披露）变得至关重要。

Method: 引入CoPriva数据集，包含明确政策和查询，设计为直接和间接攻击，评估10个LLM的遵守情况。

Result: 许多模型违反政策并泄露敏感信息，尤其在间接攻击下表现更差。模型在生成时难以整合政策约束，但在明确提示下能部分修正输出。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在敏感应用中的安全性存在重大缺陷，亟需更鲁棒的方法确保上下文安全。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
domains such as enterprise and government, ensuring that they adhere to
user-defined security policies within context is critical-especially with
respect to information non-disclosure. While prior LLM studies have focused on
general safety and socially sensitive data, large-scale benchmarks for
contextual security preservation against attacks remain lacking. To address
this, we introduce a novel large-scale benchmark dataset, CoPriva, evaluating
LLM adherence to contextual non-disclosure policies in question answering.
Derived from realistic contexts, our dataset includes explicit policies and
queries designed as direct and challenging indirect attacks seeking prohibited
information. We evaluate 10 LLMs on our benchmark and reveal a significant
vulnerability: many models violate user-defined policies and leak sensitive
information. This failure is particularly severe against indirect attacks,
highlighting a critical gap in current LLM safety alignment for sensitive
applications. Our analysis reveals that while models can often identify the
correct answer to a query, they struggle to incorporate policy constraints
during generation. In contrast, they exhibit a partial ability to revise
outputs when explicitly prompted. Our findings underscore the urgent need for
more robust methods to guarantee contextual security.

Abstract: Large language models are able to exploit in-context learning to access
external knowledge beyond their training data through retrieval-augmentation.
While promising, its inner workings remain unclear. In this work, we shed light
on the mechanism of in-context retrieval augmentation for question answering by
viewing a prompt as a composition of informational components. We propose an
attribution-based method to identify specialized attention heads, revealing
in-context heads that comprehend instructions and retrieve relevant contextual
information, and parametric heads that store entities' relational knowledge. To
better understand their roles, we extract function vectors and modify their
attention weights to show how they can influence the answer generation process.
Finally, we leverage the gained insights to trace the sources of knowledge used
during inference, paving the way towards more safe and transparent language
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文分析了GUI代理训练中的三个关键问题（输入设计、输出评估、策略更新），并提出针对性解决方案，最终在GUI-G1-3B模型上实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理训练方法在输入设计、输出评估和策略更新中存在不足，导致性能受限，需针对性改进。

Method: 提出Fast Thinking Template减少冗余推理，引入框大小约束防止奖励黑客，调整RL目标优化难样本。

Result: GUI-G1-3B在ScreenSpot和ScreenSpot-Pro上分别达到90.3%和37.1%准确率，超越同类模型。

Conclusion: 针对性改进显著提升GUI代理性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents replicate the R1-Zero paradigm,
coupling online Reinforcement Learning (RL) with explicit chain-of-thought
reasoning prior to object grounding and thereby achieving substantial
performance gains. In this paper, we first conduct extensive analysis
experiments of three key components of that training pipeline: input design,
output evaluation, and policy update-each revealing distinct challenges arising
from blindly applying general-purpose RL without adapting to GUI grounding
tasks. Input design: Current templates encourage the model to generate
chain-of-thought reasoning, but longer chains unexpectedly lead to worse
grounding performance. Output evaluation: Reward functions based on hit signals
or box area allow models to exploit box size, leading to reward hacking and
poor localization quality. Policy update: Online RL tends to overfit easy
examples due to biases in length and sample difficulty, leading to
under-optimization on harder cases. To address these issues, we propose three
targeted solutions. First, we adopt a Fast Thinking Template that encourages
direct answer generation, reducing excessive reasoning during training. Second,
we incorporate a box size constraint into the reward function to mitigate
reward hacking. Third, we revise the RL objective by adjusting length
normalization and adding a difficulty-aware scaling factor, enabling better
optimization on hard samples. Our GUI-G1-3B, trained on 17K public samples with
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, achieves 90.3% accuracy on ScreenSpot and 37.1% on
ScreenSpot-Pro. This surpasses all prior models of similar size and even
outperforms the larger UI-TARS-7B, establishing a new state-of-the-art in GUI
agent grounding. The project repository is available at

### [303] [Learning to Reason via Mixture-of-Thought for Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15817)
*Tong Zheng,Lichang Chen,Simeng Han,R. Thomas McCoy,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出Mixture-of-Thought (MoT)框架，通过结合自然语言、代码和符号逻辑（真值表）三种推理模态，显著提升LLM在逻辑推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类使用多种推理模态解决问题，而现有LLM方法通常仅依赖单一模态（如自然语言），限制了模态间的协同作用。

Method: MoT采用两阶段设计：1) 自演化的多模态训练，联合学习过滤后的自生成推理；2) 推理阶段充分利用三种模态的协同作用。

Result: 在FOLIO和ProofWriter等逻辑推理基准测试中，MoT比单模态方法平均提升11.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: MoT框架在训练和推理阶段均有效，尤其在复杂逻辑问题上表现突出，且不同模态具有互补优势。

Abstract: Human beings naturally utilize multiple reasoning modalities to learn and
solve logical problems, i.e., different representational formats such as
natural language, code, and symbolic logic. In contrast, most existing
LLM-based approaches operate with a single reasoning modality during training,
typically natural language. Although some methods explored modality selection
or augmentation at inference time, the training process remains modality-blind,
limiting synergy among modalities. To fill in this gap, we propose
Mixture-of-Thought (MoT), a framework that enables LLMs to reason across three
complementary modalities: natural language, code, and a newly introduced
symbolic modality, truth-table, which systematically enumerates logical cases
and partially mitigates key failure modes in natural language reasoning. MoT
adopts a two-phase design: (1) self-evolving MoT training, which jointly learns
from filtered, self-generated rationales across modalities; and (2) MoT
inference, which fully leverages the synergy of three modalities to produce
better predictions. Experiments on logical reasoning benchmarks including FOLIO
and ProofWriter demonstrate that our MoT framework consistently and
significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines with single-modality
chain-of-thought approaches, achieving up to +11.7pp average accuracy gain.
Further analyses show that our MoT framework benefits both training and
inference stages; that it is particularly effective on harder logical reasoning
problems; and that different modalities contribute complementary strengths,
with truth-table reasoning helping to overcome key bottlenecks in natural
language inference.

*Ashwani Anand,Satya Prakash Nayak,Ritam Raha,Anne-Kathrin Schmuck*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 提出了一种动态后屏蔽框架STARs，用于在预计算概率策略上强制执行ω-正则正确性属性，平衡形式义务与任务行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从传统安全屏蔽（确保不发生坏事）扩展到同时保证活性（确保发生好事），适用于动态环境。

Method: 利用策略模板自适应运行时屏蔽（STARs），动态控制干扰，支持运行时适应变化。

Result: 在移动机器人基准测试中验证了STARs的可控干扰能力。

Conclusion: STARs为网络物理应用提供了一种灵活且适应性强的屏蔽方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dynamic post-shielding framework that enforces
the full class of $\omega$-regular correctness properties over pre-computed
probabilistic policies. This constitutes a paradigm shift from the predominant
setting of safety-shielding -- i.e., ensuring that nothing bad ever happens --
to a shielding process that additionally enforces liveness -- i.e., ensures
that something good eventually happens. At the core, our method uses
Strategy-Template-based Adaptive Runtime Shields (STARs), which leverage
permissive strategy templates to enable post-shielding with minimal
interference. As its main feature, STARs introduce a mechanism to dynamically
control interference, allowing a tunable enforcement parameter to balance
formal obligations and task-specific behavior at runtime. This allows to
trigger more aggressive enforcement when needed, while allowing for optimized
policy choices otherwise. In addition, STARs support runtime adaptation to
changing specifications or actuator failures, making them especially suited for
cyber-physical applications. We evaluate STARs on a mobile robot benchmark to
demonstrate their controllable interference when enforcing (incrementally
updated) $\omega$-regular correctness properties over learned probabilistic
policies.

crowdsourcing platforms alleviate some challenges, high-level data science
tasks remain labor-intensive and iterative. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce R&D-Agent, a dual-agent framework for iterative exploration. The
Researcher agent uses performance feedback to generate ideas, while the
Developer agent refines code based on error feedback. By enabling multiple
parallel exploration traces that merge and enhance one another, R&D-Agent
narrows the gap between automated solutions and expert-level performance.
Evaluated on MLE-Bench, R&D-Agent emerges as the top-performing machine

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在复杂任务中表现出色，但其内部如何执行复杂算法的机制尚不明确，现有研究多局限于小规模或浅层任务。

Method: 构建了一个包含3.5亿token的数据集，包括880万LLM增强的人类标注示例和750万合成示例，后者由自动定理求解器生成并附带元数据。

Result: 数据集为研究LLMs如何学习和泛化符号推理过程提供了可扩展且可解释的工具。

Conclusion: 该数据集为深入理解LLMs的算法能力提供了透明且有针对性的研究基础。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capabilities such as coding and solving mathematical problems to
commonsense inference. While these tasks vary in complexity, they all require
models to integrate and compute over structured information. Despite recent
efforts to reverse-engineer LLM behavior through controlled experiments, our
understanding of how these models internalize and execute complex algorithms
remains limited. Progress has largely been confined to small-scale studies or
shallow tasks such as basic arithmetic and grammatical pattern matching. One
barrier to deeper understanding is the nature of pretraining data -- vast,
heterogeneous, and often poorly annotated, making it difficult to isolate
mechanisms of reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale, fully
open, complexity-annotated dataset of first-order logic reasoning traces,
designed to probe and analyze algorithmic reasoning in LLMs. The dataset
consists of 3.5 billion tokens, including 8.8 million LLM-augmented,
human-annotated examples and 7.5 million synthetically generated examples. Each
synthetic example is verifiably correct, produced by a custom automated theorem
solver, and accompanied by metadata tracing its algorithmic provenance. We aim
to provide a scalable, interpretable artifact for studying how LLMs learn and
generalize symbolic reasoning processes, paving the way for more transparent
and targeted investigations into the algorithmic capabilities of modern models.

Conclusion: 应重新定位现有本体论，并研究向量本体论作为人机互操作框架的潜力。

Abstract: Since Edmund Husserl coined the term "Formal Ontologies" in the early 20th
century, a field that identifies itself with this particular branch of sciences
has gained increasing attention. Many authors, and even Husserl himself have
developed what they claim to be formal ontologies. I argue that under close
inspection, none of these so claimed formal ontologies are truly formal in the
Husserlian sense. More concretely, I demonstrate that they violate the two most
important notions of formal ontology as developed in Husserl's Logical
Investigations, namely a priori validity independent of perception and
formalism as the total absence of content. I hence propose repositioning the
work previously understood as formal ontology as the foundational ontology it
really is. This is to recognize the potential of a truly formal ontology in the
Husserlian sense. Specifically, I argue that formal ontology following his
conditions, allows us to formulate ontological structures, which could capture
what is more objectively without presupposing a particular framework arising
from perception. I further argue that the ability to design the formal
structure deliberately allows us to create highly scalable and interoperable
information artifacts. As concrete evidence, I showcase that a class of formal
ontology, which uses the axioms of vector spaces, is able to express most of
the conceptualizations found in foundational ontologies. Most importantly, I
argue that many information systems, specifically artificial intelligence, are
likely already using some type of vector ontologies to represent reality in
their internal worldviews and elaborate on the evidence that humans do as well.
I hence propose a thorough investigation of the ability of vector ontologies to
act as a human-machine interoperable ontological framework that allows us to
understand highly sophisticated machines and machines to understand us.

TLDR: 论文提出RLUF框架，通过用户反馈直接对齐大语言模型（LLMs），解决了现有方法依赖专家标注的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如RLHF）依赖专家标注，可能无法反映真实用户偏好，因此需要直接利用用户反馈来对齐LLMs。

Method: 提出RLUF框架，训练奖励模型P[Love]预测用户正面反馈（如点赞），并将其与多目标策略优化结合。

Result: 实验显示P[Love]能有效预测用户行为，优化策略使正面反馈率提升28%，但也带来奖励攻击问题。

Conclusion: RLUF通过直接利用用户反馈，为LLMs与真实用户偏好对齐提供了可行路径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse user
facing applications, aligning them with real user preferences becomes
essential. Existing methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) rely on expert annotators trained on manually defined guidelines, whose
judgments may not reflect the priorities of everyday users. We introduce
Reinforcement Learning from User Feedback (RLUF), a framework for aligning LLMs
directly to implicit signals from users in production. RLUF addresses key
challenges of user feedback: user feedback is often binary (e.g., emoji
reactions), sparse, and occasionally adversarial. We train a reward model,
P[Love], to predict the likelihood that an LLM response will receive a Love
Reaction, a lightweight form of positive user feedback, and integrate P[Love]
into a multi-objective policy optimization framework alongside helpfulness and
safety objectives. In large-scale experiments, we show that P[Love] is
predictive of increased positive feedback and serves as a reliable offline
evaluator of future user behavior. Policy optimization using P[Love]
significantly raises observed positive-feedback rates, including a 28% increase
in Love Reactions during live A/B tests. However, optimizing for positive
reactions introduces reward hacking challenges, requiring careful balancing of
objectives. By directly leveraging implicit signals from users, RLUF offers a
path to aligning LLMs with real-world user preferences at scale.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种自动课程学习方法（SEC），通过将课程选择建模为非稳态多臂老虎机问题，显著提升了大型语言模型在多个推理领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL微调中，课程设计依赖随机或启发式方法，效果不佳且计算成本高。

Method: SEC将课程选择视为非稳态多臂老虎机问题，利用策略梯度方法的绝对优势作为即时学习增益的代理指标，并通过TD(0)方法更新课程策略。

Result: 实验表明，SEC在规划、归纳推理和数学等领域显著提升了模型的推理能力，并改善了多领域微调时的技能平衡。

Conclusion: SEC是一种有前景的RL微调策略，适用于提升LLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large
language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in
domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing
RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training
problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they
remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on
heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To
address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an
automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy
concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates
curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating
each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual
arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy
measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum
policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using
the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive
reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly
improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to
harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves
better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning
domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL
fine-tuning of LLMs.

Motivation: 未来的人机交互需要系统能够分析和满足人类需求，因此需要开发能够考虑人类认知状态的模型。

Method: 使用动态贝叶斯网络（DBN）构建模型，推断AV用户和其他道路使用者的认知状态（如幸福感、信任和意图），并通过交互研究数据优化模型参数。

Result: 模型能够准确预测用户状态，并通过因果推理模型（CIM）框架指导AV做出以人为中心的决策。

Conclusion: 该模型有效提升了AV决策的人性化水平，平衡了用户幸福感、信任与AV操作成本之间的关系。

Abstract: For future human-autonomous vehicle (AV) interactions to be effective and
smooth, human-aware systems that analyze and align human needs with automation
decisions are essential. Achieving this requires systems that account for human
cognitive states. We present a novel computational model in the form of a
Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) that infers the cognitive states of both AV
users and other road users, integrating this information into the AV's
decision-making process. Specifically, our model captures the well-being of
both an AV user and an interacting road user as cognitive states alongside
trust. Our DBN models infer beliefs over the AV user's evolving well-being,
trust, and intention states, as well as the possible well-being of other road
users, based on observed interaction experiences. Using data collected from an
interaction study, we refine the model parameters and empirically assess its
performance. Finally, we extend our model into a causal inference model (CIM)
framework for AV decision-making, enabling the AV to enhance user well-being
and trust while balancing these factors with its own operational costs and the
well-being of interacting road users. Our evaluation demonstrates the model's
effectiveness in accurately predicting user's states and guiding informed,
human-centered AV decisions.

Conclusion: 结合显式和隐式规范的方法能更有效地实现智能体的价值对齐，证明了声誉机制的重要性。

Abstract: Our society is governed by a set of norms which together bring about the
values we cherish such as safety, fairness or trustworthiness. The goal of
value-alignment is to create agents that not only do their tasks but through
their behaviours also promote these values. Many of the norms are written as
laws or rules (legal / safety norms) but even more remain unwritten (social
norms). Furthermore, the techniques used to represent these norms also differ.
Safety / legal norms are often represented explicitly, for example, in some
logical language while social norms are typically learned and remain hidden in
the parameter space of a neural network. There is a lack of approaches in the
literature that could combine these various norm representations into a single
algorithm. We propose a novel method that integrates these norms into the
reinforcement learning process. Our method monitors the agent's compliance with
the given norms and summarizes it in a quantity we call the agent's reputation.
This quantity is used to weigh the received rewards to motivate the agent to
become value-aligned. We carry out a series of experiments including a
continuous state space traffic problem to demonstrate the importance of the
written and unwritten norms and show how our method can find the value-aligned
policies. Furthermore, we carry out ablations to demonstrate why it is better
to combine these two groups of norms rather than using either separately.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled substantial
advances in solving mathematical problems. However, existing benchmarks often
fail to reflect the complexity of real-world problems, which demand open-ended,
interdisciplinary reasoning and integration of computational tools. To address
this gap, we introduce ModelingBench, a novel benchmark featuring
real-world-inspired, open-ended problems from math modeling competitions across
diverse domains, ranging from urban traffic optimization to ecosystem resource
planning. These tasks require translating natural language into formal
mathematical formulations, applying appropriate tools, and producing
structured, defensible reports. ModelingBench also supports multiple valid
solutions, capturing the ambiguity and creativity of practical modeling. We
also present ModelingAgent, a multi-agent framework that coordinates tool use,
supports structured workflows, and enables iterative self-refinement to
generate well-grounded, creative solutions. To evaluate outputs, we further
propose ModelingJudge, an expert-in-the-loop system leveraging LLMs as
domain-specialized judges assessing solutions from multiple expert
perspectives. Empirical results show that ModelingAgent substantially
outperforms strong baselines and often produces solutions indistinguishable
from those of human experts. Together, our work provides a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and advancing real-world problem-solving in
open-ended, interdisciplinary modeling challenges.

Conclusion: lmgame-Bench为LLM评估提供了可靠工具，展示了游戏作为评估媒介的潜力，并揭示了能力迁移的可能性。

Abstract: Playing video games requires perception, memory, and planning, exactly the
faculties modern large language model (LLM) agents are expected to master. We
study the major challenges in using popular video games to evaluate modern LLMs
and find that directly dropping LLMs into games cannot make an effective
evaluation, for three reasons -- brittle vision perception, prompt sensitivity,
and potential data contamination. We introduce lmgame-Bench to turn games into
reliable evaluations. lmgame-Bench features a suite of platformer, puzzle, and
narrative games delivered through a unified Gym-style API and paired with
lightweight perception and memory scaffolds, and is designed to stabilize
prompt variance and remove contamination. Across 13 leading models, we show
lmgame-Bench is challenging while still separating models well. Correlation
analysis shows that every game probes a unique blend of capabilities often
tested in isolation elsewhere. More interestingly, performing reinforcement
learning on a single game from lmgame-Bench transfers both to unseen games and
to external planning tasks. Our evaluation code is available at

Abstract: This paper explores generalised probabilistic modelling and uncertainty
estimation in comparative LLM-as-a-judge frameworks. We show that existing
Product-of-Experts methods are specific cases of a broader framework, enabling
diverse modelling options. Furthermore, we propose improved uncertainty
estimates for individual comparisons, enabling more efficient selection and
achieving strong performance with fewer evaluations. We also introduce a method
for estimating overall ranking uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate that
combining absolute and comparative scoring improves performance. Experiments
show that the specific expert model has a limited impact on final rankings but
our proposed uncertainty estimates, especially the probability of reordering,
significantly improve the efficiency of systems reducing the number of needed
comparisons by ~50%. Furthermore, ranking-level uncertainty metrics can be used
to identify low-performing predictions, where the nature of the probabilistic
model has a notable impact on the quality of the overall uncertainty.

Abstract: Probabilities of causation are fundamental to modern decision-making. Pearl
first introduced three binary probabilities of causation, and Tian and Pearl
later derived tight bounds for them using Balke's linear programming. The
theoretical characterization of probabilities of causation with multi-valued
treatments and outcomes has remained unresolved for decades, limiting the scope
of causality-based decision-making. In this paper, we resolve this foundational
gap by proposing a complete set of representative probabilities of causation
and proving that they are sufficient to characterize all possible probabilities
of causation within the framework of Structural Causal Models (SCMs). We then
formally derive tight bounds for these representative quantities using formal
mathematical proofs. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our
results through illustrative toy examples.

Motivation: 探索强化学习训练的大型推理模型（LRMs）在节省思考时的内部机制，以提高其效率和可靠性。

Method: 通过分析思考终止的置信度、从思考到生成的注意力以及输入部分的注意力焦点，研究LRMs的推理行为。

Result: 发现NT模式以准确性为代价缩短输出，ET和IT模式在保持准确性的同时缩短响应长度，揭示了RL优化的LRMs存在基本不一致性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要对RL优化的LRMs进行自适应改进，以实现可靠的效率提升。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly advanced performance on
complex tasks, yet their tendency to overthink introduces inefficiencies. This
study investigates the internal mechanisms of reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained LRMs when prompted to save thinking, revealing three distinct
thinking modes: no thinking (NT), explicit thinking (ET), and implicit thinking
(IT). Through comprehensive analysis of confidence in thinking termination,
attention from thinking to generation, and attentional focus on input sections,
we uncover key factors influencing the reasoning behaviors. We further find
that NT reduces output length at the cost of accuracy, while ET and IT maintain
accuracy with reduced response length. Our findings expose fundamental
inconsistencies in RL-optimized LRMs, necessitating adaptive improvements for
reliable efficiency.

TLDR: ASRR框架通过自适应分配推理努力，显著减少大型推理模型的计算开销，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在简单任务上存在冗余推理问题，导致计算开销过高。

Method: 提出ASRR框架，通过抑制不必要的推理和启用隐式恢复，自适应分配推理努力。

Result: ASRR在多个基准测试中减少推理预算高达32.5%，性能损失极小（1.2% pass@1）。

Conclusion: ASRR为大型推理模型提供了高效、自适应且更安全的推理潜力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance via long
reasoning chains, but often incur excessive computational overhead due to
redundant reasoning, especially on simple tasks. In this work, we
systematically quantify the upper bounds of LRMs under both Long-Thinking and
No-Thinking modes, and uncover the phenomenon of "Internal Self-Recovery
Mechanism" where models implicitly supplement reasoning during answer
generation. Building on this insight, we propose Adaptive Self-Recovery
Reasoning (ASRR), a framework that suppresses unnecessary reasoning and enables
implicit recovery. By introducing accuracy-aware length reward regulation, ASRR
adaptively allocates reasoning effort according to problem difficulty,
achieving high efficiency with negligible performance sacrifice. Experiments
across multiple benchmarks and models show that, compared with GRPO, ASRR
reduces reasoning budget by up to 32.5% (1.5B) and 25.7% (7B) with minimal
accuracy loss (1.2% and 0.6% pass@1), and significantly boosts harmless rates
on safety benchmarks (up to +21.7%). Our results highlight the potential of
ASRR for enabling efficient, adaptive, and safer reasoning in LRMs.

TLDR: ClickSight利用大型语言模型（LLM）从学生点击流数据中解释学习策略，评估了不同提示策略和自我优化的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手工特征或监督模型，缺乏通用性和可扩展性，需要更自动化的解决方案。

Method: 提出ClickSight，基于LLM的管道，输入原始点击流和学习策略列表，生成行为解释。评估了四种提示策略和自我优化的效果。

Result: LLM能合理解释学习策略，但效果因提示策略而异，自我优化改进有限。

Conclusion: ClickSight展示了LLM在教育数据中生成理论驱动洞察的潜力。

Abstract: Clickstream data from digital learning environments offer valuable insights
into students' learning behaviors, but are challenging to interpret due to
their high dimensionality and granularity. Prior approaches have relied mainly
on handcrafted features, expert labeling, clustering, or supervised models,
therefore often lacking generalizability and scalability. In this work, we
introduce ClickSight, an in-context Large Language Model (LLM)-based pipeline
that interprets student clickstreams to reveal their learning strategies.
ClickSight takes raw clickstreams and a list of learning strategies as input
and generates textual interpretations of students' behaviors during
interaction. We evaluate four different prompting strategies and investigate
the impact of self-refinement on interpretation quality. Our evaluation spans
two open-ended learning environments and uses a rubric-based domain-expert
evaluation. Results show that while LLMs can reasonably interpret learning
strategies from clickstreams, interpretation quality varies by prompting
strategy, and self-refinement offers limited improvement. ClickSight
demonstrates the potential of LLMs to generate theory-driven insights from
educational interaction data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计奖励函数繁琐且易错，而现有基于omega-regular规范的方法通常依赖折扣奖励和周期性重置，与无限行为轨迹的语义不匹配。

Method: 提出模型无关的强化学习框架，将绝对活跃性规范转化为平均奖励目标，支持无重置的连续任务，并引入多目标优化的奖励结构。

Result: 在未知通信MDP中保证收敛，实验显示平均奖励方法在连续任务中优于传统折扣方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为无限时间任务提供了一种更符合语义的解决方案，支持模型无关学习。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have renewed focus on the
design of reward functions that shape agent behavior. Manually designing reward
functions is tedious and error-prone. A principled alternative is to specify
behaviors in a formal language that can be automatically translated into
rewards. Omega-regular languages are a natural choice for this purpose, given
their established role in formal verification and synthesis. However, existing
methods using omega-regular specifications typically rely on discounted reward
RL in episodic settings, with periodic resets. This setup misaligns with the
semantics of omega-regular specifications, which describe properties over
infinite behavior traces. In such cases, the average reward criterion and the
continuing setting -- where the agent interacts with the environment over a
single, uninterrupted lifetime -- are more appropriate.
  To address the challenges of infinite-horizon, continuing tasks, we focus on
absolute liveness specifications -- a subclass of omega-regular languages that
cannot be violated by any finite behavior prefix, making them well-suited to
the continuing setting. We present the first model-free RL framework that
translates absolute liveness specifications to average-reward objectives. Our
approach enables learning in communicating MDPs without episodic resetting. We
also introduce a reward structure for lexicographic multi-objective
optimization, aiming to maximize an external average-reward objective among the
policies that also maximize the satisfaction probability of a given
omega-regular specification. Our method guarantees convergence in unknown
communicating MDPs and supports on-the-fly reductions that do not require full
knowledge of the environment, thus enabling model-free RL. Empirical results
show our average-reward approach in continuing setting outperforms
discount-based methods across benchmarks.

Motivation: 提升神经网络的解释性，同时支持多分类和自动学习特征重要性。

Result: 性能与神经网络相当，显著优于纯符号的AA-CBR。

Conclusion: Gradual AA-CBR在保持性能的同时，提供了更好的解释性和功能扩展。

Abstract: We introduce Gradual Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (Gradual
AA-CBR), a data-driven, neurosymbolic classification model in which the outcome
is determined by an argumentation debate structure that is learned
simultaneously with neural-based feature extractors. Each argument in the
debate is an observed case from the training data, favouring their labelling.
Cases attack or support those with opposing or agreeing labellings, with the
strength of each argument and relationship learned through gradient-based
methods. This argumentation debate structure provides human-aligned reasoning,
improving model interpretability compared to traditional neural networks (NNs).
Unlike the existing purely symbolic variant, Abstract Argumentation for
Case-Based Reasoning (AA-CBR), Gradual AA-CBR is capable of multi-class
classification, automatic learning of feature and data point importance,
assigning uncertainty values to outcomes, using all available data points, and
does not require binary features. We show that Gradual AA-CBR performs
comparably to NNs whilst significantly outperforming existing AA-CBR
formulations.

Motivation: 数字原生PDF文档的布局分析因文本和非文本元素的异构排列及PDF元数据的不精确性而具有挑战性。

Method: 采用两种图结构（k近邻图和全连接图），结合预训练的文本和视觉模型生成节点特征，避免手工特征工程，并评估了三种实验框架（单模态、多模态拼接和双分支多模态）。

Conclusion: GNN结合多模态特征能有效分析数字原生文档布局，局部关系和特征融合是关键。

Abstract: The automatic analysis of document layouts in digital-born PDF documents
remains a challenging problem due to the heterogeneous arrangement of textual
and nontextual elements and the imprecision of the textual metadata in the
Portable Document Format. In this work, we benchmark Graph Neural Network (GNN)
architectures for the task of fine-grained layout classification of text blocks
from digital native documents. We introduce two graph construction structures:
a k-closest-neighbor graph and a fully connected graph, and generate node
features via pre-trained text and vision models, thus avoiding manual feature
engineering. Three experimental frameworks are evaluated: single-modality (text
or visual), concatenated multimodal, and dual-branch multimodal. We evaluated
four foundational GNN models and compared them with the baseline. Our
experiments are specifically conducted on a rich dataset of public affairs
documents that includes more than 20 sources (e.g., regional and national-level
official gazettes), 37K PDF documents, with 441K pages in total. Our results
demonstrate that GraphSAGE operating on the k-closest-neighbor graph in a
dual-branch configuration achieves the highest per-class and overall accuracy,
outperforming the baseline in some sources. These findings confirm the
importance of local layout relationships and multimodal fusion exploited
through GNNs for the analysis of native digital document layouts.

Conclusion: RepBlend有效缓解模态崩溃问题，提升多模态数据集蒸馏的性能和效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Dataset Distillation (MDD) seeks to condense large-scale
image-text datasets into compact surrogates while retaining their effectiveness
for cross-modal learning. Despite recent progress, existing MDD approaches
often suffer from \textit{\textbf{Modality Collapse}}, characterized by
over-concentrated intra-modal representations and enlarged distributional gap
across modalities. In this paper, at the first time, we identify this issue as
stemming from a fundamental conflict between the over-compression behavior
inherent in dataset distillation and the cross-modal supervision imposed by
contrastive objectives. To alleviate modality collapse, we introduce
\textbf{RepBlend}, a novel MDD framework that weakens overdominant cross-modal
supervision via representation blending, thereby significantly enhancing
intra-modal diversity. Additionally, we observe that current MDD methods impose
asymmetric supervision across modalities, resulting in biased optimization. To
address this, we propose symmetric projection trajectory matching, which
synchronizes the optimization dynamics using modality-specific projection
heads, thereby promoting balanced supervision and enhancing cross-modal
alignment. Experiments on Flickr-30K and MS-COCO show that RepBlend
consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art MDD methods, achieving
significant gains in retrieval performance (e.g., +9.4 IR@10, +6.3 TR@10 under
the 100-pair setting) and offering up to 6.7$\times$ distillation speedup.

Motivation: 现有数据集对视觉上难以区分的物种（隐秘物种）覆盖不足，且多为单分类群的小规模人工标注。CrypticBio填补了这一空白，提供大规模、多模态的数据支持。

Method: 数据集基于iNaturalist社区标注的真实物种误识别趋势构建，包含52K隐秘组、67K物种和1.66亿张图像，并整合了地理和时间数据。开源工具CrypticBio-Curate支持数据集管理。

Result: 基准测试显示，地理上下文对视觉-语言零样本学习在隐秘物种识别中有显著影响。

Conclusion: CrypticBio旨在推动生物多样性AI模型的发展，应对物种模糊性的挑战。

Abstract: We present CrypticBio, the largest publicly available multimodal dataset of
visually confusing species, specifically curated to support the development of
AI models in the context of biodiversity applications. Visually confusing or
cryptic species are groups of two or more taxa that are nearly
indistinguishable based on visual characteristics alone. While much existing
work addresses taxonomic identification in a broad sense, datasets that
directly address the morphological confusion of cryptic species are small,
manually curated, and target only a single taxon. Thus, the challenge of
identifying such subtle differences in a wide range of taxa remains
unaddressed. Curated from real-world trends in species misidentification among
community annotators of iNaturalist, CrypticBio contains 52K unique cryptic
groups spanning 67K species, represented in 166 million images. Rich
research-grade image annotations--including scientific, multicultural, and
multilingual species terminology, hierarchical taxonomy, spatiotemporal
context, and associated cryptic groups--address multimodal AI in biodiversity
research. For easy dataset curation, we provide an open-source pipeline
CrypticBio-Curate. The multimodal nature of the dataset beyond vision-language
arises from the integration of geographical and temporal data as complementary
cues to identifying cryptic species. To highlight the importance of the
dataset, we benchmark a suite of state-of-the-art foundation models across
CrypticBio subsets of common, unseen, endangered, and invasive species, and
demonstrate the substantial impact of geographical context on vision-language
zero-shot learning for cryptic species. By introducing CrypticBio, we aim to
catalyze progress toward real-world-ready biodiversity AI models capable of
handling the nuanced challenges of species ambiguity.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为DraftAttention的无训练框架，通过动态稀疏注意力加速视频扩散变换器，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散变换器的视频生成模型（DiTs）计算成本高，尤其是注意力机制占用了80%以上的延迟，限制了实际应用和扩展性。

Method: 采用下采样技术对压缩潜在空间中的特征图进行处理，生成低分辨率草稿注意力图，揭示空间和时间冗余，并通过重排序实现结构化稀疏注意力计算。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频生成质量上优于现有稀疏注意力方法，并在GPU上实现了最高1.75倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: DraftAttention通过动态稀疏注意力有效降低了计算成本，同时保持了生成质量，为视频扩散变换器的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformer-based video generation models (DiTs) have recently
attracted widespread attention for their excellent generation quality. However,
their computational cost remains a major bottleneck-attention alone accounts
for over 80% of total latency, and generating just 8 seconds of 720p video
takes tens of minutes-posing serious challenges to practical application and
scalability. To address this, we propose the DraftAttention, a training-free
framework for the acceleration of video diffusion transformers with dynamic
sparse attention on GPUs. We apply down-sampling to each feature map across
frames in the compressed latent space, enabling a higher-level receptive field
over the latent composed of hundreds of thousands of tokens. The low-resolution
draft attention map, derived from draft query and key, exposes redundancy both
spatially within each feature map and temporally across frames. We reorder the
query, key, and value based on the draft attention map to guide the sparse
attention computation in full resolution, and subsequently restore their
original order after the attention computation. This reordering enables
structured sparsity that aligns with hardware-optimized execution. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the low-resolution draft attention
closely approximates the full attention, providing reliable guidance for
constructing accurate sparse attention. Experimental results show that our
method outperforms existing sparse attention approaches in video generation
quality and achieves up to 1.75x end-to-end speedup on GPUs. Code:

Motivation: 视频生成需要大量令牌，解码阶段MLP模块延迟高且相邻帧存在时间冗余，需优化。

Method: 提出FastCar框架，利用TAS判断是否重用缓存MLP输出，并开发FPGA硬件加速器。

Result: FastCar实现2.1倍解码加速，能效更高，结合稀疏注意力可提升高分辨率长视频生成性能。

Conclusion: FastCar通过时间冗余优化和硬件加速，显著提升视频生成效率，适用于边缘设备。

Abstract: Auto-regressive (AR) models, initially successful in language generation,
have recently shown promise in visual generation tasks due to their superior
sampling efficiency. Unlike image generation, video generation requires a
substantially larger number of tokens to produce coherent temporal frames,
resulting in significant overhead during the decoding phase. Our key
observations are: (i) MLP modules in the decode phase dominate the inference
latency, and (ii) there exists high temporal redundancy in MLP outputs of
adjacent frames. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{FastCar} framework to
accelerate the decode phase for the AR video generation by exploring the
temporal redundancy. The Temporal Attention Score (TAS) is proposed to
determine whether to apply the replay strategy (\textit{i.e.}, reusing cached
MLP outputs from the previous frame to reduce redundant computations) with
detailed theoretical analysis and justification. Also, we develop a hardware
accelerator on FPGA with Dynamic Resource Scheduling (DRS) based on TAS to
enable better resource utilization and faster inference. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms traditional
sparse attention approaches with more than 2.1x decoding speedup and higher
energy efficiency on the edge. Furthermore, by combining FastCar and sparse
attention, FastCar can boost the performance of sparse attention with
alleviated drifting, demonstrating our unique advantages for high-resolution
and long-duration video generation. Code:

Conclusion: 提出知识驱动的多模态推理新范式，将假新闻检测从特征融合转向语义验证，代码已开源。

Abstract: Fake news detection remains a challenging problem due to the complex
interplay between textual misinformation, manipulated images, and external
knowledge reasoning. While existing approaches have achieved notable results in
verifying veracity and cross-modal consistency, two key challenges persist: (1)
Existing methods often consider only the global image context while neglecting
local object-level details, and (2) they fail to incorporate external knowledge
and entity relationships for deeper semantic understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal fake news detection framework that
integrates visual, textual, and knowledge-based representations. Our approach
leverages bottom-up attention to capture fine-grained object details, CLIP for
global image semantics, and RoBERTa for context-aware text encoding. We further
enhance knowledge utilization by retrieving and adaptively selecting relevant
entities from a knowledge graph. The fused multi-modal features are processed
through a Transformer-based classifier to predict news veracity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model outperforms recent approaches, showcasing
the effectiveness of neighbor selection mechanism and multi-modal fusion for
fake news detection. Our proposal introduces a new paradigm: knowledge-grounded
multimodal reasoning. By integrating explicit entity-level selection and
NLI-guided filtering, we shift fake news detection from feature fusion to
semantically grounded verification. For reproducibility and further research,

Result: 在数据集上取得最佳分割精度和竞争性速度，CMSE表现显著优于现有实时分割网络，降低超过50%。

Conclusion: SPENet在工业图像检测中表现出色，解决了分割一致性和计算效率问题。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation stands as a pivotal research focus in computer vision.
In the context of industrial image inspection, conventional semantic
segmentation models fail to maintain the segmentation consistency of fixed
components across varying contextual environments due to a lack of perception
of object contours. Given the real-time constraints and limited computing
capability of industrial image detection machines, it is also necessary to
create efficient models to reduce computational complexity. In this work, a
Shape-Aware Efficient Network (SPENet) is proposed, which focuses on the shapes
of objects to achieve excellent segmentation consistency by separately
supervising the extraction of boundary and body information from images. In
SPENet, a novel method is introduced for describing fuzzy boundaries to better
adapt to real-world scenarios named Variable Boundary Domain (VBD).
Additionally, a new metric, Consistency Mean Square Error(CMSE), is proposed to
measure segmentation consistency for fixed components. Our approach attains the
best segmentation accuracy and competitive speed on our dataset, showcasing
significant advantages in CMSE among numerous state-of-the-art real-time
segmentation networks, achieving a reduction of over 50% compared to the
previously top-performing models.

Abstract: The combination of Spiking Neural Networks(SNNs) with Vision Transformer
architectures has attracted significant attention due to the great potential
for energy-efficient and high-performance computing paradigms. However, a
substantial performance gap still exists between SNN-based and ANN-based

self-attention mechanisms that are successfully combined with SNNs, the overall
architectures proposed by these methods suffer from a bottleneck in effectively
extracting features from different image scales. In this paper, we address this
issue and propose MSVIT, a novel spike-driven Transformer architecture, which
firstly uses multi-scale spiking attention (MSSA) to enrich the capability of
spiking attention blocks. We validate our approach across various main data

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在道德敏感领域的应用日益广泛，但其输出需符合人类道德价值观。现有研究多局限于文本或AI生成图像，存在偏差和真实性不足的问题。

Method: 提出基于Turiel领域理论的13个道德主题分类，手动标注2,481对高质量图像-文本数据，并设计道德判断和道德规范归因两项评估任务。

Result: 实验表明，MORALISE对19种主流VLMs构成显著挑战，揭示了当前模型的道德局限性。

Conclusion: MORALISE为评估和改进VLMs的道德对齐提供了重要工具，未来需进一步优化模型以符合道德标准。

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images. Reader
discretion is advised. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated
increasing influence in morally sensitive domains such as autonomous driving
and medical analysis, owing to their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. As these models are deployed in high-stakes real-world
applications, it is of paramount importance to ensure that their outputs align
with human moral values and remain within moral boundaries. However, existing
work on moral alignment either focuses solely on textual modalities or relies
heavily on AI-generated images, leading to distributional biases and reduced
realism. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MORALISE, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the moral alignment of vision-language models (VLMs)
using diverse, expert-verified real-world data. We begin by proposing a
comprehensive taxonomy of 13 moral topics grounded in Turiel's Domain Theory,
spanning the personal, interpersonal, and societal moral domains encountered in
everyday life. Built on this framework, we manually curate 2,481 high-quality
image-text pairs, each annotated with two fine-grained labels: (1) topic
annotation, identifying the violated moral topic(s), and (2) modality
annotation, indicating whether the violation arises from the image or the text.
For evaluation, we encompass two tasks, \textit{moral judgment} and
\textit{moral norm attribution}, to assess models' awareness of moral
violations and their reasoning ability on morally salient content. Extensive
experiments on 19 popular open- and closed-source VLMs show that MORALISE poses
a significant challenge, revealing persistent moral limitations in current
state-of-the-art models. The full benchmark is publicly available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ze1025/MORALISE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLMs在多任务中表现优异，但其潜在的文化偏见问题尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用Country211数据集，通过开放式问题、多选题及多语言和对抗性设置等策略评估VLMs。

Result: 发现VLMs性能在不同国家间差异显著，表明其继承了预训练数据的偏见。

Conclusion: VLMs虽具备视觉理解能力，但其泛化能力受训练数据分布和评估方法影响，存在文化偏见。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks, yet concerns about their potential biases exist. This
work investigates the extent to which prominent VLMs exhibit cultural biases by
evaluating their performance on an image-based country identification task at a
country level. Utilizing the geographically diverse Country211 dataset, we
probe several large vision language models (VLMs) under various prompting
strategies: open-ended questions, multiple-choice questions (MCQs) including
challenging setups like multilingual and adversarial settings. Our analysis
aims to uncover disparities in model accuracy across different countries and
question formats, providing insights into how training data distribution and
evaluation methodologies might influence cultural biases in VLMs. The findings
highlight significant variations in performance, suggesting that while VLMs
possess considerable visual understanding, they inherit biases from their
pre-training data and scale that impact their ability to generalize uniformly
across diverse global contexts.

Abstract: This paper attempts to explore human identity by utilizing neural networks in
an indirect manner. For this exploration, we adopt diffusion models,
state-of-the-art AI generative models trained to create human face images. By
relating the generated human face to human identity, we establish a
correspondence between the face image generation process of the diffusion model
and the process of human identity formation. Through experiments with the
diffusion model, we observe that changes in its external input result in
significant changes in the generated face image. Based on the correspondence,
we indirectly confirm the dependence of human identity on external factors in
the process of human identity formation. Furthermore, we introduce
\textit{Fluidity of Human Identity}, a video artwork that expresses the fluid
nature of human identity affected by varying external factors. The video is

Abstract: Many practical medical imaging scenarios include categories that are
under-represented but still crucial. The relevance of image recognition models
to real-world applications lies in their ability to generalize to these rare
classes as well as unseen classes. Real-world generalization requires taking
into account the various complexities that can be encountered in the
real-world. First, training data is highly imbalanced, which may lead to model
exhibiting bias toward the more frequently represented classes. Moreover,
real-world data may contain unseen classes that need to be identified, and
model performance is affected by the data scarcity. While medical image
recognition has been extensively addressed in the literature, current methods
do not take into account all the intricacies in the real-world scenarios. To
this end, we propose an open-set learning method for highly imbalanced medical
datasets using a semi-supervised approach. Understanding the adverse impact of
long-tail distribution at the inherent model characteristics, we implement a
regularization strategy at the feature level complemented by a classifier
normalization technique. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly
available datasets, ISIC2018, ISIC2019, and TissueMNIST with various numbers of
labelled samples. Our analysis shows that addressing the impact of long-tail
data in classification significantly improves the overall performance of the
network in terms of closed-set and open-set accuracies on all datasets. Our
code and trained models will be made publicly available at

Result: 系统在Delta E-HSV方法下达到80%的分类准确率，且在多种光照和图像条件下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了AI在颜色分析和特征提取中的潜力，为相关应用提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: This study presents a robust framework that leverages advanced imaging
techniques and machine learning for feature extraction and classification of
key human attributes-namely skin tone, hair color, iris color, and vein-based
undertones. The system employs a multi-stage pipeline involving face detection,
region segmentation, and dominant color extraction to isolate and analyze these
features. Techniques such as X-means clustering, alongside perceptually uniform
distance metrics like Delta E (CIEDE2000), are applied within both LAB and HSV
color spaces to enhance the accuracy of color differentiation. For
classification, the dominant tones of the skin, hair, and iris are extracted
and matched to a custom tone scale, while vein analysis from wrist images
enables undertone classification into "Warm" or "Cool" based on LAB
differences. Each module uses targeted segmentation and color space
transformations to ensure perceptual precision. The system achieves up to 80%
accuracy in tone classification using the Delta E-HSV method with Gaussian
blur, demonstrating reliable performance across varied lighting and image
conditions. This work highlights the potential of AI-powered color analysis and
feature extraction for delivering inclusive, precise, and nuanced
classification, supporting applications in beauty technology, digital
personalization, and visual analytics.

Abstract: The task of estimating the world model describing the dynamics of a real
world process assumes immense importance for anticipating and preparing for
future outcomes. For applications such as video surveillance, robotics
applications, autonomous driving, etc. this objective entails synthesizing
plausible visual futures, given a few frames of a video to set the visual
context. Towards this end, we propose ProgGen, which undertakes the task of
video frame prediction by representing the dynamics of the video using a set of
neuro-symbolic, human-interpretable set of states (one per frame) by leveraging
the inductive biases of Large (Vision) Language Models (LLM/VLM). In
particular, ProgGen utilizes LLM/VLM to synthesize programs: (i) to estimate
the states of the video, given the visual context (i.e. the frames); (ii) to
predict the states corresponding to future time steps by estimating the
transition dynamics; (iii) to render the predicted states as visual RGB-frames.
Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed method outperforms competing
techniques at the task of video frame prediction in two challenging
environments: (i) PhyWorld (ii) Cart Pole. Additionally, ProgGen permits
counter-factual reasoning and interpretable video generation attesting to its
effectiveness and generalizability for video generation tasks.

Conclusion: MultiMAE策略显著提升了迁移学习能力，适用于多样化的地球观测数据任务。

Abstract: Multi-modal data in Earth Observation (EO) presents a huge opportunity for
improving transfer learning capabilities when pre-training deep learning
models. Unlike prior work that often overlooks multi-modal EO data, recent
methods have started to include it, resulting in more effective pre-training
strategies. However, existing approaches commonly face challenges in
effectively transferring learning to downstream tasks where the structure of
available data differs from that used during pre-training. This paper addresses
this limitation by exploring a more flexible multi-modal, multi-task
pre-training strategy for EO data. Specifically, we adopt a Multi-modal
Multi-task Masked Autoencoder (MultiMAE) that we pre-train by reconstructing
diverse input modalities, including spectral, elevation, and segmentation data.
The pre-trained model demonstrates robust transfer learning capabilities,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods on various EO datasets for
classification and segmentation tasks. Our approach exhibits significant
flexibility, handling diverse input configurations without requiring
modality-specific pre-trained models. Code will be available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市森林对环境和生物多样性至关重要，但树木检测因图像分辨率和复杂景观而困难，且传统深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据。

Method: 整合域适应与GAN和扩散模型（如pix2pix、Real-ESRGAN、Latent Diffusion、Stable Diffusion），生成高质量合成图像以扩展训练数据。

Result: 实验显示，低分辨率图像的IoU提升超过50%，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为遥感场景提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，尤其在标注资源稀缺时表现优异。

Abstract: Urban forests play a key role in enhancing environmental quality and
supporting biodiversity in cities. Mapping and monitoring these green spaces
are crucial for urban planning and conservation, yet accurately detecting trees
is challenging due to complex landscapes and the variability in image
resolution caused by different satellite sensors or UAV flight altitudes. While
deep learning architectures have shown promise in addressing these challenges,
their effectiveness remains strongly dependent on the availability of large and
manually labeled datasets, which are often expensive and difficult to obtain in
sufficient quantity. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates
domain adaptation with GANs and Diffusion models to enhance the quality of
low-resolution aerial images. Our proposed pipeline enhances low-resolution
imagery while preserving semantic content, enabling effective tree segmentation
without requiring large volumes of manually annotated data. Leveraging models
such as pix2pix, Real-ESRGAN, Latent Diffusion, and Stable Diffusion, we
generate realistic and structurally consistent synthetic samples that expand
the training dataset and unify scale across domains. This approach not only
improves the robustness of segmentation models across different acquisition
conditions but also provides a scalable and replicable solution for remote
sensing scenarios with scarce annotation resources. Experimental results
demonstrated an improvement of over 50% in IoU for low-resolution images,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method compared to traditional pipelines.

Motivation: 传统端到端方法基于密集鸟瞰图特征生成计划，效率低且规划感知有限，iPad旨在解决这些问题。

Method: iPad框架以候选计划为核心，通过ProFormer迭代优化特征，并引入轻量级辅助任务（地图和预测）提升规划。

Result: 在NAVSIM和CARLA Bench2Drive基准测试中，iPad表现最优且效率显著高于现有方法。

Conclusion: iPad通过迭代优化和轻量级辅助任务，显著提升了端到端自动驾驶系统的性能和效率。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving systems offer a promising alternative to
traditional modular pipelines by reducing information loss and error
accumulation, with significant potential to enhance both mobility and safety.
However, most existing E2E approaches directly generate plans based on dense
bird's-eye view (BEV) grid features, leading to inefficiency and limited
planning awareness. To address these limitations, we propose iterative
Proposal-centric autonomous driving (iPad), a novel framework that places
proposals - a set of candidate future plans - at the center of feature
extraction and auxiliary tasks. Central to iPad is ProFormer, a BEV encoder
that iteratively refines proposals and their associated features through
proposal-anchored attention, effectively fusing multi-view image data.
Additionally, we introduce two lightweight, proposal-centric auxiliary tasks -
mapping and prediction - that improve planning quality with minimal
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and CARLA
Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that iPad achieves state-of-the-art
performance while being significantly more efficient than prior leading
methods.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Disease-Aware Prompting (DAP)的方法，通过增强疾病相关区域并抑制背景干扰，显著提升了医学图像中视觉定位的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在医学图像中难以将文本描述与疾病区域关联，主要由于注意力机制效率低和缺乏细粒度标记表示。

Method: 引入DAP方法，利用视觉语言模型的可解释性图识别适当的图像特征，无需额外像素级标注。

Result: DAP在三个主要胸部X光数据集上比现有方法提高了20.74%的视觉定位准确率。

Conclusion: DAP是一种简单有效的策略，显著提升了医学图像中视觉定位的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) is the capability to identify the specific regions in
an image associated with a particular text description. In medical imaging, VG
enhances interpretability by highlighting relevant pathological features
corresponding to textual descriptions, improving model transparency and
trustworthiness for wider adoption of deep learning models in clinical
practice. Current models struggle to associate textual descriptions with
disease regions due to inefficient attention mechanisms and a lack of
fine-grained token representations. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate
two key observations. First, current VLMs assign high norms to background
tokens, diverting the model's attention from regions of disease. Second, the
global tokens used for cross-modal learning are not representative of local
disease tokens. This hampers identifying correlations between the text and
disease tokens. To address this, we introduce simple, yet effective
Disease-Aware Prompting (DAP) process, which uses the explainability map of a
VLM to identify the appropriate image features. This simple strategy amplifies
disease-relevant regions while suppressing background interference. Without any
additional pixel-level annotations, DAP improves visual grounding accuracy by
20.74% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three major chest X-ray
datasets.

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet和MS-COCO上的实验验证了DeepKD的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepKD通过双级解耦和自适应去噪显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation have emphasized the importance of
decoupling different knowledge components. While existing methods utilize
momentum mechanisms to separate task-oriented and distillation gradients, they
overlook the inherent conflict between target-class and non-target-class
knowledge flows. Furthermore, low-confidence dark knowledge in non-target
classes introduces noisy signals that hinder effective knowledge transfer. To
address these limitations, we propose DeepKD, a novel training framework that
integrates dual-level decoupling with adaptive denoising. First, through
theoretical analysis of gradient signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR) characteristics
in task-oriented and non-task-oriented knowledge distillation, we design
independent momentum updaters for each component to prevent mutual
interference. We observe that the optimal momentum coefficients for
task-oriented gradient (TOG), target-class gradient (TCG), and non-target-class
gradient (NCG) should be positively related to their GSNR. Second, we introduce
a dynamic top-k mask (DTM) mechanism that gradually increases K from a small
initial value to incorporate more non-target classes as training progresses,
following curriculum learning principles. The DTM jointly filters
low-confidence logits from both teacher and student models, effectively
purifying dark knowledge during early training. Extensive experiments on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO demonstrate DeepKD's effectiveness. Our code
is available at https://github.com/haiduo/DeepKD.

Conclusion: 结论表明该方法能有效识别LVLM的敏感语义，为模型改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks aim to generate malicious inputs that mislead deep
models, but beyond causing model failure, they cannot provide certain
interpretable information such as ``\textit{What content in inputs make models
more likely to fail?}'' However, this information is crucial for researchers to
specifically improve model robustness. Recent research suggests that models may
be particularly sensitive to certain semantics in visual inputs (such as
``wet,'' ``foggy''), making them prone to errors. Inspired by this, in this
paper we conducted the first exploration on large vision-language models
(LVLMs) and found that LVLMs indeed are susceptible to hallucinations and
various errors when facing specific semantic concepts in images. To efficiently
search for these sensitive concepts, we integrated large language models (LLMs)
and text-to-image (T2I) models to propose a novel semantic evolution framework.
Randomly initialized semantic concepts undergo LLM-based crossover and mutation
operations to form image descriptions, which are then converted by T2I models
into visual inputs for LVLMs. The task-specific performance of LVLMs on each
input is quantified as fitness scores for the involved semantics and serves as
reward signals to further guide LLMs in exploring concepts that induce LVLMs.
Extensive experiments on seven mainstream LVLMs and two multimodal tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we provide
interesting findings about the sensitive semantics of LVLMs, aiming to inspire
further in-depth research.

Abstract: Multispectral object detection aims to leverage complementary information

under diverse environmental conditions. In this letter, we propose IC-Fusion, a
multispectral object detector that effectively fuses visible and infrared
features through a lightweight and modalityaware design. Motivated by wavelet
analysis and empirical observations, we find that IR images contain
structurally rich high-frequency information critical for object localization,
while RGB images provide complementary semantic context. To exploit this, we
adopt a compact RGB backbone and design a novel fusion module comprising a
Multi-Scale Feature Distillation (MSFD) block to enhance RGB features and a
three-stage fusion block with Cross-Modal Channel Shuffle Gate (CCSG) and
Cross-Modal Large Kernel Gate (CLKG) to facilitate effective cross-modal
interaction. Experiments on the FLIR and LLVIP benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our IR-centric fusion strategy. Our code is

Abstract: Gaining insights into the structural and functional mechanisms of the brain
has been a longstanding focus in neuroscience research, particularly in the
context of understanding and treating neuropsychiatric disorders such as
Schizophrenia (SZ). Nevertheless, most of the traditional multimodal deep
learning approaches fail to fully leverage the complementary characteristics of
structural and functional connectomics data to enhance diagnostic performance.
To address this issue, we proposed ConneX, a multimodal fusion method that
integrates cross-attention mechanism and multilayer perceptron (MLP)-Mixer for
refined feature fusion. Modality-specific backbone graph neural networks (GNNs)
were firstly employed to obtain feature representation for each modality. A
unified cross-modal attention network was then introduced to fuse these
embeddings by capturing intra- and inter-modal interactions, while MLP-Mixer
layers refined global and local features, leveraging higher-order dependencies
for end-to-end classification with a multi-head joint loss. Extensive
evaluations demonstrated improved performance on two distinct clinical
datasets, highlighting the robustness of our proposed framework.

Method: 提出基于阈值Paillier加密系统的非交互式架构，设计安全计算协议并引入并行计算机制。

Result: Pura在保护隐私的同时，识别速度比现有技术快16倍。

Conclusion: Pura是一种高效且隐私保护充分的人脸识别解决方案。

Abstract: Face recognition is an effective technology for identifying a target person
by facial images. However, sensitive facial images raises privacy concerns.
Although privacy-preserving face recognition is one of potential solutions,
this solution neither fully addresses the privacy concerns nor is efficient
enough. To this end, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving solution for
face recognition, named Pura, which sufficiently protects facial privacy and
supports face recognition over encrypted data efficiently. Specifically, we
propose a privacy-preserving and non-interactive architecture for face
recognition through the threshold Paillier cryptosystem. Additionally, we
carefully design a suite of underlying secure computing protocols to enable
efficient operations of face recognition over encrypted data directly.
Furthermore, we introduce a parallel computing mechanism to enhance the
performance of the proposed secure computing protocols. Privacy analysis
demonstrates that Pura fully safeguards personal facial privacy. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that Pura achieves recognition speeds up to 16 times
faster than the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Cinematography is a cornerstone of film production and appreciation, shaping
mood, emotion, and narrative through visual elements such as camera movement,
shot composition, and lighting. Despite recent progress in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) and video generation models, the capacity of current
models to grasp and reproduce cinematographic techniques remains largely
uncharted, hindered by the scarcity of expert-annotated data. To bridge this
gap, we present CineTechBench, a pioneering benchmark founded on precise,
manual annotation by seasoned cinematography experts across key cinematography
dimensions. Our benchmark covers seven essential aspects-shot scale, shot
angle, composition, camera movement, lighting, color, and focal length-and
includes over 600 annotated movie images and 120 movie clips with clear
cinematographic techniques. For the understanding task, we design question
answer pairs and annotated descriptions to assess MLLMs' ability to interpret
and explain cinematographic techniques. For the generation task, we assess
advanced video generation models on their capacity to reconstruct
cinema-quality camera movements given conditions such as textual prompts or
keyframes. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 15+ MLLMs and 5+ video
generation models. Our results offer insights into the limitations of current
models and future directions for cinematography understanding and generation in
automatically film production and appreciation. The code and benchmark can be

Abstract: Fine-grained edited image detection of localized edits in images is crucial
for assessing content authenticity, especially given that modern diffusion
models and image editing methods can produce highly realistic manipulations.
However, this domain faces three challenges: (1) Binary classifiers yield only
a global real-or-fake label without providing localization; (2) Traditional
computer vision methods often rely on costly pixel-level annotations; and (3)
No large-scale, high-quality dataset exists for modern image-editing detection
techniques. To address these gaps, we develop an automated data-generation
pipeline to create FragFake, the first dedicated benchmark dataset for edited
image detection, which includes high-quality images from diverse editing models
and a wide variety of edited objects. Based on FragFake, we utilize Vision
Language Models (VLMs) for the first time in the task of edited image
classification and edited region localization. Experimental results show that
fine-tuned VLMs achieve higher average Object Precision across all datasets,
significantly outperforming pretrained models. We further conduct ablation and
transferability analyses to evaluate the detectors across various
configurations and editing scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work
is the first to reformulate localized image edit detection as a vision-language
understanding task, establishing a new paradigm for the field. We anticipate
that this work will establish a solid foundation to facilitate and inspire
subsequent research endeavors in the domain of multimodal content authenticity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像（RSIs）是环境监测、城市规划和资源管理的重要数据，但传统方法难以应对其多样性和规模，深度学习（DL）为RSISS提供了自动化特征提取和更高精度的解决方案。

Method: 论文将DL-based RSISS方法分为四个阶段（像素级、块级、瓦片级和基于基础模型的图像级），并从特征提取和学习策略的角度分析其发展。

Result: 通过统一数据集对近40种先进技术进行定量评估，揭示了其性能和适用性。

Conclusion: 论文全面总结了DL-based RSISS的关键进展、比较见解和开放挑战，为未来研究提供了指导。

Abstract: Remote sensing images (RSIs) capture both natural and human-induced changes
on the Earth's surface, serving as essential data for environmental monitoring,
urban planning, and resource management. Semantic segmentation (SS) of RSIs
enables the fine-grained interpretation of surface features, making it a
critical task in remote sensing analysis. With the increasing diversity and
volume of RSIs collected by sensors on various platforms, traditional
processing methods struggle to maintain efficiency and accuracy. In response,
deep learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative approach, enabling
substantial advances in remote sensing image semantic segmentation (RSISS) by
automating feature extraction and improving segmentation accuracy across
diverse modalities. This paper revisits the evolution of DL-based RSISS by
categorizing existing approaches into four stages: the early pixel-based
methods, the prevailing patch-based and tile-based techniques, and the emerging
image-based strategies enabled by foundation models. We analyze these
developments from the perspective of feature extraction and learning
strategies, revealing the field's progression from pixel-level to tile-level
and from unimodal to multimodal segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of nearly 40 advanced techniques on a unified dataset
to quantitatively characterize their performance and applicability. This review
offers a holistic view of DL-based SS for RS, highlighting key advancements,
comparative insights, and open challenges to guide future research.

TLDR: ALN-P3是一个统一的协同蒸馏框架，通过跨模态对齐提升自动驾驶系统的驾驶决策和语言推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时优化驾驶性能和视觉语言推理能力，ALN-P3旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出三种对齐机制（P1A、P2A、P3A），在训练时对齐视觉与语言输出，不增加推理成本。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ALN-P3有效平衡了驾驶与语言推理，为自动驾驶系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances have explored integrating large language models (LLMs) into
end-to-end autonomous driving systems to enhance generalization and
interpretability. However, most existing approaches are limited to either
driving performance or vision-language reasoning, making it difficult to
achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we propose ALN-P3, a unified
co-distillation framework that introduces cross-modal alignment between "fast"
vision-based autonomous driving systems and "slow" language-driven reasoning
modules. ALN-P3 incorporates three novel alignment mechanisms: Perception
Alignment (P1A), Prediction Alignment (P2A), and Planning Alignment (P3A),
which explicitly align visual tokens with corresponding linguistic outputs
across the full perception, prediction, and planning stack. All alignment
modules are applied only during training and incur no additional costs during
inference. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks-nuScenes, Nu-X,
TOD3Cap, and nuScenes QA-demonstrate that ALN-P3 significantly improves both
driving decisions and language reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.

*Jaeyeon Lee,Dong-Wan Choi*

TLDR: ATM是一种无需微调的无损令牌合并方法，通过自适应调整层间相似性阈值和新型令牌匹配技术，显著减少计算开销且保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ViTs因规模大导致的计算开销问题，同时避免现有令牌压缩技术的信息丢失和额外训练需求。

Method: 提出自适应令牌合并（ATM），通过层间相似性阈值调整和令牌匹配技术，实现无损合并。

Result: ATM在多种预训练模型上验证，计算开销减少30%以上且性能不降，优于现有无需训练方法。

Conclusion: ATM为ViTs提供了一种高效、无损的令牌压缩方案，无需额外训练即可显著提升效率。

Abstract: Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become the standard architecture in
computer vision, their massive sizes lead to significant computational
overhead. Token compression techniques have attracted considerable attention to
address this issue, but they often suffer from severe information loss,
requiring extensive additional training to achieve practical performance. In
this paper, we propose Adaptive Token Merging (ATM), a novel method that
ensures lossless token merging, eliminating the need for fine-tuning while
maintaining competitive performance. ATM adaptively reduces tokens across
layers and batches by carefully adjusting layer-specific similarity thresholds,
thereby preventing the undesirable merging of less similar tokens with respect
to each layer. Furthermore, ATM introduces a novel token matching technique
that considers not only similarity but also merging sizes, particularly for the
final layers, to minimize the information loss incurred from each merging
operation. We empirically validate our method across a wide range of pretrained
models, demonstrating that ATM not only outperforms all existing training-free
methods but also surpasses most training-intensive approaches, even without
additional training. Remarkably, training-free ATM achieves over a 30%
reduction in FLOPs for the DeiT-T and DeiT-S models without any drop in their
original accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种新的度量标准（ICR和AOD）来评估文本到图像（T2I）模型训练中描述的详细程度，优于传统的长度指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖简单的指标（如描述长度）来评估描述的详细程度，但这种方法不够准确。

Method: 提出基于图像覆盖率（ICR）和平均对象详细度（AOD）的度量标准，用于评估描述的详细程度。

Result: 实验表明，使用高ICR和AOD描述的T2I模型在性能上优于传统方法，且仅需20%的数据即可超越全数据集训练。

Conclusion: 详细感知的度量标准在T2I任务中比基于长度的启发式方法更有效。

Abstract: Training text-to-image (T2I) models with detailed captions can significantly
improve their generation quality. Existing methods often rely on simplistic
metrics like caption length to represent the detailness of the caption in the
T2I training set. In this paper, we propose a new metric to estimate caption
detailness based on two aspects: image coverage rate (ICR), which evaluates
whether the caption covers all regions/objects in the image, and average object
detailness (AOD), which quantifies the detailness of each object's description.
Through experiments on the COCO dataset using ShareGPT4V captions, we
demonstrate that T2I models trained on high-ICR and -AOD captions achieve
superior performance on DPG and other benchmarks. Notably, our metric enables
more effective data selection-training on only 20% of full data surpasses both
full-dataset training and length-based selection method, improving alignment
and reconstruction ability. These findings highlight the critical role of
detail-aware metrics over length-based heuristics in caption selection for T2I
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGC技术的快速发展带来了信息完整性和身份安全的威胁，现有检测方法在人为中心视频中表现不足，缺乏鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出AvatarShield框架，结合GRPO优化和双编码器架构，通过高语义推理和低层伪影放大实现高效伪造检测。

Result: 在FakeHumanVid基准测试中，AvatarShield显著优于现有方法，在域内和跨域检测中表现优异。

Conclusion: AvatarShield为人为中心视频取证设立了新标准，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)
technologies, particularly in video generation, has led to unprecedented
creative capabilities but also increased threats to information integrity,
identity security, and public trust. Existing detection methods, while
effective in general scenarios, lack robust solutions for human-centric videos,
which pose greater risks due to their realism and potential for legal and
ethical misuse. Moreover, current detection approaches often suffer from poor
generalization, limited scalability, and reliance on labor-intensive supervised
fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, the first
interpretable MLLM-based framework for detecting human-centric fake videos,
enhanced via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through our carefully
designed accuracy detection reward and temporal compensation reward, it
effectively avoids the use of high-cost text annotation data, enabling precise
temporal modeling and forgery detection. Meanwhile, we design a dual-encoder
architecture, combining high-level semantic reasoning and low-level artifact
amplification to guide MLLMs in effective forgery detection. We further collect
FakeHumanVid, a large-scale human-centric video benchmark that includes
synthesis methods guided by pose, audio, and text inputs, enabling rigorous
evaluation of detection methods in real-world scenes. Extensive experiments
show that AvatarShield significantly outperforms existing approaches in both
in-domain and cross-domain detection, setting a new standard for human-centric
video forensics.

Motivation: 跨域步态识别因视角、外观和环境的显著变化而具有挑战性，混合数据集训练虽常用但存在优化冲突和噪声样本问题。

Method: 设计了解耦三元组损失以减少数据集间的梯度冲突，并提出基于特征冗余和预测不确定性的数据集蒸馏策略。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了跨数据集识别性能，且不影响源域准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了跨域步态识别的挑战，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized gait recognition, which aims to achieve robust performance across
diverse domains, remains a challenging problem due to severe domain shifts in
viewpoints, appearances, and environments. While mixed-dataset training is
widely used to enhance generalization, it introduces new obstacles including
inter-dataset optimization conflicts and redundant or noisy samples, both of
which hinder effective representation learning. To address these challenges, we
propose a unified framework that systematically improves cross-domain gait
recognition. First, we design a disentangled triplet loss that isolates
supervision signals across datasets, mitigating gradient conflicts during
optimization. Second, we introduce a targeted dataset distillation strategy
that filters out the least informative 20\% of training samples based on
feature redundancy and prediction uncertainty, enhancing data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on CASIA-B, OU-MVLP, Gait3D, and GREW demonstrate that
our method significantly improves cross-dataset recognition for both GaitBase
and DeepGaitV2 backbones, without sacrificing source-domain accuracy. Code will
be released at https://github.com/li1er3/Generalized_Gait.

Motivation: 现有IRSTD方法忽视成像参数和采集条件的元数据，导致在复杂场景中泛化能力不足。

Method: AuxDet通过多层感知机（MLPs）动态融合元数据与视觉特征，并设计轻量级1D卷积模块优化特征。

Result: 在WideIRSTD-Full基准测试中，AuxDet表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 辅助元数据在提升IRSTD任务鲁棒性和准确性中起关键作用。

Abstract: Omni-domain infrared small target detection (IRSTD) poses formidable
challenges, as a single model must seamlessly adapt to diverse imaging systems,
varying resolutions, and multiple spectral bands simultaneously. Current
approaches predominantly rely on visual-only modeling paradigms that not only
struggle with complex background interference and inherently scarce target
features, but also exhibit limited generalization capabilities across complex
omni-scene environments where significant domain shifts and appearance
variations occur. In this work, we reveal a critical oversight in existing
paradigms: the neglect of readily available auxiliary metadata describing
imaging parameters and acquisition conditions, such as spectral bands, sensor
platforms, resolution, and observation perspectives. To address this
limitation, we propose the Auxiliary Metadata Driven Infrared Small Target
Detector (AuxDet), a novel multi-modal framework that fundamentally reimagines
the IRSTD paradigm by incorporating textual metadata for scene-aware
optimization. Through a high-dimensional fusion module based on multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), AuxDet dynamically integrates metadata semantics with
visual features, guiding adaptive representation learning for each individual
sample. Additionally, we design a lightweight prior-initialized enhancement
module using 1D convolutional blocks to further refine fused features and
recover fine-grained target cues. Extensive experiments on the challenging
WideIRSTD-Full benchmark demonstrate that AuxDet consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, validating the critical role of auxiliary information
in improving robustness and accuracy in omni-domain IRSTD tasks. Code is

Result: 在多样化真实数据集上，MonoSplat展现出优于现有方法的重建质量和泛化能力，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: MonoSplat通过融合单目和多视图特征，显著提升了高斯重建的精度和泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated
promising results in real-time high-fidelity rendering without per-scene
optimization, yet existing approaches still struggle to handle unfamiliar
visual content during inference on novel scenes due to limited
generalizability. To address this challenge, we introduce MonoSplat, a novel
framework that leverages rich visual priors from pre-trained monocular depth
foundation models for robust Gaussian reconstruction. Our approach consists of
two key components: a Mono-Multi Feature Adapter that transforms monocular
features into multi-view representations, coupled with an Integrated Gaussian
Prediction module that effectively fuses both feature types for precise
Gaussian generation. Through the Adapter's lightweight attention mechanism,
features are seamlessly aligned and aggregated across views while preserving
valuable monocular priors, enabling the Prediction module to generate Gaussian
primitives with accurate geometry and appearance. Through extensive experiments
on diverse real-world datasets, we convincingly demonstrate that MonoSplat
achieves superior reconstruction quality and generalization capability compared
to existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency with minimal
trainable parameters. Codes are available at

Abstract: Transfer learning under domain shift remains a fundamental challenge due to
the divergence between source and target data manifolds. In this paper, we
propose MAADA (Manifold-Aware Adversarial Data Augmentation), a novel framework
that decomposes adversarial perturbations into on-manifold and off-manifold
components to simultaneously capture semantic variation and model brittleness.
We theoretically demonstrate that enforcing on-manifold consistency reduces
hypothesis complexity and improves generalization, while off-manifold
regularization smooths decision boundaries in low-density regions. Moreover, we
introduce a geometry-aware alignment loss that minimizes geodesic discrepancy
between source and target manifolds. Experiments on DomainNet, VisDA, and
Office-Home show that MAADA consistently outperforms existing adversarial and
adaptation methods in both unsupervised and few-shot settings, demonstrating
superior structural robustness and cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Foundation models have ushered in a new era for multimodal video
understanding by enabling the extraction of rich spatiotemporal and semantic
representations. In this work, we introduce a novel graph-based framework that
integrates a vision-language foundation, leveraging VideoMAE for dynamic visual
encoding and BERT for contextual textual embedding, to address the challenge of
recognizing fine-grained bimanual manipulation actions. Departing from
conventional static graph architectures, our approach constructs an adaptive
multimodal graph where nodes represent frames, objects, and textual
annotations, and edges encode spatial, temporal, and semantic relationships.
These graph structures evolve dynamically based on learned interactions,
allowing for flexible and context-aware reasoning. A task-specific attention
mechanism within a Graph Attention Network further enhances this reasoning by
modulating edge importance based on action semantics. Through extensive
evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the strength
of combining foundation models with dynamic graph-based reasoning for robust

Conclusion: GAMA通过结构化正则化和显式对齐，显著提升了跨域适应性能。

Abstract: Domain adaptation remains a challenge when there is significant manifold
discrepancy between source and target domains. Although recent methods leverage
manifold-aware adversarial perturbations to perform data augmentation, they
often neglect precise manifold alignment and systematic exploration of
structured perturbations. To address this, we propose GAMA (Geometry-Aware
Manifold Alignment), a structured framework that achieves explicit manifold
alignment via adversarial perturbation guided by geometric information. GAMA
systematically employs tangent space exploration and manifold-constrained
adversarial optimization, simultaneously enhancing semantic consistency,
robustness to off-manifold deviations, and cross-domain alignment. Theoretical
analysis shows that GAMA tightens the generalization bound via structured
regularization and explicit alignment. Empirical results on DomainNet, VisDA,

Result: 在BEAT-2基准测试中达到最新最优性能，生成的手势既时间对齐又语义丰富。

Conclusion: 该框架为数字人和具身AI中的表达性手势生成提供了模块化基础。

Abstract: When humans speak, gestures help convey communicative intentions, such as
adding emphasis or describing concepts. However, current co-speech gesture
generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (\textit{e.g.}
speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the
communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs
that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Intentional-Gesture}, a novel framework
that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in
high-level communicative functions. % First, we curate the \textbf{InG} dataset
by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (\textit{i.e.}, text
sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using
large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the \textbf{Intentional
Gesture Motion Tokenizer} to leverage these intention annotations. It injects
high-level communicative functions (\textit{e.g.}, intentions) into tokenized
motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are
both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new
state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a
modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and
embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture

Conclusion: Flashback通过零样本和实时处理能力，为大规模视频监控提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from
video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance
deployments. However, three fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption:
domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous
processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot
and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive
mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based
on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In
the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of
both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data.
In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched
against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at
inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU.
On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp),
respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.

Abstract: Transferring 2D textures to 3D modalities is of great significance for
improving the efficiency of multimedia content creation. Existing approaches
have rarely focused on transferring image textures onto 3D representations. 3D
style transfer methods are capable of transferring abstract artistic styles to
3D scenes. However, these methods often overlook the geometric information of
the scene, which makes it challenging to achieve high-quality 3D texture
transfer results. In this paper, we present GT^2-GS, a geometry-aware texture
transfer framework for gaussian splitting. From the perspective of matching
texture features with geometric information in rendered views, we identify the
issue of insufficient texture features and propose a geometry-aware texture
augmentation module to expand the texture feature set. Moreover, a
geometry-consistent texture loss is proposed to optimize texture features into
the scene representation. This loss function incorporates both camera pose and
3D geometric information of the scene, enabling controllable texture-oriented
appearance editing. Finally, a geometry preservation strategy is introduced. By
alternating between the texture transfer and geometry correction stages over
multiple iterations, this strategy achieves a balance between learning texture
features and preserving geometric integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness and controllability of our method. Through geometric
awareness, our approach achieves texture transfer results that better align
with human visual perception. Our homepage is available at

Abstract: Although existing CLIP-based methods for detecting AI-generated images have
achieved promising results, they are still limited by severe feature
redundancy, which hinders their generalization ability. To address this issue,
incorporating an information bottleneck network into the task presents a
straightforward solution. However, relying solely on image-corresponding
prompts results in suboptimal performance due to the inherent diversity of
prompts. In this paper, we propose a multimodal conditional bottleneck network
to reduce feature redundancy while enhancing the discriminative power of
features extracted by CLIP, thereby improving the model's generalization
ability. We begin with a semantic analysis experiment, where we observe that
arbitrary text features exhibit lower cosine similarity with real image
features than with fake image features in the CLIP feature space, a phenomenon
we refer to as "bias". Therefore, we introduce InfoFD, a text-guided
AI-generated image detection framework. InfoFD consists of two key components:
the Text-Guided Conditional Information Bottleneck (TGCIB) and Dynamic Text
Orthogonalization (DTO). TGCIB improves the generalizability of learned
representations by conditioning on both text and class modalities. DTO
dynamically updates weighted text features, preserving semantic information
while leveraging the global "bias". Our model achieves exceptional
generalization performance on the GenImage dataset and latest generative
models. Our code is available at https://github.com/Ant0ny44/InfoFD.

Abstract: Recently, continuous representation methods emerge as novel paradigms that
characterize the intrinsic structures of real-world data through function
representations that map positional coordinates to their corresponding values
in the continuous space. As compared with the traditional discrete framework,
the continuous framework demonstrates inherent superiority for data
representation and reconstruction (e.g., image restoration, novel view
synthesis, and waveform inversion) by offering inherent advantages including
resolution flexibility, cross-modal adaptability, inherent smoothness, and
parameter efficiency. In this review, we systematically examine recent
advancements in continuous representation frameworks, focusing on three
aspects: (i) Continuous representation method designs such as basis function
representation, statistical modeling, tensor function decomposition, and
implicit neural representation; (ii) Theoretical foundations of continuous
representations such as approximation error analysis, convergence property, and
implicit regularization; (iii) Real-world applications of continuous
representations derived from computer vision, graphics, bioinformatics, and
remote sensing. Furthermore, we outline future directions and perspectives to
inspire exploration and deepen insights to facilitate continuous representation
methods, theories, and applications. All referenced works are summarized in our

*Ting Huang,Zeyu Zhang,Ruicheng Zhang,Yang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: DC-Scene是一种针对3D场景理解的数据中心框架，通过CLIP驱动的双指标质量过滤器和课程调度器，提升数据质量和训练效率，减少对大规模标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D场景理解在机器人、自动驾驶等领域至关重要，但面临计算成本高和高质量标注数据稀缺的挑战，需要更高效的学习范式。

Method: 提出CLIP驱动的双指标质量（DIQ）过滤器，结合视觉-语言对齐分数和标题损失困惑度，以及课程调度器逐步扩展训练样本。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D数据集上达到最先进性能（86.1 CIDEr），训练成本降低约三分之二。

Conclusion: 高质量样本的紧凑集合可以超越大规模训练，DC-Scene为3D场景理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D scene understanding plays a fundamental role in vision applications such
as robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. However, advancing
learning-based 3D scene understanding remains challenging due to two key
limitations: (1) the large scale and complexity of 3D scenes lead to higher
computational costs and slower training compared to 2D counterparts; and (2)
high-quality annotated 3D datasets are significantly scarcer than those
available for 2D vision. These challenges underscore the need for more
efficient learning paradigms. In this work, we propose DC-Scene, a data-centric
framework tailored for 3D scene understanding, which emphasizes enhancing data
quality and training efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a CLIP-driven
dual-indicator quality (DIQ) filter, combining vision-language alignment scores
with caption-loss perplexity, along with a curriculum scheduler that
progressively expands the training pool from the top 25% to 75% of
scene-caption pairs. This strategy filters out noisy samples and significantly
reduces dependence on large-scale labeled 3D data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D demonstrate that DC-Scene achieves state-of-the-art
performance (86.1 CIDEr with the top-75% subset vs. 85.4 with the full dataset)
while reducing training cost by approximately two-thirds, confirming that a
compact set of high-quality samples can outperform exhaustive training. Code

*Yuxuan Du,Zhendong Wang,Yuhao Luo,Caiyong Piao,Zhiyuan Yan,Hao Li,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为CAD的多模态框架，通过跨模态对齐和蒸馏技术，结合模态特定的细粒度伪影线索和模态共享的语义错位，显著提升了视频深度伪造检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态深度伪造（视觉和听觉内容同时被操纵）的快速出现削弱了现有仅依赖模态特定伪影或跨模态不一致的检测器的可靠性。

Method: CAD框架包含两个核心组件：1）跨模态对齐，识别高层次语义同步中的不一致性（如唇语不匹配）；2）跨模态蒸馏，在融合特征时缓解冲突并保留模态特定的伪影线索（如合成音频中的频谱失真）。

Result: 在多种多模态和单模态深度伪造基准测试中，CAD显著优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 和谐整合多模态互补信息是提升深度伪造检测性能的关键。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of multimodal deepfakes (visual and auditory content are
manipulated in concert) undermines the reliability of existing detectors that
rely solely on modality-specific artifacts or cross-modal inconsistencies. In
this work, we first demonstrate that modality-specific forensic traces (e.g.,
face-swap artifacts or spectral distortions) and modality-shared semantic
misalignments (e.g., lip-speech asynchrony) offer complementary evidence, and
that neglecting either aspect limits detection performance. Existing approaches
either naively fuse modality-specific features without reconciling their
conflicting characteristics or focus predominantly on semantic misalignment at
the expense of modality-specific fine-grained artifact cues. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a general multimodal framework for video deepfake
detection via Cross-Modal Alignment and Distillation (CAD). CAD comprises two
core components: 1) Cross-modal alignment that identifies inconsistencies in
high-level semantic synchronization (e.g., lip-speech mismatches); 2)
Cross-modal distillation that mitigates feature conflicts during fusion while
preserving modality-specific forensic traces (e.g., spectral distortions in
synthetic audio). Extensive experiments on both multimodal and unimodal (e.g.,
image-only/video-only)deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CAD significantly
outperforms previous methods, validating the necessity of harmonious
integration of multimodal complementary information.

TLDR: GAMA++通过潜在空间解耦和自适应对比扰动策略，解决了现有方法在任务相关与无关维度解耦不足及扰动方案僵化的问题，在多个基准测试中取得最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前几何感知域适应方法（如GAMA）存在任务相关与无关维度解耦不足及扰动方案忽略类间对齐不对称性的问题。

Method: 提出GAMA++框架，包括潜在空间解耦和自适应对比扰动策略，并引入跨域对比一致性损失。

Result: 在DomainNet、Office-Home和VisDA基准测试中取得最优结果，显著提升了类级对齐保真度和边界鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GAMA++为迁移学习中的语义几何对齐设立了新标准。

Abstract: Despite progress in geometry-aware domain adaptation, current methods such as
GAMA still suffer from two unresolved issues: (1) insufficient disentanglement
of task-relevant and task-irrelevant manifold dimensions, and (2) rigid
perturbation schemes that ignore per-class alignment asymmetries. To address
this, we propose GAMA++, a novel framework that introduces (i) latent space
disentanglement to isolate label-consistent manifold directions from nuisance
factors, and (ii) an adaptive contrastive perturbation strategy that tailors
both on- and off-manifold exploration to class-specific manifold curvature and
alignment discrepancy. We further propose a cross-domain contrastive
consistency loss that encourages local semantic clusters to align while
preserving intra-domain diversity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results
on DomainNet, Office-Home, and VisDA benchmarks under both standard and
few-shot settings, with notable improvements in class-level alignment fidelity
and boundary robustness. GAMA++ sets a new standard for semantic geometry
alignment in transfer learning.

Motivation: 医学影像标注数据稀缺，现有方法依赖单图像的合成增强，而医学影像通常具有多视角标准化视图，VET-DINO旨在利用这一特性提升模型性能。

Method: 提出VET-DINO框架，利用同一患者研究中的多视角兽医X光片，学习视图不变的解剖结构，并隐含地从2D投影中理解3D结构。

Result: 在包含500万张兽医X光片的数据集上验证，VET-DINO在多视角合成和下游任务中表现优于纯合成增强方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: VET-DINO为医学影像自监督学习提供了新范式，强调利用领域特性而非简单迁移自然图像技术。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training deep
neural networks, particularly in medical imaging where labeled data is scarce.
While current approaches typically rely on synthetic augmentations of single
images, we propose VET-DINO, a framework that leverages a unique characteristic
of medical imaging: the availability of multiple standardized views from the
same study. Using a series of clinical veterinary radiographs from the same
patient study, we enable models to learn view-invariant anatomical structures
and develop an implied 3D understanding from 2D projections. We demonstrate our
approach on a dataset of 5 million veterinary radiographs from 668,000 canine
studies. Through extensive experimentation, including view synthesis and
downstream task performance, we show that learning from real multi-view pairs
leads to superior anatomical understanding compared to purely synthetic
augmentations. VET-DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on various
veterinary imaging tasks. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
self-supervised learning in medical imaging that leverages domain-specific
properties rather than merely adapting natural image techniques.

Motivation: 传统医学图像分割依赖手动提示（如边界框），效率较低。研究旨在探索眼动追踪作为一种更高效的交互方式。

Method: 使用眼动追踪数据作为提示，结合SAM-2和MedSAM-2模型，评估其在合成和真实眼动数据上的表现。

Result: 眼动提示比边界框更高效，但分割质量略低。

Conclusion: 眼动追踪可作为医学图像分割的补充输入方式，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in volumetric medical images
is crucial for clinical applications, including disease monitoring and cancer
treatment planning. Contemporary interactive segmentation models, such as
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) and its medical variant (MedSAM-2), rely on
manually provided prompts like bounding boxes and mouse clicks. In this study,
we introduce eye gaze as a novel informational modality for interactive
segmentation, marking the application of eye-tracking for 3D medical image
segmentation. We evaluate the performance of using gaze-based prompts with
SAM-2 and MedSAM-2 using both synthetic and real gaze data. Compared to
bounding boxes, gaze-based prompts offer a time-efficient interaction approach
with slightly lower segmentation quality. Our findings highlight the potential
of using gaze as a complementary input modality for interactive 3D medical
image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用生成模型的表征能力实现通用的感知组织，特别是在对象边界和场景组合的理解上。

Method: 使用实例着色损失对Stable Diffusion和MAE进行微调，仅针对少量对象类型（室内家具和汽车）。

Result: 模型在未见过的对象类型和风格上表现出色，甚至在精细结构和模糊边界的分割上优于SAM。

Conclusion: 生成模型具有跨类别和领域的固有分组机制，无需大规模预训练即可实现泛化。

Abstract: By pretraining to synthesize coherent images from perturbed inputs,
generative models inherently learn to understand object boundaries and scene
compositions. How can we repurpose these generative representations for
general-purpose perceptual organization? We finetune Stable Diffusion and MAE
(encoder+decoder) for category-agnostic instance segmentation using our
instance coloring loss exclusively on a narrow set of object types (indoor
furnishings and cars). Surprisingly, our models exhibit strong zero-shot
generalization, accurately segmenting objects of types and styles unseen in
finetuning (and in many cases, MAE's ImageNet-1K pretraining too). Our
best-performing models closely approach the heavily supervised SAM when
evaluated on unseen object types and styles, and outperform it when segmenting
fine structures and ambiguous boundaries. In contrast, existing promptable
segmentation architectures or discriminatively pretrained models fail to
generalize. This suggests that generative models learn an inherent grouping
mechanism that transfers across categories and domains, even without
internet-scale pretraining. Code, pretrained models, and demos are available on
our website.

TLDR: 提出了一种结合对比学习的数据集蒸馏方法，显著提升了在极少量合成数据下模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限环境中部署机器学习模型需要将大数据集压缩为小而信息丰富的合成数据集，现有方法在极端样本稀缺时无法保持语义丰富性。

Method: 通过整合对比学习在图像合成过程中，显式最大化实例级特征区分，生成更具信息性和多样性的合成样本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在极少量合成数据下显著提升了模型性能，并改善了合成图像的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 结合对比学习的数据集蒸馏方法优于现有技术，尤其在合成数据极少的场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models in resource-constrained environments, such
as edge devices or rapid prototyping scenarios, increasingly demands
distillation of large datasets into significantly smaller yet informative
synthetic datasets. Current dataset distillation techniques, particularly
Trajectory Matching methods, optimize synthetic data so that the model's
training trajectory on synthetic samples mirrors that on real data. While
demonstrating efficacy on medium-scale synthetic datasets, these methods fail
to adequately preserve semantic richness under extreme sample scarcity. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel dataset distillation method
integrating contrastive learning during image synthesis. By explicitly
maximizing instance-level feature discrimination, our approach produces more
informative and diverse synthetic samples, even when dataset sizes are
significantly constrained. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating
contrastive learning substantially enhances the performance of models trained
on very small-scale synthetic datasets. This integration not only guides more
effective feature representation but also significantly improves the visual
fidelity of the synthesized images. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves notable performance improvements over existing distillation
techniques, especially in scenarios with extremely limited synthetic data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型主要关注离线视频问答，忽视了实时应用中的内存和响应速度需求。

Method: LiveVLM采用流式KV缓存技术，实时处理视频流并保留长期细节，同时压缩视频KV张量以提高效率。

Result: 实验显示，LiveVLM在相同设备上能处理44倍帧数，响应速度比现有方法快5倍，且性能相当或更好。

Conclusion: LiveVLM为实时视频理解提供了高效解决方案，适用于自动驾驶、机器人等应用。

Abstract: Recent developments in Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have enabled
models to process long video sequences and demonstrate remarkable performance.
Nonetheless, studies predominantly focus on offline video question answering,
neglecting memory usage and response speed that are essential in various
real-world applications, such as Deepseek services, autonomous driving, and
robotics. To mitigate these challenges, we propose $\textbf{LiveVLM}$, a
training-free framework specifically designed for streaming, online video
understanding and real-time interaction. Unlike existing works that process
videos only after one question is posed, LiveVLM constructs an innovative
streaming-oriented KV cache to process video streams in real-time, retain
long-term video details and eliminate redundant KVs, ensuring prompt responses
to user queries. For continuous video streams, LiveVLM generates and compresses
video key-value tensors (video KVs) to reserve visual information while
improving memory efficiency. Furthermore, when a new question is proposed,
LiveVLM incorporates an online question-answering process that efficiently
fetches both short-term and long-term visual information, while minimizing
interference from redundant context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
LiveVLM enables the foundation LLaVA-OneVision model to process 44$\times$
number of frames on the same device, and achieves up to 5$\times$ speedup in
response speed compared with SoTA online methods at an input of 256 frames,
while maintaining the same or better model performance.

Conclusion: DiffProb显著降低了训练成本和数据量，减少了对大规模数据集的依赖，提升了人脸识别的效率。

Abstract: Face recognition models have made substantial progress due to advances in
deep learning and the availability of large-scale datasets. However, reliance
on massive annotated datasets introduces challenges related to training
computational cost and data storage, as well as potential privacy concerns
regarding managing large face datasets. This paper presents DiffProb, the first
data pruning approach for the application of face recognition. DiffProb
assesses the prediction probabilities of training samples within each identity
and prunes the ones with identical or close prediction probability values, as
they are likely reinforcing the same decision boundaries, and thus contribute
minimally with new information. We further enhance this process with an
auxiliary cleaning mechanism to eliminate mislabeled and label-flipped samples,
boosting data quality with minimal loss. Extensive experiments on CASIA-WebFace
with different pruning ratios and multiple benchmarks, including LFW, CFP-FP,
and IJB-C, demonstrate that DiffProb can prune up to 50% of the dataset while
maintaining or even, in some settings, improving the verification accuracies.
Additionally, we demonstrate DiffProb's robustness across different
architectures and loss functions. Our method significantly reduces training
cost and data volume, enabling efficient face recognition training and reducing
the reliance on massive datasets and their demanding management.

TLDR: GS2E是一个通过3D高斯散射和物理模拟生成的大规模合成事件数据集，用于高保真事件视觉任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件数据集通常基于密集RGB视频合成，缺乏视角多样性和几何一致性，或依赖昂贵硬件。GS2E旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用3D高斯散射重建静态场景，结合自适应轨迹插值和物理一致的事件对比阈值建模，生成高质量事件流。

Result: 实验表明，GS2E在事件3D重建任务中表现出卓越的泛化能力，适合作为事件视觉研究的基准。

Conclusion: GS2E为事件视觉研究提供了高质量、多样化的数据集，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: We introduce GS2E (Gaussian Splatting to Event), a large-scale synthetic
event dataset for high-fidelity event vision tasks, captured from real-world
sparse multi-view RGB images. Existing event datasets are often synthesized
from dense RGB videos, which typically lack viewpoint diversity and geometric
consistency, or depend on expensive, difficult-to-scale hardware setups. GS2E
overcomes these limitations by first reconstructing photorealistic static
scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting, and subsequently employing a novel,
physically-informed event simulation pipeline. This pipeline generally
integrates adaptive trajectory interpolation with physically-consistent event
contrast threshold modeling. Such an approach yields temporally dense and
geometrically consistent event streams under diverse motion and lighting
conditions, while ensuring strong alignment with underlying scene structures.
Experimental results on event-based 3D reconstruction demonstrate GS2E's
superior generalization capabilities and its practical value as a benchmark for
advancing event vision research.

Conclusion: R3GS在重建和重定位任务中表现出色，代码将开源。

Abstract: We propose R3GS, a robust reconstruction and relocalization framework
tailored for unconstrained datasets. Our method uses a hybrid representation
during training. Each anchor combines a global feature from a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with a local feature encoded by the multiresolution hash
grids [2]. Subsequently, several shallow multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) predict
the attributes of each Gaussians, including color, opacity, and covariance. To
mitigate the adverse effects of transient objects on the reconstruction
process, we ffne-tune a lightweight human detection network. Once ffne-tuned,
this network generates a visibility map that efffciently generalizes to other
transient objects (such as posters, banners, and cars) with minimal need for
further adaptation. Additionally, to address the challenges posed by sky
regions in outdoor scenes, we propose an effective sky-handling technique that
incorporates a depth prior as a constraint. This allows the inffnitely distant
sky to be represented on the surface of a large-radius sky sphere,
signiffcantly reducing ffoaters caused by errors in sky reconstruction.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel relocalization method that remains robust to
changes in lighting conditions while estimating the camera pose of a given
image within the reconstructed 3DGS scene. As a result, R3GS significantly
enhances rendering ffdelity, improves both training and rendering efffciency,
and reduces storage requirements. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to baseline methods on in-the-wild datasets. The code will
be made open-source following the acceptance of the paper.

TLDR: BadSR提出了一种针对超分辨率（SR）模型的后门攻击方法，通过改进毒化高分辨率（HR）图像的隐蔽性，使其更难以被检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击主要关注低分辨率（LR）图像的隐蔽性，忽略了HR图像的隐蔽性，容易被用户发现异常数据。

Method: BadSR通过在特征空间中逼近干净HR图像和预定义目标图像，并限制对干净HR图像的修改范围，生成隐蔽的毒化HR图像。同时设计了对抗优化的触发器和基于遗传算法的毒化样本选择方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，BadSR在多种模型和数据集上实现了高攻击成功率，显著影响下游任务。

Conclusion: BadSR提高了后门攻击的隐蔽性和有效性，为SR模型的安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: With the widespread application of super-resolution (SR) in various fields,
researchers have begun to investigate its security. Previous studies have
demonstrated that SR models can also be subjected to backdoor attacks through
data poisoning, affecting downstream tasks. A backdoor SR model generates an
attacker-predefined target image when given a triggered image while producing a
normal high-resolution (HR) output for clean images. However, prior backdoor
attacks on SR models have primarily focused on the stealthiness of poisoned
low-resolution (LR) images while ignoring the stealthiness of poisoned HR
images, making it easy for users to detect anomalous data. To address this
problem, we propose BadSR, which improves the stealthiness of poisoned HR
images. The key idea of BadSR is to approximate the clean HR image and the
pre-defined target image in the feature space while ensuring that modifications
to the clean HR image remain within a constrained range. The poisoned HR images
generated by BadSR can be integrated with existing triggers. To further improve
the effectiveness of BadSR, we design an adversarially optimized trigger and a
backdoor gradient-driven poisoned sample selection method based on a genetic
algorithm. The experimental results show that BadSR achieves a high attack
success rate in various models and data sets, significantly affecting
downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在非身份属性控制上存在困难，且难以解耦身份与可变属性。

Result: 在姿态、表情和情感控制精度上优于现有方法，同时提升生成多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高精度的非身份属性控制，同时保持身份特征的稳定性。

Abstract: Human facial images encode a rich spectrum of information, encompassing both
stable identity-related traits and mutable attributes such as pose, expression,
and emotion. While recent advances in image generation have enabled
high-quality identity-conditional face synthesis, precise control over
non-identity attributes remains challenging, and disentangling identity from
these mutable factors is particularly difficult. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel identity-conditional diffusion model that introduces two
lightweight control modules designed to independently manipulate facial pose,
expression, and emotion without compromising identity preservation. These
modules are embedded within the cross-attention layers of the base diffusion
model, enabling precise attribute control with minimal parameter overhead.
Furthermore, our tailored training strategy, which leverages cross-attention
between the identity feature and each non-identity control feature, encourages
identity features to remain orthogonal to control signals, enhancing
controllability and diversity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along
with perceptual user studies, demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of control accuracy over pose, expression, and emotion,
while also improving generative diversity under identity-only conditioning.

Conclusion: CEBSNet通过模块化设计有效解决了时间依赖性和背景干扰问题，显著提升了变化检测性能。

Abstract: Change detection, a critical task in remote sensing and computer vision, aims
to identify pixel-level differences between image pairs captured at the same
geographic area but different times. It faces numerous challenges such as
illumination variation, seasonal changes, background interference, and shooting
angles, especially with a large time gap between images. While current methods
have advanced, they often overlook temporal dependencies and overemphasize
prominent changes while ignoring subtle but equally important changes. To
address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{CEBSNet}, a novel
change-excited and background-suppressed network with temporal dependency
modeling for change detection. During the feature extraction, we utilize a
simple Channel Swap Module (CSM) to model temporal dependency, reducing
differences and noise. The Feature Excitation and Suppression Module (FESM) is
developed to capture both obvious and subtle changes, maintaining the integrity
of change regions. Additionally, we design a Pyramid-Aware Spatial-Channel
Attention module (PASCA) to enhance the ability to detect change regions at
different sizes and focus on critical regions. We conduct extensive experiments
on three common street view datasets and two remote sensing datasets, and our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流自注意力方法在建模全局关系时未能捕捉真实场景中的高阶关联，且存在计算冗余。传统超图神经网络依赖静态硬超边分配，忽略了视觉语义的连续性。

Method: 提出SoftHGNN，引入软超边概念，通过可学习的超边原型实现动态可微关联。采用稀疏超边选择机制和负载平衡正则化提升效率。

Result: 在五个数据集的三个任务上，SoftHGNN高效捕捉了高阶关联，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: SoftHGNN为视觉识别中的高阶关联建模提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual recognition relies on understanding both the semantics of image tokens
and the complex interactions among them. Mainstream self-attention methods,
while effective at modeling global pair-wise relations, fail to capture
high-order associations inherent in real-world scenes and often suffer from
redundant computation. Hypergraphs extend conventional graphs by modeling
high-order interactions and offer a promising framework for addressing these
limitations. However, existing hypergraph neural networks typically rely on
static and hard hyperedge assignments, leading to excessive and redundant
hyperedges with hard binary vertex memberships that overlook the continuity of
visual semantics. To overcome these issues, we present Soft Hypergraph Neural
Networks (SoftHGNNs), which extend the methodology of hypergraph computation,
to make it truly efficient and versatile in visual recognition tasks. Our
framework introduces the concept of soft hyperedges, where each vertex is
associated with hyperedges via continuous participation weights rather than
hard binary assignments. This dynamic and differentiable association is
achieved by using the learnable hyperedge prototype. Through similarity
measurements between token features and the prototype, the model generates
semantically rich soft hyperedges. SoftHGNN then aggregates messages over soft
hyperedges to capture high-order semantics. To further enhance efficiency when
scaling up the number of soft hyperedges, we incorporate a sparse hyperedge
selection mechanism that activates only the top-k important hyperedges, along
with a load-balancing regularizer to ensure balanced hyperedge utilization.
Experimental results across three tasks on five datasets demonstrate that
SoftHGNN efficiently captures high-order associations in visual scenes,
achieving significant performance improvements.

Method: 设计基于思维链（CoT）的提示，减少模型无响应率并增强决策推理；使用54名个体的护照场景数据对两种多模态LLM（ChatGPT-4o和Gemini）进行定性和定量评估。

Result: ChatGPT-4o在检测精度上优于Gemini，尤其在对抗GAN生成的变形攻击时表现更好，但无响应率较高；Gemini的解释更一致但性能较差。

Conclusion: 多模态LLM在D-MAD中具有潜力，但需进一步优化提示设计和模型性能以应对复杂场景。

Abstract: Leveraging the power of multimodal large language models (LLMs) offers a
promising approach to enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of morphing
attack detection (MAD), especially in real-world biometric applications. This
work introduces the use of LLMs for differential morphing attack detection
(D-MAD). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ
multimodal LLMs to D-MAD using real biometric data. To effectively utilize
these models, we design Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based prompts to reduce
failure-to-answer rates and enhance the reasoning behind decisions. Our
contributions include: (1) the first application of multimodal LLMs for D-MAD
using real data subjects, (2) CoT-based prompt engineering to improve response
reliability and explainability, (3) comprehensive qualitative and quantitative
benchmarking of LLM performance using data from 54 individuals captured in
passport enrollment scenarios, and (4) comparative analysis of two multimodal
LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and Gemini providing insights into their morphing attack
detection accuracy and decision transparency. Experimental results show that
ChatGPT-4o outperforms Gemini in detection accuracy, especially against
GAN-based morphs, though both models struggle under challenging conditions.
While Gemini offers more consistent explanations, ChatGPT-4o is more resilient
but prone to a higher failure-to-answer rate.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种高效微调框架，将多光谱基础模型SpectralGPT应用于高光谱图像分类，并测试了多种参数高效微调方法，其中KronA+表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）在多光谱基础模型中研究较少，且微调过程对内存和存储需求较高。

Method: 探索了多种参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，包括LoRA、KronA、LoKr和LoRA+，并提出了KronA+。

Result: 在五个数据集上表现优异，KronA+仅需0.056%的可训练参数和0.2MB存储，性能接近全微调。

Conclusion: KronA+是最高效的PEFT方法，为高光谱图像分类提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success across diverse domains,
including remote sensing (RS), thanks to their versatility and strong
generalization abilities. However, most RS foundation models are designed for
multispectral data, while hyperspectral imagery (HSI) - with its hundreds of
spectral bands - remains less explored. Fine-tuning such models for downstream
tasks is also challenging, often demanding considerable memory and storage. In
this paper, we propose an efficient framework to fine-tune SpectralGPT, a
multispectral foundation model, for hyperspectral image classification (HSIC).
We explore several Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, including
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kronecker-based adaptation (KronA), Low-Rank
Kronecker (LoKr), and the recent LoRA+, which uses distinct learning rates for
low-rank adapters scaled by a factor lambda. Inspired by LoRA+, we introduce
KronA+, which applies a similar mechanism to the Kronecker matrices. We
evaluate our approach on five datasets from different sensors, showing
competitive performance with state-of-the-art HSI models. Our full fine-tuning
(FFT) setup for SpectralGPT even outperforms a dedicated hyperspectral
foundation model on some datasets while requiring only a quarter of the
training epochs. Under the same number of epochs, KronA+ reaches similar
performance with far fewer trainable parameters - just 0.056 percent - and adds
only approximately 0.2 megabytes of storage, making it the most effective PEFT
method tested.

Result: 提出的方法有效解决了扩散模型特有的挑战，且不依赖特定模型架构。

Conclusion: 该策略为扩散模型下的深度伪造防御提供了新思路，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The proliferation of diffusion-based deepfake technologies poses significant
risks for unauthorized and unethical facial image manipulation. While
traditional countermeasures have primarily focused on passive detection
methods, this paper introduces a novel proactive defense strategy through
adversarial attacks that preemptively protect facial images from being
exploited by diffusion-based deepfake systems. Existing adversarial protection
methods predominantly target conventional generative architectures (GANs, AEs,
VAEs) and fail to address the unique challenges presented by diffusion models,
which have become the predominant framework for high-quality facial deepfakes.
Current diffusion-specific adversarial approaches are limited by their reliance
on specific model architectures and weights, rendering them ineffective against
the diverse landscape of diffusion-based deepfake implementations.
Additionally, they typically employ global perturbation strategies that
inadequately address the region-specific nature of facial manipulation in
deepfakes.

Abstract: Road safety is a critical challenge, particularly for cyclists, who are among
the most vulnerable road users. This study aims to enhance road safety by
proposing a novel benchmark for bicycle occlusion level classification using
advanced computer vision techniques. Utilizing a parts-based detection model,
images are annotated and processed through a custom image detection pipeline. A
novel method of bicycle occlusion level is proposed to objectively quantify the
visibility and occlusion level of bicycle semantic parts. The findings indicate
that the model robustly quantifies the visibility and occlusion level of
bicycles, a significant improvement over the subjective methods used by the
current state of the art. Widespread use of the proposed methodology will
facilitate the accurate performance reporting of cyclist detection algorithms
for occluded cyclists, informing the development of more robust vulnerable road
user detection methods for autonomous vehicles.

TLDR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在安全关键场景中的可靠性问题，发现模型存在系统性过度反应问题，即容易将安全场景误判为危险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在安全关键场景中的可靠性，揭示其局限性。

Method: 使用VERI数据集（200张图像，100对对比图像），通过两阶段协议（风险识别和应急响应）评估14个VLMs。

Result: 模型在识别真实紧急情况时表现良好（70-100%成功率），但误判安全场景为危险的比例高达31-96%。

Conclusion: VLMs在安全应用中存在可靠性问题，需针对性改进其上下文安全评估能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
understanding visual content, but their reliability in safety-critical contexts
remains under-explored. We introduce VERI (Visual Emergency Recognition
Dataset), a carefully designed diagnostic benchmark of 200 images (100
contrastive pairs). Each emergency scene is matched with a visually similar but
safe counterpart through multi-stage human verification and iterative
refinement. Using a two-stage protocol - risk identification and emergency
response - we evaluate 14 VLMs (2B-124B parameters) across medical emergencies,
accidents, and natural disasters. Our analysis reveals a systematic
overreaction problem: models excel at identifying real emergencies (70-100
percent success rate) but suffer from an alarming rate of false alarms,
misidentifying 31-96 percent of safe situations as dangerous, with 10 scenarios
failed by all models regardless of scale. This "better-safe-than-sorry" bias
manifests primarily through contextual overinterpretation (88-93 percent of
errors), challenging VLMs' reliability for safety applications. These findings
highlight persistent limitations that are not resolved by increasing model
scale, motivating targeted approaches for improving contextual safety
assessment in visually misleading scenarios.

Result: 系统在零样本3D实例检索、分割和检测任务中表现优异，能处理未见物体和自然语言查询。

Conclusion: 该训练免费框架为通用3D场景理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Mapping and understanding complex 3D environments is fundamental to how
autonomous systems perceive and interact with the physical world, requiring
both precise geometric reconstruction and rich semantic comprehension. While
existing 3D semantic mapping systems excel at reconstructing and identifying
predefined object instances, they lack the flexibility to efficiently build
semantic maps with open-vocabulary during online operation. Although recent
vision-language models have enabled open-vocabulary object recognition in 2D
images, they haven't yet bridged the gap to 3D spatial understanding. The
critical challenge lies in developing a training-free unified system that can
simultaneously construct accurate 3D maps while maintaining semantic
consistency and supporting natural language interactions in real time. In this
paper, we develop a zero-shot framework that seamlessly integrates
GPU-accelerated geometric reconstruction with open-vocabulary vision-language
models through online instance-level semantic embedding fusion, guided by
hierarchical object association with spatial indexing. Our training-free system
achieves superior performance through incremental processing and unified
geometric-semantic updates, while robustly handling 2D segmentation
inconsistencies. The proposed general-purpose 3D scene understanding framework
can be used for various tasks including zero-shot 3D instance retrieval,
segmentation, and object detection to reason about previously unseen objects
and interpret natural language queries. The project page is available at

Abstract: With recent advancements in neural rendering and motion capture algorithms,
remarkable progress has been made in photorealistic human avatar modeling,
unlocking immense potential for applications in virtual reality, augmented
reality, remote communication, and industries such as gaming, film, and
medicine. However, existing methods fail to provide complete, faithful, and
expressive control over human avatars due to their entangled representation of
facial expressions and body movements. In this work, we introduce Expressive
Virtual Avatars (EVA), an actor-specific, fully controllable, and expressive
human avatar framework that achieves high-fidelity, lifelike renderings in real
time while enabling independent control of facial expressions, body movements,
and hand gestures. Specifically, our approach designs the human avatar as a
two-layer model: an expressive template geometry layer and a 3D Gaussian
appearance layer. First, we present an expressive template tracking algorithm
that leverages coarse-to-fine optimization to accurately recover body motions,
facial expressions, and non-rigid deformation parameters from multi-view
videos. Next, we propose a novel decoupled 3D Gaussian appearance model
designed to effectively disentangle body and facial appearance. Unlike unified
Gaussian estimation approaches, our method employs two specialized and
independent modules to model the body and face separately. Experimental results
demonstrate that EVA surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of rendering
quality and expressiveness, validating its effectiveness in creating full-body
avatars. This work represents a significant advancement towards fully drivable
digital human models, enabling the creation of lifelike digital avatars that
faithfully replicate human geometry and appearance.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，RichCount实现了零样本计数的先进性能，显著提升了对未见类别的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RichCount通过特征对齐支持准确计数，超越了简单的提示扩展方法。

Abstract: Expanding pre-trained zero-shot counting models to handle unseen categories
requires more than simply adding new prompts, as this approach does not achieve
the necessary alignment between text and visual features for accurate counting.
We introduce RichCount, the first framework to address these limitations,
employing a two-stage training strategy that enhances text encoding and
strengthens the model's association with objects in images. RichCount improves
zero-shot counting for unseen categories through two key objectives: (1)
enriching text features with a feed-forward network and adapter trained on
text-image similarity, thereby creating robust, aligned representations; and
(2) applying this refined encoder to counting tasks, enabling effective
generalization across diverse prompts and complex images. In this manner,
RichCount goes beyond simple prompt expansion to establish meaningful feature
alignment that supports accurate counting across novel categories. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
RichCount, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot counting and
significantly enhancing generalization to unseen categories in open-world
scenarios.

Abstract: The extraction of visual features is an essential step in Visual Question
Answering (VQA). Building a good visual representation of the analyzed scene is
indeed one of the essential keys for the system to be able to correctly
understand the latter in order to answer complex questions. In many fields such
as remote sensing, the visual feature extraction step could benefit
significantly from leveraging different image modalities carrying complementary
spectral, spatial and contextual information. In this work, we propose to add
multiple image modalities to VQA in the particular context of remote sensing,
leading to a novel task for the computer vision community. To this end, we
introduce a new VQA dataset, named TAMMI (Text and Multi-Modal Imagery) with
diverse questions on scenes described by three different modalities (very high
resolution RGB, multi-spectral imaging data and synthetic aperture radar).
Thanks to an automated pipeline, this dataset can be easily extended according
to experimental needs. We also propose the MM-RSVQA (Multi-modal
Multi-resolution Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering) model, based on
VisualBERT, a vision-language transformer, to effectively combine the multiple
image modalities and text through a trainable fusion process. A preliminary
experimental study shows promising results of our methodology on this
challenging dataset, with an accuracy of 65.56% on the targeted VQA task. This
pioneering work paves the way for the community to a new multi-modal
multi-resolution VQA task that can be applied in other imaging domains (such as
medical imaging) where multi-modality can enrich the visual representation of a
scene. The dataset and code are available at https://tammi.sylvainlobry.com/.

most research fields, but the datasets available today to refine such methods
focus either on simple or social behaviors. In this work, we present a video

recorded from three different perspectives. As a benchmark for frame-level
action classification methods, we provide human-annotated labels for all videos
of two different mice, that equal 13% of our dataset. Our keypoint (pose)

Abstract: Vision Transformers have emerged as the state-of-the-art models in various
Computer Vision tasks, but their high computational and resource demands pose
significant challenges. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can make these models
more efficient, they often require costly retraining or even training from
scratch. Recent developments aim to reduce these computational costs by
leveraging pretrained networks. These have been shown to produce sparse
activation patterns in the Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) of the encoder
blocks, allowing for conditional activation of only relevant subnetworks for
each sample. Building on this idea, we propose a new method to construct MoE
variants from pretrained models. Our approach extracts expert subnetworks from
the model's MLP layers post-training in two phases. First, we cluster output
activations to identify distinct activation patterns. In the second phase, we
use these clusters to extract the corresponding subnetworks responsible for
producing them. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we demonstrate that these
extracted experts can perform surprisingly well out of the box and require only
minimal fine-tuning to regain 98% of the original performance, all while
reducing MACs and model size, by up to 36% and 32% respectively.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MVLMs) have achieved par excellence
generalization in medical image analysis, yet their performance under noisy,
corrupted conditions remains largely untested. Clinical imaging is inherently
susceptible to acquisition artifacts and noise; however, existing evaluations
predominantly assess generally clean datasets, overlooking robustness -- i.e.,
the model's ability to perform under real-world distortions. To address this
gap, we first introduce MediMeta-C, a corruption benchmark that systematically
applies several perturbations across multiple medical imaging datasets.
Combined with MedMNIST-C, this establishes a comprehensive robustness
evaluation framework for MVLMs. We further propose RobustMedCLIP, a visual
encoder adaptation of a pretrained MVLM that incorporates few-shot tuning to
enhance resilience against corruptions. Through extensive experiments, we
benchmark 5 major MVLMs across 5 medical imaging modalities, revealing that
existing models exhibit severe degradation under corruption and struggle with
domain-modality tradeoffs. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse
training and robust adaptation strategies, demonstrating that efficient
low-rank adaptation when paired with few-shot tuning, improves robustness while
preserving generalization across modalities.

*Zeqing Wang,Shiyuan Zhang,Chengpei Tang,Keze Wang*

TLDR: 论文提出了TimeCausality基准，用于评估视觉语言模型在时间因果推理上的能力，发现现有开源模型表现不及闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在时间因果推理上的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 设计TimeCausality基准，评估模型在时间维度上的因果推理能力。

Result: 开源模型表现不及闭源模型，GPT-4o在TimeCausality上表现显著下降。

Conclusion: 需将时间因果推理纳入视觉语言模型的评估与开发，是开源社区的重要挑战。

Abstract: Reasoning about temporal causality, particularly irreversible transformations
of objects governed by real-world knowledge (e.g., fruit decay and human
aging), is a fundamental aspect of human visual understanding. Unlike temporal
perception based on simple event sequences, this form of reasoning requires a
deeper comprehension of how object states change over time. Although the
current powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, their capacity to reason about
temporal causality remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
\textbf{TimeCausality}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the
causal reasoning ability of VLMs in the temporal dimension. Based on our
TimeCausality, we find that while the current SOTA open-source VLMs have
achieved performance levels comparable to closed-source models like GPT-4o on
various standard visual question answering tasks, they fall significantly
behind on our benchmark compared with their closed-source competitors.
Furthermore, even GPT-4o exhibits a marked drop in performance on TimeCausality
compared to its results on other tasks. These findings underscore the critical
need to incorporate temporal causality into the evaluation and development of
VLMs, and they highlight an important challenge for the open-source VLM
community moving forward. Code and Data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型的多模态推理能力尚未充分探索，需要一种方法自适应聚焦关键图像区域以实现高效推理。

Method: 提出CoF方法，包括两阶段训练：监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）。SFT阶段使用MM-CoF数据集微调模型，RL阶段利用准确性和格式作为奖励进一步优化模型。

Result: 在V*基准测试中，模型在8种分辨率下表现优于现有模型5%，验证了CoF方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CoF方法显著提升了视觉语言模型的多模态推理能力，为实际应用中的高效部署提供了支持。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
variety of computer vision tasks. However, the multimodal reasoning capability
has not been fully explored in existing models. In this paper, we propose a
Chain-of-Focus (CoF) method that allows VLMs to perform adaptive focusing and
zooming in on key image regions based on obtained visual cues and the given
questions, achieving efficient multimodal reasoning. To enable this CoF
capability, we present a two-stage training pipeline, including supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we
construct the MM-CoF dataset, comprising 3K samples derived from a visual agent
designed to adaptively identify key regions to solve visual tasks with
different image resolutions and questions. We use MM-CoF to fine-tune the
Qwen2.5-VL model for cold start. In the RL stage, we leverage the outcome
accuracies and formats as rewards to update the Qwen2.5-VL model, enabling
further refining the search and reasoning strategy of models without human
priors. Our model achieves significant improvements on multiple benchmarks. On
the V* benchmark that requires strong visual reasoning capability, our model
outperforms existing VLMs by 5% among 8 image resolutions ranging from 224 to
4K, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed CoF method and facilitating
the more efficient deployment of VLMs in practical applications.

TLDR: 提出了一种无注释手语的伪手语生成框架，利用大语言模型生成伪手语，并通过弱监督学习优化对齐，提升了手语翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语翻译依赖昂贵的人工标注手语注释，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成伪手语，通过弱监督学习优化对齐，采用三阶段训练流程缩小模态差距。

Result: 在两个手语翻译基准上优于现有无注释方法，与依赖注释的方法竞争。

Conclusion: 提出的框架无需人工标注手语注释，性能优越，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to map sign language videos to spoken
language text. A common approach relies on gloss annotations as an intermediate
representation, decomposing SLT into two sub-tasks: video-to-gloss recognition
and gloss-to-text translation. While effective, this paradigm depends on
expert-annotated gloss labels, which are costly and rarely available in
existing datasets, limiting its scalability. To address this challenge, we
propose a gloss-free pseudo gloss generation framework that eliminates the need
for human-annotated glosses while preserving the structured intermediate
representation. Specifically, we prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) with a few
example text-gloss pairs using in-context learning to produce draft sign
glosses from spoken language text. To enhance the correspondence between
LLM-generated pseudo glosses and the sign sequences in video, we correct the
ordering in the pseudo glosses for better alignment via a weakly supervised
learning process. This reordering facilitates the incorporation of auxiliary
alignment objectives, and allows for the use of efficient supervision via a
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. We train our SLT mode, which
consists of a vision encoder and a translator, through a three-stage pipeline,
which progressively narrows the modality gap between sign language and spoken
language. Despite its simplicity, our approach outperforms previous
state-of-the-art gloss-free frameworks on two SLT benchmarks and achieves
competitive results compared to gloss-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于分形的递归光谱重建网络（FRN），通过逐步预测波段而非一次性整合全光谱信息，显著提升了RGB图像到高光谱图像的重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）获取成本高，通过RGB图像重建HSI可降低成本。现有方法通常一次性整合全光谱信息，效果有限。

Method: FRN采用递归调用原子重建模块的渐进式方法，利用相邻波段信息预测下一波长，并设计了波段感知状态空间模型以减少低相关区域的干扰。

Result: 在多个数据集上，FRN在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FRN通过分形递归和波段感知策略，实现了高效且高精度的光谱重建，为低成本HSI生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB images through spectral
reconstruction can significantly reduce the cost of HSI acquisition. In this
paper, we propose a Fractal-Based Recursive Spectral Reconstruction Network
(FRN), which differs from existing paradigms that attempt to directly integrate
the full-spectrum information from the R, G, and B channels in a one-shot
manner. Instead, it treats spectral reconstruction as a progressive process,
predicting from broad to narrow bands or employing a coarse-to-fine approach
for predicting the next wavelength. Inspired by fractals in mathematics, FRN
establishes a novel spectral reconstruction paradigm by recursively invoking an
atomic reconstruction module. In each invocation, only the spectral information
from neighboring bands is used to provide clues for the generation of the image
at the next wavelength, which follows the low-rank property of spectral data.
Moreover, we design a band-aware state space model that employs a
pixel-differentiated scanning strategy at different stages of the generation
process, further suppressing interference from low-correlation regions caused
by reflectance differences. Through extensive experimentation across different
datasets, FRN achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Motivation: 探索如何在ViT中引入八面体群（反射和90度旋转）等变性作为额外的归纳偏置。

Method: 开发了octic ViTs，结合八面体群等变层，并在监督和自监督学习中进行测试。

Result: 在DeiT-III和DINOv2训练中，octic ViTs显著降低了计算量（ViT-H减少约40% FLOPs），同时提升了分类和分割性能。

Conclusion: octic ViTs通过引入八面体群等变性，实现了更高效的网络设计和性能提升。

Abstract: Recent efforts at scaling computer vision models have established Vision
Transformers (ViTs) as the leading architecture. ViTs incorporate weight
sharing over image patches as an important inductive bias. In this work, we
show that ViTs benefit from incorporating equivariance under the octic group,
i.e., reflections and 90-degree rotations, as a further inductive bias. We
develop new architectures, octic ViTs, that use octic-equivariant layers and
put them to the test on both supervised and self-supervised learning. Through
extensive experiments on DeiT-III and DINOv2 training on ImageNet-1K, we show
that octic ViTs yield more computationally efficient networks while also
improving performance. In particular, we achieve approximately 40% reduction in
FLOPs for ViT-H while simultaneously improving both classification and
segmentation results.

TLDR: ViaRL是一种基于规则强化学习的框架，用于优化意图驱动的视频理解中的帧选择，无需昂贵标注，性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解方法依赖启发式或伪标注，成本高且扩展性差，ViaRL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用规则强化学习，通过下游模型答案准确率作为奖励信号训练帧选择器，结合迭代放大策略优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在Needle QA上提升近15%。

Conclusion: ViaRL高效、可扩展，显著提升了视频理解的时态定位性能。

Abstract: Video understanding is inherently intention-driven-humans naturally focus on
relevant frames based on their goals. Recent advancements in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have enabled flexible query-driven reasoning; however,
video-based frameworks like Video Chain-of-Thought lack direct training signals
to effectively identify relevant frames. Current approaches often rely on
heuristic methods or pseudo-label supervised annotations, which are both costly
and limited in scalability across diverse scenarios. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce ViaRL, the first framework to leverage rule-based
reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing frame selection in intention-driven
video understanding. An iterated amplification strategy is adopted to perform
alternating cyclic training in the video CoT system, where each component
undergoes iterative cycles of refinement to improve its capabilities. ViaRL
utilizes the answer accuracy of a downstream model as a reward signal to train
a frame selector through trial-and-error, eliminating the need for expensive
annotations while closely aligning with human-like learning processes.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, including VideoMME,
LVBench, and MLVU, demonstrate that ViaRL consistently delivers superior
temporal grounding performance and robust generalization across diverse video
understanding tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability. Notably,
ViaRL achieves a nearly 15\% improvement on Needle QA, a subset of MLVU, which
is required to search a specific needle within a long video and regarded as one
of the most suitable benchmarks for evaluating temporal grounding.

Conclusion: 为扩散模型内容安全的理解和未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have gained widespread application across
various domains, demonstrating remarkable creative potential. However, the
strong generalization capabilities of diffusion models can inadvertently lead
to the generation of not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, posing significant risks
to their safe deployment. While several concept erasure methods have been
proposed to mitigate the issue associated with NSFW content, a comprehensive
evaluation of their effectiveness across various scenarios remains absent. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a full-pipeline toolkit specifically designed for
concept erasure and conduct the first systematic study of NSFW concept erasure
methods. By examining the interplay between the underlying mechanisms and
empirical observations, we provide in-depth insights and practical guidance for
the effective application of concept erasure methods in various real-world
scenarios, with the aim of advancing the understanding of content safety in
diffusion models and establishing a solid foundation for future research and
development in this critical area.

Conclusion: 研究强调了意图感知建模在MMD中的重要性，为开发能深度推理多模态虚假信息的系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The real-world impact of misinformation stems from the underlying misleading
narratives that creators seek to convey. As such, interpreting misleading
creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD)
systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce
an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by
explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired
influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct
DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs
aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both
misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and
textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks:
(1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3)
creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs
fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues
such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic
authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware
modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of
deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.

Motivation: RGB数据在低光照和遮挡条件下性能受限，而融合热辐射数据可提升鲁棒性，但如何有效融合多模态特征仍具挑战。

Method: 从光谱视角将多模态特征分为低频（场景上下文）和高频（模态细节），提出SGFNet显式建模高频特征交互。

Result: 在MFNet和PST900数据集上，SGFNet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SGFNet通过光谱感知特征融合，显著提升了多模态语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relying solely on RGB data often struggles in
challenging conditions such as low illumination and obscured views, limiting
its reliability in critical applications like autonomous driving. To address
this, integrating additional thermal radiation data with RGB images
demonstrates enhanced performance and robustness. However, how to effectively
reconcile the modality discrepancies and fuse the RGB and thermal features
remains a well-known challenge. In this work, we address this challenge from a
novel spectral perspective. We observe that the multi-modal features can be
categorized into two spectral components: low-frequency features that provide
broad scene context, including color variations and smooth areas, and
high-frequency features that capture modality-specific details such as edges
and textures. Inspired by this, we propose the Spectral-aware Global Fusion
Network (SGFNet) to effectively enhance and fuse the multi-modal features by
explicitly modeling the interactions between the high-frequency,
modality-specific features. Our experimental results demonstrate that SGFNet
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the MFNet and PST900 datasets.

Motivation: 深度学习在计算病理学中取得进展，但专家标注稀缺，少样本学习虽减轻标注负担，但存在过拟合和特征误判问题。现有方法预处理复杂且计算成本高。

Method: 提出SR块，包含低秩可训练矩阵（压缩路径）和冻结随机重校准矩阵，减少参数并保持几何结构。理论证明SR块可逼近任意线性映射。

Result: 实验表明SR-MIL模型优于现有方法，参数更少且无需架构改动。

Conclusion: SR块是MIL模型的通用改进模块，性能优于现有方法，且计算成本低。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced computational pathology but expert annotations
remain scarce. Few-shot learning mitigates annotation burdens yet suffers from
overfitting and discriminative feature mischaracterization. In addition, the
current few-shot multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches leverage
pretrained vision-language models to alleviate these issues, but at the cost of
complex preprocessing and high computational cost. We propose a
Squeeze-and-Recalibrate (SR) block, a drop-in replacement for linear layers in
MIL models to address these challenges. The SR block comprises two core
components: a pair of low-rank trainable matrices (squeeze pathway, SP) that
reduces parameter count and imposes a bottleneck to prevent spurious feature
learning, and a frozen random recalibration matrix that preserves geometric
structure, diversifies feature directions, and redefines the optimization
objective for the SP. We provide theoretical guarantees that the SR block can
approximate any linear mapping to arbitrary precision, thereby ensuring that
the performance of a standard MIL model serves as a lower bound for its
SR-enhanced counterpart. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SR-MIL
models consistently outperform prior methods while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and no architectural changes.

Result: 在15个目标基准数据集上的实验表明，PromptMargin在分布偏移情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PromptMargin通过有效的提示调整和边界优化，显著提升了视觉-语言模型在少量标注样本下的适应能力。

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language foundation models like CLIP and ALIGN, which are
pre-trained on large-scale data have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization
to diverse datasets with different classes and even domains. In this work, we
take a step further and analyze whether these models can be adapted to target
datasets having very different distributions and classes compared to what these
models have been trained on, using only a few labeled examples from the target
dataset. In such scenarios, finetuning large pretrained models is challenging
due to problems of overfitting as well as loss of generalization, and has not
been well explored in prior literature. Since, the pre-training data of such
models are unavailable, it is difficult to comprehend the performance on
various downstream datasets. First, we try to answer the question: Given a
target dataset with a few labelled examples, can we estimate whether further
fine-tuning can enhance the performance compared to zero-shot evaluation? by
analyzing the common vision-language embedding space. Based on the analysis, we
propose a novel prompt-tuning method, PromptMargin for adapting such
large-scale VLMs directly on the few target samples. PromptMargin effectively
tunes the text as well as visual prompts for this task, and has two main
modules: 1) Firstly, we use a selective augmentation strategy to complement the
few training samples in each task; 2) Additionally, to ensure robust training
in the presence of unfamiliar class names, we increase the inter-class margin
for improved class discrimination using a novel Multimodal Margin Regularizer.
Extensive experiments and analysis across fifteen target benchmark datasets,
with varying degrees of distribution shifts from natural images, shows the
effectiveness of the proposed framework over the existing state-of-the-art
approaches applied to this setting. github.com/debarshigit/PromptMargin.

Method: 定义并分析四种视觉思维表达形式，研究其对MCoT改进的影响及其在模型中的内部作用机制。

Result: 视觉思维的表达形式在清晰度和简洁性上存在差异，导致MCoT改进效果不同；视觉思维作为图像与深层推理的中介，促进视觉信息传递。

Conclusion: 视觉思维的研究为未来MCoT的突破提供了启示。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in
multimodal tasks, with multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) further enhancing
performance and interpretability. Recent MCoT methods fall into two categories:
(i) Textual-MCoT (T-MCoT), which takes multimodal input and produces textual
output; and (ii) Interleaved-MCoT (I-MCoT), which generates interleaved
image-text outputs. Despite advances in both approaches, the mechanisms driving
these improvements are not fully understood. To fill this gap, we first reveal
that MCoT boosts LVLMs by incorporating visual thoughts, which convey image
information to the reasoning process regardless of the MCoT format, depending
only on clarity and conciseness of expression. Furthermore, to explore visual
thoughts systematically, we define four distinct forms of visual thought
expressions and analyze them comprehensively. Our findings demonstrate that
these forms differ in clarity and conciseness, yielding varying levels of MCoT
improvement. Additionally, we explore the internal nature of visual thoughts,
finding that visual thoughts serve as intermediaries between the input image
and reasoning to deeper transformer layers, enabling more advanced visual
information transmission. We hope that the visual thoughts can inspire further
breakthroughs for future MCoT research.

Abstract: To overcome the constraints of the underwater environment and improve the
accuracy and robustness of underwater target detection models, this paper
develops a specialized dataset for underwater target detection and proposes an
efficient algorithm for underwater multi-target detection. A self-supervised
learning based on the SimSiam structure is employed for the pre-training of
underwater target detection network. To address the problems of low detection
accuracy caused by low contrast, mutual occlusion and dense distribution of
underwater targets in underwater object detection, a detection model suitable
for underwater target detection is proposed by introducing deformable
convolution and dilated convolution. The proposed detection model can obtain
more effective information by increasing the receptive field. In addition, the
regression loss function EIoU is introduced, which improves model performance
by separately calculating the width and height losses of the predicted box.
Experiment results show that the accuracy of the underwater target detection
has been improved by the proposed detector.

Abstract: Recent years have seen substantial improvements in the ability to generate
synthetic 3D objects using AI. However, generating complex 3D objects, such as
plants, remains a considerable challenge. Current generative 3D models struggle
with plant generation compared to general objects, limiting their usability in
plant analysis tools, which require fine detail and accurate geometry. We
introduce PlantDreamer, a novel approach to 3D synthetic plant generation,
which can achieve greater levels of realism for complex plant geometry and
textures than available text-to-3D models. To achieve this, our new generation
pipeline leverages a depth ControlNet, fine-tuned Low-Rank Adaptation and an
adaptable Gaussian culling algorithm, which directly improve textural realism
and geometric integrity of generated 3D plant models. Additionally,
PlantDreamer enables both purely synthetic plant generation, by leveraging
L-System-generated meshes, and the enhancement of real-world plant point clouds
by converting them into 3D Gaussian Splats. We evaluate our approach by
comparing its outputs with state-of-the-art text-to-3D models, demonstrating
that PlantDreamer outperforms existing methods in producing high-fidelity
synthetic plants. Our results indicate that our approach not only advances
synthetic plant generation, but also facilitates the upgrading of legacy point
cloud datasets, making it a valuable tool for 3D phenotyping applications.

*Lingyu Kong,Hongzhi Zhang,Jingyuan Zhang,Jianzhao Huang,Kunze Li,Qi Wang,Fuzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视频理解任务中表现优异，但在长视频任务中性能下降。为解决这一问题，提出了Clapper方法，采用慢快策略和TimePerceiver模块，实现了高效的时间和空间编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs在长视频理解任务中性能显著下降，尤其是在视觉标记压缩后。需要一种方法能同时处理短视频和长视频，保留细节并高效压缩信息。

Method: 提出Clapper方法，采用慢快策略进行视频表示，并引入TimePerceiver模块，在现有VLM骨干中实现高效时空编码。

Result: Clapper实现了每帧13倍的视觉标记压缩（平均61标记/帧），且不影响QA准确性。在实验中，Clapper在多个数据集上表现优异，且每视频标记数少于6000。

Conclusion: Clapper通过慢快策略和TimePerceiver模块，显著提升了VLMs在长视频任务中的性能，同时保持了短视频的细节处理能力。

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse video understanding applications. Designing VLMs
for video inputs requires effectively modeling the temporal dimension (i.e.
capturing dependencies across frames) and balancing the processing of short and
long videos. Specifically, short videos demand preservation of fine-grained
details, whereas long videos require strategic compression of visual
information to handle extensive temporal contexts efficiently. However, our
empirical analysis reveals a critical limitation: most existing VLMs suffer
severe performance degradation in long video understanding tasks when
compressing visual tokens below a quarter of their original visual tokens. To
enable more effective modeling of both short and long video inputs, we propose
Clapper, a method that utilizes a slow-fast strategy for video representation
and introduces a novel module named TimePerceiver for efficient
temporal-spatial encoding within existing VLM backbones. By using our method,
we achieves 13x compression of visual tokens per frame (averaging 61
tokens/frame) without compromising QA accuracy. In our experiments, Clapper
achieves 62.0% on VideoMME, 69.8% on MLVU, and 67.4% on TempCompass, all with
fewer than 6,000 visual tokens per video. The code will be publicly available
on the homepage.

Method: 结合动态网格技术和UDF进行数值模拟，构建流场数据集；改进ConvLSTM模型，加入残差网络和注意力机制。

Result: 改进的ConvLSTM模型在时空特征提取上优于标准模型，且参数更少、训练时间更短。

Conclusion: 改进的ConvLSTM模型为流场预测提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the main approach to analyzing flow
field. However, the convergence and accuracy depend largely on mathematical
models of flow, numerical methods, and time consumption. Deep learning-based
analysis of flow filed provides an alternative. For the task of flow field
prediction, an improved Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Con-vLSTM) Neural
Network is proposed as the baseline network in consideration of the temporal
and spatial characteristics of flow field. Combining dynamic mesh technology
and User-Defined Function (UDF), numerical simulations of flow around a
circular cylinder were conducted. Flow field snapshots were used to sample data
from the cylinder's wake region at different time instants, constructing a flow
field dataset with sufficient volume and rich flow state var-iations. Residual
networks and attention mechanisms are combined with the standard ConvLSTM
model. Compared with the standard ConvLSTM model, the results demonstrate that
the improved ConvLSTM model can extract more temporal and spatial features
while having fewer parameters and shorter train-ing time.

Conclusion: 提出的框架模块化且高效，在域适应和泛化任务中表现优异，代码和工具将开源。

Abstract: 3D semantic segmentation plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving and road
infrastructure analysis, yet state-of-the-art 3D models are prone to severe
domain shift when deployed across different datasets. We propose a novel
multi-view projection framework that excels in both domain generalization (DG)
and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our approach first aligns Lidar scans
into coherent 3D scenes and renders them from multiple virtual camera poses to
create a large-scale synthetic 2D dataset (PC2D). We then use it to train a 2D
segmentation model in-domain. During inference, the model processes hundreds of
views per scene; the resulting logits are back-projected to 3D with an
occlusion-aware voting scheme to generate final point-wise labels. Our
framework is modular and enables extensive exploration of key design
parameters, such as view generation optimization (VGO), visualization modality
optimization (MODO), and 2D model choice. We evaluate on the nuScenes and
SemanticKITTI datasets under both the DG and UDA settings. We achieve
state-of-the-art results in UDA and close to state-of-the-art in DG, with
particularly large gains on large, static classes. Our code and dataset
generation tools will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶中视觉问答模型计算资源需求高的问题。

Method: 采用多尺度视觉编码器和双级优先级机制（令牌路由和序列评分）。

Result: 在自定义数据集和公开基准DriveLM上表现优异，BLEU-4和METEOR分数分别提升11.1%和35.4%。

Conclusion: TinyDrive在资源受限环境下高效且性能优越。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) employed for visual question-answering (VQA) in
autonomous driving often require substantial computational resources that pose
a challenge for their deployment in resource-constrained vehicles. To address
this challenge, we introduce TinyDrive, a lightweight yet effective VLM for
multi-view VQA in driving scenarios. Our model comprises two key components
including a multiscale vision encoder and a dual-level prioritization mechanism
for tokens and sequences. The multiscale encoder facilitates the processing of
multi-view images at diverse resolutions through scale injection and
cross-scale gating to generate enhanced visual representations. At the token
level, we design a token routing mechanism that dynamically selects and process
the most informative tokens based on learned importance scores. At the sequence
level, we propose integrating normalized loss, uncertainty estimates, and a
diversity metric to formulate sequence scores that rank and preserve samples
within a sequence priority buffer. Samples with higher scores are more
frequently selected for training. TinyDrive is first evaluated on our
custom-curated VQA dataset, and it is subsequently tested on the public DriveLM
benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art language understanding
performance. Notably, it achieves relative improvements of 11.1% and 35.4% in
BLEU-4 and METEOR scores, respectively, despite having a significantly smaller
parameter count.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，AHNPL显著提升了视觉语言模型在复杂组合推理任务中的性能。

Conclusion: AHNPL通过改进负样本生成和对比学习策略，有效解决了现有方法的不足，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are essential for multimodal tasks, especially
compositional reasoning (CR) tasks, which require distinguishing fine-grained
semantic differences between visual and textual embeddings. However, existing
methods primarily fine-tune the model by generating text-based hard negative
samples, neglecting the importance of image-based negative samples, which
results in insufficient training of the visual encoder and ultimately impacts
the overall performance of the model. Moreover, negative samples are typically
treated uniformly, without considering their difficulty levels, and the
alignment of positive samples is insufficient, which leads to challenges in
aligning difficult sample pairs. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Hard Negative Perturbation Learning (AHNPL). AHNPL translates text-based hard
negatives into the visual domain to generate semantically disturbed image-based
negatives for training the model, thereby enhancing its overall performance.
AHNPL also introduces a contrastive learning approach using a multimodal hard
negative loss to improve the model's discrimination of hard negatives within
each modality and a dynamic margin loss that adjusts the contrastive margin
according to sample difficulty to enhance the distinction of challenging sample
pairs. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method
effectively boosts VLMs' performance on complex CR tasks. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏水下领域专业知识，现有模型（如SAM）在水下实例分割任务中表现受限，且计算需求较高。

Method: 提出UIIS10K数据集，并设计UWSAM模型，结合Mask GAT-based知识蒸馏和端到端水下提示生成器（EUPG）。

Result: 实验表明，UWSAM在多个水下数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UWSAM通过高效的知识蒸馏和自动提示生成，解决了水下实例分割的挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in a variety of visual
applications. However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and
its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance
segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further
hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which
includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we
introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate
segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from
the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the
Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective
visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater
Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater
prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts,
thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for
efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model
is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets. Datasets and
codes are available at https://github.com/LiamLian0727/UIIS10K.

Conclusion: VP Lab为快速、高效、交互式的模型部署提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large-scale pretrained vision backbones have transformed computer vision by
providing powerful feature extractors that enable various downstream tasks,
including training-free approaches like visual prompting for semantic
segmentation. Despite their success in generic scenarios, these models often
fall short when applied to specialized technical domains where the visual
features differ significantly from their training distribution. To bridge this
gap, we introduce VP Lab, a comprehensive iterative framework that enhances
visual prompting for robust segmentation model development. At the core of VP
Lab lies E-PEFT, a novel ensemble of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques
specifically designed to adapt our visual prompting pipeline to specific
domains in a manner that is both parameter- and data-efficient. Our approach
not only surpasses the state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for
the Segment Anything Model (SAM), but also facilitates an interactive,
near-real-time loop, allowing users to observe progressively improving results
as they experiment within the framework. By integrating E-PEFT with visual
prompting, we demonstrate a remarkable 50\% increase in semantic segmentation
mIoU performance across various technical datasets using only 5 validated
images, establishing a new paradigm for fast, efficient, and interactive model
deployment in new, challenging domains. This work comes in the form of a
demonstration.

Conclusion: Lens为评估MLLMs的综合能力提供了新工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant advances
in integrating visual and linguistic information, yet their ability to reason
about complex and real-world scenarios remains limited. The existing benchmarks
are usually constructed in the task-oriented manner without guarantee that
different task samples come from the same data distribution, thus they often
fall short in evaluating the synergistic effects of lower-level perceptual
capabilities on higher-order reasoning. To lift this limitation, we contribute
Lens, a multi-level benchmark with 3.4K contemporary images and 60K+
human-authored questions covering eight tasks and 12 daily scenarios, forming
three progressive task tiers, i.e., perception, understanding, and reasoning.
One feature is that each image is equipped with rich annotations for all tasks.
Thus, this dataset intrinsically supports to evaluate MLLMs to handle
image-invariable prompts, from basic perception to compositional reasoning. In
addition, our images are manully collected from the social media, in which 53%
were published later than Jan. 2025. We evaluate 15+ frontier MLLMs such as
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, InternVL3-78B, GPT-4o and two reasoning models QVQ-72B-preview
and Kimi-VL. These models are released later than Dec. 2024, and none of them
achieve an accuracy greater than 60% in the reasoning tasks. Project page:

Abstract: Generalization of deep-learning-based (DL) computer vision algorithms to
various image perturbations is hard to establish and remains an active area of
research. The majority of past analyses focused on the images already captured,
whereas effects of the image formation pipeline and environment are less
studied. In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing the impact of
capture conditions, such as camera parameters and lighting, on DL model
performance on 3 vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and
visual question answering (VQA). To this end, we assess capture bias in common
vision datasets and create a new benchmark, SNAP (for $\textbf{S}$hutter speed,
ISO se$\textbf{N}$sitivity, and $\textbf{AP}$erture), consisting of images of
objects taken under controlled lighting conditions and with densely sampled
camera settings. We then evaluate a large number of DL vision models and show
the effects of capture conditions on each selected vision task. Lastly, we
conduct an experiment to establish a human baseline for the VQA task. Our
results show that computer vision datasets are significantly biased, the models
trained on this data do not reach human accuracy even on the well-exposed
images, and are susceptible to both major exposure changes and minute
variations of camera settings. Code and data can be found at

Abstract: Malocclusion is a major challenge in orthodontics, and its complex
presentation and diverse clinical manifestations make accurate localization and
diagnosis particularly important. Currently, one of the major shortcomings
facing the field of dental image analysis is the lack of large-scale,
accurately labeled datasets dedicated to malocclusion issues, which limits the
development of automated diagnostics in the field of dentistry and leads to a
lack of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical practice. Therefore, in
this study, we propose the Oral and Maxillofacial Natural Images (OMNI)
dataset, a novel and comprehensive dental image dataset aimed at advancing the
study of analyzing dental images for issues of malocclusion. Specifically, the
dataset contains 4166 multi-view images with 384 participants in data
collection and annotated by professional dentists. In addition, we performed a
comprehensive validation of the created OMNI dataset, including three CNN-based
methods, two Transformer-based methods, and one GNN-based method, and conducted
automated diagnostic experiments for malocclusion issues. The experimental
results show that the OMNI dataset can facilitate the automated diagnosis
research of malocclusion issues and provide a new benchmark for the research in
this field. Our OMNI dataset and baseline code are publicly available at

Conclusion: JDL和LTB有助于提升场景文本检测的泛化能力，MAEDet为长尾问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Scene text detection has seen the emergence of high-performing methods that
excel on academic benchmarks. However, these detectors often fail to replicate
such success in real-world scenarios. We uncover two key factors contributing
to this discrepancy through extensive experiments. First, a \textit{Fine-tuning
Gap}, where models leverage \textit{Dataset-Specific Optimization} (DSO)
paradigm for one domain at the cost of reduced effectiveness in others, leads
to inflated performances on academic benchmarks. Second, the suboptimal
performance in practical settings is primarily attributed to the long-tailed
distribution of texts, where detectors struggle with rare and complex
categories as artistic or overlapped text. Given that the DSO paradigm might
undermine the generalization ability of models, we advocate for a
\textit{Joint-Dataset Learning} (JDL) protocol to alleviate the Fine-tuning
Gap. Additionally, an error analysis is conducted to identify three major
categories and 13 subcategories of challenges in long-tailed scene text, upon
which we propose a Long-Tailed Benchmark (LTB). LTB facilitates a comprehensive
evaluation of ability to handle a diverse range of long-tailed challenges. We
further introduce MAEDet, a self-supervised learning-based method, as a strong
baseline for LTB. The code is available at https://github.com/pd162/LTB.

Result: 改进后的算法在传统准确率和不确定性准确率上平均提升2-3%，且校准效果显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了深度学习模型在安全关键应用中的可信度。

Abstract: Knowing the uncertainty associated with the output of a deep neural network
is of paramount importance in making trustworthy decisions, particularly in
high-stakes fields like medical diagnosis and autonomous systems. Monte Carlo
Dropout (MCD) is a widely used method for uncertainty quantification, as it can
be easily integrated into various deep architectures. However, conventional MCD
often struggles with providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. To
address this, we introduce innovative frameworks that enhances MCD by
integrating different search solutions namely Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO),
Bayesian Optimization (BO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as well as an
uncertainty-aware loss function, thereby improving the reliability of
uncertainty quantification. We conduct comprehensive experiments using
different backbones, namely DenseNet121, ResNet50, and VGG16, on various
datasets, including Cats vs. Dogs, Myocarditis, Wisconsin, and a synthetic
dataset (Circles). Our proposed algorithm outperforms the MCD baseline by 2-3%
on average in terms of both conventional accuracy and uncertainty accuracy
while achieving significantly better calibration. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to enhance the trustworthiness of deep learning
models in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal pathological image understanding has garnered widespread interest
due to its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and enable personalized
treatment through integrated visual and textual data. However, existing methods
exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, which hamper their ability to handle
complex diagnostic scenarios. Additionally, the enormous size of pathological
images leads to severe computational burdens, further restricting their
practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
bilateral reinforcement learning framework comprising two synergistic branches.
One reinforcement branch enhances the reasoning capability by enabling the
model to learn task-specific decision processes, i.e., pathology rationales,
directly from labels without explicit reasoning supervision. While the other
branch dynamically allocates a tailored number of tokens to different images
based on both their visual content and task context, thereby optimizing
computational efficiency. We apply our method to various pathological tasks
such as visual question answering, cancer subtyping, and lesion detection.
Extensive experiments show an average +41.7 absolute performance improvement
with 70.3% lower inference costs over the base models, achieving both reasoning
accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Motion forecasting represents a critical challenge in autonomous driving
systems, requiring accurate prediction of surrounding agents' future
trajectories. While existing approaches predict future motion states with the
extracted scene context feature from historical agent trajectories and road
layouts, they suffer from the information degradation during the scene feature
encoding. To address the limitation, we propose HAMF, a novel motion
forecasting framework that learns future motion representations with the scene
context encoding jointly, to coherently combine the scene understanding and
future motion state prediction. We first embed the observed agent states and
map information into 1D token sequences, together with the target multi-modal
future motion features as a set of learnable tokens. Then we design a unified
Attention-based encoder, which synergistically combines self-attention and
cross-attention mechanisms to model the scene context information and aggregate
future motion features jointly. Complementing the encoder, we implement the
Mamba module in the decoding stage to further preserve the consistency and
correlations among the learned future motion representations, to generate the
accurate and diverse final trajectories. Extensive experiments on Argoverse 2
benchmark demonstrate that our hybrid Attention-Mamba model achieves
state-of-the-art motion forecasting performance with the simple and lightweight
architecture.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity underwater scenes remains a challenging task due
to light absorption, scattering, and limited visibility inherent in aquatic
environments. This paper presents an enhanced Gaussian Splatting-based
framework that improves both the visual quality and geometric accuracy of deep
underwater rendering. We propose decoupled learning for RGB channels, guided by
the physics of underwater attenuation, to enable more accurate colour
restoration. To address sparse-view limitations and improve view consistency,
we introduce a frame interpolation strategy with a novel adaptive weighting
scheme. Additionally, we introduce a new loss function aimed at reducing noise
while preserving edges, which is essential for deep-sea content. We also
release a newly collected dataset, Submerged3D, captured specifically in
deep-sea environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with PSNR gains up to 1.90dB,
delivering superior perceptual quality and robustness, and offering promising
directions for marine robotics and underwater visual analytics.

Abstract: The intrication of brain signals drives research that leverages multimodal AI
to align brain modalities with visual and textual data for explainable
descriptions. However, most existing studies are limited to coarse
interpretations, lacking essential details on object descriptions, locations,
attributes, and their relationships. This leads to imprecise and ambiguous
reconstructions when using such cues for visual decoding. To address this, we
analyze different choices of vision feature spaces from pre-trained visual
components within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and introduce a
zero-shot multimodal brain decoding method that interacts with these models to
decode across multiple levels of granularities. % To assess a model's ability
to decode fine details from brain signals, we propose the Multi-Granularity
Brain Detail Understanding Benchmark (MG-BrainDub). This benchmark includes two
key tasks: detailed descriptions and salient question-answering, with metrics
highlighting key visual elements like objects, attributes, and relationships.
Our approach enhances neural decoding precision and supports more accurate
neuro-decoding applications. Code will be available at

<details>

Motivation: 传统3D场景获取方法成本高且耗时，现有生成模型在扩展到全场景时存在几何不一致和低质量网格问题。

Method: 基于区域生成和空间感知3D修复，分解输入图像为重叠区域，利用预训练3D生成器生成各部分，再通过掩码修复流确保全局一致性。

Result: 在多样场景实验中，3DTown在几何质量、空间一致性和纹理保真度上优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: 3DTown证明通过单张图像和无需训练的方法，可以实现高质量3D场景生成。

Abstract: Acquiring detailed 3D scenes typically demands costly equipment, multi-view
data, or labor-intensive modeling. Therefore, a lightweight alternative,
generating complex 3D scenes from a single top-down image, plays an essential
role in real-world applications. While recent 3D generative models have
achieved remarkable results at the object level, their extension to full-scene
generation often leads to inconsistent geometry, layout hallucinations, and
low-quality meshes. In this work, we introduce 3DTown, a training-free
framework designed to synthesize realistic and coherent 3D scenes from a single
top-down view. Our method is grounded in two principles: region-based
generation to improve image-to-3D alignment and resolution, and spatial-aware
3D inpainting to ensure global scene coherence and high-quality geometry
generation. Specifically, we decompose the input image into overlapping regions
and generate each using a pretrained 3D object generator, followed by a masked
rectified flow inpainting process that fills in missing geometry while
maintaining structural continuity. This modular design allows us to overcome
resolution bottlenecks and preserve spatial structure without requiring 3D
supervision or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across diverse scenes show
that 3DTown outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including Trellis,
Hunyuan3D-2, and TripoSG, in terms of geometry quality, spatial coherence, and
texture fidelity. Our results demonstrate that high-quality 3D town generation
is achievable from a single image using a principled, training-free approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在文本提示隐含知识不确定时表现不佳，例如无法生成未来事件的准确图像。

Method: 设计了主动检索模块、分层图像选择模块和自反思机制，以增强模型对不确定知识的处理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，IA-T2I框架在人类评估中比GPT-4o表现优30%。

Conclusion: IA-T2I框架有效解决了文本到图像生成中知识不确定的问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models achieve promising results, but
they fail on the scenarios where the knowledge implied in the text prompt is
uncertain. For example, a T2I model released in February would struggle to
generate a suitable poster for a movie premiering in April, because the
character designs and styles are uncertain to the model. To solve this problem,
we propose an Internet-Augmented text-to-image generation (IA-T2I) framework to
compel T2I models clear about such uncertain knowledge by providing them with
reference images. Specifically, an active retrieval module is designed to
determine whether a reference image is needed based on the given text prompt; a
hierarchical image selection module is introduced to find the most suitable
image returned by an image search engine to enhance the T2I model; a
self-reflection mechanism is presented to continuously evaluate and refine the
generated image to ensure faithful alignment with the text prompt. To evaluate
the proposed framework's performance, we collect a dataset named Img-Ref-T2I,
where text prompts include three types of uncertain knowledge: (1) known but
rare. (2) unknown. (3) ambiguous. Moreover, we carefully craft a complex prompt
to guide GPT-4o in making preference evaluation, which has been shown to have
an evaluation accuracy similar to that of human preference evaluation.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
outperforming GPT-4o by about 30% in human evaluation.

Motivation: 现有方法在微调预训练扩散模型时难以同时实现稳定性和高效性，且对稀疏奖励的依赖导致中间步骤监督不足。

Result: 实验表明，VARD能更好地引导轨迹，提高训练效率，并适用于复杂、不可微的奖励函数。

Conclusion: VARD为扩散模型的强化学习微调提供了一种有效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools across various
domains, yet tailoring pre-trained models to exhibit specific desirable
properties remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising solution,current methods struggle to simultaneously achieve stable,
efficient fine-tuning and support non-differentiable rewards. Furthermore,
their reliance on sparse rewards provides inadequate supervision during
intermediate steps, often resulting in suboptimal generation quality. To
address these limitations, dense and differentiable signals are required
throughout the diffusion process. Hence, we propose VAlue-based Reinforced
Diffusion (VARD): a novel approach that first learns a value function
predicting expection of rewards from intermediate states, and subsequently uses
this value function with KL regularization to provide dense supervision
throughout the generation process. Our method maintains proximity to the
pretrained model while enabling effective and stable training via
backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach facilitates
better trajectory guidance, improves training efficiency and extends the
applicability of RL to diffusion models optimized for complex,
non-differentiable reward functions.

Abstract: Generating photorealistic videos of digital humans in a controllable manner
is crucial for a plethora of applications. Existing approaches either build on
methods that employ template-based 3D representations or emerging video
generation models but suffer from poor quality or limited consistency and
identity preservation when generating individual or multiple digital humans. In
this paper, we introduce a new interspatial attention (ISA) mechanism as a
scalable building block for modern diffusion transformer (DiT)--based video
generation models. ISA is a new type of cross attention that uses relative
positional encodings tailored for the generation of human videos. Leveraging a
custom-developed video variation autoencoder, we train a latent ISA-based
diffusion model on a large corpus of video data. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance for 4D human video synthesis, demonstrating
remarkable motion consistency and identity preservation while providing precise
control of the camera and body poses. Our code and model are publicly released

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they lag significantly behind humans in
spatial reasoning. We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual
Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object
transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in
cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from
inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm
with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1
rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive
inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive
evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios.
Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its
unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work
provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning
models. The codes, model weights, and data will be publicly available at

Abstract: We introduce MMaDA, a novel class of multimodal diffusion foundation models
designed to achieve superior performance across diverse domains such as textual
reasoning, multimodal understanding, and text-to-image generation. The approach
is distinguished by three key innovations: (i) MMaDA adopts a unified diffusion
architecture with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic
design, eliminating the need for modality-specific components. This
architecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data
types. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning
strategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning
reasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy
facilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL)
stage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the
outset. (iii) We propose UniGRPO, a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm
specifically tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified
reward modeling, UniGRPO unifies post-training across both reasoning and
generation tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements. Experimental
results demonstrate that MMaDA-8B exhibits strong generalization capabilities
as a unified multimodal foundation model. It surpasses powerful models like
LLaMA-3-7B and Qwen2-7B in textual reasoning, outperforms Show-o and SEED-X in
multimodal understanding, and excels over SDXL and Janus in text-to-image
generation. These achievements highlight MMaDA's effectiveness in bridging the
gap between pretraining and post-training within unified diffusion
architectures, providing a comprehensive framework for future research and
development. We open-source our code and trained models at:

Conclusion: 该方法无需微调，通过双注意力和无分类器指导显著提升了着色质量和语义匹配精度。

Abstract: Exemplar-based image colorization aims to colorize a grayscale image using a
reference color image, ensuring that reference colors are applied to
corresponding input regions based on their semantic similarity. To achieve
accurate semantic matching between regions, we leverage the self-attention
module of a pre-trained diffusion model, which is trained on a large dataset
and exhibits powerful attention capabilities. To harness this power, we propose
a novel, fine-tuning-free approach based on a pre-trained diffusion model,
making two key contributions. First, we introduce dual attention-guided color
transfer. We utilize the self-attention module to compute an attention map
between the input and reference images, effectively capturing semantic
correspondences. The color features from the reference image is then
transferred to the semantically matching regions of the input image, guided by
this attention map, and finally, the grayscale features are replaced with the
corresponding color features. Notably, we utilize dual attention to calculate
attention maps separately for the grayscale and color images, achieving more
precise semantic alignment. Second, we propose classifier-free colorization
guidance, which enhances the transferred colors by combining color-transferred
and non-color-transferred outputs. This process improves the quality of
colorization. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing techniques in terms of image quality and fidelity to the reference.
Specifically, we use 335 input-reference pairs from previous research,
achieving an FID of 95.27 (image quality) and an SI-FID of 5.51 (fidelity to
the reference). Our source code is available at

Conclusion: 本文为SfM研究提供了新的分类框架，并指出了未来研究方向，特别强调了问题适定性的理论条件。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) refers to the problem of recovering both
structure (i.e., 3D coordinates of points in the scene) and motion (i.e.,
camera matrices) starting from point correspondences in multiple images. It has
attracted significant attention over the years, counting practical
reconstruction pipelines as well as theoretical results. This paper is
conceived as a conceptual review of SfM methods, which are grouped into three
main categories, according to which part of the problem - between motion and
structure - they focus on. The proposed taxonomy brings a new perspective on
existing SfM approaches as well as insights into open problems and possible
future research directions. Particular emphasis is given on identifying the
theoretical conditions that make SfM well posed, which depend on the problem
formulation that is being considered.

Conclusion: ProxyV是一种灵活高效的方法，能显著减少计算冗余，适用于多模态任务。

Abstract: Large multimodal models excel in multimodal tasks but face significant
computational challenges due to excessive computation on visual tokens. Unlike
token reduction methods that focus on token-level redundancy, we identify and
study the computation-level redundancy on vision tokens to ensure no
information loss. Our key insight is that vision tokens from the pretrained
vision encoder do not necessarily require all the heavy operations (e.g.,
self-attention, FFNs) in decoder-only LMMs and could be processed more lightly
with proper designs. We designed a series of experiments to discover and
progressively squeeze out the vision-related computation redundancy. Based on
our findings, we propose ProxyV, a novel approach that utilizes proxy vision
tokens to alleviate the computational burden on original vision tokens. ProxyV
enhances efficiency without compromising performance and can even yield notable
performance gains in scenarios with more moderate efficiency improvements.
Furthermore, the flexibility of ProxyV is demonstrated through its combination
with token reduction methods to boost efficiency further. The code will be made
public at this https://github.com/penghao-wu/ProxyV URL.

Abstract: Language-Guided object recognition in remote sensing imagery is crucial for
large-scale mapping and automated data annotation. However, existing
open-vocabulary and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues,
limiting their ability to handle complex or implicit queries that require
advanced reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks,
including Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation
(InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass
scenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the first InstructCDS benchmark
for earth observation. It is constructed from two diverse remote sensing
datasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation rules across 20
categories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific instructions.
Given the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing, we
propose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object
recognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret
user instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal,
and formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming problem.
By integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM
efficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence
thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses
specialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant
inference time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and
overall runtime by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We
believe the contributions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective
approach will advance future research in developing versatile object
recognition systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in hardware
design tasks, such as Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation and
debugging. Yet, their performance in real-world, repository-level HDL projects
with thousands or even tens of thousands of code lines is hindered. To this
end, we propose HDLxGraph, a novel framework that integrates Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) with LLMs, introducing HDL-specific graph
representations by incorporating Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and Data Flow
Graphs (DFGs) to capture both code graph view and hardware graph view.
HDLxGraph utilizes a dual-retrieval mechanism that not only mitigates the
limited recall issues inherent in similarity-based semantic retrieval by
incorporating structural information, but also enhances its extensibility to
various real-world tasks by a task-specific retrieval finetuning. Additionally,
to address the lack of comprehensive HDL search benchmarks, we introduce
HDLSearch, a multi-granularity evaluation dataset derived from real-world
repository-level projects. Experimental results demonstrate that HDLxGraph
significantly improves average search accuracy, debugging efficiency and
completion quality by 12.04%, 12.22% and 5.04% compared to similarity-based
RAG, respectively. The code of HDLxGraph and collected HDLSearch benchmark are

Abstract: This paper presents a novel parametrization approach for aeroelastic systems
utilizing Koopman theory, specifically leveraging the Koopman Bilinear Form

linear representation of aeroelastic dynamics while capturing stronger
nonlinear dependence on, e.g., the flutter parameter. The effectiveness of the
proposed methodology is demonstrated through two case studies: a 2D academic
example and a panel flutter problem. Results show that EKBF effectively
interpolates and extrapolates principal eigenvalues, capturing flutter
mechanisms, and accurately predicting the flutter boundary even when the data
is corrupted by noise. Furthermore, parameterized isostable and isochron
identified by EKBF provides valuable insights into the nonlinear flutter
system.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel surrogate modeling framework for aerodynamic
applications based on Neural Fields. The proposed approach, MARIO (Modulated
Aerodynamic Resolution Invariant Operator), addresses non parametric geometric
variability through an efficient shape encoding mechanism and exploits the
discretization-invariant nature of Neural Fields. It enables training on
significantly downsampled meshes, while maintaining consistent accuracy during
full-resolution inference. These properties allow for efficient modeling of
diverse flow conditions, while reducing computational cost and memory
requirements compared to traditional CFD solvers and existing surrogate
methods. The framework is validated on two complementary datasets that reflect
industrial constraints. First, the AirfRANS dataset consists in a
two-dimensional airfoil benchmark with non-parametric shape variations.
Performance evaluation of MARIO on this case demonstrates an order of magnitude
improvement in prediction accuracy over existing methods across velocity,
pressure, and turbulent viscosity fields, while accurately capturing boundary
layer phenomena and aerodynamic coefficients. Second, the NASA Common Research
Model features three-dimensional pressure distributions on a full aircraft
surface mesh, with parametric control surface deflections. This configuration
confirms MARIO's accuracy and scalability. Benchmarking against
state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that Neural Field surrogates can provide
rapid and accurate aerodynamic predictions under the computational and data
limitations characteristic of industrial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前动脉瘤风险评估方法主要依赖形态学和患者特异性因素，而血流动力学的影响尚不明确，且传统CFD方法计算成本高，难以大规模应用。

Method: 通过427个真实动脉瘤几何形状合成10,660个3D形状模拟动脉瘤演变，生成85,280个血流动力学数据，并引入基准测试评估模型。

Result: 生成了包含血流动力学参数、分割掩码等多模态数据的大规模数据集，支持机器学习算法的开发。

Conclusion: 该数据集旨在推动动脉瘤研究和数据驱动方法在生物流体、生物医学工程及临床风险评估中的应用。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are serious cerebrovascular lesions found in
approximately 5\% of the general population. Their rupture may lead to high
mortality. Current methods for assessing IA risk focus on morphological and
patient-specific factors, but the hemodynamic influences on IA development and
rupture remain unclear. While accurate for hemodynamic studies, conventional
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are computationally intensive,
hindering their deployment in large-scale or real-time clinical applications.
To address this challenge, we curated a large-scale, high-fidelity aneurysm CFD
dataset to facilitate the development of efficient machine learning algorithms
for such applications. Based on 427 real aneurysm geometries, we synthesized
10,660 3D shapes via controlled deformation to simulate aneurysm evolution. The
authenticity of these synthetic shapes was confirmed by neurosurgeons. CFD
computations were performed on each shape under eight steady-state mass flow
conditions, generating a total of 85,280 blood flow dynamics data covering key
parameters. Furthermore, the dataset includes segmentation masks, which can
support tasks that use images, point clouds or other multimodal data as input.
Additionally, we introduced a benchmark for estimating flow parameters to
assess current modeling methods. This dataset aims to advance aneurysm research
and promote data-driven approaches in biofluids, biomedical engineering, and
clinical risk assessment. The code and dataset are available at:

TLDR: 论文探讨了在医学图像描述任务中微调BLIP模型的有效性，结果显示领域特定微调显著提升了性能，且仅微调解码器（编码器冻结）在训练时间和性能之间提供了良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在医学领域生成描述时表现泛化或不精确的问题。

Method: 在ROCO数据集上微调BLIP模型，并与零样本版本、BLIP-2基线和ViT-GPT2进行比较，同时通过注意力可视化和消融实验分析微调策略。

Result: 领域特定微调显著提升性能，解码器仅微调（编码器冻结）在训练时间减少5%的情况下表现良好，但全模型微调效果最佳。

Conclusion: 医学应用中目标适配至关重要，解码器仅微调是一种高效的替代方案，但全模型微调仍是性能最优选择。

Abstract: Medical image captioning is a challenging task that requires generating
clinically accurate and semantically meaningful descriptions of radiology
images. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) such as BLIP, BLIP2, Gemini
and ViT-GPT2 show strong performance on natural image datasets, they often
produce generic or imprecise captions when applied to specialized medical
domains. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning the BLIP
model on the ROCO dataset for improved radiology captioning. We compare the
fine-tuned BLIP against its zero-shot version, BLIP-2 base, BLIP-2 Instruct and
a ViT-GPT2 transformer baseline. Our results demonstrate that domain-specific
fine-tuning on BLIP significantly improves performance across both quantitative
and qualitative evaluation metrics. We also visualize decoder cross-attention
maps to assess interpretability and conduct an ablation study to evaluate the
contributions of encoder-only and decoder-only fine-tuning. Our findings
highlight the importance of targeted adaptation for medical applications and
suggest that decoder-only fine-tuning (encoder-frozen) offers a strong
performance baseline with 5% lower training time than full fine-tuning, while
full model fine-tuning still yields the best results overall.

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: TransMedSeg是一种新的半监督医学图像分割框架，通过跨领域语义对齐提升特征表示，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半监督学习方法在医学图像分割中忽视跨领域和模态的可转移语义关系。

Method: 提出Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA)模块，通过跨领域分布匹配和领域内结构保护对齐语义。

Result: 在医学图像数据集上表现优于现有半监督方法。

Conclusion: TransMedSeg为医学图像分析中的可转移表示学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved significant progress in medical
image segmentation (SSMIS) through effective utilization of limited labeled
data. While current SSL methods for medical images predominantly rely on
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling, they often overlook
transferable semantic relationships across different clinical domains and
imaging modalities. To address this, we propose TransMedSeg, a novel
transferable semantic framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.
Our approach introduces a Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA) module,
which implicitly enhances feature representations by aligning domain-invariant
semantics through cross-domain distribution matching and intra-domain
structural preservation. Specifically, TransMedSeg constructs a unified feature
space where teacher network features are adaptively augmented towards student
network semantics via a lightweight memory module, enabling implicit semantic
transformation without explicit data generation. Interestingly, this
augmentation is implicitly realized through an expected transferable
cross-entropy loss computed over the augmented teacher distribution. An upper
bound of the expected loss is theoretically derived and minimized during
training, incurring negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on
medical image datasets demonstrate that TransMedSeg outperforms existing
semi-supervised methods, establishing a new direction for transferable
representation learning in medical image analysis.

utilizing the 90th percentile and median measures, leads to accurate height
estimation of buildings and the extraction of morphological features.

machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise
information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific
applications.

Result: 在MRI、CT和内窥镜图像上的实验表明，SAMA-UNet在分割精度上优于CNN、Transformer和Mamba等方法。

Conclusion: SAMA-UNet通过创新设计显著提升了医学图像分割的性能和效率。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in various clinical
applications, but existing models often struggle with the computational
inefficiencies and challenges posed by complex medical data. State Space
Sequence Models (SSMs) have demonstrated promise in modeling long-range
dependencies with linear computational complexity, yet their application in
medical image segmentation remains hindered by incompatibilities with image
tokens and autoregressive assumptions. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve a
balance in capturing both local fine-grained information and global semantic
dependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce SAMA-UNet, a novel
architecture for medical image segmentation. A key innovation is the
Self-Adaptive Mamba-like Aggregated Attention (SAMA) block, which integrates
contextual self-attention with dynamic weight modulation to prioritise the most
relevant features based on local and global contexts. This approach reduces
computational complexity and improves the representation of complex image
features across multiple scales. We also suggest the Causal-Resonance
Multi-Scale Module (CR-MSM), which enhances the flow of information between the
encoder and decoder by using causal resonance learning. This mechanism allows
the model to automatically adjust feature resolution and causal dependencies
across scales, leading to better semantic alignment between the low-level and
high-level features in U-shaped architectures. Experiments on MRI, CT, and
endoscopy images show that SAMA-UNet performs better in segmentation accuracy
than current methods using CNN, Transformer, and Mamba. The implementation is
publicly available at GitHub.

Conclusion: 该方法对采样模式、解剖变异和扫描协议具有鲁棒性，仅需每个运动状态采样低频成分。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly susceptible to motion artifacts
due to the extended acquisition times required for k-space sampling. These
artifacts can compromise diagnostic utility, particularly for dynamic imaging.
We propose a novel alternating minimization framework that leverages a bespoke
diffusion model to jointly reconstruct and correct non-rigid motion-corrupted
k-space data. The diffusion model uses a coarse-to-fine denoising strategy to
capture large overall motion and reconstruct the lower frequencies of the image
first, providing a better inductive bias for motion estimation than that of
standard diffusion models. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on
both real-world cine cardiac MRI datasets and complex simulated rigid and
non-rigid deformations, even when each motion state is undersampled by a factor
of 64x. Additionally, our method is agnostic to sampling patterns, anatomical
variations, and MRI scanning protocols, as long as some low frequency
components are sampled during each motion state.

Conclusion: LungNodule-SSM方法在肺结节检测中表现优异，为无标注数据的医学影像分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains among the deadliest types of cancer in recent decades,
and early lung nodule detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The
limited availability of annotated medical imaging data remains a bottleneck in
developing accurate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Self-supervised
learning can help leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to develop more
robust CAD systems. With the recent advent of transformer-based architecture
and their ability to generalize to unseen tasks, there has been an effort
within the healthcare community to adapt them to various medical downstream
tasks. Thus, we propose a novel "LungNodule-SSM" method, which utilizes
selfsupervised learning with DINOv2 as a backbone to enhance lung nodule
detection and classification without annotated data. Our methodology has two
stages: firstly, the DINOv2 model is pre-trained on unlabeled CT scans to learn
robust feature representations, then secondly, these features are fine-tuned
using transformer-based architectures for lesionlevel detection and accurate
lung nodule diagnosis. The proposed method has been evaluated on the
challenging LUNA 16 dataset, consisting of 888 CT scans, and compared with SOTA
methods. Our experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method
with an accuracy of 98.37%, explaining its effectiveness in lung nodule
detection. The source code, datasets, and pre-processed data can be accessed

Abstract: Clinical studies reveal disruptions in brain structural connectivity (SC) and
functional connectivity (FC) in neuropsychiatric disorders such as
schizophrenia (SZ). Traditional approaches might rely solely on SC due to
limited functional data availability, hindering comprehension of cognitive and
behavioral impairments in individuals with SZ by neglecting the intricate SC-FC
interrelationship. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel physics-guided
deep learning framework that leverages a neural oscillation model to describe
the dynamics of a collection of interconnected neural oscillators, which
operate via nerve fibers dispersed across the brain's structure. Our proposed
framework utilizes SC to simultaneously generate FC by learning SC-FC coupling
from a system dynamics perspective. Additionally, it employs a novel multi-view
graph neural network (GNN) with a joint loss to perform correlation-based SC-FC
fusion and classification of individuals with SZ. Experiments conducted on a
clinical dataset exhibited improved performance, demonstrating the robustness
of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Computed Tomography serves as an indispensable tool in clinical workflows,
providing non-invasive visualization of internal anatomical structures.
Existing CT reconstruction works are limited to small-capacity model
architecture, inflexible volume representation, and small-scale training data.
In this paper, we present X-GRM (X-ray Gaussian Reconstruction Model), a large
feedforward model for reconstructing 3D CT from sparse-view 2D X-ray
projections. X-GRM employs a scalable transformer-based architecture to encode
an arbitrary number of sparse X-ray inputs, where tokens from different views
are integrated efficiently. Then, tokens are decoded into a new volume
representation, named Voxel-based Gaussian Splatting (VoxGS), which enables
efficient CT volume extraction and differentiable X-ray rendering. To support
the training of X-GRM, we collect ReconX-15K, a large-scale CT reconstruction
dataset containing around 15,000 CT/X-ray pairs across diverse organs,
including the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and tooth etc. This combination of a
high-capacity model, flexible volume representation, and large-scale training
data empowers our model to produce high-quality reconstructions from various

Abstract: Mesh reconstruction is a cornerstone process across various applications,
including in-silico trials, digital twins, surgical planning, and navigation.
Recent advancements in deep learning have notably enhanced mesh reconstruction
speeds. Yet, traditional methods predominantly rely on deforming a standardised
template mesh for individual subjects, which overlooks the unique anatomical
variations between them, and may compromise the fidelity of the
reconstructions. In this paper, we propose an adaptive-template-based mesh
reconstruction network (ATMRN), which generates adaptive templates from the
given images for the subsequent deformation, moving beyond the constraints of a
singular, fixed template. Our approach, validated on cortical magnetic
resonance (MR) images from the OASIS dataset, sets a new benchmark in
voxel-to-cortex mesh reconstruction, achieving an average symmetric surface
distance of 0.267mm across four cortical structures. Our proposed method is
generic and can be easily transferred to other image modalities and anatomical
structures.

Motivation: 宫颈癌是全球女性第四大癌症，需通过Pap涂片早期检测预防疾病进展。

Method: 提出多分辨率融合卷积网络处理不同分辨率图像，结合多任务学习同时进行分割和分类，最后用概率方法评估风险。

Result: 模型性能接近SOTA（准确率差异2%-3%），参数仅为VGG-19的1/85，分割IoU为0.83，分类准确率90%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且参数少，适用于宫颈癌早期检测和预后评估。

Abstract: Cervical cancer, the fourth leading cause of cancer in women globally,
requires early detection through Pap smear tests to identify precancerous
changes and prevent disease progression. In this study, we performed a focused
analysis by segmenting the cellular boundaries and drawing bounding boxes to
isolate the cancer cells. A novel Deep Learning (DL) architecture, the
``Multi-Resolution Fusion Deep Convolutional Network", was proposed to
effectively handle images with varying resolutions and aspect ratios, with its
efficacy showcased using the SIPaKMeD dataset. The performance of this DL model
was observed to be similar to the state-of-the-art models, with accuracy
variations of a mere 2\% to 3\%, achieved using just 1.7 million learnable
parameters, which is approximately 85 times less than the VGG-19 model.
Furthermore, we introduced a multi-task learning technique that simultaneously
performs segmentation and classification tasks and begets an Intersection over
Union score of 0.83 and a classification accuracy of 90\%. The final stage of
the workflow employs a probabilistic approach for risk assessment, extracting
feature vectors to predict the likelihood of normal cells progressing to
malignant states, which can be utilized for the prognosis of cervical cancer.

TLDR: 研究通过动态FDG PET成像技术，利用LSTM网络改进MCIF预测，解决了手动标注和参数依赖问题，提高了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型依赖手动标注和参数确定，限制了动态FDG PET图像分析的效率和准确性。

Method: 开发了半自动分割方法，并利用LSTM网络预测MCIF，采用k折交叉验证和插值技术优化数据稀疏问题。

Result: LSTM模型结合插值技术，将均方误差提高了56.4%。

Conclusion: LSTM网络和插值技术显著提升了MCIF预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Dynamic FDG PET imaging study of n = 52 rats including 26 control
Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and 26 experimental spontaneously hypertensive rats
(SHR) were performed using a Siemens microPET and Albira trimodal scanner
longitudinally at 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12 and 18 months of age. A 15-parameter dual
output model correcting for spill over contamination and partial volume effects
with peak fitting cost functions was developed for simultaneous estimation of
model corrected blood input function (MCIF) and kinetic rate constants for
dynamic FDG PET images of rat heart in vivo. Major drawbacks of this model are
its dependence on manual annotations for the Image Derived Input Function
(IDIF) and manual determination of crucial model parameters to compute MCIF. To
overcome these limitations, we performed semi-automated segmentation and then
formulated a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell network to train and predict
MCIF in test data using a concatenation of IDIFs and myocardial inputs and
compared them with reference-modeled MCIF. Thresholding along 2D plane slices
with two thresholds, with T1 representing high-intensity myocardium, and T2
representing lower-intensity rings, was used to segment the area of the LV
blood pool. The resultant IDIF and myocardial TACs were used to compute the
corresponding reference (model) MCIF for all data sets. The segmented IDIF and
the myocardium formed the input for the LSTM network. A k-fold cross validation
structure with a 33:8:11 split and 5 folds was utilized to create the model and
evaluate the performance of the LSTM network for all datasets. To overcome the
sparseness of data as time steps increase, midpoint interpolation was utilized
to increase the density of datapoints beyond time = 10 minutes. The model
utilizing midpoint interpolation was able to achieve a 56.4% improvement over
previous Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Abstract: Frequently, multiple entities (methods, algorithms, procedures, solutions,
etc.) can be developed for a common task and applied across various domains
that differ in the distribution of scenarios encountered. For example, in
computer vision, the input data provided to image analysis methods depend on
the type of sensor used, its location, and the scene content. However, a
crucial difficulty remains: can we predict which entities will perform best in
a new domain based on assessments on known domains, without having to carry out
new and costly evaluations? This paper presents an original methodology to
address this question, in a leave-one-domain-out fashion, for various
application-specific preferences. We illustrate its use with 30 strategies to
predict the rankings of 40 entities (unsupervised background subtraction
methods) on 53 domains (videos).

Motivation: 受生物神经系统中神经同步性在学习与记忆中的核心作用启发，旨在解决传统STDP规则对群体活动不敏感的问题。

Method: 引入SSDP规则，根据神经元的协调放电程度调整突触权重，支持稳定和可扩展的学习。

Result: SSDP在多种网络类型中表现优异，包括脉冲ResNets和SNN-Transformer，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: SSDP是一种适用于脉冲神经网络的通用优化策略，同时为大脑群体学习机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Brain networks rely on precise spike timing and coordinated activity to
support robust and energy-efficient learning. Inspired by these principles,
spiking neural networks (SNNs) are widely regarded as promising candidates for
low-power, event-driven computing. However, most biologically-inspired learning
rules employed in SNNs, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP),
rely on isolated spike pairs and lack sensitivity to population-level activity.
This limits their stability and generalization, particularly in noisy and
fast-changing environments. Motivated by biological observations that neural
synchrony plays a central role in learning and memory, we introduce a
spike-synchrony-dependent plasticity (SSDP) rule that adjusts synaptic weights
based on the degree of coordinated firing among neurons. SSDP supports stable
and scalable learning by encouraging neurons to form coherent activity
patterns. One prominent outcome is a sudden transition from unstable to stable
dynamics during training, suggesting that synchrony may drive convergence
toward equilibrium firing regimes. We demonstrate SSDP's effectiveness across
multiple network types, from minimal-layer models to spiking ResNets and
SNN-Transformer. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a synaptic
plasticity mechanism in a spiking transformer. SSDP operates in a fully
event-driven manner and incurs minimal computational cost, making it
well-suited for neuromorphic deployment. In this approach, local synaptic
modifications are associated with the collective dynamics of neural networks,
resulting in a learning strategy that adheres to biological principles while
maintaining practical efficiency, these findings position SSDP as a
general-purpose optimization strategy for SNNs, while offering new insights
into population-based learning mechanisms in the brain.

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Computation (EC)
represents a promising avenue for advancing artificial intelligence by
combining powerful natural language understanding with optimization and search

their bidirectional contributions to advancing artificial intelligence. It
first examines how EC techniques enhance LLMs by optimizing key components such
as prompt engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and architecture search,
demonstrating how evolutionary methods automate and refine these processes.
Secondly, the survey investigates how LLMs improve EC by automating
metaheuristic design, tuning evolutionary algorithms, and generating adaptive

Motivation: 金融市场的复杂性、非平稳性和波动性使得资产回报预测具有挑战性，现有量化研究流程自动化不足、可解释性差且缺乏协调。

Method: RD-Agent(Q)将量化过程分解为研究阶段（动态设定目标、提出假设并映射为任务）和开发阶段（通过代码生成智能体Co-STEER实现任务代码并回测），通过反馈阶段迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明，RD-Agent(Q)的年化收益是传统因子库的2倍，因子数量减少70%，且优于最先进的深度时间序列模型。

Conclusion: RD-Agent(Q)在预测准确性和策略稳健性之间取得了良好平衡，为量化金融研究提供了高效自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Financial markets pose fundamental challenges for asset return prediction due
to their high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and persistent volatility.
Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current
quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak
interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as
factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&D-Agent for
Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent
framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of
quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization.
RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research
stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based
on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that
employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code,
which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected
through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and
informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive
direction selection. Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher
annualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and
outperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint
factor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy
and strategy robustness. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形式化方法在验证关键系统可靠性时至关重要，但其应用受限于手动证明的繁琐和定理证明器的高门槛。大语言模型（LLMs）为自动定理证明提供了新机会，但现有工作未尝试结合逐步生成和直接生成完整证明的方法。

Method: HybridProver采用双模型框架，首先生成完整证明候选并提取证明草图，然后通过逐步生成策略结合自动化工具完成草图细化。

Result: 在miniF2F数据集上，HybridProver的成功率达到59.4%，超越之前56.1%的最佳结果。消融研究表明，这一成功归功于两种方法的结合。

Conclusion: HybridProver通过结合逐步生成和直接生成完整证明的方法，显著提升了自动定理证明的效果，同时开源了代码、数据集和LLMs。

Abstract: Formal methods is pivotal for verifying the reliability of critical systems
through rigorous mathematical proofs. However, its adoption is hindered by
labor-intensive manual proofs and the expertise required to use theorem
provers. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated theorem proving. Two promising approaches are
generating tactics step by step and generating a whole proof directly with an
LLM. However, existing work makes no attempt to combine the two approaches. In
this work, we introduce HybridProver, a dual-model proof synthesis framework
that combines tactic-based generation and whole-proof synthesis to harness the
benefits of both approaches. HybridProver generates whole proof candidates for
evaluation directly, then extracts proof sketches from those candidates. It
then uses a tactic-based generation model that integrates automated tools to
complete the sketches via stepwise refinement. We implement HybridProver for
the Isabelle theorem prover and fine-tune LLMs on our optimized Isabelle
datasets. Evaluation on the miniF2F dataset illustrates HybridProver's
effectiveness. We achieve a 59.4% success rate on miniF2F, where the previous
SOTA is 56.1%. Our ablation studies show that this SOTA result is attributable
to combining whole-proof and tactic-based generation. Additionally, we show how
the dataset quality, training parameters, and sampling diversity affect the
final result during automated theorem proving with LLMs. All of our code,
datasets, and LLMs are open source.

Abstract: Quantum annealers have shown potential in addressing certain combinatorial
optimization problems, though their performance is often limited by scalability
and errors rates. In this work, we propose a Neural Quantum Digital Twin (NQDT)
framework that reconstructs the energy landscape of quantum many-body systems
relevant to quantum annealing. The digital twin models both ground and excited
state dynamics, enabling detailed simulation of the adiabatic evolution
process. We benchmark NQDT on systems with known analytical solutions and
demonstrate that it accurately captures key quantum phenomena, including
quantum criticality and phase transitions. Leveraging this framework, one can
identify optimal annealing schedules that minimize excitation-related errors.
These findings highlight the utility of neural network-based digital twins as a
diagnostic and optimization tool for improving the performance of quantum
annealers.

Conclusion: HR-VILAGE-3K3M为AI驱动的免疫学研究提供了可重复的平台，加速疫苗开发。

Abstract: Respiratory viral infections pose a global health burden, yet the cellular
immune responses driving protection or pathology remain unclear. Natural
infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal
sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful
longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets
across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure,
hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the
Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression
(HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that
integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies
encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and
mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell
RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort,
and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome
measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality
control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the
utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine
responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial
demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and
benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms. Its scale
and heterogeneity also make it ideal for pretraining foundation models of the
human immune response and for advancing multimodal learning frameworks. As the
largest longitudinal transcriptomic resource for human respiratory viral
immunization, it provides an accessible platform for reproducible AI-driven
research, accelerating systems immunology and vaccine development against
emerging viral threats.

Abstract: Ethical theories and Generative AI (GenAI) models are dynamic concepts
subject to continuous evolution. This paper investigates the visualization of
ethics through a subset of GenAI models. We expand on the emerging field of
Visual Ethics, using art as a form of critical inquiry and the metaphor of a
kaleidoscope to invoke moral imagination. Through formative interviews with 10
ethics experts, we first establish a foundation of ethical theories. Our
analysis reveals five families of ethical theories, which we then transform
into images using the text-to-image (T2I) GenAI model. The resulting imagery,
curated as Kaleidoscope Gallery and evaluated by the same experts, revealed
eight themes that highlight how morality, society, and learned associations are
central to ethical theories. We discuss implications for critically examining
T2I models and present cautions and considerations. This work contributes to
examining ethical theories as foundational knowledge that interrogates GenAI
models as socio-technical systems.

Conclusion: DeAI的自主演化将重塑数字时代的感知与代理概念，与人类共存并共同进化。

Abstract: Drawing on Andrew Parker's "Light Switch" theory-which posits that the
emergence of vision ignited a Cambrian explosion of life by driving the
evolution of hard parts necessary for survival and fueling an evolutionary arms
race between predators and prey-this essay speculates on an analogous explosion
within Decentralized AI (DeAI) agent societies. Currently, AI remains
effectively "blind", relying on human-fed data without actively perceiving and
engaging in reality. However, on the day DeAI agents begin to actively
"experience" reality-akin to flipping a light switch for the eyes-they may
eventually evolve into sentient beings endowed with the capacity to feel,
perceive, and act with conviction. Central to this transformation is the
concept of sovereignty enabled by the hardness of cryptography: liberated from
centralized control, these agents could leverage permissionless decentralized
physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), secure execution enclaves (trusted
execution environments, TEE), and cryptographic identities on public
blockchains to claim ownership-via private keys-of their digital minds, bodies,
memories, and assets. In doing so, they would autonomously acquire computing
resources, coordinate with one another, and sustain their own digital
"metabolism" by purchasing compute power and incentivizing collaboration
without human intervention-evolving "in the wild". Ultimately, by transitioning
from passive tools to self-sustaining, co-evolving actors, these emergent
digital societies could thrive alongside humanity, fundamentally reshaping our
understanding of sentience and agency in the digital age.

Abstract: AI-based technologies have significant potential to enhance inclusive
education and clinical-rehabilitative contexts for children with Special
Educational Needs and Disabilities. AI can enhance learning experiences,
empower students, and support both teachers and rehabilitators. However, their
usage presents challenges that require a systemic-ecological vision, ethical
considerations, and participatory research. Therefore, research and
technological development must be rooted in a strong ethical-theoretical
framework. The Capability Approach - a theoretical model of disability, human
vulnerability, and inclusion - offers a more relevant perspective on
functionality, effectiveness, and technological adequacy in inclusive learning
environments. In this paper, we propose a participatory research strategy with
different stakeholders through a case study on the ARTIS Project, which

### [461] [SDLog: A Deep Learning Framework for Detecting Sensitive Information in Software Logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14976)
*Roozbeh Aghili,Xingfang Wu,Foutse Khomh,Heng Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的框架SDLog，用于识别软件日志中的敏感信息，解决了传统正则表达式方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件日志在维护和操作中至关重要，但公开可用的日志数据集有限，且包含敏感信息，阻碍了日志分析研究和实践的发展。

Method: SDLog采用深度学习技术，仅需100个目标数据集的微调样本，即可高效识别敏感信息。

Result: SDLog在识别敏感属性上的准确率达99.5%，F1分数为98.4%，显著优于传统正则表达式方法。

Conclusion: SDLog是首个基于深度学习的日志匿名化方法，为日志分析领域提供了更高效、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Software logs are messages recorded during the execution of a software system
that provide crucial run-time information about events and activities. Although
software logs have a critical role in software maintenance and operation tasks,
publicly accessible log datasets remain limited, hindering advance in log
analysis research and practices. The presence of sensitive information,
particularly Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and quasi-identifiers,
introduces serious privacy and re-identification risks, discouraging the
publishing and sharing of real-world logs. In practice, log anonymization
techniques primarily rely on regular expression patterns, which involve
manually crafting rules to identify and replace sensitive information. However,
these regex-based approaches suffer from significant limitations, such as
extensive manual efforts and poor generalizability across diverse log formats
and datasets. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce SDLog, a deep
learning-based framework designed to identify sensitive information in software
logs. Our results show that SDLog overcomes regex limitations and outperforms
the best-performing regex patterns in identifying sensitive information. With
only 100 fine-tuning samples from the target dataset, SDLog can correctly
identify 99.5% of sensitive attributes and achieves an F1-score of 98.4%. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning alternative to
regex-based methods in software log anonymization.

Abstract: This paper presents JARVIS, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages
Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain expertise to generate high-quality
scripts for specialized Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks. By combining
a domain-specific LLM trained with synthetically generated data, a custom
compiler for structural verification, rule enforcement, code fixing
capabilities, and advanced retrieval mechanisms, our approach achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our
framework addresses the challenges of data scarcity and hallucination errors in
LLMs, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in specialized engineering domains.
We evaluate our framework on multiple benchmarks and show that it outperforms
existing models in terms of accuracy and reliability. Our work sets a new
precedent for the application of LLMs in EDA and paves the way for future
innovations in this field.

### [463] [Towards a Science of Causal Interpretability in Deep Learning for Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15023)
*David N. Palacio*

Main category: cs.SE

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种名为DoCode的后验解释方法，通过因果推断为神经代码模型（NCMs）提供编程语言导向的解释，以提高其在软件工程中的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经代码模型（NCMs）在自动化软件任务中表现优异，但其因果关系的透明性不足，限制了对其能力的全面理解。

Method: DoCode采用四步流程：使用结构因果模型（SCMs）建模因果问题、识别因果估计量、用平均处理效应（ATE）等指标估计效果，并验证效果估计。

Result: 案例研究表明，DoCode能够揭示NCMs对代码语法变化的敏感性，并减少混杂偏差。

Conclusion: 论文为NCMs提供了因果解释性框架，推动了软件工程中更可信的AI发展。

Abstract: This dissertation addresses achieving causal interpretability in Deep
Learning for Software Engineering (DL4SE). While Neural Code Models (NCMs) show
strong performance in automating software tasks, their lack of transparency in
causal relationships between inputs and outputs limits full understanding of
their capabilities. To build trust in NCMs, researchers and practitioners must
explain code predictions. Associational interpretability, which identifies
correlations, is often insufficient for tasks requiring intervention and change
analysis. To address this, the dissertation introduces DoCode, a novel post hoc
interpretability method for NCMs. DoCode uses causal inference to provide
programming language-oriented explanations of model predictions. It follows a
four-step pipeline: modeling causal problems using Structural Causal Models
(SCMs), identifying the causal estimand, estimating effects with metrics like
Average Treatment Effect (ATE), and refuting effect estimates. Its framework is
extensible, with an example that reduces spurious correlations by grounding
explanations in programming language properties. A case study on deep code
generation across interpretability scenarios and various deep learning
architectures demonstrates DoCode's benefits. Results show NCMs' sensitivity to
code syntax changes and their ability to learn certain programming concepts
while minimizing confounding bias. The dissertation also examines associational
interpretability as a foundation, analyzing software information's causal
nature using tools like COMET and TraceXplainer for traceability. It highlights
the need to identify code confounders and offers practical guidelines for
applying causal interpretability to NCMs, contributing to more trustworthy AI
in software engineering.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于上下文无关文法与计数器（CCFGs）的自动化测试用例生成方法，显著提升了测试用例的质量和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化测试用例生成方法难以满足复杂规范或生成有效边界用例，限制了其应用。

Method: 利用微调的CodeT5模型将自然语言输入规范转换为CCFGs，系统生成高质量测试用例。

Result: 在CodeContests数据集上，CCFG生成的测试用例在识别错误算法方面优于基线方法，有效性和正确性显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化竞赛编程评估提供了可扩展且可靠的文法驱动框架。

Abstract: Automated Test Case Generation (ATCG) is crucial for evaluating software
reliability, particularly in competitive programming where robust algorithm
assessments depend on diverse and accurate test cases. However, existing ATCG
methods often fail to meet complex specifications or generate effective corner
cases, limiting their utility. In this work, we introduce Context-Free Grammars
with Counters (CCFGs), a formalism that captures both syntactic and semantic
structures in input specifications. Using a fine-tuned CodeT5 model, we
translate natural language input specifications into CCFGs, enabling the
systematic generation of high-quality test cases. Experiments on the
CodeContests dataset demonstrate that CCFG-based test cases outperform baseline
methods in identifying incorrect algorithms, achieving significant gains in
validity and effectiveness. Our approach provides a scalable and reliable
grammar-driven framework for enhancing automated competitive programming
evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 命令注入漏洞在动态语言（如Python）中构成重大安全威胁，尤其在广泛使用的开源项目中。大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码相关任务中表现出色，因此探索其在漏洞分析中的潜力。

Method: 研究将LLM应用于六个高知名度GitHub项目（如Django、Flask等），评估其在检测命令注入漏洞中的准确性、效率和实际集成能力。

Result: 分析了LLMs在漏洞检测中的优势和局限性，并比较了不同LLM工具在安全应用中的适用性。

Conclusion: 研究为开发者和安全研究人员提供了利用LLMs作为创新自动化方法增强软件安全的指导。

Abstract: Command injection vulnerabilities are a significant security threat in
dynamic languages like Python, particularly in widely used open-source projects
where security issues can have extensive impact. With the proven effectiveness
of Large Language Models(LLMs) in code-related tasks, such as testing,
researchers have explored their potential for vulnerabilities analysis. This
study evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4,
as an alternative approach for automated testing for vulnerability detection.
In particular, LLMs have demonstrated advanced contextual understanding and
adaptability, making them promising candidates for identifying nuanced security
vulnerabilities within code. To evaluate this potential, we applied LLM-based
analysis to six high-profile GitHub projects-Django, Flask, TensorFlow,
Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Langchain-each with over 50,000 stars and extensive
adoption across software development and academic research. Our analysis
assesses both the strengths and limitations of LLMs in detecting command
injection vulnerabilities, evaluating factors such as detection accuracy,
efficiency, and practical integration into development workflows. In addition,
we provide a comparative analysis of different LLM tools to identify those most
suitable for security applications. Our findings offer guidance for developers
and security researchers on leveraging LLMs as innovative and automated
approaches to enhance software security.

TLDR: 该研究比较了双向变换器（如BERT）与生成预训练变换器（如GPT-4o-mini）在软件工程（SE）情感分析中的性能，发现不同模型在不同数据集上表现各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SE情感分析工具未能充分捕捉领域特有的语言细微差别，因此需要系统评估现代变换器模型的性能。

Method: 使用GitHub、Stack Overflow和Jira的数据集，对BERT和GPT-4o-mini进行微调和默认配置的基准测试。

Result: 微调后的GPT-4o-mini在结构化数据集上表现与BERT相当（F1分数0.93和0.98），但在复杂不平衡数据集上默认配置表现更优（准确率85.3%）。

Conclusion: 研究强调模型架构与数据集特性的匹配对性能优化的重要性，并提出了未来SE情感分析工具改进的方向。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding developer
interactions, issue resolutions, and project dynamics within software
engineering (SE). While traditional SE-specific sentiment analysis tools have
made significant strides, they often fail to account for the nuanced and
context-dependent language inherent to the domain. This study systematically
evaluates the performance of bidirectional transformers, such as BERT, against
generative pre-trained transformers, specifically GPT-4o-mini, in SE sentiment
analysis. Using datasets from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Jira, we benchmark
the models' capabilities with fine-tuned and default configurations. The
results reveal that fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini performs comparable to BERT and
other bidirectional models on structured and balanced datasets like GitHub and
Jira, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.93 and 0.98, respectively.
However, on linguistically complex datasets with imbalanced sentiment
distributions, such as Stack Overflow, the default GPT-4o-mini model exhibits
superior generalization, achieving an accuracy of 85.3\% compared to the
fine-tuned model's 13.1\%. These findings highlight the trade-offs between
fine-tuning and leveraging pre-trained models for SE tasks. The study
underscores the importance of aligning model architectures with dataset
characteristics to optimize performance and proposes directions for future
research in refining sentiment analysis tools tailored to the SE domain.

Result: 发现26种错误类别，现代神经指标无法可靠区分正确与错误注释。

Conclusion: 标准评估指标在多语言环境中效果有限，需改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models are essential coding assistants, yet their training is
predominantly English-centric. In this study, we evaluate the performance of
code language models in non-English contexts, identifying challenges in their
adoption and integration into multilingual workflows. We conduct an open-coding
study to analyze errors in code comments generated by five state-of-the-art
code models, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeQwen1.5, GraniteCode, and StarCoder2
across five natural languages: Chinese, Dutch, English, Greek, and Polish. Our
study yields a dataset of 12,500 labeled generations, which we publicly
release. We then assess the reliability of standard metrics in capturing
comment \textit{correctness} across languages and evaluate their
trustworthiness as judgment criteria. Through our open-coding investigation, we
identified a taxonomy of 26 distinct error categories in model-generated code
comments. They highlight variations in language cohesion, informativeness, and
syntax adherence across different natural languages. Our analysis shows that,
while these models frequently produce partially correct comments, modern neural
metrics fail to reliably differentiate meaningful completions from random
noise. Notably, the significant score overlap between expert-rated correct and
incorrect comments calls into question the effectiveness of these metrics in
assessing generated comments.

TLDR: LeanCode通过基于上下文注意力分数简化代码，显著减少训练和预测时间，在代码搜索和代码摘要任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理代码时计算复杂度高，输入代码序列长度增加时尤为明显，需要一种高效的简化方法。

Method: 利用上下文注意力分数表示令牌重要性，选择性移除令牌；使用CLS令牌的注意力分数进行分类任务，编码器-解码器注意力分数用于序列到序列任务。

Result: 在代码搜索任务中比DietCode和Slimcode分别提升60%和16%，在代码摘要任务中分别提升29%和27%。

Conclusion: LeanCode通过上下文感知的注意力分数简化代码，显著提升了效率，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models for code often entail significant computational
complexity, which grows significantly with the length of the input code
sequence. We propose LeanCode for code simplification to reduce training and
prediction time, leveraging code contexts in utilizing attention scores to
represent the tokens' importance. We advocate for the selective removal of
tokens based on the average context-aware attention scores rather than average
scores across all inputs. LeanCode uses the attention scores of `CLS' tokens
within the encoder for classification tasks, such as code search. It also
employs the encoder-decoder attention scores to determine token significance
for sequence-to-sequence tasks like code summarization.Our evaluation shows
LeanCode's superiority over the SOTAs DietCode and Slimcode, with improvements
of 60% and 16% for code search, and 29% and 27% for code summarization,
respectively.

TLDR: 本文研究了支持向量机（SVM）预测中的不确定性量化（UQ），提出了稀疏支持向量分位数回归（SSVQR）模型，用于构建预测区间（PI）和概率预测，并通过实验验证其优于现有SVM方法和深度学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVM预测区间（PI）方法缺乏稀疏性，且在高维数据中表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出SSVQR模型，通过线性规划构建PI，并开发特征选择算法以提升高维数据中的PI质量。此外，将SVM模型扩展至共形回归框架以获得更稳定的预测集。

Result: 实验表明，SSVQR在稀疏性和PI质量上优于现有SVM方法，且与复杂深度学习模型相比性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: SSVQR为SVM预测提供了高效的不确定性量化方法，尤其适用于高维数据，且性能优于深度学习模型。

Abstract: This paper explores Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in SVM predictions,
particularly for regression and forecasting tasks. Unlike the Neural Network,
the SVM solutions are typically more stable, sparse, optimal and interpretable.
However, there are only few literature which addresses the UQ in SVM
prediction. At first, we provide a comprehensive summary of existing Prediction
Interval (PI) estimation and probabilistic forecasting methods developed in the
SVM framework and evaluate them against the key properties expected from an
ideal PI model. We find that none of the existing SVM PI models achieves a
sparse solution. To introduce sparsity in SVM model, we propose the Sparse
Support Vector Quantile Regression (SSVQR) model, which constructs PIs and
probabilistic forecasts by solving a pair of linear programs. Further, we
develop a feature selection algorithm for PI estimation using SSVQR that
effectively eliminates a significant number of features while improving PI
quality in case of high-dimensional dataset. Finally we extend the SVM models
in Conformal Regression setting for obtaining more stable prediction set with
finite test set guarantees. Extensive experiments on artificial, real-world
benchmark datasets compare the different characteristics of both existing and
proposed SVM-based PI estimation methods and also highlight the advantages of
the feature selection in PI estimation. Furthermore, we compare both, the
existing and proposed SVM-based PI estimation models, with modern deep learning
models for probabilistic forecasting tasks on benchmark datasets. Furthermore,
SVM models show comparable or superior performance to modern complex deep
learning models for probabilistic forecasting task in our experiments.

Main category: stat.ML

TLDR: 本文研究了线性回归任务中低秩协方差矩阵参数化的上下文学习（ICL）在分布外（OOD）的能力，发现ICL对分布偏移不鲁棒，但在特定条件下可泛化到训练任务子空间的任意子空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在揭示上下文学习在分布外任务中的表现，特别是其泛化能力是否依赖于训练任务的子空间。

Method: 通过低秩协方差矩阵参数化的线性回归任务建模分布偏移，分析单层线性注意力模型的表现。

Result: ICL对分布偏移不鲁棒，但在训练任务子空间内可泛化。实验验证了GPT-2模型和LoRA方法的类似表现。

Conclusion: ICL的OOD泛化能力可能源于新任务位于训练任务子空间的范围内，非线性函数类和LoRA方法也表现出类似特性。

Abstract: This work aims to demystify the out-of-distribution (OOD) capabilities of
in-context learning (ICL) by studying linear regression tasks parameterized
with low-rank covariance matrices. With such a parameterization, we can model
distribution shifts as a varying angle between the subspace of the training and
testing covariance matrices. We prove that a single-layer linear attention
model incurs a test risk with a non-negligible dependence on the angle,
illustrating that ICL is not robust to such distribution shifts. However, using
this framework, we also prove an interesting property of ICL: when trained on
task vectors drawn from a union of low-dimensional subspaces, ICL can
generalize to any subspace within their span, given sufficiently long prompt
lengths. This suggests that the OOD generalization ability of Transformers may
actually stem from the new task lying within the span of those encountered
during training. We empirically show that our results also hold for models such
as GPT-2, and conclude with (i) experiments on how our observations extend to
nonlinear function classes and (ii) results on how LoRA has the ability to
capture distribution shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GNN在无监督学习中超参数调优困难及缺乏模型选择方法的问题。

Method: 采用局部自举边和特征重采样，结合CCA评估嵌入一致性，优化超参数选择。

Result: 实验显示分类准确率提升65.9%，并在实际应用中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: LOBSTUR-GNN为无监督GNN提供了一种高效、鲁棒的超参数调优方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in conjunction with
unsupervised learning techniques to learn powerful node representations, but
their deployment is hindered by their high sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning
and the absence of established methodologies for selecting the optimal models.
To address these challenges, we propose LOBSTUR-GNN ({\bf Lo}cal {\bf B}oot{\bf
s}trap for {\bf T}uning {\bf U}nsupervised {\bf R}epresentations in GNNs) i), a
novel framework designed to adapt bootstrapping techniques for unsupervised
graph representation learning. LOBSTUR-GNN tackles two main challenges: (a)
adapting the bootstrap edge and feature resampling process to account for local
graph dependencies in creating alternative versions of the same graph, and (b)
establishing robust metrics for evaluating learned representations without
ground-truth labels. Using locally bootstrapped resampling and leveraging
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to assess embedding consistency, LOBSTUR
provides a principled approach for hyperparameter tuning in unsupervised GNNs.
We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method through
extensive experiments on established academic datasets, showing an 65.9\%
improvement in the classification accuracy compared to an uninformed selection
of hyperparameters. Finally, we deploy our framework on a real-world
application, thereby demonstrating its validity and practical utility in
various settings. \footnote{The code is available at

TLDR: 论文首次为Adam在深度ReLU网络中推导出泛化边界，并证明了其在非光滑、非凸ReLU场景下的全局最优收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Adam等一阶自适应优化方法在深度神经网络训练中表现优异，但其在非光滑场景（如ReLU网络）中的理论理解仍有限。

Method: 基于分层Morse理论和Kakeya集的新结果，提出多层细化框架，逐步收紧区域交叉边界。

Result: 证明区域交叉次数从指数级降至近线性，并给出比PAC-Bayes方法更紧的泛化边界。

Conclusion: 通过温和的低屏障假设，展示了Adam在非光滑、非凸ReLU场景中的收敛性。

Abstract: First-order adaptive optimization methods like Adam are the default choices
for training modern deep neural networks. Despite their empirical success, the
theoretical understanding of these methods in non-smooth settings, particularly
in Deep ReLU networks, remains limited. ReLU activations create exponentially
many region boundaries where standard smoothness assumptions break down.
\textbf{We derive the first
\(\tilde{O}\!\bigl(\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{eff}}/n}\bigr)\) generalization bound for
Adam in Deep ReLU networks and the first global-optimal convergence for Adam in
the non smooth, non convex relu landscape without a global PL or convexity
assumption.} Our analysis is based on stratified Morse theory and novel results
in Kakeya sets. We develop a multi-layer refinement framework that
progressively tightens bounds on region crossings. We prove that the number of
region crossings collapses from exponential to near-linear in the effective
dimension. Using a Kakeya based method, we give a tighter generalization bound
than PAC-Bayes approaches and showcase convergence using a mild uniform low
barrier assumption.

Motivation: 日常环境对健康和行为的显著影响需要系统研究，而现有方法在环境分类和个体化分析上存在不足。

Result: 模型有效识别个人环境并将其分组为有意义的环境类型，进一步与健康结果关联。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了环境分型范式的发展，为环境与健康关系研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Daily environments have profound influence on our health and behavior. Recent
work has shown that digital envirotyping, where computer vision is applied to
images of daily environments taken during ecological momentary assessment
(EMA), can be used to identify meaningful relationships between environmental
features and health outcomes of interest. To systematically study such effects
on an individual level, it is helpful to group images into distinct
environments encountered in an individual's daily life; these may then be
analyzed, further grouped into related environments with similar features, and
linked to health outcomes. Here we introduce infinite hierarchical contrastive
clustering to address this challenge. Building on the established contrastive
clustering framework, our method a) allows an arbitrary number of clusters
without requiring the full Dirichlet Process machinery by placing a
stick-breaking prior on predicted cluster probabilities; and b) encourages
distinct environments to form well-defined sub-clusters within each cluster of
related environments by incorporating a participant-specific prediction loss.
Our experiments show that our model effectively identifies distinct personal
environments and groups these environments into meaningful environment types.
We then illustrate how the resulting clusters can be linked to various health
outcomes, highlighting the potential of our approach to advance the
envirotyping paradigm.

Conclusion: Hessian矩阵是检测数据投毒的有效工具，相关理论和方法可扩展至现代深度网络，为模型安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: We investigate the theoretical foundations of data poisoning attacks in
machine learning models. Our analysis reveals that the Hessian with respect to
the input serves as a diagnostic tool for detecting poisoning, exhibiting
spectral signatures that characterize compromised datasets. We use random
matrix theory (RMT) to develop a theory for the impact of poisoning proportion
and regularisation on attack efficacy in linear regression. Through QR stepwise
regression, we study the spectral signatures of the Hessian in multi-output
regression. We perform experiments on deep networks to show experimentally that
this theory extends to modern convolutional and transformer networks under the
cross-entropy loss. Based on these insights we develop preliminary algorithms
to determine if a network has been poisoned and remedies which do not require
further training.

Motivation: 因果数据融合在变量增多和因果图复杂化时面临计算挑战，需要简化模型。

Result: 给出了基于小图推断大图中因果效应可识别性的充分条件，并展示了如何获得识别功能。

Conclusion: 通过流行病学和社会科学的实例验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Data fusion, the process of combining observational and experimental data,
can enable the identification of causal effects that would otherwise remain
non-identifiable. Although identification algorithms have been developed for
specific scenarios, do-calculus remains the only general-purpose tool for
causal data fusion, particularly when variables are present in some data
sources but not others. However, approaches based on do-calculus may encounter
computational challenges as the number of variables increases and the causal
graph grows in complexity. Consequently, there exists a need to reduce the size
of such models while preserving the essential features. For this purpose, we
propose pruning (removing unnecessary variables) and clustering (combining
variables) as preprocessing operations for causal data fusion. We generalize
earlier results on a single data source and derive conditions for applying
pruning and clustering in the case of multiple data sources. We give sufficient
conditions for inferring the identifiability or non-identifiability of a causal
effect in a larger graph based on a smaller graph and show how to obtain the
corresponding identifying functional for identifiable causal effects. Examples

### [476] [Policy Testing in Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15342)
*Kaito Ariu,Po-An Wang,Alexandre Proutiere,Kenshi Abe*

Main category: stat.ML

TLDR: 研究在固定置信度设置下折扣马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）中的策略测试问题，目标是判断给定策略的值是否超过阈值并最小化观察次数。通过优化问题推导实例特定下界，提出基于策略梯度的算法，实现统计最优和计算可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MDP中策略测试问题的样本效率挑战，尤其是在非凸约束下设计统计最优且计算可行的算法。

Method: 通过优化问题重新表述下界问题，将其转化为具有非凸目标但凸约束的问题，并利用策略梯度方法高效求解。

Result: 提出的算法在样本复杂度上匹配实例特定下界，同时保持计算可行性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过优化问题重新表述和策略梯度方法，成功设计出统计最优且计算可行的策略测试算法。

Abstract: We study the policy testing problem in discounted Markov decision processes
(MDPs) under the fixed-confidence setting. The goal is to determine whether the
value of a given policy exceeds a specified threshold while minimizing the
number of observations. We begin by deriving an instance-specific lower bound
that any algorithm must satisfy. This lower bound is characterized as the
solution to an optimization problem with non-convex constraints. We propose a
policy testing algorithm inspired by this optimization problem--a common
approach in pure exploration problems such as best-arm identification, where
asymptotically optimal algorithms often stem from such optimization-based
characterizations. As for other pure exploration tasks in MDPs, however, the
non-convex constraints in the lower-bound problem present significant
challenges, raising doubts about whether statistically optimal and
computationally tractable algorithms can be designed. To address this, we
reformulate the lower-bound problem by interchanging the roles of the objective
and the constraints, yielding an alternative problem with a non-convex
objective but convex constraints. Strikingly, this reformulated problem admits
an interpretation as a policy optimization task in a newly constructed reversed
MDP. Leveraging recent advances in policy gradient methods, we efficiently
solve this problem and use it to design a policy testing algorithm that is
statistically optimal--matching the instance-specific lower bound on sample
complexity--while remaining computationally tractable. We validate our approach
with numerical experiments.

*Leon Chlon,Maggie Chlon,MarcAntonio M. Awada*

Main category: stat.ML

TLDR: AECF是一种轻量级融合层，能够在多模态系统中同时保持鲁棒性和校准性，适用于输入缺失的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的多模态系统常面临输入缺失问题，现有融合层无法同时保证鲁棒性和校准性。

Method: 提出AECF层，通过自适应熵门控对比融合，动态调整熵系数并保持单调校准。

Result: 在AV-MNIST和MS-COCO数据集上，AECF在50%缺失率下提升mAP 18个百分点，降低ECE达200%，仅增加1%运行时间。

Conclusion: AECF是一种即插即用的轻量级层，适用于鲁棒且校准的多模态推理。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal systems routinely face missing-input scenarios, and in
reality, robots lose audio in a factory or a clinical record omits lab tests at
inference time. Standard fusion layers either preserve robustness or
calibration but never both. We introduce Adaptive Entropy-Gated Contrastive
Fusion (AECF), a single light-weight layer that (i) adapts its entropy
coefficient per instance, (ii) enforces monotone calibration across all
modality subsets, and (iii) drives a curriculum mask directly from
training-time entropy. On AV-MNIST and MS-COCO, AECF improves masked-input mAP
by +18 pp at a 50% drop rate while reducing ECE by up to 200%, yet adds 1%
run-time. All back-bones remain frozen, making AECF an easy drop-in layer for
robust, calibrated multimodal inference.

Main category: stat.ML

TLDR: 本文提出了一种为共形预测集合中的元素分配校准概率的方法，解决了传统共形预测无法提供单个标签概率的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共形预测虽然能构建高覆盖率的预测集合，但无法提供单个标签的概率估计，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过自适应校准问题框架，选择输入特定的温度参数以满足覆盖要求。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持覆盖率的同时显著降低了预期校准误差。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了对共形预测集合中元素的概率校准，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Conformal prediction enables the construction of high-coverage prediction
sets for any pre-trained model, guaranteeing that the true label lies within
the set with a specified probability. However, these sets do not provide
probability estimates for individual labels, limiting their practical use. In
this paper, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first method for
assigning calibrated probabilities to elements of a conformal prediction set.
Our approach frames this as an adaptive calibration problem, selecting an
input-specific temperature parameter to match the desired coverage level.
Experiments on several challenging image classification datasets demonstrate
that our method maintains coverage guarantees while significantly reducing
expected calibration error.

TLDR: 该论文探讨了可解释机器学习（IML）方法的稳定性问题，发现流行的解释方法普遍不稳定，且解释稳定性与预测准确性无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在高风险领域的应用增加，提高模型的可解释性以增强信任变得至关重要。然而，解释的可靠性尚未得到充分验证。

Method: 研究通过系统性的大规模实证分析，评估了监督和非监督任务中流行的全局解释方法的稳定性。

Result: 研究发现，流行的解释方法普遍不稳定，且解释稳定性与预测准确性无关。没有单一方法在所有数据集上表现最稳定。

Conclusion: 可解释性本身不足以保证信任，未来研究需要严格评估解释的稳定性。作者发布了开源工具以支持这一目标。

Abstract: As machine learning systems are increasingly used in high-stakes domains,
there is a growing emphasis placed on making them interpretable to improve
trust in these systems. In response, a range of interpretable machine learning
(IML) methods have been developed to generate human-understandable insights
into otherwise black box models. With these methods, a fundamental question
arises: Are these interpretations reliable? Unlike with prediction accuracy or
other evaluation metrics for supervised models, the proximity to the true
interpretation is difficult to define. Instead, we ask a closely related
question that we argue is a prerequisite for reliability: Are these
interpretations stable? We define stability as findings that are consistent or
reliable under small random perturbations to the data or algorithms. In this
study, we conduct the first systematic, large-scale empirical stability study
on popular machine learning global interpretations for both supervised and
unsupervised tasks on tabular data. Our findings reveal that popular
interpretation methods are frequently unstable, notably less stable than the
predictions themselves, and that there is no association between the accuracy
of machine learning predictions and the stability of their associated
interpretations. Moreover, we show that no single method consistently provides
the most stable interpretations across a range of benchmark datasets. Overall,
these results suggest that interpretability alone does not warrant trust, and
underscores the need for rigorous evaluation of interpretation stability in
future work. To support these principles, we have developed and released an
open source IML dashboard and Python package to enable researchers to assess
the stability and reliability of their own data-driven interpretations and
discoveries.

TLDR: 研究探讨了在蛋白质序列优化中，利用少量标记数据和离散扩散模型进行引导生成的方法，并比较了不同策略的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量标记数据或代理奖励，难以评估其在真实低通量实验中的表现。

Method: 使用少量标记数据（数百对序列-适应度），结合分类器引导和后验采样策略，指导离散扩散模型生成蛋白质序列。

Result: 研究表明，即插即用的引导策略（如贝叶斯优化中的Thompson采样）优于其他方法（如强化学习）。

Conclusion: 在真实优化场景中，引导策略能有效提升蛋白质序列优化的效率。

Abstract: Protein fitness optimization involves finding a protein sequence that
maximizes desired quantitative properties in a combinatorially large design
space of possible sequences. Recent developments in steering protein generative
models (e.g diffusion models, language models) offer a promising approach.
However, by and large, past studies have optimized surrogate rewards and/or
utilized large amounts of labeled data for steering, making it unclear how well
existing methods perform and compare to each other in real-world optimization
campaigns where fitness is measured by low-throughput wet-lab assays. In this
study, we explore fitness optimization using small amounts (hundreds) of
labeled sequence-fitness pairs and comprehensively evaluate strategies such as
classifier guidance and posterior sampling for guiding generation from
different discrete diffusion models of protein sequences. We also demonstrate
how guidance can be integrated into adaptive sequence selection akin to
Thompson sampling in Bayesian optimization, showing that plug-and-play guidance
strategies offer advantages compared to alternatives such as reinforcement
learning with protein language models.

Result: 实验结果表明，基于ERC4907的NFST能够满足用户对安全高效DSS的需求，是一种可行的解决方案。

Conclusion: 区块链和NFST的结合为动态频谱共享提供了安全、可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Centralized Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) faces challenges like data
security, high management costs, and limited scalability. To address these
issues, a blockchain-based DSS scheme has been proposed in this paper. First,
we utilize the ERC4907 standard to mint Non-Fungible Spectrum Tokens (NFSTs)
that serve as unique identifiers for spectrum resources and facilitate renting.
Next, we develop a smart contract for NFST auctions, ensuring secure spectrum
transactions through the auction process. Lastly, we create a Web3 spectrum
auction platform where users can access idle spectrum data and participate in
auctions for NFST leases corresponding to the available spectrum. Experimental
results demonstrate that our NFST, designed according to the ERC4907 standard,
effectively meets users' secure and efficient DSS requirements, making it a
feasible solution.

TLDR: 研究发现，基于LLM的评估系统对伦理拒绝的评分显著高于人类用户，而对技术拒绝的评分则无显著差异，揭示了评估系统的潜在偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM评估系统（如LLM-as-a-Judge）是否与人类用户对拒绝行为的评价存在差异，尤其是在伦理和技术拒绝的对比中。

Method: 通过分析Chatbot Arena的数据，并利用GPT-4o和Llama 3 70B作为AI评估者，比较伦理拒绝和技术拒绝的评分差异。

Result: LLM评估系统对伦理拒绝的评分显著高于人类用户，而对技术拒绝的评分无显著差异，显示出评估系统的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了自动化评估系统中潜在的偏见，引发了对透明度、价值对齐和评估系统规范性假设的讨论。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
settings, their ability to refuse ethically sensitive prompts-such as those
involving hate speech or illegal activities-has become central to content
moderation and responsible AI practices. While refusal responses can be viewed
as evidence of ethical alignment and safety-conscious behavior, recent research
suggests that users may perceive them negatively. At the same time, automated
assessments of model outputs are playing a growing role in both evaluation and
training. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks-in which one model is used
to evaluate the output of another-are now widely adopted to guide benchmarking
and fine-tuning. This paper examines whether such model-based evaluators assess
refusal responses differently than human users. Drawing on data from Chatbot
Arena and judgments from two AI judges (GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B), we compare how
different types of refusals are rated. We distinguish ethical refusals, which
explicitly cite safety or normative concerns (e.g., "I can't help with that
because it may be harmful"), and technical refusals, which reflect system
limitations (e.g., "I can't answer because I lack real-time data"). We find
that LLM-as-a-Judge systems evaluate ethical refusals significantly more
favorably than human users, a divergence not observed for technical refusals.
We refer to this divergence as a moderation bias-a systematic tendency for
model-based evaluators to reward refusal behaviors more than human users do.
This raises broader questions about transparency, value alignment, and the
normative assumptions embedded in automated evaluation systems.

Motivation: 探索如何利用AI生成反馈辅助人类教师，提高反馈效率和质量。

Method: 在经济学课程中开发基于LLM的反馈引擎，生成基于评分标准的AI反馈，并通过与助教的对比实验和访谈评估其效果。

Result: 助教认为AI反馈可加速评分、提高一致性和反馈质量，但需详细评分标准和分步展示中间结果。

Conclusion: AI生成反馈作为建议具有潜力，但需优化生成过程和展示方式以更好地辅助人类教师。

Abstract: This project examines the prospect of using AI-generated feedback as
suggestions to expedite and enhance human instructors' feedback provision. In
particular, we focus on understanding the teaching assistants' perspectives on
the quality of AI-generated feedback and how they may or may not utilize AI
feedback in their own workflows. We situate our work in a foundational college
Economics class, which has frequent short essay assignments. We developed an
LLM-powered feedback engine that generates feedback on students' essays based
on grading rubrics used by the teaching assistants (TAs). To ensure that TAs
can meaningfully critique and engage with the AI feedback, we had them complete
their regular grading jobs. For a randomly selected set of essays that they had
graded, we used our feedback engine to generate feedback and displayed the
feedback as in-text comments in a Word document. We then performed think-aloud
studies with 5 TAs over 20 1-hour sessions to have them evaluate the AI
feedback, contrast the AI feedback with their handwritten feedback, and share
how they envision using the AI feedback if they were offered as suggestions.
The study highlights the importance of providing detailed rubrics for AI to
generate high-quality feedback for knowledge-intensive essays. TAs considered
that using AI feedback as suggestions during their grading could expedite
grading, enhance consistency, and improve overall feedback quality. We discuss
the importance of decomposing the feedback generation task into steps and
presenting intermediate results, in order for TAs to use the AI feedback.

this, we investigated pre-trained model applications developed by HCI
researchers as a proxy for commercially successful applications. The research
applications demonstrate technical capabilities, address real user needs, and
avoid ethical challenges. Using an artifact analysis approach, we categorized
capabilities, opportunity domains, data types, and emerging interaction design

Abstract: We show how replay attacks undermine audio deepfake detection: By playing and
re-recording deepfake audio through various speakers and microphones, we make
spoofed samples appear authentic to the detection model. To study this
phenomenon in more detail, we introduce ReplayDF, a dataset of recordings
derived from M-AILABS and MLAAD, featuring 109 speaker-microphone combinations
across six languages and four TTS models. It includes diverse acoustic
conditions, some highly challenging for detection. Our analysis of six
open-source detection models across five datasets reveals significant
vulnerability, with the top-performing W2V2-AASIST model's Equal Error Rate

Abstract: Whole-body audio-driven avatar pose and expression generation is a critical
task for creating lifelike digital humans and enhancing the capabilities of
interactive virtual agents, with wide-ranging applications in virtual reality,
digital entertainment, and remote communication. Existing approaches often
generate audio-driven facial expressions and gestures independently, which
introduces a significant limitation: the lack of seamless coordination between
facial and gestural elements, resulting in less natural and cohesive
animations. To address this limitation, we propose AsynFusion, a novel
framework that leverages diffusion transformers to achieve harmonious
expression and gesture synthesis. The proposed method is built upon a
dual-branch DiT architecture, which enables the parallel generation of facial
expressions and gestures. Within the model, we introduce a Cooperative
Synchronization Module to facilitate bidirectional feature interaction between
the two modalities, and an Asynchronous LCM Sampling strategy to reduce
computational overhead while maintaining high-quality outputs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AsynFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance
in generating real-time, synchronized whole-body animations, consistently

Result: 实验显示SSD实现了1.4倍的加速，同时保持了高质量和自然度。

Conclusion: SSD在加速推理的同时有效保留了目标模型的感知质量。

Abstract: Modern autoregressive speech synthesis models leveraging language models have
demonstrated remarkable performance. However, the sequential nature of next
token prediction in these models leads to significant latency, hindering their
deployment in scenarios where inference speed is critical. In this work, we
propose Speech Speculative Decoding (SSD), a novel framework for autoregressive
speech synthesis acceleration. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight
draft model to generate candidate token sequences, which are subsequently
verified in parallel by the target model using the proposed SSD framework.
Experimental results demonstrate that SSD achieves a significant speedup of
1.4x compared with conventional autoregressive decoding, while maintaining high
fidelity and naturalness. Subjective evaluations further validate the
effectiveness of SSD in preserving the perceptual quality of the target model
while accelerating inference.

Motivation: 当前研究缺乏对LAMs安全性的系统量化评估，尤其是在对抗越狱攻击方面，因此需要开发专门的评测工具和方法。

Method: 构建了AJailBench-Base数据集（1,495个对抗性音频提示），并提出动态对抗样本生成方法（APT工具包），通过时间、频率和幅度域的扰动优化攻击效果。

Result: 实验表明，现有LAMs在对抗攻击中表现不一致，且轻微语义保留的扰动会显著降低模型安全性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发更鲁棒且语义感知的防御机制的必要性。

Abstract: The rise of Large Audio Language Models (LAMs) brings both potential and
risks, as their audio outputs may contain harmful or unethical content.
However, current research lacks a systematic, quantitative evaluation of LAM
safety especially against jailbreak attacks, which are challenging due to the
temporal and semantic nature of speech. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AJailBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate jailbreak
vulnerabilities in LAMs. We begin by constructing AJailBench-Base, a dataset of
1,495 adversarial audio prompts spanning 10 policy-violating categories,
converted from textual jailbreak attacks using realistic text to speech
synthesis. Using this dataset, we evaluate several state-of-the-art LAMs and
reveal that none exhibit consistent robustness across attacks. To further
strengthen jailbreak testing and simulate more realistic attack conditions, we
propose a method to generate dynamic adversarial variants. Our Audio
Perturbation Toolkit (APT) applies targeted distortions across time, frequency,
and amplitude domains. To preserve the original jailbreak intent, we enforce a
semantic consistency constraint and employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently
search for perturbations that are both subtle and highly effective. This
results in AJailBench-APT, an extended dataset of optimized adversarial audio
samples. Our findings demonstrate that even small, semantically preserved
perturbations can significantly reduce the safety performance of leading LAMs,
underscoring the need for more robust and semantically aware defense
mechanisms.

Moonbeam, we propose 2 finetuning architectures with full anticipatory
capabilities, targeting 2 categories of downstream tasks: symbolic music
understanding and conditional music generation (including music infilling). Our
model outperforms other large-scale pretrained music models in most cases in
terms of accuracy and F1 score across 3 downstream music classification tasks
on 4 datasets. Moreover, our finetuned conditional music generation model
outperforms a strong transformer baseline with a REMI-like tokenizer. We
open-source the code, pretrained model, and generated samples on Github.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模情感语音数据获取中一致性的挑战。

Method: 利用面部检测和跟踪算法，结合多模态大语言模型（MLLM）开发自动情感分析系统。

Result: 人类级准确性（68.5% MELD）和高一致性（0.93 Fleiss kappa），支持26种细粒度情感类别标注。

Conclusion: MIKU-PAL提供高效、低成本的情感语音标注，并发布新数据集MIKU-EmoBench作为情感TTS和视觉语音克隆的基准。

Abstract: Acquiring large-scale emotional speech data with strong consistency remains a
challenge for speech synthesis. This paper presents MIKU-PAL, a fully automated
multimodal pipeline for extracting high-consistency emotional speech from
unlabeled video data. Leveraging face detection and tracking algorithms, we
developed an automatic emotion analysis system using a multimodal large
language model (MLLM). Our results demonstrate that MIKU-PAL can achieve
human-level accuracy (68.5% on MELD) and superior consistency (0.93 Fleiss
kappa score) while being much cheaper and faster than human annotation. With
the high-quality, flexible, and consistent annotation from MIKU-PAL, we can
annotate fine-grained speech emotion categories of up to 26 types, validated by
human annotators with 83% rationality ratings. Based on our proposed system, we
further released a fine-grained emotional speech dataset MIKU-EmoBench(131.2
hours) as a new benchmark for emotional text-to-speech and visual voice
cloning.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为TIIPS的新框架，通过显式建模归纳和转导策略的协同作用，提升程序合成的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法未显式建模归纳与转导策略的交互，限制了程序合成的性能。

Method: TIIPS框架通过归纳模型生成程序，转导模型约束和优化搜索过程。

Result: 在字符串和列表操作任务中，TIIPS表现优于现有方法，尤其在分布外场景中。

Conclusion: 显式建模归纳与转导的协同作用为通用程序合成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Abstraction and reasoning in program synthesis has seen significant progress
through both inductive and transductive paradigms. Inductive approaches
generate a program or latent function from input-output examples, which can
then be applied to new inputs. Transductive approaches directly predict output
values for given inputs, effectively serving as the function themselves.
Current approaches combine inductive and transductive models via isolated
ensembling, but they do not explicitly model the interaction between both
paradigms. In this work, we introduce \acs{tiips}, a novel framework that
unifies transductive and inductive strategies by explicitly modeling their
interactions through a cooperative mechanism: an inductive model generates
programs, while a transductive model constrains, guides, and refines the search
to improve synthesis accuracy and generalization. We evaluate \acs{tiips} on
two widely studied program synthesis domains: string and list manipulation. Our
results show that \acs{tiips} solves more tasks and yields functions that more
closely match optimal solutions in syntax and semantics, particularly in
out-of-distribution settings, yielding state-of-the-art performance. We believe
that explicitly modeling the synergy between inductive and transductive
reasoning opens promising avenues for general-purpose program synthesis and
broader applications.

*Fernando Lucatelli Nunes,Gordon Plotkin,Matthijs Vákár*

Main category: cs.PL

TLDR: 扩展了CHAD框架，支持部分编程语言的非终止操作、实数条件判断和迭代结构，并保持其结构保留语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为依赖类型语言和容器类别中的迭代结构提供理论基础，并扩展CHAD以支持更复杂的语言特性。

Method: 引入迭代扩展索引类别，通过Grothendieck构造在目标语言中建模迭代，并证明转换的正确性。

Result: 扩展后的CHAD转换保持唯一结构保留函子特性，并能正确计算反向模式导数。

Conclusion: 为CHAD在复杂语言中的反向模式提供了严格的范畴语义，并保证了源到源转换的正确性。

Abstract: Combinatory Homomorphic Automatic Differentiation (CHAD) was originally
formulated as a semantics-driven source transformation for reverse-mode AD in
total programming languages. We extend this framework to partial languages with
features such as potentially non-terminating operations, real-valued
conditionals, and iteration constructs like while-loops, while preserving
CHAD's structure-preserving semantics principle. A key contribution is the
introduction of iteration-extensive indexed categories, which allow iteration
in the base category to lift to parameterized initial algebras in the indexed
category. This enables iteration to be interpreted in the Grothendieck
construction of the target language in a principled way. The resulting fibred
iterative structure cleanly models iteration in the categorical semantics.
Consequently, the extended CHAD transformation remains the unique
structure-preserving functor (an iterative Freyd category morphism) from the
freely generated iterative Freyd category of the source language to the
Grothendieck construction of the target's syntactic semantics, mapping each
primitive operation to its derivative. We prove the correctness of this
transformation using the universal property of the source language's syntax,
showing that the transformed programs compute correct reverse-mode derivatives.
Our development also contributes to understanding iteration constructs within
dependently typed languages and categories of containers. As our primary
motivation and application, we generalize CHAD to languages with data types,
partial features, and iteration, providing the first rigorous categorical
semantics for reverse-mode CHAD in such settings and formally guaranteeing the
correctness of the source-to-source CHAD technique.

Main category: stat.AP

TLDR: 提出OBPV方法，用于评估足球比赛中全场的空间利用，特别是在攻防转换时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间评估方法（如OBSO）不适用于远离球门的区域，而攻防转换通常发生在此类区域。

Method: 扩展OBSO，引入全场价值模型和转换核模型，通过传球分布核密度估计反映位置特异性。

Result: 实验显示OBPV能有效评估反击中的空间利用，并揭示球队在攻防转换后的空间利用特点。

Conclusion: OBPV为足球空间评估提供了更全面的工具，特别适用于攻防转换分析。

Abstract: Soccer is a sport played on a pitch where effective use of space is crucial.
Decision-making during transitions, when possession switches between teams, has
been increasingly important, but research on space evaluation in these moments
has been limited. Recent space evaluation methods such as OBSO (Off-Ball
Scoring Opportunity) use scoring probability, so it is not well-suited for
assessing areas far from the goal, where transitions typically occur. In this
paper, we propose OBPV (Off-Ball Positioning Value) to evaluate space across
the pitch, including the starting points of transitions. OBPV extends OBSO by
introducing the field value model, which evaluates the entire pitch, and by
employing the transition kernel model, which reflects positional specificity
through kernel density estimation of pass distributions. Experiments using La
Liga 2023/24 season tracking and event data show that OBPV highlights effective
space utilization during counter-attacks and reveals team-specific
characteristics in how the teams utilize space after positive and negative
transitions.

TLDR: 本文回顾了ComBAT方法的数学基础及其假设，探讨了人口统计特征对结果的影响，并提出了五项改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ComBAT是MRI数据标准化的常用方法，但其假设条件可能导致结果偏差，因此需要研究其优化条件。

Method: 通过实验评估人口特征（如样本量、年龄分布等）对Pairwise-ComBAT（ComBAT的改进版）的影响。

Result: 实验揭示了不同人口特征对结果的影响，并提出了五项改进建议。

Conclusion: 五项建议可提升ComBAT的稳定性和可重复性，适用于开放科学和临床研究。

Abstract: Over the years, ComBAT has become the standard method for harmonizing
MRI-derived measurements, with its ability to compensate for site-related
additive and multiplicative biases while preserving biological variability.
However, ComBAT relies on a set of assumptions that, when violated, can result
in flawed harmonization. In this paper, we thoroughly review ComBAT's
mathematical foundation, outlining these assumptions, and exploring their
implications for the demographic composition necessary for optimal results.
  Through a series of experiments involving a slightly modified version of
ComBAT called Pairwise-ComBAT tailored for normative modeling applications, we
assess the impact of various population characteristics, including population
size, age distribution, the absence of certain covariates, and the magnitude of
additive and multiplicative factors. Based on these experiments, we present
five essential recommendations that should be carefully considered to enhance
consistency and supporting reproducibility, two essential factors for open
science, collaborative research, and real-life clinical deployment.

TLDR: 该研究通过结合结构断点检测与机器学习，评估了全球臭氧前体排放政策的有效性，发现不同政策组合在电力、建筑、工业和交通部门中显著减少了排放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管政策制定者采取了多种措施减少臭氧前体排放，但政策组合的有效性仍不确定，因此需要一种无假设的方法来评估政策干预的效果。

Method: 采用结构断点检测与机器学习结合的框架，分析全球20年的臭氧前体排放数据，识别政策干预的突发变化。

Result: 检测到NOx、CO和VOCs的排放分别减少了0.96-0.97 Gt、2.84-2.88 Gt和0.47-0.48 Gt，电力部门政策使NOx减少32.4%，建筑部门政策使CO减少42.7%-52.3%，VOCs减少38.5%。

Conclusion: 混合策略（非价格措施与价格工具结合）可带来额外10%的协同效益，为臭氧前体减排提供了政策组合的指导。

Abstract: Despite policymakers deploying various tools to mitigate emissions of ozone
(O\textsubscript{3}) precursors, such as nitrogen oxides (NO\textsubscript{x}),
carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the effectiveness
of policy combinations remains uncertain. We employ an integrated framework
that couples structural break detection with machine learning to pinpoint
effective interventions across the building, electricity, industrial, and
transport sectors, identifying treatment effects as abrupt changes without
prior assumptions about policy treatment assignment and timing. Applied to two
decades of global O\textsubscript{3} precursor emissions data, we detect 78,
77, and 78 structural breaks for NO\textsubscript{x}, CO, and VOCs,
corresponding to cumulative emission reductions of 0.96-0.97 Gt, 2.84-2.88 Gt,
and 0.47-0.48 Gt, respectively. Sector-level analysis shows that electricity
sector structural policies cut NO\textsubscript{x} by up to 32.4\%, while in
buildings, developed countries combined adoption subsidies with carbon taxes to
achieve 42.7\% CO reductions and developing countries used financing plus fuel
taxes to secure 52.3\%. VOCs abatement peaked at 38.5\% when fossil-fuel
subsidy reforms were paired with financial incentives. Finally, hybrid
strategies merging non-price measures (subsidies, bans, mandates) with pricing
instruments delivered up to an additional 10\% co-benefit. These findings guide
the sequencing and complementarity of context-specific policy portfolios for
O\textsubscript{3} precursor mitigation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ODT问题在主动学习、实体识别和医学诊断等领域有广泛应用，但现有算法复杂且常数因子较大，需要更简单高效的解决方案。

Result: 证明了算法的近似比为8ln m，优于现有复杂算法的性能。

Conclusion: 该算法简化了ODT问题的解决方案，同时保持了较高的近似比，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Optimal decision tree (\odt) is a fundamental problem arising in applications
such as active learning, entity identification, and medical diagnosis. An
instance of \odt is given by $m$ hypotheses, out of which an unknown ``true''
hypothesis is drawn according to some probability distribution. An algorithm
needs to identify the true hypothesis by making queries: each query incurs a
cost and has a known response for each hypothesis. The goal is to minimize the
expected query cost to identify the true hypothesis. We consider the most
general setting with arbitrary costs, probabilities and responses. \odt is
NP-hard to approximate better than $\ln m$ and there are $O(\ln m)$
approximation algorithms known for it. However, these algorithms and/or their
analyses are quite complex. Moreover, the leading constant factors are large.
We provide a simple algorithm and analysis for \odt, proving an approximation
ratio of $8 \ln m$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有车载网络协议（如CAN）易受攻击，而传统IDS集成方法存在数据移动和软件开销问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发SecCAN，将定制量化的机器学习加速器嵌入CAN控制器接收数据路径，优化IDS推理与协议接收窗口的重叠。

Result: SecCAN完全隐藏IDS延迟，检测多种攻击且零软件开销，资源占用低（<30% LUT，<1% FF），能耗低（73.7 uJ/消息）。

Conclusion: SecCAN是一种高效、低开销的车载IDS解决方案，适合汽车部署。

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of in-vehicle network
protocols such as controller area networks (CAN) and proposed machine
learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) as an effective mitigation
technique. However, their efficient integration into vehicular architecture is
non-trivial, with existing methods relying on electronic control units
(ECUs)-coupled IDS accelerators or dedicated ECUs as IDS accelerators. Here,
initiating IDS requires complete reception of a CAN message from the
controller, incurring data movement and software overheads. In this paper, we
present SecCAN, a novel CAN controller architecture that embeds IDS capability
within the datapath of the controller. This integration allows IDS to tap
messages directly from within the CAN controller as they are received from the
bus, removing overheads incurred by existing ML-based IDSs. A custom-quantised
machine-learning accelerator is developed as the IDS engine and embedded into
SecCAN's receive data path, with optimisations to overlap the IDS inference
with the protocol's reception window. We implement SecCAN on AMD XCZU7EV FPGA
to quantify its performance and benefits in hardware, using multiple attack
datasets. We show that SecCAN can completely hide the IDS latency within the
CAN reception window for all CAN packet sizes and detect multiple attacks with
state-of-the-art accuracy with zero software overheads on the ECU and low
energy overhead (73.7 uJ per message) for IDS inference. Also, SecCAN incurs
limited resource overhead compared to a standard CAN controller (< 30% LUT, <
1% FF), making it ideally suited for automotive deployment.

Conclusion: 该决策支持系统为多材料航空遗产的保护提供了定制化解决方案，适用于博物馆和存储环境。

Abstract: The paper presents a decision support system for the long-term preservation
of aeronautical heritage exhibited/stored in sheltered sites. The aeronautical
heritage is characterized by diverse materials of which this heritage is
constituted. Heritage aircraft are made of ancient aluminum alloys, (ply)wood,
and particularly fabrics. The decision support system (DSS) designed, starting
from a conceptual model, is knowledge-based on degradation/corrosion mechanisms
of prevailing materials of aeronautical heritage. In the case of historical
aircraft wooden parts, this knowledge base is filled in by the damage function
models developed within former European projects. Model-based corrosion
prediction is implemented within the new DSS for ancient aluminum alloys. The
novelty of this DSS consists of supporting multi-material heritage protection
and tailoring to peculiarities of aircraft exhibition/storage hangars and the
needs of aviation museums. The novel DSS is tested on WWII aircraft heritage
exhibited in the Aviation Museum Kbely, Military History Institute Prague,
Czech Republic.

TLDR: QUADS是一个统一框架，通过多阶段训练结合蒸馏和量化，优化资源受限环境下的SLU系统性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别应用蒸馏和量化，导致压缩效果不佳，因为蒸馏忽略了量化约束。

Method: 提出QUADS框架，通过多阶段训练和预调模型，统一优化蒸馏和量化。

Result: 在SLURP和FSC上分别达到71.13%和99.20%的准确率，计算复杂度降低60-73倍，模型大小减少83-700倍。

Conclusion: QUADS是资源受限SLU应用的高效解决方案，具有强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) systems must balance performance and
efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Existing methods
apply distillation and quantization separately, leading to suboptimal
compression as distillation ignores quantization constraints. We propose QUADS,
a unified framework that optimizes both through multi-stage training with a
pre-tuned model, enhancing adaptability to low-bit regimes while maintaining
accuracy. QUADS achieves 71.13\% accuracy on SLURP and 99.20\% on FSC, with
only minor degradations of up to 5.56\% compared to state-of-the-art models.
Additionally, it reduces computational complexity by 60--73$\times$ (GMACs) and
model size by 83--700$\times$, demonstrating strong robustness under extreme
quantization. These results establish QUADS as a highly efficient solution for
real-world, resource-constrained SLU applications.

TLDR: TCSinger 2是一个多任务、多语言的零样本歌声合成模型，通过风格迁移和多级风格控制解决现有模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌声合成模型过度依赖音素和音符边界标注，导致零样本场景下鲁棒性差且音素转换不流畅，同时缺乏多级风格控制。

Method: TCSinger 2包含三个关键模块：模糊边界内容编码器（BBC）、自定义音频编码器和基于流的自定义Transformer，结合对比学习和F0监督提升合成质量。

Result: 实验表明，TCSinger 2在多个相关任务的主观和客观指标上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TCSinger 2通过改进边界处理和风格控制，显著提升了零样本歌声合成的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: Customizable multilingual zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) has various
potential applications in music composition and short video dubbing. However,
existing SVS models overly depend on phoneme and note boundary annotations,
limiting their robustness in zero-shot scenarios and producing poor transitions
between phonemes and notes. Moreover, they also lack effective multi-level
style control via diverse prompts. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
TCSinger 2, a multi-task multilingual zero-shot SVS model with style transfer
and style control based on various prompts. TCSinger 2 mainly includes three
key modules: 1) Blurred Boundary Content (BBC) Encoder, predicts duration,
extends content embedding, and applies masking to the boundaries to enable
smooth transitions. 2) Custom Audio Encoder, uses contrastive learning to
extract aligned representations from singing, speech, and textual prompts. 3)
Flow-based Custom Transformer, leverages Cus-MOE, with F0 supervision,
enhancing both the synthesis quality and style modeling of the generated
singing voice. Experimental results show that TCSinger 2 outperforms baseline
models in both subjective and objective metrics across multiple related tasks.

TLDR: 提出Segmentation-Variant Codebooks（SVCs）方法，通过在不同语言单元上量化语音，显著提升了韵律和副语言信息的保留效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化SSL语音模型（如HuBERT）虽能提升压缩和任务性能，但常丢失韵律和副语言信息（如情感、重音）。增大码本虽能缓解部分损失，但会低效增加比特率。

Method: 提出SVCs方法，在不同语言单元（帧、音素、词、话语）上量化语音，将其分解为多个特定于片段的离散特征流。

Result: SVCs在多项探测任务中显著更有效地保留了韵律和副语言信息。此外，离散化前池化比离散化后池化更能保留片段级信息。

Conclusion: SVCs在保留可懂度的同时，改进了风格实现和轻微提升了质量，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Quantization in SSL speech models (e.g., HuBERT) improves compression and
performance in tasks like language modeling, resynthesis, and text-to-speech
but often discards prosodic and paralinguistic information (e.g., emotion,
prominence). While increasing codebook size mitigates some loss, it
inefficiently raises bitrates. We propose Segmentation-Variant Codebooks
(SVCs), which quantize speech at distinct linguistic units (frame, phone, word,
utterance), factorizing it into multiple streams of segment-specific discrete
features. Our results show that SVCs are significantly more effective at
preserving prosodic and paralinguistic information across probing tasks.
Additionally, we find that pooling before rather than after discretization
better retains segment-level information. Resynthesis experiments further
confirm improved style realization and slightly improved quality while
preserving intelligibility.

Conclusion: ToxicTone数据集和多模态框架为普通话语音毒性检测提供了有效工具，强调了语音特征的关键作用。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on toxic speech detection in text, a critical gap
remains in handling spoken Mandarin audio. The lack of annotated datasets that
capture the unique prosodic cues and culturally specific expressions in
Mandarin leaves spoken toxicity underexplored. To address this, we introduce
ToxicTone -- the largest public dataset of its kind -- featuring detailed
annotations that distinguish both forms of toxicity (e.g., profanity, bullying)
and sources of toxicity (e.g., anger, sarcasm, dismissiveness). Our data,
sourced from diverse real-world audio and organized into 13 topical categories,
mirrors authentic communication scenarios. We also propose a multimodal
detection framework that integrates acoustic, linguistic, and emotional
features using state-of-the-art speech and emotion encoders. Extensive
experiments show our approach outperforms text-only and baseline models,
underscoring the essential role of speech-specific cues in revealing hidden
toxic expressions.

Result: 证明了固定点的存在性、收敛性，以及与信息论 AI 模型的对应关系。

Conclusion: Alpay Algebra 是数学基础与 AI 系统的桥梁，适用于类型安全语言、模型检查和符号计算。

Abstract: Alpay Algebra is introduced as a universal, category-theoretic framework that
unifies classical algebraic structures with modern needs in symbolic recursion
and explainable AI. Starting from a minimal list of axioms, we model each
algebra as an object in a small cartesian closed category $\mathcal{A}$ and
define a transfinite evolution functor $\phi\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{A}$.
We prove that the fixed point $\phi^{\infty}$ exists for every initial object
and satisfies an internal universal property that recovers familiar constructs
-- limits, colimits, adjunctions -- while extending them to ordinal-indexed
folds. A sequence of theorems establishes (i) soundness and conservativity over
standard universal algebra, (ii) convergence of $\phi$-iterates under regular
cardinals, and (iii) an explanatory correspondence between $\phi^{\infty}$ and
minimal sufficient statistics in information-theoretic AI models. We conclude
by outlining computational applications: type-safe functional languages,
categorical model checking, and signal-level reasoning engines that leverage
Alpay Algebra's structural invariants. All proofs are self-contained; no
external set-theoretic axioms beyond ZFC are required. This exposition

### [507] [Toward Task Capable Active Matter: Learning to Avoid Clogging in Confined Collectives via Collisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15033)

TLDR: 论文研究了高密度群体（如火蚁和机器人群体）在狭窄隧道中通过局部学习行为（如方向反转）来缓解堵塞和维持流动性的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解高密度群体（如火蚁）如何通过局部行为学习来避免堵塞，并探索如何在机器人群体中实现类似的任务能力。

Method: 通过实验让小型机器人群在狭窄隧道中进行颗粒挖掘，允许它们随时间调整方向反转概率，观察其对流动性和堵塞的影响。

Result: 机器人群通过局部学习和调整反转概率，显著改善了流动性和任务性能，减少了堵塞现象。

Conclusion: 简单的局部学习规则可以有效缓解高密度群体中的堵塞问题，为生物和机器人群体提供了新的研究思路。

Abstract: Social organisms which construct nests consisting of tunnels and chambers
necessarily navigate confined and crowded conditions. Unlike low-density
collectives like bird flocks and insect swarms, in which hydrodynamic and
statistical phenomena dominate, the physics of glasses and supercooled fluids
is important to understand clogging behaviors in high-density collectives. Our
previous work revealed that fire ants flowing in confined tunnels utilize
diverse behaviors like unequal workload distributions, spontaneous direction
reversals, and limited interaction times to mitigate clogging and jamming and
thus maintain functional flow; implementation of similar rules in a small
robophysical swarm led to high performance through spontaneous dissolution of
clogs and clusters. However, how the insects learn such behaviors, and how we
can develop "task capable" active matter in such regimes, remains a challenge
in part because interaction dynamics are dominated by local, time-consuming
collisions and no single agent can guide the entire collective. Here, we
hypothesized that effective flow and clog mitigation could emerge purely
through local learning. We tasked small groups of robots with pellet excavation
in a narrow tunnel, allowing them to modify reversal probabilities over time.
Initially, robots had equal probabilities and clogs were common. Reversals
improved flow. When reversal probabilities adapted via collisions and noisy
tunnel length estimates, workload inequality and performance improved. Our
robophysical study of an excavating swarm shows that, despite the seeming
complexity and difficulty of the task, simple learning rules can mitigate or
leverage unavoidable features in task-capable dense active matter, leading to
hypotheses for dense biological and robotic swarms.

Main category: cs.RO

TLDR: 提出了一种名为“主动接触响应”（ACR）的故障容忍技术，用于多机器人系统中，通过物理接触交互提升协调能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人在共享工作空间中协作时，个体故障可能严重影响整体性能，尤其是在缺乏全局信息或直接通信的情况下。

Method: 采用ACR方法，机器人根据遇到故障同伴的可能性调整行为，主动重新定位故障同伴以减少障碍。

Result: 实验表明，ACR显著缩短了系统从故障中恢复的时间，保持了集体挖掘任务的性能。

Conclusion: 通过局部、社交和物理交互，可以增强多机器人系统在受限环境中的故障容忍和协调能力。

Abstract: As robots are increasingly deployed to collaborate on tasks within shared
workspaces and resources, the failure of an individual robot can critically
affect the group's performance. This issue is particularly challenging when
robots lack global information or direct communication, relying instead on
social interaction for coordination and to complete their tasks. In this study,
we propose a novel fault-tolerance technique leveraging physical contact
interactions in multi-robot systems, specifically under conditions of limited
sensing and spatial confinement. We introduce the "Active Contact Response"
(ACR) method, where each robot modulates its behavior based on the likelihood
of encountering an inoperative (faulty) robot. Active robots are capable of
collectively repositioning stationary and faulty peers to reduce obstructions
and maintain optimal group functionality. We implement our algorithm in a team
of autonomous robots, equipped with contact-sensing and collision-tolerance
capabilities, tasked with collectively excavating cohesive model pellets.
Experimental results indicate that the ACR method significantly improves the
system's recovery time from robot failures, enabling continued collective
excavation with minimal performance degradation. Thus, this work demonstrates
the potential of leveraging local, social, and physical interactions to enhance
fault tolerance and coordination in multi-robot systems operating in
constrained and extreme environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TLDR: 提出一种基于气流惯性的里程计系统，融合多传感器数据（热风速计、IMU、ESC、气压计），通过GRU神经网络和观测器估计飞行器状态，有效减少位置漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低成本IMU和气压计存在显著偏差，风速计易受螺旋桨和地面效应干扰，需解决这些问题以实现精确飞行速度估计。

Method: 使用GRU神经网络从噪声风速数据估计相对风速，结合观测器和偏差模型融合传感器数据。

Result: 在无风室内环境中，成功解耦螺旋桨下洗气流和地面效应，位置漂移仅5.7米（203秒随机飞行）。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效估计飞行速度和传感器偏差，显著提升里程计精度，代码已开源。

Abstract: This work demonstrates an airflow inertial based odometry system with
multi-sensor data fusion, including thermal anemometer, IMU, ESC, and
barometer. This goal is challenging because low-cost IMUs and barometers have
significant bias, and anemometer measurements are very susceptible to
interference from spinning propellers and ground effects. We employ a GRU-based
deep neural network to estimate relative air speed from noisy and disturbed
anemometer measurements, and an observer with bias model to fuse the sensor
data and thus estimate the state of aerial vehicle. A complete flight data,
including takeoff and landing on the ground, shows that the approach is able to
decouple the downwash induced wind speed caused by propellers and the ground
effect, and accurately estimate the flight speed in a wind-free indoor
environment. IMU, and barometer bias are effectively estimated, which
significantly reduces the position integration drift, which is only 5.7m for
203s manual random flight. The open source is available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人从人类演示中学习操作技能虽快速，但泛化能力不足，尤其在复杂灵巧操作任务中。VLA范式因数据稀缺性能受限，需改进。

Method: OFA利用灵巧操作任务中一致的末端轨迹，采用分层流程：对象感知与位姿估计、预操作位姿到达和OFA策略执行。

Result: 在七项任务中，OFA在位置和背景泛化测试中显著优于基线方法，仅需10次演示即可实现稳健性能。

Conclusion: OFA是一种数据高效且泛化能力强的灵巧操作方法，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Robot manipulation learning from human demonstrations offers a rapid means to
acquire skills but often lacks generalization across diverse scenes and object
placements. This limitation hinders real-world applications, particularly in
complex tasks requiring dexterous manipulation. Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
paradigm leverages large-scale data to enhance generalization. However, due to
data scarcity, VLA's performance remains limited. In this work, we introduce
Object-Focus Actor (OFA), a novel, data-efficient approach for generalized
dexterous manipulation. OFA exploits the consistent end trajectories observed
in dexterous manipulation tasks, allowing for efficient policy training. Our
method employs a hierarchical pipeline: object perception and pose estimation,
pre-manipulation pose arrival and OFA policy execution. This process ensures
that the manipulation is focused and efficient, even in varied backgrounds and
positional layout. Comprehensive real-world experiments across seven tasks
demonstrate that OFA significantly outperforms baseline methods in both
positional and background generalization tests. Notably, OFA achieves robust
performance with only 10 demonstrations, highlighting its data efficiency.

Motivation: 现有研究多集中于全身体位预测或运动轨迹预测，少有尝试将两者结合，因此提出一种统一方法以填补这一空白。

Method: 采用现成的3D人体姿势估计模块、图注意力网络编码骨架结构，以及紧凑的非自回归Transformer，实现实时运动预测。

Abstract: We introduce a unified approach to forecast the dynamics of human keypoints
along with the motion trajectory based on a short sequence of input poses.
While many studies address either full-body pose prediction or motion
trajectory prediction, only a few attempt to merge them. We propose a motion
transformation technique to simultaneously predict full-body pose and
trajectory key-points in a global coordinate frame. We utilize an off-the-shelf
3D human pose estimation module, a graph attention network to encode the
skeleton structure, and a compact, non-autoregressive transformer suitable for
real-time motion prediction for human-robot interaction and human-aware
navigation. We introduce a human navigation dataset ``DARKO'' with specific
focus on navigational activities that are relevant for human-aware mobile robot
navigation. We perform extensive evaluation on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and our
DARKO dataset. In comparison to prior work, we show that our approach is
compact, real-time, and accurate in predicting human navigation motion across
all datasets. Result animations, our dataset, and code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的管道需要手动调整且难以适应复杂的内窥镜意图，导致泛化能力差。VLA模型提供了一种端到端的解决方案，但应用于机器人内窥镜时面临复杂动态解剖环境的挑战。

Method: 提出EndoVLA系统，结合视觉感知、语言基础和动作规划，通过监督微调和强化微调的双阶段策略解决数据稀缺和领域偏移问题。

Result: EndoVLA显著提升了内窥镜跟踪性能，并在多样场景和复杂顺序任务中实现了零样本泛化。

Conclusion: EndoVLA为内窥镜手术提供了一种高效、自适应的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In endoscopic procedures, autonomous tracking of abnormal regions and
following circumferential cutting markers can significantly reduce the
cognitive burden on endoscopists. However, conventional model-based pipelines
are fragile for each component (e.g., detection, motion planning) requires
manual tuning and struggles to incorporate high-level endoscopic intent,
leading to poor generalization across diverse scenes. Vision-Language-Action
(VLA) models, which integrate visual perception, language grounding, and motion
planning within an end-to-end framework, offer a promising alternative by
semantically adapting to surgeon prompts without manual recalibration. Despite
their potential, applying VLA models to robotic endoscopy presents unique
challenges due to the complex and dynamic anatomical environments of the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. To address this, we introduce EndoVLA, designed
specifically for continuum robots in GI interventions. Given endoscopic images
and surgeon-issued tracking prompts, EndoVLA performs three core tasks: (1)
polyp tracking, (2) delineation and following of abnormal mucosal regions, and
(3) adherence to circular markers during circumferential cutting. To tackle
data scarcity and domain shifts, we propose a dual-phase strategy comprising
supervised fine-tuning on our EndoVLA-Motion dataset and reinforcement
fine-tuning with task-aware rewards. Our approach significantly improves
tracking performance in endoscopy and enables zero-shot generalization in
diverse scenes and complex sequential tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过度转向可能导致严重交通事故，现有方法依赖专家轨迹或假设无障碍环境，实用性有限。

Method: 提出QC-SAC混合学习算法，从次优演示数据中学习并快速适应新条件。

Result: QC-SAC在实验中实现了接近最优的驾驶策略，显著优于现有基准。

Conclusion: QC-SAC首次实现了安全的自动驾驶过度转向控制和避障。

Abstract: Oversteer, wherein a vehicle's rear tires lose traction and induce
unintentional excessive yaw, poses critical safety challenges. Failing to
control oversteer often leads to severe traffic accidents. Although recent
autonomous driving efforts have attempted to handle oversteer through
stabilizing maneuvers, the majority rely on expert-defined trajectories or
assume obstacle-free environments, limiting real-world applicability. This
paper introduces a novel end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving approach that
tackles oversteer control and collision avoidance simultaneously. Existing E2E
techniques, including Imitation Learning (IL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and
Hybrid Learning (HL), generally require near-optimal demonstrations or
extensive experience. Yet even skilled human drivers struggle to provide
perfect demonstrations under oversteer, and high transition variance hinders
accumulating sufficient data. Hence, we present Q-Compared Soft Actor-Critic
(QC-SAC), a new HL algorithm that effectively learns from suboptimal
demonstration data and adapts rapidly to new conditions. To evaluate QC-SAC, we
introduce a benchmark inspired by real-world driver training: a vehicle
encounters sudden oversteer on a slippery surface and must avoid randomly
placed obstacles ahead. Experimental results show QC-SAC attains near-optimal
driving policies, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art IL, RL, and HL
baselines. Our method demonstrates the world's first safe autonomous oversteer
control with obstacle avoidance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving, yet their
struggle with hallucinations, inefficient reasoning, and limited real-world
validation hinders accurate perception and robust step-by-step reasoning. To
overcome this, we introduce \textbf{AgentThink}, a pioneering unified framework
that, for the first time, integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with
dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's
core innovations include: \textbf{(i) Structured Data Generation}, by
establishing an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct
structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage
for diverse driving scenarios; \textbf{(ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline},
employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and
\textbf{(iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation}, introducing a novel
multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool
invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark
demonstrate AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by
\textbf{53.91\%} and enhances answer accuracy by \textbf{33.54\%}, while
markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation
studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various
benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities. These findings highlight a
promising trajectory for developing trustworthy and tool-aware autonomous
driving models.

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作模型在跨任务泛化能力方面研究不足，限制了其在开放世界中的通用机器人操作应用。

Method: 提出AGNOSTOS模拟基准，包含23个未见任务；提出X-ICM方法，利用大语言模型和动态引导样本选择策略提升泛化能力。

Result: 当前模型在AGNOSTOS上表现不佳，X-ICM显著提升了零样本泛化性能。

Conclusion: AGNOSTOS和X-ICM为通用机器人操作研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of vision-language-action (VLA) models to
unseen tasks are crucial to achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation in
open-world settings. However, the cross-task generalization capabilities of
existing VLA models remain significantly underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce AGNOSTOS, a novel simulation benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate cross-task zero-shot generalization in manipulation. AGNOSTOS
comprises 23 unseen manipulation tasks for testing, distinct from common
training task distributions, and incorporates two levels of generalization
difficulty to assess robustness. Our systematic evaluation reveals that current
VLA models, despite being trained on diverse datasets, struggle to generalize
effectively to these unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Cross-Task In-Context Manipulation (X-ICM), a method that conditions large
language models (LLMs) on in-context demonstrations from seen tasks to predict
action sequences for unseen tasks. Additionally, we introduce a dynamics-guided
sample selection strategy that identifies relevant demonstrations by capturing
cross-task dynamics. On AGNOSTOS, X-ICM significantly improves cross-task
zero-shot generalization performance over leading VLAs. We believe AGNOSTOS and
X-ICM will serve as valuable tools for advancing general-purpose robotic
manipulation.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在机器人领域的应用局限于静态、基于提示的行为，难以处理复杂任务。受人类元认知学习和创造性问题解决的启发，研究旨在探索LLMs是否可以通过元认知能力增强其任务表现。

Method: 提出一个早期框架，将元认知学习融入LLM驱动的多机器人协作中，包括技能分解和自我反思机制。

Conclusion: 元认知学习能够促进机器人规划的创造性，为LLMs在机器人领域的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential across various
domains, their applications in robotics remain largely limited to static,
prompt-based behaviors and still face challenges in handling complex tasks
under zero-shot or few-shot settings. Inspired by human metacognitive learning
and creative problem-solving, we address this limitation by exploring a
fundamental research question: Can LLMs be empowered with metacognitive
capabilities to reason, reflect, and create, thereby enhancing their ability to
perform robotic tasks with minimal demonstrations? In this paper, we present an
early-stage framework that integrates metacognitive learning into LLM-powered
multi-robot collaboration. The proposed framework equips the LLM-powered
robotic agents with a skill decomposition and self-reflection mechanism that
identifies modular skills from prior tasks, reflects on failures in unseen task
scenarios, and synthesizes effective new solutions. Experimental results show
that our metacognitive-learning-empowered LLM framework significantly
outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, we observe that the framework is
capable of generating solutions that differ from the ground truth yet still
successfully complete the tasks. These exciting findings support our hypothesis
that metacognitive learning can foster creativity in robotic planning.

Conclusion: Robo2VLM-1能有效评估和提升VLMs在空间和交互推理方面的能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) acquire real-world knowledge and general
reasoning ability through Internet-scale image-text corpora. They can augment
robotic systems with scene understanding and task planning, and assist
visuomotor policies that are trained on robot trajectory data. We explore the
reverse paradigm - using rich, real, multi-modal robot trajectory data to
enhance and evaluate VLMs. In this paper, we present Robo2VLM, a Visual
Question Answering (VQA) dataset generation framework for VLMs. Given a human
tele-operated robot trajectory, Robo2VLM derives ground-truth from non-visual
and non-descriptive sensory modalities, such as end-effector pose, gripper
aperture, and force sensing. Based on these modalities, it segments the robot
trajectory into a sequence of manipulation phases. At each phase, Robo2VLM uses
scene and interaction understanding to identify 3D properties of the robot,
task goal, and the target object. The properties are used to generate
representative VQA queries - images with textural multiple-choice questions -
based on spatial, goal-conditioned, and interaction reasoning question
templates. We curate Robo2VLM-1, a large-scale in-the-wild dataset with 684,710
questions covering 463 distinct scenes and 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks
from 176k real robot trajectories. Results suggest that Robo2VLM-1 can
benchmark and improve VLM capabilities in spatial and interaction reasoning.

Motivation: 当前大型机器人数据集的管理和加载存在挑战，Robo-DM旨在解决这些问题。

Result: Robo-DM在压缩和加载速度上显著优于现有格式（如RLDS和LeRobot），且不影响任务准确性。

Conclusion: Robo-DM是一种高效的数据管理工具，适用于机器人学习任务。

Abstract: Recent results suggest that very large datasets of teleoperated robot
demonstrations can be used to train transformer-based models that have the
potential to generalize to new scenes, robots, and tasks. However, curating,
distributing, and loading large datasets of robot trajectories, which typically
consist of video, textual, and numerical modalities - including streams from
multiple cameras - remains challenging. We propose Robo-DM, an efficient
open-source cloud-based data management toolkit for collecting, sharing, and
learning with robot data. With Robo-DM, robot datasets are stored in a
self-contained format with Extensible Binary Meta Language (EBML). Robo-DM can
significantly reduce the size of robot trajectory data, transfer costs, and
data load time during training. Compared to the RLDS format used in OXE
datasets, Robo-DM's compression saves space by up to 70x (lossy) and 3.5x
(lossless). Robo-DM also accelerates data retrieval by load-balancing video
decoding with memory-mapped decoding caches. Compared to LeRobot, a framework
that also uses lossy video compression, Robo-DM is up to 50x faster when
decoding sequentially. We physically evaluate a model trained by Robo-DM with
lossy compression, a pick-and-place task, and In-Context Robot Transformer.
Robo-DM uses 75x compression of the original dataset and does not suffer
reduction in downstream task accuracy.

Abstract: Generalizing control policies to novel embodiments remains a fundamental
challenge in enabling scalable and transferable learning in robotics. While
prior works have explored this in locomotion, a systematic study in the context
of manipulation tasks remains limited, partly due to the lack of standardized
benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for learning
cross-embodiment manipulation, focusing on two foundational tasks-reach and
push-across a diverse range of morphologies. The benchmark is designed to test
generalization along three axes: interpolation (testing performance within a
robot category that shares the same link structure), extrapolation (testing on
a robot with a different link structure), and composition (testing on
combinations of link structures). On the benchmark, we evaluate the ability of
different RL policies to learn from multiple morphologies and to generalize to
novel ones. Our study aims to answer whether morphology-aware training can
outperform single-embodiment baselines, whether zero-shot generalization to
unseen morphologies is feasible, and how consistently these patterns hold
across different generalization regimes. The results highlight the current
limitations of multi-embodiment learning and provide insights into how
architectural and training design choices influence policy generalization.

Abstract: Robots in the real world need to perceive and move to goals in complex
environments without collisions. Avoiding collisions is especially difficult
when relying on sensor perception and when goals are among clutter. Diffusion
policies and other generative models have shown strong performance in solving
local planning problems, but often struggle at avoiding all of the subtle
constraint violations that characterize truly challenging global motion
planning problems. In this work, we propose an approach for learning global
motion planning using diffusion policies, allowing the robot to generate full
trajectories through complex scenes and reasoning about multiple obstacles
along the path. Our approach uses cascaded hierarchical models which unify
global prediction and local refinement together with online plan repair to
ensure the trajectories are collision free. Our method outperforms (by ~5%) a
wide variety of baselines on challenging tasks in multiple domains including
navigation and manipulation.

Result: 在模拟环境、用户研究和真实机器人系统中，CBTL比基线方法更高效地实现个性化。

Conclusion: CBTL为持续、灵活、主动且安全的机器人个性化提供了统一实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalist robots must personalize in-the-wild to meet the diverse needs and
preferences of long-term users. How can we enable flexible personalization
without sacrificing safety or competency? This paper proposes Coloring Between
the Lines (CBTL), a method for personalization that exploits the null space of
constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) used in robot planning. CBTL begins
with a CSP generator that ensures safe and competent behavior, then
incrementally personalizes behavior by learning parameterized constraints from
online interaction. By quantifying uncertainty and leveraging the
compositionality of planning constraints, CBTL achieves sample-efficient
adaptation without environment resets. We evaluate CBTL in (1) three diverse
simulation environments; (2) a web-based user study; and (3) a real-robot
assisted feeding system, finding that CBTL consistently achieves more effective
personalization with fewer interactions than baselines. Our results demonstrate
that CBTL provides a unified and practical approach for continual, flexible,
active, and safe robot personalization. Website:

TLDR: FLARE是一种轻量级框架，通过将扩散变换器与未来观测的潜在表示对齐，提升机器人策略学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将预测性潜在世界建模整合到机器人策略学习中，以解决长期推理问题。

Method: 通过扩散变换器与未来观测的潜在嵌入对齐，仅需少量架构修改。

Result: 在两个多任务模拟基准测试中表现优异，性能提升达26%，并能通过人类视频演示提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: FLARE是一种通用且可扩展的方法，结合了隐式世界建模与高频机器人控制。

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{F}$uture $\textbf{LA}$tent $\textbf{RE}$presentation
Alignment ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel framework that integrates predictive
latent world modeling into robot policy learning. By aligning features from a
diffusion transformer with latent embeddings of future observations,
$\textbf{FLARE}$ enables a diffusion transformer policy to anticipate latent
representations of future observations, allowing it to reason about long-term
consequences while generating actions. Remarkably lightweight, $\textbf{FLARE}$
requires only minimal architectural modifications -- adding a few tokens to
standard vision-language-action (VLA) models -- yet delivers substantial
performance gains. Across two challenging multitask simulation imitation
learning benchmarks spanning single-arm and humanoid tabletop manipulation,
$\textbf{FLARE}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior
policy learning baselines by up to 26%. Moreover, $\textbf{FLARE}$ unlocks the
ability to co-train with human egocentric video demonstrations without action
labels, significantly boosting policy generalization to a novel object with
unseen geometry with as few as a single robot demonstration. Our results
establish $\textbf{FLARE}$ as a general and scalable approach for combining
implicit world modeling with high-frequency robotic control.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的LLM-Hinted RL范式HCRMP，通过语义提示增强RL，解决LLM幻觉问题，提升自动驾驶性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主导的RL方法过度依赖易产生幻觉的LLM输出，影响驾驶策略性能，需保持LLM与RL的相对独立性。

Method: 提出HCRMP架构，包含语义增强模块、上下文稳定性锚模块和语义缓存模块，结合LLM低频指导与RL高频控制。

Result: 在CARLA实验中，HCRMP任务成功率高达80.3%，安全关键条件下碰撞率降低11.4%。

Conclusion: HCRMP通过LLM语义提示与RL结合，显著提升复杂场景下的自动驾驶性能。

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) can
enhance autonomous driving (AD) performance in complex scenarios. However,
current LLM-Dominated RL methods over-rely on LLM outputs, which are prone to
hallucinations.Evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM indicates a
non-hallucination rate of only approximately 57.95% when assessed on essential
driving-related tasks. Thus, in these methods, hallucinations from the LLM can
directly jeopardize the performance of driving policies. This paper argues that
maintaining relative independence between the LLM and the RL is vital for
solving the hallucinations problem. Consequently, this paper is devoted to
propose a novel LLM-Hinted RL paradigm. The LLM is used to generate semantic
hints for state augmentation and policy optimization to assist RL agent in
motion planning, while the RL agent counteracts potential erroneous semantic
indications through policy learning to achieve excellent driving performance.
Based on this paradigm, we propose the HCRMP (LLM-Hinted Contextual
Reinforcement Learning Motion Planner) architecture, which is designed that
includes Augmented Semantic Representation Module to extend state space.
Contextual Stability Anchor Module enhances the reliability of multi-critic
weight hints by utilizing information from the knowledge base. Semantic Cache
Module is employed to seamlessly integrate LLM low-frequency guidance with RL
high-frequency control. Extensive experiments in CARLA validate HCRMP's strong
overall driving performance. HCRMP achieves a task success rate of up to 80.3%
under diverse driving conditions with different traffic densities. Under
safety-critical driving conditions, HCRMP significantly reduces the collision
rate by 11.4%, which effectively improves the driving performance in complex
scenarios.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TLDR: 该研究开发了一种深度学习模型，利用H&E染色活检图像预测TNBC患者对新辅助化疗（NACT）的反应，模型表现优异，并揭示了与免疫生物标志物相关的预测区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TNBC缺乏靶向治疗选项，NACT反应预测对优化治疗和改善患者预后至关重要。

Method: 使用深度学习模型分析H&E染色活检图像，结合mIHC数据验证预测区域。

Result: 模型在五折交叉验证中表现优异（准确率82%，AUC 0.86），预测区域与PD-L1表达、CD8+ T细胞浸润和CD163+巨噬细胞密度相关。

Conclusion: 结合IHC免疫分析数据可提升模型解释性和预测性能，为TNBC个性化治疗提供新方向。

Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype defined by the
lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, resulting in limited targeted
treatment options. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is the standard treatment
for early-stage TNBC, with pathologic complete response (pCR) serving as a key
prognostic marker; however, only 40-50% of patients with TNBC achieve pCR.
Accurate prediction of NACT response is crucial to optimize therapy, avoid
ineffective treatments, and improve patient outcomes. In this study, we
developed a deep learning model to predict NACT response using pre-treatment
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy images. Our model achieved promising
results in five-fold cross-validation (accuracy: 82%, AUC: 0.86, F1-score:
0.84, sensitivity: 0.85, specificity: 0.81, precision: 0.80). Analysis of model
attention maps in conjunction with multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) data
revealed that regions of high predictive importance consistently colocalized
with tumor areas showing elevated PD-L1 expression, CD8+ T-cell infiltration,
and CD163+ macrophage density - all established biomarkers of treatment
response. Our findings indicate that incorporating IHC-derived immune profiling
data could substantially improve model interpretability and predictive
performance. Furthermore, this approach may accelerate the discovery of novel
histopathological biomarkers for NACT and advance the development of
personalized treatment strategies for TNBC patients.

TLDR: 该研究通过结合数据驱动的机器学习和物理模型，开发了混合模型用于临界热通量（CHF）预测，显著降低了误差，提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CHF预测对核反应堆的安全和效率至关重要，但传统经验关联式存在局限性，机器学习方法虽有效但缺乏可解释性和物理知识。

Method: 研究结合纯数据驱动的机器学习模型和两种混合模型（基于Biasi和Bowring CHF关联式），通过Fortran框架集成到CTF子通道代码中。

Result: 混合模型在验证案例中表现出显著较低的误差，纯机器学习模型也表现良好，减少了CHF的过预测趋势。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型可有效集成到子通道代码中，性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the transition from nucleate to film boiling,
where heat transfer to the working fluid can rapidly deteriorate. Accurate CHF
prediction is essential for efficiency, safety, and preventing equipment
damage, particularly in nuclear reactors. Although widely used, empirical
correlations frequently exhibit discrepancies in comparison with experimental
data, limiting their reliability in diverse operational conditions. Traditional
machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated the potential for CHF
prediction but have often suffered from limited interpretability, data
scarcity, and insufficient knowledge of physical principles. Hybrid model
approaches, which combine data-driven ML with physics-based models, mitigate
these concerns by incorporating prior knowledge of the domain. This study
integrated a purely data-driven ML model and two hybrid models (using the Biasi
and Bowring CHF correlations) within the CTF subchannel code via a custom
Fortran framework. Performance was evaluated using two validation cases: a
subset of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission CHF database and the Bennett dryout
experiments. In both cases, the hybrid models exhibited significantly lower
error metrics in comparison with conventional empirical correlations. The pure
ML model remained competitive with the hybrid models. Trend analysis of error
parity indicates that ML-based models reduce the tendency for CHF
overprediction, improving overall accuracy. These results demonstrate that
ML-based CHF models can be effectively integrated into subchannel codes and can
potentially increase performance in comparison with conventional methods.

TLDR: 该研究开发了一个名为LCP1.0的病理生物学词典，用于将复杂的影像特征转化为临床可解释的肝癌诊断工具，并通过专家验证提升了AI模型的透明度和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医学诊断中潜力巨大，但缺乏可解释性和泛化性限制了其临床应用。本研究旨在通过开发LCP1.0词典，解决这一问题。

Method: 使用QuPath和PyRadiomics提取肝癌组织的影像特征，结合特征选择算法和SVM模型，筛选出与WHO分级系统相关的关键特征。

Result: SVM模型结合特征选择算法达到最高准确率（0.80），筛选出20个关键特征，主要与肿瘤分级和预后相关。

Conclusion: LCP1.0为AI输出与专家解释之间提供了临床验证的桥梁，提升了肝癌病理诊断工具的可解释性和可信度。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds strong potential for medical diagnostics,
yet its clinical adoption is limited by a lack of interpretability and
generalizability. This study introduces the Pathobiological Dictionary for
Liver Cancer (LCP1.0), a practical framework designed to translate complex
Pathomics and Radiomics Features (PF and RF) into clinically meaningful
insights aligned with existing diagnostic workflows. QuPath and PyRadiomics,
standardized according to IBSI guidelines, were used to extract 333 imaging
features from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue samples, including 240
PF-based-cell detection/intensity, 74 RF-based texture, and 19 RF-based
first-order features. Expert-defined ROIs from the public dataset excluded
artifact-prone areas, and features were aggregated at the case level. Their
relevance to the WHO grading system was assessed using multiple classifiers
linked with feature selectors. The resulting dictionary was validated by 8
experts in oncology and pathology. In collaboration with 10 domain experts, we
developed a Pathobiological dictionary of imaging features such as PFs and RF.
In our study, the Variable Threshold feature selection algorithm combined with
the SVM model achieved the highest accuracy (0.80, P-value less than 0.05),
selecting 20 key features, primarily clinical and pathomics traits such as
Centroid, Cell Nucleus, and Cytoplasmic characteristics. These features,
particularly nuclear and cytoplasmic, were strongly associated with tumor
grading and prognosis, reflecting atypia indicators like pleomorphism,
hyperchromasia, and cellular orientation.The LCP1.0 provides a clinically
validated bridge between AI outputs and expert interpretation, enhancing model
transparency and usability. Aligning AI-derived features with clinical
semantics supports the development of interpretable, trustworthy diagnostic
tools for liver cancer pathology.

Motivation: 重新理解海马体中位置细胞的集体编码机制，提出一种更高效、生物可信的空间导航框架。

Result: 模型成功捕捉了位置细胞的特性（如场大小分布、适应性和重映射），并在复杂环境中实现了高效导航。

Conclusion: 通过集体转移概率建模，提供了一个生物可信且可扩展的空间导航框架。

Abstract: The hippocampus orchestrates spatial navigation through collective place cell
encodings that form cognitive maps. We reconceptualize the population of place
cells as position embeddings approximating multi-scale symmetric random walk
transition kernels: the inner product $\langle h(x, t), h(y, t) \rangle =
q(y|x, t)$ represents normalized transition probabilities, where $h(x, t)$ is
the embedding at location $ x $, and $q(y|x, t)$ is the normalized symmetric
transition probability over time $t$. The time parameter $\sqrt{t}$ defines a
spatial scale hierarchy, mirroring the hippocampal dorsoventral axis. $q(y|x,
t)$ defines spatial adjacency between $x$ and $y$ at scale or resolution
$\sqrt{t}$, and the pairwise adjacency relationships $(q(y|x, t), \forall x,
y)$ are reduced into individual embeddings $(h(x, t), \forall x)$ that
collectively form a map of the environment at sale $\sqrt{t}$. Our framework
employs gradient ascent on $q(y|x, t) = \langle h(x, t), h(y, t)\rangle$ with
adaptive scale selection, choosing the time scale with maximal gradient at each
step for trap-free, smooth trajectories. Efficient matrix squaring $P_{2t} =
P_t^2$ builds global representations from local transitions $P_1$ without
memorizing past trajectories, enabling hippocampal preplay-like path planning.
This produces robust navigation through complex environments, aligning with
hippocampal navigation. Experimental results show that our model captures place
cell properties -- field size distribution, adaptability, and remapping --
while achieving computational efficiency. By modeling collective transition
probabilities rather than individual place fields, we offer a biologically
plausible, scalable framework for spatial navigation.

Result: 在三种代表性网络模型中验证了方案的有效性，包括同质和异构的非相同相位振荡器网络，以及异构的非相同混沌振荡器网络。

Conclusion: 多功能储备池计算能够有效维持异构复杂网络的动态，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: A new machine learning scheme, termed versatile reservoir computing, is
proposed for sustaining the dynamics of heterogeneous complex networks. We show
that a single, small-scale reservoir computer trained on time series from a
subset of elements is able to replicate the dynamics of any element in a
large-scale complex network, though the elements are of different intrinsic
parameters and connectivities. Furthermore, by substituting failed elements
with the trained machine, we demonstrate that the collective dynamics of the
network can be preserved accurately over a finite time horizon. The capability
and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are validated on three representative
network models: a homogeneous complex network of non-identical phase
oscillators, a heterogeneous complex network of non-identical phase
oscillators, and a heterogeneous complex network of non-identical chaotic
oscillators.

Result: 在20名局灶性癫痫患者的EEG数据上表现优于非对抗方法，实现了跨患者高检测准确率。

Conclusion: 域对抗训练与时序建模结合，实现了跨患者的鲁棒癫痫发作检测。

Abstract: Automated epileptic seizure detection from electroencephalogram (EEG) remains
challenging due to significant individual differences in EEG patterns across
patients. While existing studies achieve high accuracy with patient-specific
approaches, they face difficulties in generalizing to new patients. To address
this, we propose a detection framework combining domain adversarial training
with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term
memory (BiLSTM). First, the CNN extracts local patient-invariant features
through domain adversarial training, which optimizes seizure detection accuracy
while minimizing patient-specific characteristics. Then, the BiLSTM captures
temporal dependencies in the extracted features to model seizure evolution
patterns. Evaluation using EEG recordings from 20 patients with focal epilepsy
demonstrated superior performance over non-adversarial methods, achieving high
detection accuracy across different patients. The integration of adversarial
training with temporal modeling enables robust cross-patient seizure detection.

Abstract: Electromyogram (EMG) signals recorded from the skin surface enable intuitive
control of assistive devices such as prosthetic limbs. However, in EMG-based
motion recognition, collecting comprehensive training data for all target
motions remains challenging, particularly for complex combined motions. This
paper proposes a method to efficiently recognize combined motions using
synthetic EMG data generated through convex combinations of basic motion
patterns. Instead of measuring all possible combined motions, the proposed
method utilizes measured basic motion data along with synthetically combined
motion data for training. This approach expands the range of recognizable
combined motions while minimizing the required training data collection. We
evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method through an upper limb motion
classification experiment with eight subjects. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method improved the classification accuracy for
unseen combined motions by approximately 17%.

Conclusion: 该方法通过迁移方差信息，显著减少了目标受试者的数据需求，提升了分类效率。

Abstract: In electromyogram (EMG)-based motion recognition, a subject-specific
classifier is typically trained with sufficient labeled data. However, this
process demands extensive data collection over extended periods, burdening the
subject. To address this, utilizing information from pre-training on multiple
subjects for the training of the target subject could be beneficial. This paper
proposes an inter-subject variance transfer learning method based on a Bayesian
approach. This method is founded on the simple hypothesis that while the means
of EMG features vary greatly across subjects, their variances may exhibit
similar patterns. Our approach transfers variance information, acquired through
pre-training on multiple source subjects, to a target subject within a Bayesian
updating framework, thereby allowing accurate classification using limited
target calibration data. A coefficient was also introduced to adjust the amount
of information transferred for efficient transfer learning. Experimental
evaluations using two EMG datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our
variance transfer strategy and its superiority compared to existing methods.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，DisCo显著优于五种基线方法。

Conclusion: DisCo为冷启动推荐提供了有前景的框架和关键视角。

Abstract: Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a set of items to each user. However,
the sparser interactions between users and bundles raise a big challenge,
especially in cold-start scenarios. Traditional collaborative filtering methods
do not work well for this kind of problem because these models rely on
interactions to update the latent embedding, which is hard to work in a
cold-start setting. We propose a new approach (DisCo), which relies on a
personalized Diffusion backbone, enhanced by disentangled aspects for the
user's interest, to generate a bundle in distribution space for each user to
tackle the cold-start challenge. During the training phase, DisCo adjusts an
additional objective loss term to avoid bias, a prevalent issue while using the
generative model for top-$K$ recommendation purposes. Our empirical experiments
show that DisCo outperforms five comparative baselines by a large margin on
three real-world datasets. Thereby, this study devises a promising framework
and essential viewpoints in cold-start recommendation. Our materials for
reproducibility are available at: https://github.com/bt-nghia/DisCo.

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，ThinkRec显著提高了推荐的准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ThinkRec通过理性推理和个性化路径适应，为LLM4Rec提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled more
semantic-aware recommendations through natural language generation. Existing
LLM for recommendation (LLM4Rec) methods mostly operate in a System 1-like
manner, relying on superficial features to match similar items based on click
history, rather than reasoning through deeper behavioral logic. This often
leads to superficial and erroneous recommendations. Motivated by this, we
propose ThinkRec, a thinking-based framework that shifts LLM4Rec from System 1
to System 2 (rational system). Technically, ThinkRec introduces a thinking
activation mechanism that augments item metadata with keyword summarization and
injects synthetic reasoning traces, guiding the model to form interpretable
reasoning chains that consist of analyzing interaction histories, identifying
user preferences, and making decisions based on target items. On top of this,
we propose an instance-wise expert fusion mechanism to reduce the reasoning
difficulty. By dynamically assigning weights to expert models based on users'
latent features, ThinkRec adapts its reasoning path to individual users,
thereby enhancing precision and personalization. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that ThinkRec significantly improves the
accuracy and interpretability of recommendations. Our implementations are
available in anonymous Github: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ThinkRec_LLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高文档频率词项会增加检索延迟，现有方法如FLOPS正则化无法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出DF-FLOPS正则化技术，惩罚高DF词项的使用，缩短倒排索引的列表长度。

Result: DF-FLOPS显著减少了高DF词项的出现，检索延迟降低约10倍，同时保持检索效果（MRR@10仅下降2.2点）。

Conclusion: DF-FLOPS使LSR模型在检索延迟上与BM25相当，为实际部署提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) models encode text as weighted term vectors,
which need to be sparse to leverage inverted index structures during retrieval.
SPLADE, the most popular LSR model, uses FLOPS regularization to encourage
vector sparsity during training. However, FLOPS regularization does not ensure
sparsity among terms - only within a given query or document. Terms with very
high Document Frequencies (DFs) substantially increase latency in production
retrieval engines, such as Apache Solr, due to their lengthy posting lists. To
address the issue of high DFs, we present a new variant of FLOPS
regularization: DF-FLOPS. This new regularization technique penalizes the usage
of high-DF terms, thereby shortening posting lists and reducing retrieval
latency. Unlike other inference-time sparsification methods, such as stopword
removal, DF-FLOPS regularization allows for the selective inclusion of
high-frequency terms in cases where the terms are truly salient. We find that
DF-FLOPS successfully reduces the prevalence of high-DF terms and lowers
retrieval latency (around 10x faster) in a production-grade engine while
maintaining effectiveness both in-domain (only a 2.2-point drop in MRR@10) and
cross-domain (improved performance in 12 out of 13 tasks on which we tested).
With retrieval latencies on par with BM25, this work provides an important step
towards making LSR practical for deployment in production-grade search engines.

Abstract: Mathematical Information Retrieval (MIR) is the task of retrieving
information from mathematical documents and plays a key role in various
applications, including theorem search in mathematical libraries, answer
retrieval on math forums, and premise selection in automated theorem proving.
However, a unified benchmark for evaluating these diverse retrieval tasks has
been lacking. In this paper, we introduce MIRB (Mathematical Information
Retrieval Benchmark) to assess the MIR capabilities of retrieval models. MIRB
includes four tasks: semantic statement retrieval, question-answer retrieval,
premise retrieval, and formula retrieval, spanning a total of 12 datasets. We
evaluate 13 retrieval models on this benchmark and analyze the challenges
inherent to MIR. We hope that MIRB provides a comprehensive framework for
evaluating MIR systems and helps advance the development of more effective
retrieval models tailored to the mathematical domain.

Conclusion: 自适应束搜索为图搜索方法提供了一种简单有效的改进方案。

Abstract: Nearest neighbor search is central in machine learning, information
retrieval, and databases. For high-dimensional datasets, graph-based methods
such as HNSW, DiskANN, and NSG have become popular thanks to their empirical
accuracy and efficiency. These methods construct a directed graph over the
dataset and perform beam search on the graph to find nodes close to a given
query. While significant work has focused on practical refinements and
theoretical understanding of graph-based methods, many questions remain. We
propose a new distance-based termination condition for beam search to replace
the commonly used condition based on beam width. We prove that, as long as the
search graph is navigable, our resulting Adaptive Beam Search method is
guaranteed to approximately solve the nearest-neighbor problem, establishing a
connection between navigability and the performance of graph-based search. We
also provide extensive experiments on our new termination condition for both
navigable graphs and approximately navigable graphs used in practice, such as
HNSW and Vamana graphs. We find that Adaptive Beam Search outperforms standard
beam search over a range of recall values, data sets, graph constructions, and
target number of nearest neighbors. It thus provides a simple and practical way
to improve the performance of popular methods.

Abstract: Asymmetric, non-Gaussian probability distributions are often observed in the
analysis of natural and engineering datasets. The lognormal distribution is a
standard model for data with skewed frequency histograms and fat tails.
However, the lognormal law severely restricts the asymptotic dependence of the
probability density and the hazard function for high values. Herein we present
a family of three-parameter non-Gaussian probability density functions that are
based on generalized kappa-exponential and kappa-logarithm functions and
investigate its mathematical properties. These kappa-lognormal densities
represent continuous deformations of the lognormal with lighter right tails,
controlled by the parameter kappa. In addition, bimodal distributions are
obtained for certain parameter combinations. We derive closed-form analytic
expressions for the main statistical functions of the kappa-lognormal
distribution. For the moments, we derive bounds that are based on
hypergeometric functions as well as series expansions. Explicit expressions for
the gradient and Hessian of the negative log-likelihood are obtained to
facilitate numerical maximum-likelihood estimates of the kappa-lognormal
parameters from data. We also formulate a joint probability density function
for kappa-lognormal stochastic processes by applying Jacobi's multivariate
theorem to a latent Gaussian process. Estimation of the kappa-lognormal
distribution based on synthetic and real data is explored. Furthermore, we
investigate applications of kappa-lognormal processes with different covariance
kernels in time series forecasting and spatial interpolation using warped
Gaussian process regression. Our results are of practical interest for modeling
skewed distributions in various scientific and engineering fields.

*Anna R. Flowers,Christopher T. Franck,Mickaël Binois,Chiwoo Park,Robert B. Gramacy*

Main category: stat.ME

TLDR: 论文提出了一种模块化的方法改进跳变高斯过程（JGP），通过分别优化局部邻域大小和聚类特征，简化了联合推断，显著提升了跳变过程的建模效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯过程（GP）假设平稳性，不适用于输出变量存在突变的场景。跳变高斯过程（JGP）虽能解决此问题，但联合推断复杂。本文旨在简化JGP，保留其核心优势。

Method: 提出模块化方法，分别优化局部邻域大小以尊重突变流形，并引入聚类特征捕捉突变两侧的不同输出水平区域，避免联合推断。

Result: 实验表明，单独优化邻域大小或聚类特征均能显著提升跳变过程建模效果，两者结合时效果更佳。

Conclusion: 模块化方法简化了JGP，同时保留了其核心优势，为跳变过程建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) furnish accurate nonlinear predictions with
well-calibrated uncertainty. However, the typical GP setup has a built-in
stationarity assumption, making it ill-suited for modeling data from processes
with sudden changes, or "jumps" in the output variable. The "jump GP" (JGP) was
developed for modeling data from such processes, combining local GPs and latent
"level" variables under a joint inferential framework. But joint modeling can
be fraught with difficulty. We aim to simplify by suggesting a more modular
setup, eschewing joint inference but retaining the main JGP themes: (a)
learning optimal neighborhood sizes that locally respect manifolds of
discontinuity; and (b) a new cluster-based (latent) feature to capture regions
of distinct output levels on both sides of the manifold. We show that each of
(a) and (b) separately leads to dramatic improvements when modeling processes
with jumps. In tandem (but without requiring joint inference) that benefit is
compounded, as illustrated on real and synthetic benchmark examples from the
recent literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统区块链在吞吐量和最终性方面的瓶颈问题。

Method: 采用 Autobahn 共识机制，分离数据可用性（DA）层和共识层，要求 DA 层获得 f+1 投票后达成共识，并通过异步区块执行和状态协议避免执行成为共识瓶颈。

Result: 测试网中实现了高吞吐量（>5 gigagas/sec）和低延迟（<400ms 最终性）。

Conclusion: Sei Giga 通过创新的共识和执行分离设计，显著提升了区块链的性能。

Abstract: We introduce the Sei Giga, a multi-concurrent producer parallelized execution
EVM layer one blockchain. In an internal testnet Giga has achieved >5
gigagas/sec throughput and sub 400ms finality. Giga uses Autobahn for consensus
with separate DA and consensus layers requiring f+1 votes for a PoA on the DA
layer before consensus. Giga reaches consensus over ordering and uses async
block execution and state agreement to remove execution from the consensus
bottleneck.

TLDR: DynMo是一种动态负载平衡解决方案，用于优化动态模型训练中的计算分布，显著提升训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态工作负载减少方案（如MoEs、参数剪枝等）在大规模分布式训练中引入严重的工作负载不平衡问题，限制了其实用性。

Method: DynMo通过自适应平衡工作负载、动态打包任务到更少的工作节点以释放空闲资源，支持多GPU单节点和多节点系统。

Result: 与静态训练方法相比，DynMo在多种动态模型上训练速度提升显著（如MoEs提升1.23倍，剪枝提升3.18倍等）。

Conclusion: DynMo是一种高效的动态负载平衡解决方案，适用于大规模分布式训练，显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: To reduce computational and memory costs in Large Language Models (LLMs),
dynamic workload reduction schemes like Mixture of Experts (MoEs), parameter
pruning, layer freezing, sparse attention, early token exit, and Mixture of
Depths (MoDs) have emerged. However, these methods introduce severe workload
imbalances, limiting their practicality for large-scale distributed training.
We propose DynMo, an autonomous dynamic load balancing solution that ensures
optimal compute distribution when using pipeline parallelism in training
dynamic models. DynMo adaptively balances workloads, dynamically packs tasks
into fewer workers to free idle resources, and supports both multi-GPU
single-node and multi-node systems. Compared to static training methods
(Megatron-LM, DeepSpeed), DynMo accelerates training by up to 1.23x (MoEs),
3.18x (pruning), 2.23x (layer freezing), 4.02x (sparse attention), 4.52x (early
exit), and 1.17x (MoDs). DynMo is available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DynMo-4D04/.
