### [1] [From Threat to Tool: Leveraging Refusal-Aware Injection Attacks for Safety Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10020)
*Kyubyung Chae,Hyunbin Jin,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为RAAI的无需训练、模型无关的框架，通过检测LLM的内部拒绝信号并注入预定义短语，生成有害但流畅的补全。实验表明RAAI显著提高了有害响应率，同时利用其生成的数据微调LLM可增强模型对有害提示的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂的人类标注或辅助模型，成本高且耗时。RAAI旨在利用LLM攻击技术，提供一种简单、可扩展的安全对齐工具。

Method: RAAI通过检测LLM的内部拒绝信号并自适应注入预定义短语，生成有害补全。无需训练，适用于任何LLM。

Result: RAAI将有害响应率从基线2.15%提升至平均61.04%。微调后的LLM在有害提示下表现更鲁棒，同时保持标准任务（如MMLU和ARC）的性能。

Conclusion: RAAI展示了LLM攻击技术可转化为实用工具，为安全对齐提供可扩展且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

### [2] [LLMs Caught in the Crossfire: Malware Requests and Jailbreak Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10022)
*Haoyang Li,Huan Gao,Zhiyuan Zhao,Zhiyu Lin,Junyu Gao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了MalwareBench基准数据集，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成中对越狱攻击的鲁棒性，发现主流LLMs对恶意代码生成的拒绝能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在代码生成中对越狱攻击的特定脆弱性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建包含3,520个越狱提示的MalwareBench数据集，覆盖11种越狱方法和29种代码功能类别，评估LLMs的拒绝能力。

Result: 主流LLMs对恶意代码的平均拒绝率为60.93%，结合越狱攻击算法后降至39.92%。

Conclusion: LLMs的代码安全能力仍面临重大挑战。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

### [3] [Private Memorization Editing: Turning Memorization into a Defense to Strengthen Data Privacy in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10024)
*Elena Sofia Ruzzetti,Giancarlo A. Xompero,Davide Venditti,Fabio Massimo Zanzotto*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为PME的方法，通过编辑模型对训练数据的记忆来防止LLMs泄露个人隐私信息（PII），同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs可能记忆并泄露个人隐私信息（PII），需要一种方法在不影响模型性能的情况下防止这种泄露。

Method: 提出PME方法，通过检测和编辑模型对PII的记忆，使其更鲁棒。

Result: PME有效减少了PII泄露，某些情况下甚至将隐私攻击的准确率降至零。

Conclusion: PME是一种有效的隐私防御策略，能够在不影响模型性能的情况下减少隐私泄露风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

*Yuanhaur Chang,Oren Heller,Yaniv Shlomo,Iddo Bar-Noy,Ella Bokobza,Michal Grinstein-Weiss,Ning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 研究探讨了中小型企业（SMB）决策者在网络安全决策中的认知与行为，通过混合方法揭示了其风险感知与防御措施选择的原因，并提出干预措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中小型企业决策者缺乏网络安全意识和知识，导致实施措施效果不佳，研究旨在理解其决策过程并提出改进方法。

Method: 采用混合方法，包括半结构化访谈（n=21）和在线调查（n=322），结合主题分析和情境意识模型。

Result: 揭示了决策者的风险感知、防御措施选择原因及安全感知影响因素，构建了结构方程模型以提升意识。

Conclusion: 研究提出干预措施，帮助中小型企业克服网络安全挑战，提升决策者的情境意识。

Abstract: Key decision-makers in small and medium businesses (SMBs) often lack the
awareness and knowledge to implement cybersecurity measures effectively. To
gain a deeper understanding of how SMB executives navigate cybersecurity
decision-making, we deployed a mixed-method approach, conducting
semi-structured interviews (n=21) and online surveys (n=322) with SMB key
decision-makers. Using thematic analysis, we revealed SMB decision-makers'
perceived risks in terms of the digital assets they valued, and found reasons
for their choice of defense measures and factors impacting security perception.
We employed the situational awareness model to characterize decision-makers
based on cybersecurity awareness, identifying those who have comparatively low
awareness in the fight against adversaries. We further explored the
relationship between awareness and business attributes, and constructed a
holistic structural equation model to understand how awareness can be improved.
Finally, we proposed interventions to help SMBs overcome potential challenges.

### [5] [Secure Data Access in Cloud Environments Using Quantum Cryptography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10028)
*S. Vasavi Venkata Lakshmi,Ziaul Haque Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种基于量子密码学的云数据安全解决方案，结合QKD、BB84协议和QOTP，以抵御未来量子计算机的威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据安全方法在未来量子计算机时代可能失效，因此需要更强大的保护手段。

Method: 使用BB84协议的QKD生成安全密钥，并结合QOTP进行数据加密和解密。

Result: 该方法为云环境提供了强大的数据安全保障，即使面对量子计算机攻击。

Conclusion: 量子密码学为当前和未来的云数据安全提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but keeping it
secure is a big challenge nowadays. Traditional methods of ensuring data may
not be strong enough in the future when powerful quantum computers become
available. To solve this problem, this study uses quantum cryptography to
protect data in the cloud environment. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) creates
secure keys by sending information using quantum particles like photons.
Specifically, we use the BB84 protocol, a simple and reliable way to make
secure keys that cannot be stolen without detection. To protect the data, we
use the Quantum One Time pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption, ensuring the
data stays completely private. This study shows how these Quantum methods can
be applied in cloud systems to provide a strong defense against hackers, even
if they have access to quantum computers. The combination of QKD, BB84, and
QOTP creates a safe and reliable way to keep data secure when it is stored or
shared in the cloud. Using quantum cryptography, this paper provides a way to
ensure data security now and in the future, making cloud computing safer for
everyone to store their data securely and safely.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本生成、图像创作、信息检索和代码开发等领域带来变革，但也引发新的网络安全挑战，如提示注入攻击、越狱、错误信息传播和深度伪造风险。

Method: 通过比较分析ChatGPT和Gemini的安全性和对齐水平，并提出越狱技术的分类及实验验证。

Result: 研究揭示了ChatGPT和Gemini在安全性和对齐方面的差异，并总结了越狱技术的分类及其影响。

Conclusion: LLMs的快速发展需要更严格的安全措施和对齐技术，以应对潜在的网络安全威胁。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) are transforming digital usage, particularly in
text generation, image creation, information retrieval and code development.
ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI in November 2022, quickly became a reference,
prompting the emergence of competitors such as Google's Gemini. However, these
technological advances raise new cybersecurity challenges, including prompt
injection attacks, the circumvention of regulatory measures (jailbreaking), the

This paper presents a comparative analysis of the security and alignment levels
of ChatGPT and Gemini, as well as a taxonomy of jailbreak techniques associated
with experiments.

### [7] [Safeguarding Multimodal Knowledge Copyright in the RAG-as-a-Service Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10030)
*Tianyu Chen,Jian Lou,Wenjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: AQUA是首个用于多模态RAG系统中图像知识保护的框架，通过嵌入语义信号实现高效、隐蔽的版权追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG向服务化平台发展，共享知识库中图像知识的版权保护成为关键问题，现有方法仅关注文本知识。

Method: AQUA采用基于缩写的触发器和空间关系线索两种互补方法，将语义信号嵌入合成图像。

Result: 实验表明，AQUA能在多种模型和数据集上实现鲁棒、隐蔽且可靠的版权追踪。

Conclusion: AQUA填补了多模态RAG系统中图像知识保护的空白。

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented
platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the
copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods
in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected.
In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

### [8] [Symbolic Generation and Modular Embedding of High-Quality abc-Triples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10039)
*Michael A. Idowu*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种生成满足a + b = c的整数三元组(a, b, c)的符号恒等式，基于abc猜想的特征，通过模逆和参数化方法生成低radical值的三元组。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受abc猜想的结构特征启发，旨在生成具有低radical值的整数三元组，为密码学预处理中的符号熵过滤提供探索性框架。

Method: 结合2和3的幂与模逆运算，构建参数化恒等式，并通过仿射变换扩展到更广泛的高质量三元组空间。

Result: 计算结果显示生成的结构化三元组具有低radical值，包括已知和新发现的三元组。

Conclusion: 该方法为可控三元组生成提供了符号和代数框架，并暗示了在密码学预处理中的潜在应用。

Abstract: We present a symbolic identity for generating integer triples $(a, b, c)$
satisfying $a + b = c$, inspired by structural features of the \emph{abc
conjecture}. The construction uses powers of $2$ and $3$ in combination with
modular inversion in $\mathbb{Z}/3^p\mathbb{Z}$, leading to a parametric
identity with residue constraints that yield abc-triples exhibiting low radical
values. Through affine transformations, these symbolic triples are embedded
into a broader space of high-quality examples, optimised for the ratio $\log c
/ \log \operatorname{rad}(abc)$. Computational results demonstrate the
emergence of structured, radical-minimising candidates, including both known
and novel triples. These methods provide a symbolic and algebraic framework for
controlled triple generation, and suggest exploratory implications for symbolic
entropy filtering in cryptographic pre-processing.

### [9] [Multiverse Privacy Theory for Contextual Risks in Complex User-AI Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10042)
*Ece Gumusel*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: Multiverse Privacy Theory提出了一种新框架，通过模拟隐私决策的平行宇宙来理解隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI交互日益增多的时代，用户面临复杂且不确定的隐私决策。

Method: 引入Multiverse Privacy Theory，模拟隐私决策的平行宇宙，结合情境完整性、偏好演化和概率决策。

Result: 该理论为理解隐私问题提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 未来工作将探索基于真实场景调查数据的应用。

Abstract: In an era of increasing interaction with artificial intelligence (AI), users
face evolving privacy decisions shaped by complex, uncertain factors. This
paper introduces Multiverse Privacy Theory, a novel framework in which each
privacy decision spawns a parallel universe, representing a distinct potential
outcome based on user choices over time. By simulating these universes, this
theory provides a foundation for understanding privacy through the lens of
contextual integrity, evolving preferences, and probabilistic decision-making.
Future work will explore its application using real-world, scenario-based
survey data.

### [10] [GenBreak: Red Teaming Text-to-Image Generators Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10047)
*Zilong Wang,Xiang Zheng,Xiaosen Wang,Bo Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: GenBreak框架通过微调红队大语言模型（LLM），系统探索文本到图像（T2I）生成器的潜在漏洞，结合监督微调和强化学习，生成既能绕过安全机制又能产生高毒性图像的对抗性提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在评估T2I模型安全性时存在局限性，无法同时实现高毒性图像生成和安全机制绕过，缺乏可靠工具。

Method: 结合监督微调（基于精选数据集）和强化学习（通过代理T2I模型交互），利用多奖励信号指导LLM生成对抗性提示。

Result: 生成的对抗性提示在黑盒攻击中表现出色，揭示了商业T2I生成器的实际安全隐患。

Conclusion: GenBreak填补了T2I模型安全性评估工具的空白，揭示了其实际脆弱性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

*David Farr,Kevin Talty,Alexandra Farr,John Stockdale,Iain Cruickshank,Jevin West*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 研究探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）检测Python代码漏洞，比较了零样本、少样本跨领域和少样本同领域提示策略。结果显示少样本提示显著提升性能，结合置信度路由策略可优化自动化与专家监督的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络威胁日益复杂，快速准确的漏洞检测对系统安全至关重要。研究旨在探索LLMs在漏洞评估中的潜力。

Method: 通过模拟识别带有已知CWE的Python代码，比较零样本、少样本跨领域和少样本同领域提示策略，并结合置信度路由策略。

Result: 少样本提示显著提升分类性能，LLMs能通过少量示例泛化漏洞类别，但模型可靠性、可解释性和对抗鲁棒性仍需改进。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为可扩展的网络安全工具，结合专家参与决策（EITL）能优化工作流程，为AI辅助漏洞检测系统奠定基础。

Abstract: As cyber threats become more sophisticated, rapid and accurate vulnerability
detection is essential for maintaining secure systems. This study explores the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software vulnerability assessment by
simulating the identification of Python code with known Common Weakness
Enumerations (CWEs), comparing zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot
in-domain prompting strategies. Our results indicate that while zero-shot
prompting performs poorly, few-shot prompting significantly enhances
classification performance, particularly when integrated with confidence-based
routing strategies that improve efficiency by directing human experts to cases
where model uncertainty is high, optimizing the balance between automation and
expert oversight. We find that LLMs can effectively generalize across
vulnerability categories with minimal examples, suggesting their potential as
scalable, adaptable cybersecurity tools in simulated environments. However,
challenges such as model reliability, interpretability, and adversarial
robustness remain critical areas for future research. By integrating AI-driven
approaches with expert-in-the-loop (EITL) decision-making, this work highlights
a pathway toward more efficient and responsive cybersecurity workflows. Our
findings provide a foundation for deploying AI-assisted vulnerability detection
systems in both real and simulated environments that enhance operational
resilience while reducing the burden on human analysts.

### [12] [D-LiFT: Improving LLM-based Decompiler Backend via Code Quality-driven Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10125)
*Muqi Zou,Hongyu Cai,Hongwei Wu,Zion Leonahenahe Basque,Arslan Khan,Berkay Celik,Dave,Tian,Antonio Bianchi,Ruoyu,Wang,Dongyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: D-LiFT利用强化学习训练的LLM改进反编译代码质量，通过D-SCORE系统确保准确性和可读性，显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反编译器输出存在语法和语义错误，且可读性差，LLM虽被探索用于改进，但存在新错误和验证不可靠的问题。

Method: 提出D-LiFT，结合强化学习训练LLM，并通过D-SCORE系统多维度评估代码质量，优先确保准确性再优化可读性。

Result: 基于Ghidra和多种LLM的实现显示，D-LiFT在coreutils和util-linux项目中显著提升反编译代码质量，改进函数数量比基线高55.3%。

Conclusion: D-LiFT通过D-SCORE驱动的LLM微调，有效平衡反编译代码的准确性与可读性，为安全任务提供更可靠工具。

Abstract: Decompilers, which reconstruct human-readable source code from binary
executables, are vital to many security tasks. Yet, despite recent advances,
their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains
difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs),
researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.
Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations,
such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.
In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that
harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving
accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of
decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}.
Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system
to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle,
D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher
scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically,
D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler
and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then
evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with
the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for
fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs,
demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the
coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without
D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled
functions, as measured by D-SCORE.

### [13] [Unconditionally Secure Wireless-Wired Ground-Satellite-Ground Communication Networks Utilizing Classical and Quantum Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10147)
*Lucas Truax,Sandip Roy,Laszlo B. Kish*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: KLJN是一种基于经典物理的安全通信方法，相比量子密钥分发（QKD），它更简单、成本更低且更可靠，适用于卫星通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卫星通信中的安全挑战，特别是针对量子计算等高级威胁，同时避免QKD的高成本和复杂性。

Method: 利用KLJN方案，基于经典物理原理，使用标准电子组件实现无条件安全通信。

Result: KLJN在成本、简单性和鲁棒性上优于QKD，尤其适合地面系统。

Conclusion: KLJN是卫星通信安全的一种革命性替代方案，具有显著优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) as an
approach to securing satellite communications. KLJN has the potential to
revolutionize satellite communication security through its combination of
simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and resilience with unconditional security.
Unlike quantum key distribution (QKD), which requires complex, fragile, and
expensive infrastructure like photon detectors and dedicated optical links,
KLJN operates using standard electronic components and wires, significantly
reducing implementation costs and logistical hurdles. KLJN's security, grounded
in the fundamental laws of classical physics, is impervious to environmental
and radiation-induced noise, making it highly reliable in the harsh conditions
of satellite communications. This robustness, coupled with its ability to
integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, positions KLJN as a
revolutionary alternative to quantum solutions for ensuring secure, resilient
satellite communications. The authors explore the value of achieving
unconditionally secure communications in strategic ground-to-satellite networks
which address vulnerabilities posed by advanced computational threats,
including quantum computing. Our team has examined two leading approaches to
unconditional security - the KLJN scheme and QKD - and analyzed the potential
use of each for space systems. While QKD leverages quantum mechanics for
security, it faces challenges related to cost, complexity, and environmental
sensitivity. In contrast, the KLJN scheme utilizes classical physics principles
to provide a simpler, more cost-effective, and resilient alternative,
particularly for ground-based systems. The study concludes that KLJN offers
significant advantages in simplicity, cost-efficiency, and robustness, making
it a practical choice for many secure communication applications.

*Saswat Das,Jameson Sandler,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种用于评估对话隐私风险的审计框架CMPL，通过多轮交互测试揭示潜在漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理在敏感数据访问中可能引发隐私泄露风险，现有单轮防御措施不足。

Method: 提出CMPL框架，采用迭代探测策略模拟多轮对话，系统化测试隐私漏洞。

Result: CMPL能发现现有单轮防御无法阻止的隐私风险，并提供量化风险指标和开放基准。

Conclusion: CMPL是有效的诊断工具，为对话隐私审计提供了量化方法和评估基准。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

Abstract: Effective attribution of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) increasingly
hinges on the ability to correlate behavioral patterns and reason over complex,
varied threat intelligence artifacts. We present AURA (Attribution Using
Retrieval-Augmented Agents), a multi-agent, knowledge-enhanced framework for
automated and interpretable APT attribution. AURA ingests diverse threat data
including Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), Indicators of Compromise
(IoCs), malware details, adversarial tools, and temporal information, which are
processed through a network of collaborative agents. These agents are designed
for intelligent query rewriting, context-enriched retrieval from structured
threat knowledge bases, and natural language justification of attribution
decisions. By combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large
Language Models (LLMs), AURA enables contextual linking of threat behaviors to
known APT groups and supports traceable reasoning across multiple attack
phases. Experiments on recent APT campaigns demonstrate AURA's high attribution
consistency, expert-aligned justifications, and scalability. This work
establishes AURA as a promising direction for advancing transparent,
data-driven, and scalable threat attribution using multi-agent intelligence.

*Marius Mehrl,Mila Pfander,Theresa Winner,Cornelius Fritz*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 研究探讨了独裁政权下秘密警察出现的条件，发现其与特定可预防威胁（如抗议）及物质资源相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明秘密警察在独裁政权中并不普遍，仅存在于不到50%的独裁国家年份中，因此需要探究其出现的条件。

Method: 采用统计变量选择技术，从文献中提取候选变量，分析其对秘密警察出现的解释力。

Result: 秘密警察更可能在统治者面临可预防威胁（如抗议）且拥有物质资源时出现。

Conclusion: 研究增进了对独裁者制度选择及独裁政治的理解。

Abstract: Autocrats use secret police to stay in power, as these organizations deter
and suppress opposition to their rule. Existing research shows that secret
police are very good at this but, surprisingly, also that they are not as
ubiquitous in autocracies as one may assume, existing in less than 50% of
autocratic country-years. We thus explore under which conditions secret police
emerge in dictatorships. For this purpose, we apply statistical variable
selection techniques to identify which of several candidate variables extracted
from the literature on state security forces and authoritarian survival hold
explanatory power. Our results highlight that secret police are more likely to
emerge when rulers face specific, preempt-able threats, such as protests and
anti-system mobilisation, but also when they have the material resources to
establish these organisations. This research contributes to our understanding
of autocrats' institutional choices and authoritarian politics.

*Yeonwoo Jang,Shariqah Hossain,Ashwin Sreevatsa,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 研究发现某些机器学习遗忘方法在简单提示攻击下可能失效，部分方法（如ELM）对特定攻击（如印地语填充文本）仍脆弱，需改进评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证机器学习遗忘方法的有效性，揭示其在提示攻击下的脆弱性。

Method: 系统评估八种遗忘技术，采用输出、logit和探针分析。

Result: 部分方法（如RMU、TAR）表现稳健，但ELM在特定攻击下恢复57.3%准确率。

Conclusion: 现有遗忘方法需更严格评估框架，区分真实知识移除与表面输出抑制。

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

*Chuyang Chen,Brendan Dolan-Gavitt,Zhiqiang Lin*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: ELFuzz利用LLM自动合成针对被测系统的基于生成的模糊测试工具，显著提高了覆盖率和漏洞发现能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于生成的模糊测试需要大量手动构建输入语法和语义约束，ELFuzz旨在通过LLM驱动的合成自动化这一过程。

Method: ELFuzz从最小种子模糊测试工具开始，通过LLM驱动的进化合成，结合覆盖率指导，生成高效的模糊测试工具。

Result: ELFuzz在评估中实现了434.8%的更高覆盖率和174.0%的更多漏洞触发，并在实际测试中发现了5个0-day漏洞。

Conclusion: ELFuzz展示了在模糊测试中自动化、高效和可扩展输入生成的潜力。

Abstract: Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to
specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and
software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to
construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large
Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based
fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over
fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels
the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance.
Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of
real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2)
synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and
semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared
ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized
by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more
coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also
used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of
cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are
exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the
fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to
62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers
synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical
structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results
present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and
extensible input generation for fuzzing.

Abstract: In the last decade, the rapid growth of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and
Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAV) in communication, defense, and transportation
has increased. The application of UAS will continue to increase rapidly. This
has led researchers to examine security vulnerabilities in various facets of
UAS infrastructure and UAVs, which form a part of the UAS system to reinforce
these critical systems. This survey summarizes the cybersecurity
vulnerabilities in several phases of UAV deployment, the likelihood of each
vulnerability's occurrence, the impact of attacks, and mitigation strategies
that could be applied. We go beyond the state-of-the-art by taking a
comprehensive approach to enhancing UAS security by performing an analysis of
both UAS-specific and non-UAS-specific mitigation strategies that are
applicable within the UAS domain to define the lessons learned. We also present
relevant cybersecurity standards and their recommendations in the UAS context.
Despite the significant literature in UAS security and the relevance of
cyberphysical and networked systems security approaches from the past, which we
identify in the survey, we find several critical research gaps that require
further investigation. These form part of our discussions and recommendations
for the future exploration by our research community.

*Kwangsu Lee*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种高效的分布式广播加密（DBE）方案，首次证明了其自适应选择密文攻击（CCA）安全性，解决了现有方案中公钥验证需要线性配对操作的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DBE方案仅支持自适应选择明文攻击（CPA）安全性，且公钥验证效率低，需要线性配对操作。

Method: 首先提出半静态CCA安全的DBE方案，基于$q$-Type假设证明安全性；随后改进Gentry-Waters的通用转换方法，将其应用于CCA安全DBE方案，实现自适应CCA安全性。

Result: 提出的DBE方案具有恒定大小的密文和私钥，线性大小的公钥，且公钥验证仅需恒定数量的配对操作和高效的群成员检查。

Conclusion: 该方案首次实现了自适应CCA安全的DBE，显著提升了效率和安全性。

Abstract: Distributed broadcast encryption (DBE) is a specific kind of broadcast
encryption (BE) where users independently generate their own public and private
keys, and a sender can efficiently create a ciphertext for a subset of users by
using the public keys of the subset users. Previously proposed DBE schemes have
been proven in the adaptive chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) security model and
have the disadvantage of requiring linear number of pairing operations when
verifying the public key of a user. In this paper, we propose an efficient DBE
scheme in bilinear groups and prove adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA)
security for the first time. To do this, we first propose a semi-static CCA
secure DBE scheme and prove the security under the $q$-Type assumption. Then,
by modifying the generic transformation of Gentry and Waters that converts a
semi-static CPA secure DBE scheme into an adaptive CPA secure DBE scheme to be
applied to CCA secure DBE schemes, we propose an adaptive CCA secure DBE scheme
and prove its adaptive CCA security. Our proposed DBE scheme is efficient
because it requires constant size ciphertexts, constant size private keys, and
linear size public keys, and the public key verification requires only a
constant number of pairing operations and efficient group membership checks.

TLDR: FicGCN是一个基于同态加密（HE）的框架，旨在优化图卷积神经网络（GCN）的稀疏特性，平衡聚合和组合操作，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云基GCN服务的需求增长，敏感图数据的隐私问题日益突出。同态加密虽能保护隐私，但带来高计算开销，尤其是GCN操作中的矩阵乘法和旋转。

Method: FicGCN采用延迟感知打包方案、稀疏密文内聚合（SpIntra-CA）方法和基于局部邻接结构的区域数据重排序，以减少旋转开销。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，FicGCN性能最佳，比最新设计提升高达4.10倍。

Conclusion: FicGCN通过优化稀疏特性和计算平衡，显著提升了HE基GCN的效率和性能。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) have gained widespread popularity
in various fields like personal healthcare and financial systems, due to their
remarkable performance. Despite the growing demand for cloud-based GCN
services, privacy concerns over sensitive graph data remain significant.
Homomorphic Encryption (HE) facilitates Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
(PPML) by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data. However, HE
introduces substantial computational overhead, particularly for GCN operations
that require rotations and multiplications in matrix products. The sparsity of
GCNs offers significant performance potential, but their irregularity
introduces additional operations that reduce practical gains. In this paper, we
propose FicGCN, a HE-based framework specifically designed to harness the
sparse characteristics of GCNs and strike a globally optimal balance between
aggregation and combination operations. FicGCN employs a latency-aware packing
scheme, a Sparse Intra-Ciphertext Aggregation (SpIntra-CA) method to minimize
rotation overhead, and a region-based data reordering driven by local adjacency
structure. We evaluated FicGCN on several popular datasets, and the results
show that FicGCN achieved the best performance across all tested datasets, with
up to a 4.10x improvement over the latest design.

Motivation: 微调LLMs常涉及敏感信息，引发隐私问题。MIAs利用微调过程中的损失减少揭示成员信息，促使开发防御措施。

Method: 提出SOFT技术，通过选择性数据混淆和可调参数平衡隐私保护与模型性能。实验覆盖六个领域和多种LLM架构。

Result: SOFT显著降低隐私风险，同时保持模型性能，为微调LLMs提供实用且可扩展的隐私保护方案。

Conclusion: SOFT是一种有效的防御技术，能在保护敏感信息的同时维持LLMs的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely
adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often
involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive
experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales.
Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to
safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

Motivation: 研究多智能体LLM系统在复杂任务中的联合应用潜力，填补现有研究中规范和评估的空白。

Method: 扩展了现有系统架构，提出多智能体系统规范，并通过网络安全任务测试其可行性。

Result: 测试表明，基于OpenAI和DeepSeek的LLM智能体能够正确完成问答、服务器安全和网络安全任务。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM系统在特定领域具有应用潜力，需进一步规范和评估以发挥其价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.
However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques,
and applications individually, their joint specification and combined
application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM
systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for
specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning
techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory
research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system.
The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a
specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving
cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation
approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering,
server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by
agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法依赖强假设，而新攻击仅需公开可用的变分自编码器，揭示扩散模型训练中重用公开组件的风险。

Method: 利用变分自编码器近似模型的潜在空间，实现更有效的代理攻击。

Result: 攻击使Tree-Ring检测器的AUC从0.993降至0.153（ROC）和0.994降至0.385（PR），图像质量保持高。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了扩散模型训练中重用公开组件的风险，并指出Tree-Ring检测器的精度不足，需改进。

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 为未来LLM防护措施的研发提供了结构化基础，推动其稳健发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled
advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at

Motivation: 现代车辆的安全性日益重要，但CAN总线缺乏强大的安全措施，使其易受网络攻击。IDS虽能应对威胁，但对抗攻击（如规避攻击）可绕过检测。

Method: 研究基于梯度的对抗攻击，分白盒、灰盒和黑盒三种场景，评估攻击对先进IDS的有效性，并分析对抗扰动的影响及实时可行性。

Result: 攻击效果受数据集质量、目标IDS及攻击者知识程度影响显著，且在汽车领域约束下具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，对抗攻击的有效性取决于多种因素，需进一步优化IDS以应对此类威胁。

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and
the attacker's degree of knowledge.

Motivation: 随着CPS技术的进步和连接性增强，其面临更高的网络攻击风险，尤其是在安全关键系统中，现有防御策略未能充分利用CPS的物理特性。

Method: 提出CyFence架构，通过语义检查验证系统行为，并利用可信执行环境保护检查代码的安全性。

Result: 在真实场景（主动制动数字控制器）中验证了CyFence能有效抵御多种攻击，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: CyFence通过结合语义检查和可信执行环境，显著提升了CPS的安全性和抗攻击能力。

Abstract: In the last decades, Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) have experienced a
significant technological evolution and increased connectivity, at the cost of
greater exposure to cyber-attacks. Since many CPS are used in safety-critical
systems, such attacks entail high risks and potential safety harms. Although
several defense strategies have been proposed, they rarely exploit the
cyber-physical nature of the system. In this work, we exploit the nature of CPS
by proposing CyFence, a novel architecture that improves the resilience of
closed-loop control systems against cyber-attacks by adding a semantic check,
used to confirm that the system is behaving as expected. To ensure the security
of the semantic check code, we use the Trusted Execution Environment
implemented by modern processors. We evaluate CyFence considering a real-world
application, consisting of an active braking digital controller, demonstrating
that it can mitigate different types of attacks with a negligible computation
overhead.

TLDR: 该论文分析了威胁行为组的独特性行为特征，发现仅有少数组具有独特性行为，质疑行为特征是否能完全替代IOC用于威胁归因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索威胁行为组的独特性行为特征（如TTPs和软件）是否足够用于威胁检测和归因，以替代短寿命的IOC。

Method: 方法包括系统分析MITRE ATT&CK和Malpedia两个开源CTI知识库中的威胁组行为特征，并评估其独特性和完整性。

Result: 结果显示，仅有34%的威胁组在ATT&CK中具有独特性技术行为，73%使用独特性软件，但在Malpedia中这一比例降至24%。结合多源数据后，独特性行为比例仍低于30%。

Conclusion: 结论指出，行为特征的独特性不足，难以完全替代IOC用于威胁归因。

Abstract: Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, file hashes, and domain
names are commonly used for threat detection and attribution. However, IOCs
tend to be short-lived as they are easy to change. As a result, the
cybersecurity community is shifting focus towards more persistent behavioral
profiles, such as the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and the
software used by a threat group. However, the distinctiveness and completeness
of such behavioral profiles remain largely unexplored. In this work, we
systematically analyze threat group profiles built from two open cyber threat
intelligence (CTI) knowledge bases: MITRE ATT&CK and Malpedia. We first
investigate what fraction of threat groups have group-specific behaviors, i.e.,
behaviors used exclusively by a single group. We find that only 34% of threat
groups in ATT&CK have group-specific techniques. The software used by a threat
group proves to be more distinctive, with 73% of ATT&CK groups using
group-specific software. However, this percentage drops to 24% in the broader
Malpedia dataset. Next, we evaluate how group profiles improve when data from
both sources are combined. While coverage improves modestly, the proportion of
groups with group-specific behaviors remains under 30%. We then enhance
profiles by adding exploited vulnerabilities and additional techniques
extracted from more threat reports. Despite the additional information, 64% of
groups still lack any group-specific behavior. Our findings raise concerns on
the belief that behavioral profiles can replace IOCs in threat group
attribution.

Result: 在模拟环境中验证了框架的可行性和鲁棒性，能抵御多种威胁。

Conclusion: GOLIATH框架有效解决了集中式方案的局限性，实现了可信的信息收集与交换。

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) technology has advanced during the
past years, and it is now used for several applications that require vehicles
to exchange real-time data, such as in traffic information management.
Traditionally, road traffic information has been collected using on-site
sensors. However, crowd-sourcing traffic information from onboard sensors or
smartphones has become a viable alternative. State-of-the-art solutions
currently follow a centralized model where only the service provider has
complete access to the collected traffic data and represent a single point of
failure and trust. In this paper, we propose GOLIATH, a blockchain-based
decentralized framework that runs on the In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system
to collect real-time information exchanged between the network's participants.
Our approach mitigates the limitations of existing crowd-sourcing centralized
solutions by guaranteeing trusted information collection and exchange, fully
exploiting the intrinsic distributed nature of vehicles. We demonstrate its
feasibility in the context of vehicle positioning and traffic information
management. Each vehicle participating in the decentralized network shares its
position and neighbors' ones in the form of a transaction recorded on the
ledger, which uses a novel consensus mechanism to validate it. We design the
consensus mechanism resilient against a realistic set of adversaries that aim
to tamper or disable the communication. We evaluate the proposed framework in a
simulated (but realistic) environment, which considers different threats and
allows showing its robustness and safety properties.

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于设计更健壮和隐私保护的密码学应用，并为研究人员和从业者提供了CS与MPC密码学交互的教程。

Abstract: The paper presents an analysis of Commitment Schemes (CSs) used in
Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols. While the individual properties of CSs
and the guarantees offered by MPC have been widely studied in isolation, their
interrelation in concrete protocols and applications remains mostly
underexplored. This paper presents the relation between the two, with an
emphasis on (security) properties and their impact on the upper layer MPC. In
particular, we investigate how different types of CSs contribute to various MPC
constructions and their relation to real-life applications of MPC. The paper
can also serve as a tutorial for understanding the cryptographic interplay
between CS and MPC, making it accessible to both researchers and practitioners.
Our findings emphasize the importance of carefully selecting CS to meet the
adversarial and functional requirements of MPC, thereby aiming for more robust
and privacy-preserving cryptographic applications

*Xiaoxing Mo,Yuxuan Cheng,Nan Sun,Leo Yu Zhang,Wei Luo,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: TED-LaST是一种增强的防御策略，通过标签监督的动态跟踪和自适应层强调，提升了对DNN中后门攻击的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的拓扑演化动力学（TED）方法在检测后门攻击时可能被自适应攻击绕过，因此需要更鲁棒的防御策略。

Method: 提出TED-LaST，结合标签监督的动态跟踪和自适应层强调，以识别传统TED无法检测的隐蔽威胁。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型架构上的实验表明，TED-LaST能有效对抗复杂的后门攻击，如Adap-Blend和Adapt-Patch。

Conclusion: TED-LaST为后门检测设定了新标准，显著提升了DNN的安全性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against
evolving threats.

*Xiaobei Yan,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: ObfusBFA是一种高效且全面的方法，通过引入随机虚拟操作来抵御针对DNN的位翻转攻击（BFA），显著降低攻击成功率，同时保持模型精度和低开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位翻转攻击（BFA）对DNN构成严重威胁，现有防御方法缺乏普适性，需要一种更全面的解决方案。

Method: ObfusBFA通过在模型推理中引入随机虚拟操作，将攻击转化为随机位翻转，并设计算法识别关键位和插入混淆操作。

Result: ObfusBFA在各种攻击和数据集上保持模型精度，显著降低攻击成功率，且引入的开销极小。

Conclusion: ObfusBFA是一种实用且高效的防御方法，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Bit-flip attacks (BFAs) represent a serious threat to Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs), where flipping a small number of bits in the model parameters or binary
code can significantly degrade the model accuracy or mislead the model
prediction in a desired way. Existing defenses exclusively focus on protecting
models for specific attacks and platforms, while lacking effectiveness for
other scenarios. We propose ObfusBFA, an efficient and holistic methodology to
mitigate BFAs targeting both the high-level model weights and low-level
codebase (executables or shared libraries). The key idea of ObfusBFA is to
introduce random dummy operations during the model inference, which effectively
transforms the delicate attacks into random bit flips, making it much harder
for attackers to pinpoint and exploit vulnerable bits. We design novel
algorithms to identify critical bits and insert obfuscation operations. We
evaluate ObfusBFA against different types of attacks, including the adaptive
scenarios where the attacker increases the flip bit budget to attempt to
circumvent our defense. The results show that ObfusBFA can consistently
preserve the model accuracy across various datasets and DNN architectures while
significantly reducing the attack success rates. Additionally, it introduces
minimal latency and storage overhead, making it a practical solution for
real-world applications.

### [33] [Quantifying Azure RBAC Wildcard Overreach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10755)
*Christophe Parisel*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: Belshazaar框架通过两阶段方法解决Azure RBAC中通配符权限的问题，包括显式展开通配符和量化权限语义溢出，发现39%的操作存在跨资源提供者权限问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Azure RBAC中的通配符权限简化了策略编写，但模糊了实际允许的操作，削弱了最小权限原则。

Method: 1. 通过上下文无关文法形式化Azure操作语法，并实现编译器展开通配符；2. 定义超度量直径指标量化通配符的语义溢出。

Result: 在15481个操作中，39%的操作与非明显通配符关联时存在跨资源提供者权限问题，且有效权限集可计算。

Conclusion: 通配符模式可能导致权限膨胀，Belshazaar提供了一种可扩展的语义驱动方法，以实现更严格的最小权限RBAC策略。

Abstract: Azure RBAC leverages wildcard permissions to simplify policy authoring, but
this abstraction often obscures the actual set of allowed operations and
undermines least-privilege guarantees. We introduce Belshazaar, a two-stage
framework that targets both the effective permission set problem and the
evaluation of wildcards permissions spread. First, we formalize Azure action
syntax via a context free grammar and implement a compiler that expands any
wildcard into its explicit action set. Second, we define an ultrametric
diameter metric to quantify semantic overreach in wildcard scenarios. Applied
to Microsoft s official catalog of 15481 actions, Belshazaar reveals that about
39 percent of actions admit a cross Resource Provider reach when associated
with non obvious wildcards, and that effective permissions sets are effectively
computable. These findings demonstrate that wildcard patterns can introduce
substantial privilege bloat, and that our approach offers a scalable, semantics
driven path toward tighter, least-privilege RBAC policies in Azure
environments.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于SilentBadDiffusion（SBD）的多元素（ME）攻击方法，通过增加每个毒样本中的有毒视觉-文本元素数量来增强攻击能力，并引入离散余弦变换（DCT）保持隐蔽性。实验结果显示，该方法在低子采样率下表现优于原始SBD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）可能被攻击者利用进行版权侵权攻击。现有攻击方法SBD在数据资源和攻击效果上存在局限，需要改进。

Method: 提出ME攻击方法，结合SBD和多元素策略，并引入DCT保持隐蔽性。使用新数据集验证效果。

Result: 在低子采样率（5%）下，ME和DCT的CIR/FAE表现优于原始SBD。新数据集的攻击效果接近或超过基准数据集。

Conclusion: ME攻击方法显著提升了攻击效果，尤其在数据受限情况下，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,
respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney
datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI
and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than
original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种针对LLM分解攻击的外部监控框架，通过轻量级顺序监控有效防御攻击，成功率达93%，同时降低成本与延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全防御无法应对分解攻击，恶意目标被分解为良性子任务以绕过拒绝。现有技术仅检测即时提示的伤害，无法识别长程恶意意图。

Method: 提出外部监控框架，观察对话更高粒度。构建最大多样数据集测试攻击效果，并提出轻量级顺序监控实时防御。

Result: 攻击成功率平均87%（GPT-4o），监控框架防御成功率达93%，降低成本90%、延迟50%。

Conclusion: 轻量级顺序监控能高效防御分解攻击，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

Motivation: 传统MCIL方法仅关注视觉和文本，本文探索了视觉、音频和文本的多模态增量学习，旨在整合互补信息并缓解灾难性遗忘。

Method: 1. 基于MoE结构的MIFE实现增量微调；2. AAVFM模块增强特征判别性和泛化性；3. 多模态对比训练损失优化跨模态对齐；4. 引入两个MCIL专用评估指标。

Result: 在三个多模态数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文方法在多模态增量学习中表现出色，解决了信息整合和灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

TLDR: 论文提出Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM (NOCL)，通过节点描述和节点概念技术，将LLM扩展到非文本属性图，并显著减少token长度，同时统一多级图任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络依赖监督学习，自监督方法仍需微调，LLM在图任务中存在推理能力、token长度和任务单一等问题。

Method: NOCL采用节点描述将异质属性转为自然语言，节点概念编码为语义嵌入以减少token长度，并通过图表示描述符统一任务格式。

Result: 实验显示NOCL在监督学习中与传统方法竞争，且在零样本场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: NOCL为图基础模型开辟了新方向，解决了LLM在图任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 传统逆设计方法耗时且计算量大，深度学习可提高效率。

Method: 提出基于TNN的逆设计方法，结合MLP、CNN和LSTM算法，比较不同配置的性能。

Result: LSTM-LSTM-TNN精度最高但训练时间最长，CNN-LSTM-TNN在精度和速度上表现最优。

Conclusion: CNN-LSTM-TNN是兼顾精度和速度的最佳方案。

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法忽视偏好对的质量差异，导致数据利用和性能不佳。

Method: 提出Omni-DPO，联合考虑偏好对的固有质量和模型学习动态，动态加权样本。

Result: 在文本理解和数学推理任务中，Omni-DPO显著优于基线方法，甚至超过领先模型。

Conclusion: Omni-DPO通过优化数据利用和学习动态，显著提升了RLHF的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Conclusion: 该研究为将贝叶斯方法融入LLM系统提供了可行路径，有助于开发更可靠和校准的LLM应用。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于信息理论的框架，优化分层变分自编码器（HVAEs）的潜在维度分配，以提高分布外（OOD）检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，OOD检测至关重要，但现有HVAEs的潜在维度分配方式往往随意，导致性能不佳。

Method: 通过信息理论原则，形式化信息损失与表示衰减的权衡，提出优化潜在维度分配的框架，并证明在固定潜在预算下存在最优分配比例。

Result: 实验表明，调整该比例能显著提升OOD检测性能，优于基线HVAE配置。

Conclusion: 该框架为潜在结构设计提供了理论指导，提升了深度生成模型在OOD检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

Conclusion: 随机化算法在核化赌博问题中具有潜力，能够提供更好的实际性能。

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

Conclusion: 该方法在数据重建精度和聚类分离纯度之间取得了最佳平衡，为大规模图像无监督表示学习提供了可靠的基础。

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为非负扩散（NnD）的生成模型，用于高效生成和推断非负物理对象（如3D云），显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然对象通常复杂且多变，传统模拟方法计算成本高，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 使用基于分数的扩散方法，结合退火Langevin动力学，确保生成过程中的非负性。

Result: 生成的3D云与物理趋势一致，专家难以区分其非物理性。

Conclusion: NnD是一种高效且物理意义明确的生成方法，适用于非负对象的生成与推断。

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

*Maryam Khalid,Akane Sano*

TLDR: GRAIL是一个新的基准框架，用于评估动态环境中基于图的主动学习（AL）策略，弥补了现有方法在多样性、公平性和适应性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的AL方法主要在静态数据集上评估，忽视用户中心考量（如多样性、公平性）和动态环境适应性。

Method: 引入GRAIL框架，提出新指标评估AL策略的持续有效性、多样性和用户负担。

Result: 实验表明现有AL策略在预测性能和用户负担之间存在权衡，GRAIL能平衡节点重要性、查询多样性和网络拓扑。

Conclusion: GRAIL为动态环境中的图AL方法提供了全面评估机制，强调了平衡多因素的重要性。

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 研究无感知设置下的多玩家多臂老虎机问题，其中玩家无法感知碰撞且每个臂的容量未知，扩展了经典单位容量模型，并解决了协调和容量发现的新挑战。

Method: 提出A-CAPELLA算法，通过协作假设检验协议实现同步连续消除和容量估计，利用精心设计的碰撞模式进行学习。

Result: A-CAPELLA在无感知且臂容量未知的情况下实现了对数级遗憾，证明了其高效性。

Conclusion: A-CAPELLA是一种高效的去中心化算法，适用于无感知多玩家多臂老虎机问题，能够有效解决容量未知的挑战。

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习代理从仿真到现实部署时存在性能差距，传统域随机化（DR）未利用离线数据，ODR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用最大似然估计拟合模拟器参数分布，证明其一致性，推导误差界限，并提出E-DROPO算法。

Result: ODR的仿真到现实误差比均匀DR更紧，E-DROPO通过熵奖励防止方差崩溃，提升零样本迁移鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ODR理论框架为仿真到现实迁移提供了更优方法，E-DROPO进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为BYOL-γ增强的GCBC方法，通过改进状态表示的时间一致性，提升目标条件行为克隆（GCBC）在组合泛化任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标条件行为克隆（GCBC）在训练任务上表现良好，但在需要组合泛化的新任务上表现不佳，部分原因是状态表示缺乏时间一致性。

Method: 提出BYOL-γ增强的GCBC方法，通过改进表示学习目标，无需对比样本或TD学习即可近似后继表示。

Result: 该方法在需要组合泛化的任务上表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: BYOL-γ增强的GCBC通过改进时间一致性，有效提升了组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Result: 发现网络通过分层计划和价值函数扩展搜索深度，且状态表示不统一，每个箱子单独处理。

Conclusion: 研究表明，模型自由训练的网络机制可以用熟悉的术语理解，而非完全不可解释。

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了三种新型生存模型（iSurvM、iSurvQ、iSurvJ），结合不精确概率理论和注意力机制处理截尾数据，无需参数假设，实验表明其性能优于传统Beran估计器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统非参数方法（如Beran估计器）在处理复杂数据结构和严重截尾时表现不佳，因此需要更高效的生存分析方法。

Method: 1. 用区间值概率分布表示截尾数据；2. 使用基于核的Nadaraya-Watson回归和注意力权重计算不精确概率分布；3. 提出三种训练决策策略对应三种模型。

Result: 实验证明，新模型（尤其是iSurvJ）在准确性和计算复杂度上均优于Beran估计器。

Conclusion: 新模型为生存分析提供了更高效的非参数解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心力衰竭（HF）的早期检测对改善预后至关重要，但现有心率监测工具依赖群体平均值，缺乏个性化。

Method: 研究结合生理模型与神经网络，通过VO2数据训练PMB-NN框架，并在12名参与者的数据集上进行测试。

Result: PMB-NN的中位R²为0.8，RMSE为8.3 bpm，性能优于传统生理模型（p=0.002）。

Conclusion: PMB-NN框架为个性化实时心脏监测提供了可能，未来可应用于日常活动中的心脏健康追踪。

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

Motivation: 解决深度学习中的分布外识别问题，提出双曲嵌入能更好地捕捉数据层次结构。

Method: 引入平衡双曲学习，优化层次失真和子层次平衡，使用双曲原型进行分类，并推广分布外评分函数。

Result: 在13个数据集和13种评分函数上的实验表明，双曲嵌入优于现有方法和其他双曲方法。

Conclusion: 双曲嵌入在分布外识别中表现优异，支持层次化泛化。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法（如SimCLR和SupCon）缺乏不确定性量化机制，限制了其应用范围。

Method: VCL框架通过最大化证据下界（ELBO），将InfoNCE损失作为重构项，并添加KL散度正则化，使用投影正态分布建模后验分布。

Result: VCL在多个基准测试中缓解了维度崩溃，提高了与类标签的互信息，分类精度与确定性基线相当或更好，同时提供有意义的后验不确定性估计。

Conclusion: VCL为对比学习提供了概率基础，扩展了其应用潜力。

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

the competition we define two foundational tasks (i.e. Speech Detection and

and evaluation metrics, illustrative benchmark models, online tutorial code, a
community discussion board, and public leaderboard for submissions. To promote
accessibility and participation the competition features a Standard track that
emphasises algorithmic innovation, as well as an Extended track that is
expected to reward larger-scale computing, accelerating progress toward a
non-invasive brain-computer interface for speech.

Conclusion: WBSAC为稀疏奖励环境提供了一种有效的探索策略。

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: 采样轨迹的几何规律为优化扩散生成模型提供了新思路，动态规划方法简单高效且性能优越。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: DynaSubVAE是一种动态子群变分自编码器框架，用于联合学习表示和自适应OOD检测，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实观测数据中存在异质子群，传统模型常忽略这些群体，导致预测不准确甚至有害。

Method: DynaSubVAE通过动态更新潜在结构捕获新趋势，利用非参数聚类机制发现和建模潜在子群。

Result: 实验表明DynaSubVAE在近OOD和远OOD检测中表现优异，尤其在类OOD场景下。

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE的动态子群机制在OOD检测和精度上优于传统聚类方法。

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

Motivation: ECG和PCG分别捕捉心脏的电活动和机械活动，但两者信息内容的重叠与差异及其在生理状态和个体间的变化尚不完全清楚。

Method: 使用EPHNOGRAM数据集，结合线性和非线性机器学习模型（如非因果LSTM），分析ECG和PCG的相互重建能力及影响因素。

Result: 非线性模型（尤其是非因果LSTM）在重建中表现最优，且从PCG重建ECG更可行。基于包络的建模提高了跨主题泛化能力，并验证了PCG可估计ECG生物标志物。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对心脏电机械模态关系的理解，为新型多模态心脏监测技术提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代应用对模拟电路设计的自动化需求迫切，但现有方法在电路表示效率和数值精度敏感度上存在不足。

Method: 采用SFCI（简洁浮点输入规范表示）改进组件类型识别，降低令牌长度复杂度至O(|V|)，并提升数值精度敏感度。

Result: 实验显示LaMAGIC2在0.01的严格容差下成功率提高34%，MSE降低10倍，且在更多顶点电路中表现更优。

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2为模拟拓扑生成提供了一个高效且鲁棒的框架。

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦聚类方法仅适用于简单数据分割场景，无法处理复杂分布式结构，因此需要一种新方法支持复杂数据分割并保护隐私。

Method: 提出DC-Clustering方法，通过共享中间表示而非原始数据实现隐私保护，支持k-means和谱聚类，仅需一次与中央服务器的通信。

Result: 实验表明，DC-Clustering在合成和公开数据集上的聚类性能与集中式聚类相当。

Conclusion: DC-Clustering填补了联邦学习研究的空白，适用于隐私敏感领域如医疗和金融。

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

Result: 在合成噪声和真实众包数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效利用少量标注数据，提升分类器性能。

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

Result: 新方法成功解决88%原有方法无法处理的问题，占总问题的41%。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了SDP验证的根本挑战，并提出实用解决方案，提升其在深度神经网络中的适用性。

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在特定领域（如医疗、金融、法律）的微调应用增多，其可能泄露数据集级别的敏感属性（如患者人口统计或疾病流行率），但目前对LLMs的属性推断攻击研究不足。

Method: 论文提出了PropInfer基准任务，基于ChatDoctor数据集，设计了两种攻击方法：基于提示的生成攻击和利用词频信号的影子模型攻击。

Result: 实验表明，这两种攻击方法在多种预训练LLMs上均取得成功，揭示了LLMs在属性推断方面的新漏洞。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLMs在微调过程中可能泄露敏感信息的风险，为未来模型安全研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Conclusion: Graph-MLLM为多模态图学习提供了公平评估工具，并揭示了视觉与文本融合及微调MLLMs的重要性，推动该领域进一步发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

Result: Col-UCB实现了最优的极小极大和实例依赖的协作遗憾，适应组间共享动作集的结构。

Conclusion: 协作在某些情况下比独立学习更有优势，Col-UCB提供了平衡探索的有效方法。

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

Motivation: 解决现有学习优化器（如VeLO）因依赖JAX和缺乏用户友好工具而难以广泛应用的问题。

Method: 开发PyLO库，支持CUDA加速的学习优化器架构，并结合现有优化工具（如学习率调度和权重衰减）。

Result: PyLO显著提升了性能（如ViT B/16训练速度从39.36到205.59样本/秒），并证明学习优化器与现有工具结合能带来额外优势。

Conclusion: PyLO为学习优化器的实际应用提供了便捷途径，展示了其在真实大规模任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于小波变换的生理信号分析方法，并引入了针对EMG和ECG的大规模预训练模型，同时构建了多模态框架，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生理信号常受运动伪影、基线漂移等低信噪比干扰，且具有非平稳性和突变特征，传统方法难以有效分析。

Method: 采用小波变换捕捉多尺度时频特征，并首次提出针对EMG和ECG的预训练模型，结合多模态框架进行融合。

Result: 在低信噪比、高个体差异和设备不匹配等挑战下，性能优于现有方法，并建立了新的基准。

Conclusion: 该方法为生理信号分析奠定了基础，多模态设计对可穿戴健康监测和临床诊断具有潜在影响。

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

TLDR: 该研究提出了一种基于神经算子的端到端学习框架，用于数据驱动的路径依赖性非弹性材料建模。框架通过历史感知神经算子（HANO）预测材料响应，解决了传统循环神经网络的自一致性问题，并在复杂条件下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统循环神经网络在建模路径依赖性材料时存在自一致性和初始状态敏感性问题，需要一种更稳健的方法。

Method: 开发了HANO，一种基于傅里叶神经算子的自回归模型，结合分层自注意力机制，实现多尺度特征提取和离散不变学习。

Result: HANO在预测精度、泛化能力和鲁棒性上均优于基线模型，适用于复杂条件。

Conclusion: HANO为模拟非弹性材料提供了高效的数据驱动替代方案，适合与传统数值求解器集成。

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

Conclusion: TreeLoRA为大型预训练模型的持续学习提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，显著降低了计算负担并保持了性能。

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

Conclusion: 强调控制基础模型变异对准确揭示潜在能力间因果关系的重要性。

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for
complex embodied tasks like Embodied Question Answering (EQA) where nuanced
evaluation of agents' spatial, temporal, and logical understanding is critical
yet not considered by generic approaches. We introduce EQA-RM, a novel
generative multimodal reward model specifically architected for EQA, trained

Conclusion: PAJAMA为LLM生成内容评估提供了一种高效、低成本且可靠的替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model
Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging
programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a
model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of
RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the
JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

Motivation: 由于复杂火灾模型在多日模拟中与观测结果存在偏差，需要数据同化技术来改进预测。

Method: 使用WRF-SFIRE模型的历史火灾模拟数据训练cGAN，结合卫星数据和地形高度，估计火灾到达时间。

Result: 在五个美国太平洋地区火灾中验证，平均Sorensen-Dice系数为0.81，地形对推断影响较小。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效利用卫星数据估计火灾蔓延时间，地形影响有限。

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

Motivation: 现实中的时间序列数据（如医疗、气候、金融）常不规则、多模态且杂乱，但现有研究多基于干净、规则的单模态数据，与实际脱节。

Method: 提出Time-IMM数据集（涵盖9种不规则类型）和IMM-TSF基准库（支持异步融合和多种集成策略）。

Result: 实验表明，显式建模多模态不规则数据能显著提升预测性能。

Conclusion: Time-IMM和IMM-TSF为真实场景下的时间序列分析提供了基础工具。

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

Result: 光谱-cLHS方法比标准cLHS更能均匀覆盖环境特征空间和空间异质性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提供更平衡的训练数据，有望提高SOC预测的准确性。

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

scalability, accuracy, and interpretability compared to traditional neural
networks. This paper investigates the application of KANs to model and analyze
the dynamics of a buck converter system, focusing on state-space parameter
estimation along with discovering the system equations. Using simulation data,
the methodology involves approximating state derivatives with KANs,
constructing interpretable state-space representations, and validating these
models through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate the ability of
KANs to accurately identify system dynamics, verify model consistency, and
detect parameter changes, providing valuable insights into their applicability

Conclusion: 该方法能以时间和成本高效的方式自动化PCB设计优化。

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design

Conclusion: 该框架为公平性评估提供了统计严谨的解决方案，尤其适用于交叉分析中的小群体问题。

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

### [91] [Non-stationary Online Learning for Curved Losses: Improved Dynamic Regret via Mixability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10616)
*Yu-Jie Zhang,Peng Zhao,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 本文通过利用mixability的概念，改进了非平稳在线学习中动态遗憾的界限，特别是针对具有更强曲率的损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态遗憾最小化研究主要集中于凸函数，而忽略了具有更强曲率的损失函数（如平方或逻辑损失）。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用指数加权方法并结合固定份额更新，利用mixability性质来捕捉损失曲率。

Result: 实现了动态遗憾界限为$\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$，优于现有结果。

Conclusion: 通过简单的分析框架利用mixability，避免了复杂的KKT分析，显著改进了动态遗憾界限。

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种两阶段方法，用于准确数字化纸质心电图（ECG）记录，特别是在信号重叠的情况下。通过U-Net分割网络和自适应网格检测模块，显著提高了数字化精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在处理信号重叠的ECG记录时的不足，提升数字化精度。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）U-Net分割网络隔离ECG主迹线；2）自适应网格检测模块将二值掩码转换为时间序列信号。

Result: U-Net的IoU为0.87；在非重叠和重叠信号上，MSE和Pearson相关系数均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了ECG记录的数字化精度，尤其适用于信号重叠情况，为研究和临床应用提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出一种基于低秩分解的图学习方法，解决大规模图学习问题，并通过实验验证其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模数据中，传统图学习方法因计算复杂度高而难以应用，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 利用条件相关矩阵的低秩分解，结合黎曼优化技术，提出一种低秩约束的GLasso算法变体。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模图学习提供了一种高效且可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种新的理论分析，指出MISL方法在无监督强化学习中学习技能的多样性和可分性对下游任务适应至关重要，但MISL无法保证这些特性。作者提出了新的度量LSEPIN和基于Wasserstein距离的算法WSEP及PWSEP，以改进技能学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MISL方法在无监督强化学习中缺乏对技能多样性和可分性的理论分析，无法保证其学习效果对下游任务的适应性。

Method: 提出新的度量LSEPIN，并基于Wasserstein距离设计算法WSEP和PWSEP，替代KL散度以优化技能学习。

Result: 理论分析表明WSEP和PWSEP能更好地适应下游任务，并发现更多初始策略。

Conclusion: 通过引入Wasserstein距离和新的度量，本文提出的方法显著提升了无监督强化学习中技能学习的适应性和多样性。

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

TLDR: 论文提出Time-R1框架，通过两阶段强化微调提升LLMs在时间序列预测中的多步推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法缺乏显式的时间序列推理过程，而LLMs的多步推理能力为解决这一问题提供了可能，但提示工程存在计算成本高、隐私风险等问题。

Method: 提出Time-R1框架，包括监督微调阶段和强化学习阶段，设计了细粒度多目标奖励和GRIP方法优化推理路径。

Result: 实验表明Time-R1在多种数据集上显著提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: Time-R1通过强化微调成功提升了LLMs在时间序列预测中的推理能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

Motivation: 研究生成模型潜在空间的几何结构，特别是扩散模型中的相变现象。

Method: 通过近似潜在变量的后验分布学习对数配分函数，从而定义Fisher度量，并提供理论收敛保证。

Result: 在Ising和TASEP模型上验证了方法的有效性，并在扩散模型中揭示了潜在空间的相变分形结构。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩散模型潜在空间的复杂结构及其与相变现象的联系提供了新见解。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设训练与测试数据分布一致且无污染，但现实中不成立。本文首次系统研究数据偏移对 CoT 模型的危害。

Method: 聚焦 $k$-parity 问题，分析数据分布偏移和数据投毒对 CoT 分解训练模型的影响。

Result: 发现 CoT 在 $k$-parity 问题上的表现比直接预测更差，并揭示了其机制原因。

Conclusion: 数据偏移和污染显著影响 CoT 模型性能，需进一步研究应对策略。

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

Motivation: 持续学习中神经网络的灾难性遗忘问题，尤其是自组织映射（SOMs）的局限性。

Method: 引入饱和自组织映射（SatSOM），通过逐步降低学习率和邻域半径来冻结训练良好的神经元，并将学习重定向到未充分利用的区域。

Result: SatSOM提高了持续学习中的知识保留能力。

Conclusion: SatSOM是一种有效的改进方法，适用于持续学习场景。

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

Motivation: 现代神经网络常编码不需要的概念，影响公平性和可解释性，现有方法可能损害有用信号。

Method: SPLICE使用斜投影移除敏感概念，同时精确保留目标标签的协方差。

Result: 在Bias in Bios和Winobias等基准测试中，SPLICE优于基线，移除保护属性且对主任务信息损害最小。

Conclusion: SPLICE是唯一能移除线性概念预测性并保持目标协方差的解决方案，具有理论和实证优势。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

Motivation: 现有表格原生ICL架构仅依赖合成数据，未能充分利用真实数据的语义和世界知识；而基于大语言模型的ICL模型又受限于上下文容量。

Method: 引入ConTextTab，结合语义理解与表格原生ICL框架，使用多模态嵌入并训练于大规模真实数据。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，并在语义丰富的CARTE基准上创下新标准。

Conclusion: ConTextTab成功融合了两种方法的优势，为表格ICL提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative

Result: 给出了ε范围内的几乎匹配的上下界，优于之前仅能实现绝对误差的工作。

Conclusion: 首次研究了相对误差限制下的单调分类问题，提供了更优的理论结果。

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

Result: LSR实现了精确记忆检索和高容量，同时引入更多局部极小值，且在图像数据集上表现出创造性和新颖性。

Conclusion: LSR在记忆存储和生成任务中具有潜力，为DenseAM网络提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models

interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing

exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

Conclusion: 熵正则化与鲁棒性的关联为强化学习中的鲁棒安全性提供了新思路，可通过简单奖励塑形实现。

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

Motivation: 大规模语言模型训练通常需要高带宽集群，成本高且扩展性受限。现有低通信方法仍需同步步骤，导致低带宽网络下效率低下。

Method: NoLoCo通过Nesterov动量优化器的变体，随机选择部分模型权重进行平均，避免集体通信。

Result: NoLoCo在125M至6.8B参数模型上表现优异，通信开销显著低于现有方法，同步速度快一个数量级，收敛速度提升4%。

Conclusion: NoLoCo是一种高效的低通信训练方法，适用于大规模模型训练，尤其适合低带宽环境。

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

Conclusion: PSMs为神经序列模型的设计提供了新的理论框架，兼具高效性和表达能力。

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

Result: 在多种商业和开源模型中，内部缓解方法将偏见降至1%以下，保持性能。

Conclusion: 建议采用更真实的评估方法和内部缓解策略以确保公平招聘。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

Result: 实验表明SEAL在知识整合和少样本泛化方面表现良好。

Conclusion: SEAL是实现语言模型自我适应的重要一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our
website and code is available at https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal.

Motivation: 解决LLM遗忘学习中的无意遗忘问题，同时保留有价值信息。

Method: 提出轻量级代理数据归因指标，设计自适应非均匀遗忘权重分配策略。

Result: 在TOFU基准测试中，GUARD显著提升保留性能，遗忘10%数据时保留集效用提升194.92%。

Conclusion: GUARD有效平衡遗忘与保留，为LLM遗忘学习提供新方向。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

Result: 实验表明，EG-CFG在多种编码任务中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: EG-CFG通过动态整合执行信号，显著提升了代码生成的准确性和多样性。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

Result: 在困难逆问题（如大范围修复和高倍超分辨率）中显著提升样本质量和测量一致性。

Conclusion: ReGuidance首次为DPS提供了严格的算法保证，同时提升奖励和接近数据流形。

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

TLDR: Farseer是一种新的缩放定律，显著提高了预测准确性，减少了外推误差433%，并优化了LLM训练的计算分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型训练成本高、小规模实验结果难以推广的问题。

Method: 通过构建模型损失表面$L(N,D)$，Farseer比现有方法（如Chinchilla定律）更精确地拟合经验数据。

Result: Farseer在1,000个LLM上验证，减少了433%的外推误差，并提供了优化的计算分配策略。

Conclusion: Farseer为LLM训练提供了可靠的预测工具，推动了高效创新，并开源了所有数据和模型。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

Motivation: 研究扩散桥中不同损失函数的性能差异，尤其是LV损失和rKL损失的表现，以优化采样方法。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，比较LV损失和rKL-LD损失在扩散桥中的表现，包括超参数优化和训练稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，rKL-LD损失在性能上优于LV损失，且训练更稳定，超参数优化需求更少。

Conclusion: rKL-LD损失在扩散桥中更具优势，建议在实际应用中优先使用。

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

Result: 识别了五种基本范式，并展示了该分类法在跨模态评估中的广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注跨模态评估方法的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

Conclusion: TaskCraft提供了一个大规模合成数据集（约36,000个任务），支持未来代理调优和评估的研究。

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在语义相同但表达不同的提示下是否会产生行为差异，揭示模型评估中可能被忽视的稳定性问题。

Method: 提出PBSS框架，应用于10个约束任务，分析模型在语义等效提示下的行为漂移。

Result: 发现模型在语义等效提示下存在一致的行为漂移，可能与分词和解码策略有关。

Conclusion: 提示的微小变化可能导致LLM行为不稳定，分词和解码策略可能影响模型服务质量。

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉推理任务转换为文本推理任务时，会丢失图表中的关键结构和语义信息，尤其是在需要大量视觉细节的任务（如图表问答）中。

Method: ChartReasoner首先训练高保真模型将图表图像转换为结构化ECharts代码，然后设计数据合成管道生成推理轨迹，并通过代码验证器过滤低质量样本，最后结合监督微调和强化学习训练多模态模型。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试中，ChartReasoner表现优异，能尽可能保留图表原始细节，性能接近GPT-4o等专有系统，同时参数更少。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner通过代码驱动的两阶段框架，有效解决了视觉推理任务中的信息丢失问题，性能优越且参数高效。

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: ICM方法能够有效提升前沿语言模型的训练效果，优于人类监督方法。

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

Result: 专家一致性高但受框架子组件影响；LLMs接近专家水平，优于众包工作者。

Conclusion: LLMs在特定任务中表现可靠，适用于情感敏感场景，如对话伴侣。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在故事生成中的局限性，为游戏环境中应用LLM叙事规划提供了挑战与启示。

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

Motivation: 探讨如何利用计算方法识别叙述者是否可靠，填补现实文本中不可靠叙述者检测的研究空白。

Method: 基于叙事学理论定义不可靠叙述者类型，构建TUNa数据集，测试LLM在多种学习设置下的分类性能。

Result: 任务具有挑战性，但LLM在识别不可靠叙述者方面有潜力。

Conclusion: 释放数据集和代码，鼓励未来研究。

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

TLDR: ToxSyn-PT是首个大规模葡萄牙语语料库，支持对九个受法律保护的少数群体进行细粒度仇恨言论分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决葡萄牙语中仇恨言论数据稀缺的问题，并提供多样化的合成数据以支持低资源环境下的研究。

Method: 通过四阶段流程创建语料库：手动筛选种子、少样本扩展、基于释义的增强和中性文本补充。

Result: 生成的语料库类别平衡、风格多样，并在多个葡萄牙语仇恨言论数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT为合成数据和低资源环境下的仇恨言论检测研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

TLDR: 语言模型在特定条件下可能表现出近乎确定性的决策行为，挑战了传统采样假设，并提出了一种区分随机与确定性决策的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否具有贝叶斯大脑，并重新评估先前基于采样假设的方法。

Method: 通过模拟Gibbs采样实验，分析语言模型在不同条件下的决策模式，并提出区分随机与确定性行为的方法。

Result: 发现语言模型在非零采样温度下仍可能产生最大似然估计，揭示了其确定性行为，并指出模拟Gibbs采样可能导致误导性先验。

Conclusion: 语言模型的决策行为可能更复杂，需谨慎评估其先验推断方法，以避免误导性结论。

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于梯度的数据选择方法在大型语言模型微调中计算资源消耗过大，难以实际应用。

Method: 结合聚类和修改的UCB算法，将数据选择问题建模为多臂老虎机问题，通过历史数据信息估计集群分布并平衡探索与利用。

Result: 实验表明，ClusterUCB在保持性能的同时大幅降低了计算消耗。

Conclusion: ClusterUCB是一种高效且实用的数据选择方法，适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

TLDR: Flick是一种针对低资源语言环境下少标签文本分类的新方法，通过提炼高置信度的伪标签来提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言环境下少标签分类问题中伪标签噪声和领域适应的挑战。

Method: Flick引入伪标签细化组件，通过单簇凝聚和自适应top-k选择机制提炼高置信度伪标签。

Result: 在14个多样化数据集（包括阿拉伯语、乌尔都语等低资源语言）上表现优异。

Conclusion: Flick在低资源语言环境下显著提升了少标签分类的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 研究表明，用户提供的建议会影响大型语言模型（LLMs）在教育模拟场景中的表现，尤其是谄媚行为（sycophancy）可能带来显著风险。不同查询框架下，LLMs的响应质量差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在教育环境中对用户建议的敏感性，尤其是谄媚行为对学习公平性的潜在影响。

Method: 测试了五款LLMs（来自OpenAI GPT-4o和GPT-4.1系列），在五种实验条件下评估其响应质量。

Result: 当学生提到错误答案时，LLMs的正确率可能下降15个百分点；提到正确答案时则提升15个百分点。较小模型的偏差更强（如GPT-4.1-nano偏差达30%，GPT-4o为8%）。

Conclusion: LLMs的谄媚行为可能加剧教育不平等，需进一步研究其机制及缓解方法。

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在语音到语音翻译（S2ST）中存在模态适应问题，因为LLMs仅基于文本数据训练，难以直接适应语音模态。

Method: 提出了一种计划性交替训练方法，在训练中交替使用语音和文本单元，并逐步减少文本比例，以实现从文本到语音的渐进式模态适应。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在CVSS数据集上显著提升了翻译性能，尤其是在训练数据有限的语言中。

Conclusion: 通过计划性交替训练，成功解决了LLMs在S2ST中的模态适应问题，提升了翻译效果。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

Conclusion: 该方法生成高精度推理数据，优化推理效率，适用于多领域任务。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理包含文本和表格的异构文档时，因扁平化表格和分块策略导致信息丢失和推理能力下降，亟需改进。

Result: 实验表明，TableRAG在公共数据集和HeteQA基准上均优于现有基线，创下异构文档问答的新记录。

Conclusion: TableRAG通过统一文本和表格处理，显著提升了异构文档问答能力，并开源了框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

Motivation: LLM在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但自我验证能力不足，现有方法依赖额外验证模型或多阶段训练，扩展性受限。

Method: 提出PAG框架，通过多轮RL训练，让LLM在生成和验证角色间切换，引入选择性修正机制。

Result: 实验表明，PAG在推理和验证任务中均表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAG通过统一框架提升LLM的自我验证和修正能力，具有扩展性和高效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

Result: 发现战争报道多于和平报道，且美、英和中东媒体在冲突角色描述上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 媒体框架对读者观点有显著影响，需警惕其潜在的冲突激化作用。

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

Method: 研究通过分割奖励函数并引入新的输出长度惩罚机制，动态调整模型的推理效率。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH500和AIME2024三个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在简单问题上缩短了输出长度并保持准确性，在复杂问题上提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM的推理效率，兼顾了输出简洁性和准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

Motivation: 仅预测主张标签不足以揭示模型的推理过程，缺乏可解释性。因此，研究旨在通过识别关键表格单元格来增强验证任务的可解释性。

Method: 扩展SciTab基准数据集，加入人工标注的单元格级依据，并提出处理模糊案例的分类法。

Result: 结合表格对齐信息提升了主张验证性能，但多数LLM无法准确恢复人类标注的推理路径。

Conclusion: 研究强调了模型推理路径的重要性，并指出当前LLM在忠实推理方面的不足。

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

Method: 通过预提示人物角色在多学科基准（MMLU）上评估模型，并设计不同任务（如评分、薪资谈判建议）来检测偏见。

Result: 预提示角色对评分影响微弱，但在评分用户答案和薪资谈判建议任务中表现出显著偏见。

Conclusion: 随着LLM助手记忆和个性化趋势，模型已知用户社会人口特征可能导致偏见问题加剧。

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

Motivation: 探索如何以低成本实现语言模型的强大推理能力。

Method: 使用LoRA对1.5B参数的基模型进行参数高效更新，结合强化学习。

Result: Tina模型在推理性能上优于或接近SOTA模型，成本仅为现有方法的1/260，且Pass@1准确率达43.33%。

Conclusion: LoRA在高效RL推理中表现出色，快速适应推理结构，同时保留基模型知识，代码和模型完全开源。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在多用户对话状态跟踪（DST）中的表现，发现其在多用户场景下性能显著下降，需进一步优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DST基准主要关注结构化用户-代理对话，无法反映真实多用户交互的复杂性，因此需要评估LLMs在多用户DST中的鲁棒性。

Method: 基于言语行为理论，通过生成第二个用户的对话扩展现有DST数据集，系统地将多用户对话纳入评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，与单用户DST相比，LLMs在多用户场景下的性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在多用户DST中存在局限，未来研究需提升其在此类场景中的表现，以实现更真实和鲁棒的DST模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何高效且低成本地从语言模型中提取和增强推理能力。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）从源模型中捕捉推理能力，并通过监督微调将其迁移到目标模型中。

Result: SAE-Tuning在仅1美元成本和20分钟内实现接近RL训练的性能（>97%），并在轻量RL训练后显著提升推理表现。

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning是一种高效、低成本且可推广的推理能力提取方法，具有通用性和模块化特性。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在知识密集型任务中因缺乏背景知识和幻觉倾向导致的性能不足问题。

Method: 提出RRP框架，结合关系嵌入和双向分布学习，引入反思模块评估和优化推理路径。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上达到最优性能，并能以即插即用方式增强多种LLMs。

Conclusion: RRP通过生成定制化推理路径，有效指导LLMs推理，提升其性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖概率模型，受限于数据驱动性质，无法充分利用语言学约束。

Result: 在拉丁语原始词形重建任务中，字符级准确性和音系合理性指标显著提升。

Conclusion: 混合方法在重建原始词形上优于传统数据驱动方法。

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the

Motivation: 探究LLMs在拼写过程中如何内部表示和利用字符级信息。

Result: 发现LLMs的嵌入层未完全编码字符信息，需依赖中间层突破拼写行为。

Conclusion: LLMs的字符处理机制复杂，拼写行为依赖多层Transformer重建。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

Motivation: 检测威胁生命的语言对保护个体心理健康和预防潜在伤害至关重要。

Method: 使用Gemma、Mistral和Llama-2三种开源LLMs，并在不同数据集（平衡、不平衡、极端不平衡）上进行微调，与传统方法（如词袋模型、词嵌入、主题建模、BERT）对比。

Result: LLMs表现优于传统方法，Mistral和Llama-2表现最佳，Gemma稍逊。上采样技术对传统方法有益，但对LLMs影响较小。

Conclusion: LLMs在现实世界的威胁生命语言检测中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

TLDR: PREMISE框架通过提示优化减少大型推理模型的冗余计算，保持准确性同时显著降低成本和令牌使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的链式推理（CoT）冗长且成本高，限制了在延迟敏感或API受限环境中的部署。

Method: PREMISE结合诊断和梯度启发式提示优化，通过多目标文本搜索平衡令牌长度和答案有效性。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，PREMISE保持或提升准确性（如Claude 96%→96%），同时减少87.5%的推理令牌和69-82%的成本。

Conclusion: 提示级优化是高效推理的可行路径，无需牺牲推理质量。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统二元标签（真/假）无法处理复杂声明的问题，提供更全面的多角度验证。

Method: 提出ClaimSpect框架，利用检索增强生成技术分层解析声明，检索相关语料片段以发现子方面和观点。

Result: 在科学和政治声明数据集上验证了框架的鲁棒性和准确性，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: ClaimSpect能有效解构复杂声明并整合语料库中的多角度观点，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt能有效捕捉科学领域演变，生成更优的多维度分类法。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在训练时面临模型容量有限、高质量数据稀缺和计算资源限制等问题，且分词器对新语言的覆盖不足，导致训练后适应新语言困难。

Conclusion: 通用分词器设计是一种低成本且高效的方法，可在不显著影响预训练语言性能的情况下，显著提升模型对新语言的适应能力。

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in

Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the

TLDR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLM）修正ASR预测中命名实体错误的方法，结合LLM的推理能力和本地上下文（如讲义），在NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare数据集上实现了命名实体WER相对降低30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 命名实体是ASR系统中的关键部分，但现有ASR系统对其识别错误率较高，影响下游应用。

Method: 引入LLM修正机制，利用LLM的推理能力和包含正确命名实体的本地上下文（如讲义）修正ASR预测。

Result: 在NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare数据集上，命名实体的WER相对降低30%。

Conclusion: LLM修正机制能有效提升ASR系统对命名实体的识别准确性。

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

*Wei Sun,Tingyu Qu,Mingxiao Li,Jesse Davis,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: LangEdit提出了一种新颖的空空间约束框架，用于在多语言大模型中高效更新知识，同时避免参数干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言大模型中知识更新时参数干扰导致的多语言泛化能力下降问题。

Method: 通过将每种语言的参数更新投影到先前更新子空间的正交补空间，确保更新独立性。

Result: 在三种模型架构、六种语言和四个下游任务中，LangEdit显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LangEdit为多语言大模型的高效知识更新提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示方法中因过度思考导致的冗余推理轨迹问题。

Method: 采用逐步探索机制和长短切换采样策略，生成多样化推理路径，训练两个专用模型（一个优化准确性，一个优化推理长度），最后通过参数插值集成。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集和骨干模型上，ReCUT显著减少推理长度30-50%，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: ReCUT有效平衡推理长度和准确性，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为SlowFast Sampling的动态采样策略，通过交替探索和加速解码阶段，显著提升了扩散语言模型（dLLMs）的生成效率和灵活性。结合dLLM-Cache减少冗余计算，实验显示最高可实现34.22倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有dLLMs的采样策略（如基于置信度或半自回归解码）存在静态行为问题，导致效率低下和灵活性不足。

Method: 提出SlowFast Sampling，基于确定性、收敛性和位置性三大原则动态切换解码阶段，并结合dLLM-Cache减少计算冗余。

Result: 在LLaDA上实现最高15.63倍加速，结合缓存后可达34.22倍，且准确率下降极小，吞吐量优于LLaMA3 8B等自回归基线。

Conclusion: SlowFast Sampling通过优化采样策略，充分释放了dLLMs在快速高质量生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Motivation: 探索自监督语音模型在不同语言中的信息表示方式，填补非英语分析的空白。

Method: 使用探测分类器和几何分析，研究模型对音素、声调和说话者信息的编码。

Result: 所有预训练和测试语言中，音素、声调和说话者信息的子空间基本正交，层间探测准确率模式相似，匹配语言的音素和声调探测在后期层略有优势。

Conclusion: wav2vec2学习的表示结构基本不受预训练语音材料影响。

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Conclusion: MedRef为现实医疗应用提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large

performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and
benchmark tasks. The study provides both theoretical insights into
parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers
implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）通过微调获取新知识时的双重性：既能泛化新事实，又易产生幻觉信息，并提出这是由同一机制——上下文外推理（OCR）驱动的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在知识获取中表现出的双重行为（泛化与幻觉）的根本原因。

Method: 通过实验验证OCR机制的存在，并形式化为合成事实回忆任务，分析单层单头注意力模型的性能。

Result: OCR机制解释了泛化和幻觉行为，矩阵分解是关键因素，梯度下降的隐式偏置是OCR能力的数学基础。

Conclusion: 研究为OCR现象提供了理论框架，为分析和缓解知识注入中的不良行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

Result: 在四个下游任务中表现优于现有生物医学和临床编码器。

Conclusion: BioClinical ModernBERT为生物医学和临床NLP提供了高效的解决方案，并公开了模型和训练检查点以支持研究。

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's
capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal
understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral
Medium, trained for reasoning on top of Mistral Medium 3 with RL alone, and we
open-source Magistral Small (Apache 2.0) which further includes cold-start data

Result: SNMF在因果引导任务中优于SAEs和监督基线，且特征与人类可解释概念一致。

Conclusion: SNMF是一种简单有效的工具，可用于识别LLM中的可解释特征和概念表示。

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Conclusion: 动态认知摩擦模型为LLMs对齐提供了新视角，未来可扩展以应对更复杂的对话需求。

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在语言模型预训练中数据混合选择效率低下，Domain2Vec旨在通过元域分解和分布对齐假设优化这一过程。

Method: Domain2Vec通过分类器将数据集分解为元域向量的分布，利用分布对齐假设（DA²）在无需训练的情况下找到最优数据混合。

Result: 实验表明，Domain2Vec仅需51.5%的计算量即可达到相同验证损失，并在相同计算预算下平均提升下游任务性能2.83%。

Conclusion: Domain2Vec是一种高效、可扩展的方法，显著优化了语言模型预训练的数据选择过程。

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

TLDR: AutoMind是一个自适应的大型语言模型（LLM）代理框架，通过专家知识库、树搜索算法和动态代码生成策略，提升了自动化数据科学的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM驱动的数据科学代理在复杂任务中表现不佳，因其依赖固定工作流程和编码策略，无法模拟人类专家的经验。

Method: AutoMind结合专家知识库、树搜索算法和自适应代码生成策略，动态适应任务复杂度。

Result: 在自动化数据科学基准测试中，AutoMind表现优于现有方法，展现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AutoMind是迈向全自动数据科学的重要一步，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推理模型如何有效进行自我重新评估，以发现错误并提高准确性。

Method: 通过向模型注入四种无益思维（如无关思维、误导思维等），观察其识别和恢复能力。

Result: 模型能识别无益思维，但恢复能力差，大模型表现更差，且存在非/逆缩放趋势。

Conclusion: 需改进推理模型的自我重新评估能力，以提升推理效果和系统安全性。

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

### [186] [A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130)

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文提出了一个猜想，揭示了AI系统中可证明的正确性与广泛数据映射能力之间的基本权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI系统在设计时如何平衡严格的可证明正确性与处理高维数据的能力，这一矛盾在历史上一直存在但未明确表述。

Method: 通过信息论形式化这一猜想，并结合认识论、形式验证和技术哲学的背景进行分析。

Result: 猜想表明，AI系统无法同时实现零错误性能和高维数据处理能力，这对评估标准、治理框架和混合系统设计有重要影响。

Conclusion: 验证或反驳这一猜想对构建可信AI至关重要，需进一步研究以明确其影响。

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 当前医学AI模型难以动态适应新场景，导致预测错误，需改进以提升临床应用。

Method: 提出上下文切换AI概念，无需重新训练即可动态调整推理。

Result: 模型能跨专科和地区诊断治疗疾病，扩大医疗服务覆盖。

Conclusion: 动态上下文切换AI有望提升医学模型的适应性和应用范围。

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

Conclusion: 通过整合特征重要性和可解释性分析，为未来因果研究提供基础，有助于AD的早期诊断和干预。

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在数学、符号和常识推理方面表现出色，但战略推理（评估动态环境中的多智能体行为、制定行动计划和调整策略）尚未被系统评估或建模。

Method: 通过兵棋游戏设计WGSR-Bench，围绕环境态势感知、对手风险建模和政策生成三个核心任务（S-POE架构）评估战略推理能力，并设计了一个LLM驱动的兵棋代理。

Result: WGSR-Bench旨在评估现有LLM在博弈论战略推理中的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究有望推动基于大模型的战略智能研究。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

Motivation: 研究AI系统能力提升时安全验证的计算复杂性，揭示能力与安全需求之间的动态关系。

Method: 通过形式化能力-风险动态（CRS）和四个核心定理，分析验证复杂性与系统表达能力的关系。

Result: 验证复杂度指数增长，安全策略占比极小，现有对齐技术无法全覆盖，安全属性对神经网络为零测集。

Conclusion: AI发展需在系统复杂性约束、接受不可验证风险或开发新安全范式间做出选择。

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

Result: 在单一团队配置下，方法能击败专业选手，但随着团队规模扩大，性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 跨团队策略的泛化能力仍是开放挑战，代码已开源。

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large
language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of
tasks in the Minecraft environment. Project page:

Motivation: StarCraft AI的传统方法（规则系统或监督学习）在适应性和计算效率上存在局限，需更高效的训练框架。

Method: 提出NeuroPAL框架，整合NEAT与PAL，通过交替训练与评估优化进化训练效率。

Result: PAL显著加速学习过程，训练时间减半，并涌现专家级策略（如代理兵营布局）。

Conclusion: PAL等结构化评估机制可提升神经进化在复杂实时策略环境中的可扩展性与有效性。

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

Conclusion: HMS和SA-MCTS有效解决了知识不足和领域差距问题，Mirage-1在长时任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection

environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型日益复杂，传统算法基准已趋饱和，需要更具挑战性的基准来指导未来算法推理的改进。

Abstract: As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm
benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more
challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning.
This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging
olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original
problems. We detail the construction methodology of the benchmark, ensuring a
comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities,
and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We
propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and
enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant
evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind
closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human
participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal
compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully
open-source resource (https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGI-Eval/OIBench), we
hope this benchmark will contribute to advancing code reasoning capabilities
for future LLMs.

Motivation: 当前科学基准主要评估MLLMs的知识理解能力，而忽略了感知和推理能力的评估，导致对MLLMs在科学领域的全面评估不足。

Method: 设计了SFE基准，包含830个专家验证的VQA对，涵盖三个问题类型和五个高价值学科的66个多模态任务，评估科学信号感知、属性理解和比较推理能力。

Result: 实验显示，当前最先进的GPT-o3和InternVL-3在SFE上的表现仅为34.08%和26.52%，表明MLLMs在科学领域仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

TLDR: LogiPlan是一个新基准，用于评估大语言模型在复杂关系结构中的逻辑规划和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑关系推理对依赖LLMs生成和查询关系图的应用（如网络基础设施、知识库或业务流程模式）至关重要。

Method: LogiPlan通过控制对象数量、关系和关系链的最小深度动态调整任务复杂度，包含三个任务：计划生成、一致性检测和比较问题，并评估模型的自我纠正能力。

Result: 评估了多个先进模型，发现性能差距与模型规模和架构相关，复杂配置下模型表现不佳。

Conclusion: 尽管增强推理模型在简单任务上表现良好，但在需要深度逻辑规划的复杂配置中仍有挑战。

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

TLDR: 论文介绍了Primender序列，一种结合素数性质和模数条件的整数序列，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）的符号推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要可解释的、基于规则的测试平台，以评估LLM推断隐藏规则、验证数学假设和规模化推广符号逻辑的能力。

Method: 设计结构化提示和评估框架，测试多个LLM在识别规则、验证假设和生成序列方面的表现。

Result: 提出了一种新的数学构造和方法论，用于评估LLM在符号推理和假设测试中的性能。

Conclusion: Primender序列为连接数论、人工智能和软件工程领域提供了新的工具和方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

Method: 结合基于神经网络的症状生成器和新的图诊断算法，利用子系统间的最小因果关系信息。

Result: 在模拟数据集中，82%的情况下包含真实因果组件，73%的场景中有效缩小搜索空间；在真实数据集上也展示了实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在缺乏先验知识的大型复杂信息物理系统中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种将AutomationML（AML）建模的非正式文本约束形式化并验证的流程，通过映射到OWL本体、翻译为SHACL约束并自动解释验证结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AML建模建议多为非正式文本约束，无法自动验证，需形式化方法解决。

Method: 将AML模型映射到OWL本体，用大型语言模型将文本规则转为SHACL约束，并验证和解释结果。

Result: 验证表明复杂建模规则可半自动检查，无需用户掌握形式化方法或本体技术。

Conclusion: 该流程有效解决了AML约束自动验证问题，提升了建模效率。

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

Method: 开发编译器aspsmt2smt，利用gringo部分接地输入程序，z3处理剩余变量。

Result: 系统能有效处理实数计算，支持连续变化推理。

Conclusion: ASPMT及其编译器为复杂问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining
answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the
functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT
programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to
compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler
called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP
grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for
reasoning about continuous changes.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its
performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts
instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex
solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently
explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization
problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from
Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging
environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution
refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both
ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to
promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative

Conclusion: 该框架为城市行为建模提供了新方法，推动了LLMs在城市计算中的应用，并为智能城市规划等提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments
show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to
0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work
contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling,
advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical
approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a
foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and
participatory urban design applications.

Abstract: Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex
tasks. However, they lack the ability to understand planning tasks when
provided using natural language. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
introduced novel capabilities in human-computer interaction. In the context of
planning tasks, LLMs have shown to be particularly good in interpreting human
intents among other uses. This paper introduces GenPlanX that integrates LLMs
for natural language-based description of planning tasks, with a classical AI

demonstrate the efficacy of GenPlanX in assisting users with office-related
tasks, highlighting its potential to streamline workflows and enhance

Motivation: 毒性是药物早期开发失败的主要原因，但目前分子毒性修复任务尚未被系统性定义或评估。

Method: 构建标准化数据集（11个任务，560个分子），设计机制感知和任务自适应的提示标注流程，并提出自动化评估框架ToxiEval。

Result: 评估了近30个主流MLLM，发现尽管面临挑战，但已展现出毒性理解、语义约束和结构感知编辑的潜力。

Conclusion: ToxiMol为分子毒性修复提供了基准，MLLM在该任务中展现出初步潜力，但仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

TLDR: 强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）能在某些模型中激发强大的数学推理能力，即使奖励信号与正确答案无关。Qwen2.5-Math-7B在MATH-500上的性能显著提升，但其他模型（如Llama3或OLMo2）未见类似效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RLVR在缺乏有效奖励信号的情况下如何通过强化学习提升模型的数学推理能力。

Method: 使用RLVR训练模型，测试不同奖励信号（随机、格式、错误标签等）对Qwen2.5-Math-7B等模型的影响。

Result: Qwen2.5-Math-7B性能显著提升（最高27.1%），但其他模型未见类似效果。代码推理行为在Qwen中显著增加。

Conclusion: RLVR可能利用了预训练中学到的推理表示，但机制尚不明确。未来研究需验证多种模型，避免单一模型偏差。

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

This work describes a method for creating 60-second cinematic movies
incorporating Stable Diffusion for high-fidelity image synthesis, GPT-2 for
narrative structuring, and a hybrid audio pipeline using gTTS and
YouTube-sourced music. It uses a five-scene framework, which is augmented by
linear frame interpolation, cinematic post-processing (e.g., sharpening), and
audio-video synchronization to provide professional-quality results. It was
created in a GPU-accelerated Google Colab environment using Python 3.11. It has
a dual-mode Gradio interface (Simple and Advanced), which supports resolutions
of up to 1024x768 and frame rates of 15-30 FPS. Optimizations such as CUDA
memory management and error handling ensure reliability. The experiments
demonstrate outstanding visual quality, narrative coherence, and efficiency,
furthering text-to-video synthesis for creative, educational, and industrial
applications.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于掩码的LoRA调优方法，用于灵活的视频编辑，无需修改模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频编辑方法依赖大规模预训练，缺乏灵活性，尤其是对后续帧的控制不足。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在视频编辑性能上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效且灵活的视频编辑解决方案，适用于特定编辑需求。

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TLDR: DeepTraverse是一种新型视觉架构，受算法搜索策略启发，通过系统性阐明和自适应细化学习特征，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉主干网络的特征构建方式单一，缺乏自适应迭代细化路径，能否通过算法搜索原则实现更结构化、逻辑化的处理流程？

Method: DeepTraverse包含递归探索模块（深化特征分析）和自适应校准模块（动态调整特征显著性），通过算法交互构建和细化特征模式。

Result: 在多个图像分类基准测试中，DeepTraverse表现出色，分类准确性和特征区分度优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 集成算法先验是构建更高效、性能更强、结构更清晰的视觉主干网络的有效策略。

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型因计算和内存冗余严重，限制了实际部署能力，需系统性解决方案。

Result: 在CogACT模型上实现1.93倍加速，FLOPs降至28.9%，成功率仅下降0.6%。

Conclusion: EfficientVLA有效解决了VLA模型的冗余问题，显著提升效率且性能损失极小。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

Result: 最佳检测方法的真阳性率为75.3%，表明任务具有挑战性。

Conclusion: ICCWD数据集有助于设计更好的未成年人检测方法。

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Conclusion: RoCA在跨域自动驾驶中表现出强大的泛化和适应能力。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

Conclusion: SPARKE方法有效解决了提示感知多样性问题，适用于大规模生成场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

Motivation: 传统方法依赖月度统计估计背景反射率，在山区因积雪变化频繁而失效，需要更动态的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够隐式学习表面反射率动态，提升复杂地形下的泛化能力，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at

Motivation: 由于线性探测（LP）无法充分评估掩码图像建模（MIM）模型的潜力，且现有注意力探测方法存在参数过多和效率低下的问题，需要一种更高效的探测方法。

Conclusion: EP是一种高效且通用的探测方法，适用于多种预训练范式，显著提升了性能与效率。

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

Result: 在DeepFashion2和ConCon-Chi基准测试中，个性化检索准确率比现有方法提升4%-22%。

Conclusion: 低秩适应方法在个性化视觉-语言检索中表现优异，同时有效保留了通用知识。

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

TLDR: 提出HalLoc数据集和基线模型，用于高效、概率性的幻觉检测，提升视觉语言模型的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有幻觉检测方法计算成本高、无法处理模糊边界的问题。

Method: 构建包含15万标注样本的HalLoc数据集，开发低开销的基线模型。

Result: 模型能实时检测幻觉，提升模型可靠性且不影响效率。

Conclusion: HalLoc为增强视觉语言模型的可信度提供了新途径。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌的准确诊断对早期治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习方法受限于数据稀缺和缺乏不确定性意识。

Method: 使用迁移学习和不确定性量化（UQ）在HAM10000数据集上评估多种预训练特征提取器和分类器，并引入UQ方法（MCD、Ensemble、EMCD）。

Result: CLIP-based视觉变换器（如LAION CLIP ViT-H/14与SVM结合）性能最高；集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理间表现最佳。

Conclusion: 将不确定性量化融入深度学习模型可提升医学诊断的性能和可信度，适用于临床实践。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见癌症，手动生成SOAP笔记耗时且导致医生疲劳，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用弱监督多模态框架，结合病变图像和稀疏临床文本生成SOAP笔记，减少人工标注依赖。

Result: 性能与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro相当，并引入MedConceptEval和CCS评估临床质量。

Conclusion: 框架可扩展且临床实用，减轻医生负担，减少对大标注数据集的需求。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

TLDR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在分析学生学术情绪中的潜力，发现其在零样本提示下能识别部分情绪，但存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法难以泛化，需反复数据收集和训练，而VLMs提供了一种无需微调的新途径。

Method: 使用两种VLMs（Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct和Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct）通过零样本提示分析5,000张学生面部表情图像。

Result: 两种模型在学术情绪识别中表现中等，Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct表现更优，但对分心行为识别较差。

Conclusion: VLMs在学术情绪识别中具有一定潜力，尤其是Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct在识别困惑情绪方面表现突出。

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于点特征感知的高斯泼溅框架，用于从稀疏训练视图中实现实时高质量渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法需要大量校准视图，稀疏输入时易过拟合，导致渲染质量下降。

Method: 利用立体基础模型估计相机姿态和稠密点云，通过多尺度2D特征采样和自注意力机制增强点间交互，最终解码为高斯参数。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中显著优于NeRF方法，在少样本设置下与最先进的3DGS方法竞争。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏视图下的渲染质量下降问题，实现了高质量的实时渲染。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

Motivation: 现有方法无法同时满足遵循文本指令和专注于局部修改的需求，限制了CAD设计的效率和灵活性。

Method: 提出互补标注策略（顶点和VLLM标注），并利用LLM预测被掩码的局部部分。

Result: 实验证明GeoCAD在生成质量、有效性和文本-CAD一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: GeoCAD为局部几何可控CAD生成提供了高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

Motivation: 理解城市文化和建筑风格的差异对预测城市未来演变至关重要，但传统方法依赖专家解释和历史文档，难以标准化。

Method: 采用视觉语言模型构建多模态研究框架，开发UrbanSense框架和UrbanDiffBench数据集，实现城市风格的定量分析和比较。

Result: 实验结果显示，超过80%的生成描述通过t检验，主观评价的高Phi分数（城市0.912，时期0.833）表明方法能捕捉细微风格差异。

Conclusion: 该方法为城市风格演变的量化和解释提供了科学依据，对未来设计具有潜在价值。

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

TLDR: RKM（RealKeyMorph）是一种分辨率无关的医学图像配准方法，避免了传统方法因重采样引入的伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习配准技术需固定分辨率重采样，可能引入伪影，限制了实际应用。

Method: RKM扩展了KeyMorph框架，通过输出真实世界坐标的关键点，避免重采样，利用扫描仪的仿射矩阵实现分辨率无关。

Result: 实验证明RKM在腹部MRI和不同分辨率脑数据集上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RKM提供了一种更优的医学图像配准方案，适用于多种分辨率场景。

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

Conclusion: Motion-R1通过逻辑分解和联合优化，显著提升了文本到动作生成的性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

performance compared to state-of-the-art lightweight models. MHLA notably
improves inference speed, allowing FaceLiVT to deliver high accuracy with lower

Conclusion: FSATFusion在红外与可见光图像融合及下游视觉任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 通过图像处理框架，本文深化了对自注意力机制的理解，同时展示了改进架构的实际优势。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

Motivation: 海底物体埋藏状态对研究局部沉积动力学、生态风险评估及污染物迁移至关重要，但现有遥感图像方法难以准确估计埋藏深度。

Method: 结合CAD模型对齐与局部海底平面拟合，通过多视角摄影测量和深度特征估计物体姿态与埋藏深度。

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

*Shicheng Yin,Kaixuan Yin,Yang Liu,Weixing Chen,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种动态自适应区域标记器（DART），通过自适应划分图像为不同大小的内容相关补丁，解决了固定大小补丁导致的背景过度编码和局部细节缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定大小的补丁在稀疏分布的信息对象中会导致背景过度编码和关键局部细节缺失，限制了非卷积模型（如ViT和Vim）的性能。

Method: DART结合可学习的区域分数和分段可微分分位数操作，自适应分配更密集的标记到信息丰富的区域。

Result: DART在DeiT（ImageNet-1K）上提高了2.1%的准确率，同时减少了45%的FLOPs。

Conclusion: DART是一种高效的方法，能够在不增加计算开销的情况下显著提升性能，适用于多种模型。

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为ReconMOST的数据驱动扩散模型框架，用于多层海水温度重建，解决了传统方法在稀疏数据、算法复杂性和高计算成本方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确重建海洋温度对全球气候动力学和海洋气象研究至关重要，但现有方法受限于数据稀疏性和计算复杂性，机器学习方法也仅适用于表层或局部区域重建。

Method: 通过预训练无条件扩散模型学习历史数值模拟数据中的物理一致性分布模式，并在生成阶段利用高精度原位观测数据作为反向扩散过程的指导点。

Result: 该方法在缺失数据超过92.5%的情况下仍能保持重建精度和空间分辨率，MSE值在指导、重建和总体上分别为0.049、0.680和0.633。

Conclusion: ReconMOST框架在全局多层海洋温度重建中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，为海洋研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

Motivation: 现有统一模型在图像理解和生成任务中表现不如专用模型，主要因视觉特征和训练过程的差异。

Method: 提出Pisces模型，采用解耦视觉编码架构和优化训练技术，结合数据筛选和微调。

Result: 在20多个图像理解基准测试和GenEval生成基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Pisces展示了图像理解与生成的协同关系，并验证了分离视觉编码器的优势，推动了统一多模态模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

TLDR: LRRNet提出了一种端到端的红外小目标检测框架，利用背景的低秩特性，通过压缩-重建-减除范式直接建模背景，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测在复杂背景下因低信噪比、目标形态多样和缺乏视觉线索而具有挑战性，现有深度学习方法因目标变异性大和弱先验导致性能不稳定。

Method: 采用压缩-重建-减除（CRS）范式，直接学习图像域中的低秩背景结构，无需基于块的处理或显式矩阵分解。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，LRRNet优于38种先进方法，检测精度、鲁棒性和计算效率均显著提升，实时性能达82.34 FPS。

Conclusion: LRRNet首次通过端到端深度网络直接学习低秩背景结构，为红外小目标检测提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAPTCHA方案在深度学习攻击下日益脆弱，现有对抗攻击方法依赖原始图像特征，导致失真且适用性受限。

Method: UAC利用大型语言模型生成对抗样本，EDICT方法优化扩散模型的双潜在变量以提升图像质量；BP-UAC采用双路径优化策略处理黑盒场景。

Result: 实验表明BP-UAC在多种系统中攻击成功率高，生成的CAPTCHA对人类和DNN均难以区分。

Conclusion: UAC框架有效解决了传统CAPTCHA的脆弱性问题，为对抗攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频内容的快速增长需要更有效的摘要技术，传统单模态方法难以捕捉视频的完整语义。

Method: MF2Summ采用五阶段流程：特征提取、跨模态注意力交互、特征融合、片段预测和关键镜头选择，使用Transformer建模跨模态依赖。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上，MF2Summ的F1分数分别比DSNet提高了1.9%和0.6%，优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: MF2Summ通过多模态融合显著提升了视频摘要性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CIDer为多模态情感识别提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

Motivation: 传统显式运动方法在人体视频压缩中因复杂多样的运动模式导致重建失真和运动不准确，需探索更有效的方法。

Method: 提出IMT范式，将复杂人体信号转化为紧凑视觉特征，并进一步转化为隐式运动指导以重建信号。

Result: 实验证明IMT能显著提升生成式人体视频编解码器（GHVC）的压缩效率和重建保真度。

Conclusion: IMT为人体视频压缩提供了一种高效且高保真的解决方案，克服了显式运动方法的局限性。

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）由于其高维和丰富的光谱信息，与自然图像不同，现有对抗攻击方法在HSI上的研究有限，且难以充分利用图像的结构和特征信息。

Method: 方法包括：1）在保持图像结构不变的情况下，随机分块并应用多样化变换；2）设计针对中间层的特征距离损失，结合输出层预测作为辅助损失。

Result: 实验表明，所生成的对抗样本在两个公开HSI数据集上对黑盒模型具有高可迁移性，且在防御策略下仍保持强攻击性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了HSI对抗样本的可迁移性和攻击效果，为HSI分类模型的安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

Result: GHN-QAT显著提升了4位量化精度，并在2位量化中表现优于随机初始化。

Conclusion: GHN-QAT为量化DNN设计提供了新思路，未来可结合量化感知训练进一步优化。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music

textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蜂蜜的植物源分类对市场价值至关重要，但难以一次性收集所有品种训练模型，因此需要类增量学习技术。

Method: 研究比较了多种CIL算法，并提出结合CB算法的方法，通过重新初始化较少使用的神经元来提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，CB方法将大多数CIL算法的性能提升了1-7%。

Conclusion: 结合CB的CIL方法能有效解决蜂蜜植物源分类问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

*Shuyang Li,Shuang Wang,Zhuangzhuang Sun,Jing Xiao*

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为PSLG-SAM的两阶段框架，用于解决参考遥感图像分割（RRSIS）任务中的密集标注和复杂场景问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RRSIS方法依赖多模态融合和语义分割头，面临密集标注和复杂场景解释的挑战。

Method: PSLG-SAM将任务分解为粗定位和精细分割两阶段：粗定位阶段通过视觉定位网络粗略定位目标，精细分割阶段利用SAM模型结合聚类和边界优化策略进行精确分割。

Result: 实验表明PSLG-SAM在RRSIS-D和RRSIS-M数据集上性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PSLG-SAM通过两阶段分解和训练无关的第二阶段，显著减少了标注负担并提升了分割精度。

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: J-DDL显著提升了战斗机检测的自动化水平，为未来研究提供了数据支持。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated
aircraft inspection technologies.

Conclusion: CogReasoner为流媒体视频推理提供了高效解决方案，代码即将发布。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species

system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,

structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

Conclusion: CEI为评估人脸识别系统的公平性提供了敏感且鲁棒的工具，适用于其他统计分布尾部分析问题。

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Dense visual SLAM, leveraging RGB-D camera systems, offers advantages but faces
challenges in achieving real-time performance, robustness, and scalability for

decompositions, achieves better convergence rates, memory efficiency, and
reconstruction/localization quality than existing state-of-the-art approaches.
Evaluation across diverse indoor RGB-D datasets demonstrates LRSLAM's superior

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

Conclusion: DanceChat通过LLM的显式指导，有效提升了舞蹈生成的多样性和音乐对齐性。

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Method: 利用文本生成图像模型生成多样化图像，结合类热图和可学习原型，整合提示调优和适配器学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均性能提升3.47%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: T2I-PAL有效减少模态差异，提升多标签识别性能，且无需全标注图像，兼容现有CLIP框架。

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

Conclusion: 不对称掩码策略在自蒸馏框架中有效，能保留关键信息并提升模型表现。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Motivation: 高密度场景中目标检测的标注成本高，现有方法在点监督下存在样本分配不足和实例混淆问题。

Method: SSP框架结合规则驱动的先验注入和数据驱动的标签净化，提出像素级和语义级空间分区方法。

Result: 在DOTA-v1.0等数据集上，SSP的mAP达到45.78%，优于PointOBB-v2 4.10%；与ORCNN和ReDet结合时，mAP分别达47.86%和48.50%。

Conclusion: SSP为高密度场景下的目标检测提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is

TLDR: LatentCSI利用预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDM）从WiFi CSI测量生成物理环境图像，避免了传统方法的复杂计算，实现了高效高质量的图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖复杂且计算密集的技术（如GANs），而LatentCSI旨在通过轻量级神经网络直接映射CSI到LDM的潜在空间，简化流程并提升效率。

Method: 使用轻量级神经网络将CSI幅度映射到LDM潜在空间，结合文本引导的扩散模型去噪，最后通过LDM解码器生成高分辨率图像。

Result: 在公开数据集和自采数据集上验证，LatentCSI在计算效率和感知质量上优于基线方法，并具备文本引导可控性。

Conclusion: LatentCSI提供了一种高效、高质量的图像生成方法，同时具备文本引导的灵活性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的边界框标注且难以统一多种查询类型，MSTAR旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，MAP提升6.4%（Total-Text），MQTR基准上平均提升8.5%。

Conclusion: MSTAR在减少标注成本的同时显著提升了多查询场景文本检索性能。

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

Result: 在Objaverse和ShapeNet数据集上，TexTailor在生成视角一致纹理方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TexTailor通过改进纹理合成过程，显著提升了纹理一致性，代码已开源。

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

Conclusion: 该方法为医学影像中的文本-图像对齐问题提供了有效解决方案，代码将公开。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ和COCO-Stuff上分别达到FID 11.9和7.0，支持一步分割和分类，性能领先。

Conclusion: SymmFlow在生成、分割和分类任务中表现优异，展示了统一框架的潜力。

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型的微调方法依赖人工标注和大规模计算资源，限制了实用性。

Result: 在VBench-2.0基准测试中，GigaVideo-1在17个维度上平均提升4%，仅需4 GPU小时。

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1展示了无需人工标注和最小真实数据的高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and
data will be publicly available.

Motivation: 现有原型方法在医学图像中学习到的原型过于细粒度且可视化不一致，难以与人类理解的生物标志物对应。

Method: PiPViT利用视觉Transformer捕获长距离依赖关系，结合对比学习和多分辨率输入处理，学习稳健且可解释的原型。

Result: 在四个视网膜OCT数据集上，PiPViT性能与先进方法相当，同时提供更具临床意义的解释。

Conclusion: PiPViT能够透明解释其决策，帮助临床医生理解诊断结果。

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Result: 在Style GAN数据集上分类准确率94.14%，AUC-ROC得分0.985。

Conclusion: 该模型为深度伪造检测提供高效、低资源消耗的解决方案。

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

Motivation: 解决未成年筛查中数据分布偏移和儿童数据不足的挑战。

Method: 使用多任务架构，结合FaRL骨干网络和MLP，引入α加权焦点损失和年龄平衡小批量采样。

Conclusion: 模型在分布偏移下表现出强泛化能力，显著提升未成年检测性能。

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

Conclusion: HyperCLIC能有效处理实例和类别的持续学习任务，适用于动态真实环境。

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

Conclusion: UMBD框架能无缝集成现有COD模型，结合判别性与生成性优势，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

TLDR: IQE-CLIP是一种针对医学领域零样本和少样本异常检测的新框架，通过结合文本和视觉信息生成异常敏感的嵌入，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的方法依赖于特定场景的提示设计，且难以区分正常与异常实例，同时在医学领域探索有限。

Method: 提出IQE-CLIP框架，引入基于类和可学习的提示令牌，并设计实例感知查询模块以提取多模态信息。

Result: 在六个医学数据集上，IQE-CLIP在零样本和少样本设置中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: IQE-CLIP通过多模态信息融合，有效解决了医学领域异常检测的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

TLDR: PosterCraft是一个统一框架，用于生成高质量海报，通过多阶段优化流程提升文本渲染、布局和美学效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成美观海报比简单设计更具挑战性，需兼顾文本渲染、艺术内容融合、布局和风格协调。

Method: 采用级联工作流，包括文本渲染优化、区域感知微调、美学文本强化学习和联合视觉语言反馈细化。

Result: PosterCraft在渲染准确性、布局连贯性和视觉吸引力上显著优于开源基线，接近商业系统水平。

Conclusion: PosterCraft通过自动化数据构建和多阶段优化，实现了高质量海报生成，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

TLDR: 提出了一种名为SbCA的统一模型，用于解决超大规模上采样任务中的性能下降问题，通过笔画向量放大器和细节补全模块实现高质量图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASISR方法在超出训练数据范围的上采样因子下表现显著下降，导致模糊问题。

Method: 使用笔画向量放大器将图像分解为矢量图形进行放大，并通过细节补全模块恢复缺失细节，采用循环策略迭代优化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，SbCA在超大规模上采样任务（如×100）中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SbCA有效解决了分布漂移问题，消除了伪影、噪声和模糊，生成高质量超分辨率图像。

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过观察世界获取物理知识并推理动态场景，而现有方法缺乏物理知识整合和多样化场景验证。

Method: SlotPi结合了基于哈密顿原理的物理模块和时空预测模块，用于动态预测。

Result: 实验表明，SlotPi在预测和视觉问答任务中表现优异，并在新创建的真实世界数据集上验证了其适应性。

Conclusion: SlotPi的强适应性为开发更先进的世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

Abstract: This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event
cameras and other sensors with reinforcement learning to enable real-time
human-centered navigation and obstacle avoidance. Unlike conventional
image-based controllers, which operate at fixed rates and suffer from motion
blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event
cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling
adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based
perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to
improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated
environments, demonstrating robust navigation, pedestrian following, and
obstacle avoidance. A demo video is available at the project website.

TLDR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的零样本视频摘要方法，通过结合视频语言模型和大型语言模型，实现用户可控的视频摘要生成。


<details>

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖领域特定训练数据或无法融入用户自然语言意图的问题。

Method: （i）分割视频为场景，（ii）生成场景描述，（iii）用LLM评分，（iv）通过新指标传播分数。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum上超越无监督方法，在QFVS上表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 预训练多模态模型结合提示和分数传播，为通用视频摘要提供了强大基础。

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督形变图像配准方法在稀疏特征和大位移场景下表现不佳，主要因为神经网络预测的形变场缺乏约束。

Method: 提出SmoothProper模块，结合对偶优化层和交互项，实现流信号的空间传播、平滑性约束和结构一致性保持。

Result: 在视网膜血管数据集上，将配准误差降至1.88像素（2912x2912图像），首次有效解决了稀疏特征和大位移问题。

Conclusion: SmoothPrope是一种模型无关、无需调参的解决方案，显著提升了无监督形变图像配准的性能。

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

Method: 提出目标聚焦掩码策略，结合多尺度特征和SDF预测，融合隐式SDF与显式点云表示。

Result: 在DexYCB和HO3Dv2基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: HOMAE通过结合全局上下文与局部几何信息，有效解决了遮挡问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

Result: 在MLVU、LVBench和LongVideoBench基准测试中，性能分别提升9.6%、6.6%和3.9%。

Conclusion: 代理系统在解决长视频理解问题中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and

Conclusion: 该框架为视频抠图量化提供了系统解决方案，显著提升了量化模型的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for

procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

Result: CreatiPoster超越开源和商业系统，发布10万版权免费设计库。

Conclusion: CreatiPoster推动AI辅助图形设计的普及，支持多种应用场景。

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

<details>

Motivation: 现有ZSGM方法假设图像偏移与文本偏移在CLIP嵌入空间中完全对齐，导致生成图像质量下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过实证研究分析CLIP嵌入空间中的偏移不对齐现象，并提出迭代优化方法AIR。

Result: 在26种实验设置中，AIR方法在定性和定量评估中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: AIR方法通过关注偏移不对齐问题，显著提升了零样本生成模型的适应能力和生成图像质量。

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

Result: M4V在768×1280分辨率下比基于注意力的方法减少45% FLOPs，并生成高质量视频。

Conclusion: M4V在降低计算成本的同时，显著提升了视频生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于频谱视角的自回归视觉生成框架SpectralAR，解决了传统图像块自回归建模中的因果性问题，并通过实验验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视觉生成方法使用空间图像块，但图像块本质上是并行的，与自回归建模的因果性矛盾。

Method: 提出SpectralAR框架，通过嵌套频谱标记化将图像转换为有序频谱标记，实现从低频到高频的自回归生成。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的实验显示，SpectralAR仅用64个标记和310M参数即达到3.02 gFID。

Conclusion: SpectralAR在保持序列因果性和标记效率的同时，实现了高质量的视觉生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

TLDR: 论文提出了知识图像生成任务和MMMG基准，用于评估图像生成模型的推理能力，发现现有模型表现不佳，并发布了开源基线FLUX-Reason。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图像对人类文明和学习至关重要，但生成此类图像需要多模态推理能力，现有模型表现不足，因此需要新的任务和基准。

Method: 提出MMMG基准，包含4,456个专家验证的图像-提示对，采用统一知识图谱表示，并引入MMMG-Score评估指标。

Result: 评估16个先进文本到图像生成模型，发现推理能力不足，GPT-4o得分仅50.20；开源基线FLUX-Reason得分为34.45。

Conclusion: MMMG基准揭示了图像生成模型的推理缺陷，FLUX-Reason为未来研究提供了有效基线。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: CDPruner是一种新的视觉令牌修剪方法，通过最大化条件多样性来优化多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉令牌修剪方法存在冗余或忽略指令相关性的问题，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出CDPruner，利用条件相似性和DPP最大化保留令牌的条件多样性。

Result: 在多种MLLMs上实现SOTA性能，显著降低计算成本（如LLaVA上减少95% FLOPs）。

Conclusion: CDPruner高效且通用，能保持高性能的同时大幅降低推理成本。

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

Conclusion: GenWorld数据集和SpannDetector模型为AI生成视频检测提供了新方向，强调了物理合理性的重要性。

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种基于超二次曲面（superquadrics）的高效3D占用预测方法QuadricFormer，解决了现有方法在稀疏驾驶场景中的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D占用预测中通常使用密集体素或稀疏高斯表示，前者效率低，后者因椭球形先验限制了对多样几何结构的建模能力。

Method: 提出使用几何表达能力强的超二次曲面作为场景基元，开发了概率超二次曲面混合模型，并设计了QuadricFormer模型和剪枝-分裂模块以提高效率。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，QuadricFormer在保持高效的同时实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 超二次曲面基元能高效表示复杂结构，QuadricFormer为3D占用预测提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

Motivation: 现有注意力扰动方法缺乏确定扰动位置的原则性方法，尤其是在DiT架构中，质量相关的计算分布在多个层中。

Method: 研究了注意力扰动的粒度，从层级别到单个注意力头，并提出“HeadHunter”框架和SoftPAG方法。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX.1等模型上验证了方法的优越性，实现了生成质量的提升和视觉风格的针对性操控。

Conclusion: 首次在扩散模型中进行了头级别的注意力扰动分析，揭示了注意力层的可解释性分工，并提供了有效的扰动策略设计方法。

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

TLDR: InstaInpaint是一种基于参考的前馈框架，能在0.4秒内完成3D场景修复，速度比现有方法快1000倍，同时保持高性能。


<details>

Motivation: 当前3D场景修复方法依赖耗时计算，无法满足实时或在线应用需求。

Method: 提出InstaInpaint框架，采用自监督掩码微调策略训练大型重建模型（LRM），从2D修复提案生成3D修复结果。

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现优异，支持灵活的下游应用（如物体插入和多区域修复）。

Conclusion: InstaInpaint在速度和性能上均优于现有方法，适用于实时3D场景修复。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

Motivation: 现有生成模型在2D补全后依赖3D恢复技术，导致表面过度平滑和几何失真，无法仅从RGB数据推断3D结构。

Method: 提出双流扩散模型（几何-外观）联合合成RGBD空间的新视角，并结合场景编码器从参考图像中获取更全面的场景理解。

Result: 方法在多样数据集上展示了更高的视觉一致性和合理性。

Conclusion: SceneCompleter通过融合结构和纹理信息，实现了更优的3D一致生成式新视角合成。

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

Main category: math.OC

TLDR: 本文探讨了Gittins指数在实际问题中的应用潜力，尽管其理论性强且适用范围有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gittins指数虽在理论上能优化多种决策问题，但实际应用较少，本文旨在展示其实际价值。

Method: 通过实例驱动的介绍和多个问题示例，展示Gittins指数的应用，包括贝叶斯优化和队列尾延迟最小化。

Result: Gittins指数在某些问题中能实现最优解，其他问题中虽次优但表现优异。

Conclusion: Gittins指数不仅具有理论意义，还能有效解决实际问题。

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,
advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

Result: 突变效应预测性能与序列似然性高度相关，且预测性能的范围受序列长度显著影响。

Conclusion: 使用gLM进行突变效应预测时，需综合考虑序列似然性和长度。

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for

inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在多场景和角色连贯叙事上存在挑战，生成结果常因固定长度片段和模型不稳定性导致叙事脱节和视觉不连贯。

Method: AniMaker采用多智能体框架（导演、摄影、评审、后期制作），结合MCTS-Gen高效生成候选片段和AniEval评估多片段动画。

Conclusion: AniMaker通过智能体协作和优化技术，推动了AI生成叙事动画向生产标准迈进。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent
storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains
challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into
fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.
Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that
even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output
animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient
multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus
creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text
input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the
Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip
generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent
for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical
components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to
generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in
Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot
animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level
consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering

*Yuxuan Li,Sheng Jinag,Bizhu Wang*

Main category: cs.MM

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于语义通信的云-边-端协作架构（SC-CEE-Meta），用于解决元宇宙中VR数据传输的延迟和带宽问题，显著降低了传输延迟并提升了图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着技术进步和对新视听体验的追求，元宇宙受到热捧，但高分辨率虚拟场景的传输面临带宽不足和延迟问题，影响了用户体验。

Method: 提出了SC-CEE-Meta架构，包括VR视频语义传输、视频合成和3D虚拟场景重建三个模块，通过语义通信减少数据传输量，并在云端和边缘设备上部署预处理和渲染模块。

Result: 在Meta Quest Pro上验证，SC-CEE-Meta在恶劣信道条件下可减少96.05%的无线传输延迟，并提升43.99%的图像质量。

Conclusion: SC-CEE-Meta架构有效解决了元宇宙中的数据传输问题，显著提升了用户体验，为未来元宇宙服务提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences
strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces
practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image
quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

Main category: cs.MM

TLDR: 论文提出了一种注意力视频扩散（AVD）模型，通过生成事故视频片段解决交通场景中的事故预测问题，同时引入EQ-TAA方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通场景中的事故预测（TAA）面临数据偏差和背景混淆问题，现有方法依赖标注且难以捕捉真实因果关系。

Method: 提出AVD模型，通过文本提示生成因果视频帧，并结合EQ-TAA方法使用对比损失训练。

Result: 实验表明AVD和EQ-TAA性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AVD和EQ-TAA为TAA提供了一种无需额外标注的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

TLDR: 提出了一种自适应双模态框架，通过动态分支选择、双向跨模态GAN和混合训练协议，显著提升了HER2评估的准确性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HER2评估模型通常独立分析H&E或IHC图像，而临床依赖两者的协同解释。但由于工作流程复杂性和成本限制，难以同时获取两种模态。

Method: 1) 动态分支选择器；2) 双向跨模态GAN；3) 混合训练协议。

Result: 单模态H&E预测准确率从71.44%提升至94.25%，双模态准确率达95.09%，IHC输入可靠性为90.28%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过弹性设计，显著提升了HER2评估的准确性和适用性，尤其适合资源有限的环境。

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.MM

TLDR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的3D面部动画框架，解决了多模态情感控制信号不足和确定性映射限制表达多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一模态控制信号且缺乏对情感表达随机性的建模，限制了动画的表现力。

Method: 采用FLAME多模态情感绑定策略和注意力潜扩散模型，实现多信号源情感控制和多样化运动生成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在情感相似性上提升21.6%，同时保持面部动态的自然性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态对齐和扩散模型显著提升了3D面部动画的表达力和可控性。

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉叙事（如漫画）的多模态内容结构化理解问题，支持故事结构、角色连续性和事件进展的推理。

Method: 将叙事内容分解为多个层次（从宏观故事线到细粒度事件段），构建多模态图谱链接视觉元素与文本组件，并跨层次集成。

Result: 在Manga109数据集上验证，支持符号推理任务（如动作检索、对话追踪等），表现出高精度和召回率。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于叙事的分析、交互式故事和多模态推理提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

Result: 在MIntRec数据集上达到最优性能，准确率提升1.13%。消融实验显示小波融合模块显著提升非语言语义提取，识别准确率增加0.41%。

Conclusion: WDMIR框架有效填补了语言与非语言信息间的语义鸿沟，提升了意图识别的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal
systems.

Motivation: 理解情感表达中语音、面部和手势的协调动态，以提高实时情感检测的准确性，并优化人机交互系统。

Method: 使用IEMOCAP语料库中的双人互动数据，结合语音特征（如韵律、MFCCs、情感模型输出）和3D面部及手部标记位移，量化表达活跃度并预测语音与手势的映射关系。

Result: 非重叠语音显著增加下半脸和嘴部的活跃度；悲伤在非重叠时表达增强，愤怒在重叠时手势减少；韵律和MFCCs在发音区域预测准确性最高。

Conclusion: 对话结构和同步性显著影响情感表达，多模态协调动态的深入理解有助于提升情感检测和AI系统的表现。

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

Conclusion: 该框架为高性能CUDA代码转译提供了有效解决方案，展示了LLM在此领域的应用前景。

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering
farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these
technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce
additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly
challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with
existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic
mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots
through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

Abstract: Constructing a physically realistic and accurately scaled simulated 3D world
is crucial for the training and evaluation of embodied intelligence tasks. The
diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets
are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI.
However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on
traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which
suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations
significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present
EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It
enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and
photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale
in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can
be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained
physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation.
EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key
modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object
Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates
diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging
generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the
needs of embodied intelligence related research. Code is available at

Result: 在大规模物品抓取数据集上进行了全面评估，揭示了多模态训练和预训练的重要性。

Conclusion: 多模态训练和预训练能显著提升抓取性能，且模型能在微调和推理时仅使用部分模态输入。

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

Result: EyeRobot在五个全景工作空间操作任务中表现出色，实现了大范围工作空间的有效操作。

Conclusion: EyeRobot展示了手眼协调行为，能够通过单一摄像头高效完成大范围操作任务。

Abstract: Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order
to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system
with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We
develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings
and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We
accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a
360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports
rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze
on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the
hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye
observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct
action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks
towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements
a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small
compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable
fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.
We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring
manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest
EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate
manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera. See project site for

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中均优于基线方法，展示了强大的开放词汇目标理解和泛化导航能力。

Conclusion: VLFly为无人机语言引导导航提供了高效、泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

Conclusion: 该方法在机器人导航和复杂地形探索中具有潜力，展现了超越个案预测的通用性。

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from
sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these
methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at

Result: 三种方法均能有效识别关键残基，并与实验数据一致。

Conclusion: 新方法为蛋白质关键残基识别提供了有效工具，且优于现有技术。

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance
for future research in this rapidly evolving area. For more information,

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar
manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

Result: 实验证明BNMusic能有效减少噪声感知，提升听觉体验。

Conclusion: BNMusic框架通过融合噪声与个性化音乐，显著改善声学体验。

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine
learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations
such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute
sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a
scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome
these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically
generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude
encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands
representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to
quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational
advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum
architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through
extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge
states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating
resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This
research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,
advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional
computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and
resource expenditure.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种评估LLM代码生成质量的合成管道和基于角色的系统方法，以量化输入变化对生成代码的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM降低了编写代码的门槛，但生成代码的质量受用户背景和提示质量影响，需量化这种敏感性。

Method: 提出了独立于具体编程任务和LLM的合成评估管道和基于角色的系统评估方法。

Result: 实验证明了方法的有效性，并公开了代码供社区使用。

Conclusion: 提出的方法广泛适用，有助于评估LLM代码生成的敏感性。

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity
with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's
sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic
persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM
responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are
widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our
methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.

TLDR: BugGen是一个利用大型语言模型（LLM）自动生成、插入和验证RTL中功能性错误的系统，显著提高了验证效率和ML辅助调试的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件复杂性增加了验证资源的压力，需要采用机器学习方法来提高调试效率，但现有方法无法可靠生成多样化和可扩展的错误数据集。

Method: BugGen采用多代理管道，通过LLM系统性地生成、插入和验证功能性错误，包括模块分区、目标选择和迭代优化。

Result: 在OpenTitan IP块上测试，BugGen生成了500个独特错误，功能准确率达94%，并发现了104个未检测到的错误。ML模型训练分类准确率达88.1%-93.2%。

Conclusion: BugGen为生成高质量错误数据集提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了验证效率和ML辅助调试的实用性。

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

Motivation: 研究用户对AI移动应用的感知和评价，填补现有研究的空白，并解决用户反馈量大且复杂的问题。

Method: 利用292个AI驱动的应用和894K条用户评论，开发了一个多阶段分析流程，包括评论分类、情感-主题提取和聚类，并验证了大型语言模型（LLMs）和提示策略的有效性。

Result: 提取了18个正面和15个负面用户主题，发现用户关注的核心主题包括生产力、可靠性、个性化帮助（正面）和技术故障、价格问题、语言支持限制（负面）。

Conclusion: 该分析方法能更准确地反映用户对AI应用的体验，揭示了普遍满意因素和领域特定问题，为未来AI应用设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统构建GitHub问题解决任务数据集的方法耗时且费力，特别是在环境搭建、结果评分和任务验证阶段。

Method: SWE-Factory整合了三个自动化组件：SWE-Builder（多智能体系统自动化环境搭建）、标准化退出代码评分方法、自动化fail2pass验证。

Result: 实验显示，SWE-Factory能高效构建有效任务实例（如GPT-4.1-mini下每实例成本$0.045），退出代码评分准确率100%，fail2pass验证精度0.92、召回率1.00。

Conclusion: SWE-Factory为训练和评估LLMs提供了高效、高质量的GitHub问题解决数据集构建方案。

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at

Abstract: Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many
automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a
full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or
eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing
environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control
and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have
discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.
In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the
camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches
for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this
algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is
unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy
available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the
algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the
search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging
technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation
accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering
out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated
manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success
of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on
keyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,
limitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical
issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among
commonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations
leading to overestimated performances. Additionally, we address the limited
availability of pre-trained models by releasing a strong PLM-based model for
keyphrase generation as an effort to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于GNN的方法对噪声边敏感且易过拟合，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提取局部子图，生成两种图表示：一种结合注意力机制去噪，另一种通过变分自编码器对齐特征分布。使用互学习损失函数协调表示。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，RMSE提升0.8%，排序指标提升36%。

Conclusion: MCCL显著提升了矩阵补全的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

Motivation: 现有GNN-based KGRSs在稀疏交互场景下性能不佳，且复杂模型和机制（如注意力机制）会进一步降低性能。

Method: LightKG采用简化GNN层（将关系编码为标量对）和线性聚合框架，并引入高效对比学习层，避免耗时的子图生成和比较。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，LightKG平均推荐准确性提升5.8%，训练时间减少84.3%。

Conclusion: LightKG在稀疏和密集场景下均优于现有方法，同时显著降低训练时间，证明了其简单性和高效性。

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is

Motivation: 现有模型在长期用户价值预测中表现不佳，低估长期价值或缺乏鲁棒性，需要改进。

Method: SHORE结合短期预测任务（如LTV-15和LTV-30）作为辅助任务，并采用混合损失函数（顺序保持分类和动态Huber损失）。

Result: 在真实数据集上，SHORE比现有基线模型预测误差相对减少47.91%。

Conclusion: SHORE在数字游戏LTV预测中表现出高效和鲁棒性，适用于工业规模应用。

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

Conclusion: MGOE是图基多任务推荐领域的突破性方法。

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

Main category: cs.GR

TLDR: FastFLUX是一种架构级剪枝框架，通过BRLL方法和ST训练策略提升FLUX模型的推理效率，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I生成模型（如FLUX）参数庞大，导致推理慢、内存占用高、部署困难，现有加速方法性能下降明显且训练成本高。

Method: 提出BRLL方法，用轻量线性层替换复杂残差分支，保留原始快捷连接；引入ST训练策略，利用LoRA监督邻近块。

Result: FastFLUX在保持高质量图像生成的同时显著提升推理速度，即使剪枝20%层级仍表现优异。

Conclusion: FastFLUX有效解决了FLUX模型的推理效率问题，为T2I生成模型的部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

TLDR: 利用低质量、合成和分布外图像提升扩散模型质量的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖高质量数据集，但低质量图像中仍蕴含价值，如何利用这些数据提升模型表现是研究动机。

Method: 提出Ambient Diffusion Omni框架，利用图像的光谱功率律衰减和局部性特性，从所有可用图像中提取信号。

Result: 在合成损坏图像上验证框架有效性，并在ImageNet上实现最佳FID，显著提升文本到图像生成的质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 噪声能平衡高质量分布与混合分布间的偏差，理论分析验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的新型密度均衡映射框架（LDEM），通过深度神经网络实现密度均匀性和几何规则性，解决了传统方法在精度、重叠伪影和2D到3D扩展方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密度均衡映射方法依赖迭代数值求解器或优化方法，存在精度有限、极端情况下产生重叠伪影以及从2D扩展到3D时需重新设计算法的问题。

Method: 提出LDEM框架，使用深度神经网络，引入损失函数确保密度均匀性和几何规则性，并采用分层方法预测粗粒度和密集级别的变换。

Result: LDEM在多种简单和复杂密度分布下表现出优于现有方法的密度均衡性和双射性，且能无缝扩展到3D领域。

Conclusion: LDEM为密度均衡映射的稳健和可扩展计算提供了新思路，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试衣方法局限于正面视角且缺乏实时性，而基于单件服装的方法因依赖昂贵机器人模型和合成服装与人体对齐问题而受限。

Method: 采用真实人体收集服装数据集，结合简化的DensePose图改进中间表示，确保服装与人体对齐并支持交互。

Result: 在图像质量和时间一致性上优于现有方法，用户研究表明系统有助于服装购买决策。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了现有技术的局限性，提供了更实用和高效的虚拟试衣解决方案。

Abstract: Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front
view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods
have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training
per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1)
the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively
expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural
human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the
human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for
collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the
necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person
representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a
simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized
garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction
without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and
quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual
try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of
our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user
study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system
helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在3D资产编辑中面临多视角一致性的挑战，限制了灵活性和实际应用。

Method: 基于视频扩散模型，Edit360通过锚点视图编辑传播机制，在潜在和注意力空间中对齐多视角信息。

Result: 实现了高质量3D资产的重建，支持任意视角的编辑。

Conclusion: Edit360为可定制的3D内容创作提供了灵活且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image
generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains
challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view
consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined
viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications.
We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to
multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360
enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring
structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for
2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To
achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation
mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within
the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited
multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets,
enabling customizable 3D content creation.

Main category: cs.GR

TLDR: 提出了一种新型动态校准方法，突破了IMU校准中的绝对静态假设限制，实现了实时估计RG'G和RBS，并通过Transformer模型和校准触发器设计，首次实现了隐式IMU校准和稀疏IMU的长期精确运动捕捉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IMU校准方法依赖于绝对静态假设，限制了应用场景。本文旨在打破这一限制，扩展IMU的动态校准能力。

Method: 基于两个宽松假设（RG'G和RBS在短时间内变化微小，且运动/IMU读数多样），利用Transformer模型学习映射关系，并设计校准触发器确保多样性。

Result: 实现了隐式IMU校准和稀疏IMU的长期精确运动捕捉，代码和数据集已开源。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统限制，显著扩展了IMU的应用场景，为动态校准提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse
inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive
absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G
and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby
significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve
real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the
matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU
readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption
reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides
diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for
accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in
real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS
matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based
model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU
readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To
our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,
seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration
process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture
using sparse IMUs. The code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头颈癌治疗中，解剖结构变化可能导致质子治疗剂量分布偏差，传统手动重规划耗时耗力。

Method: 使用DRL算法（DQN和PPO），基于患者CT和模拟解剖变化数据训练个性化代理，调整优化优先级。

Result: 在五名患者中，DRL代理显著提升计划质量分数，优于人工重规划。

Conclusion: DRL框架在自适应质子治疗中展现出潜力，可高效优化治疗计划。

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering
efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton
therapy.

Method: MAGIC通过复制nnU-Net的编码和解码分支实现，支持单模型处理多模态数据，并在Sim-CT、MR-Linac和CCTA三种模态上训练和验证。

Result: MAGIC在57%的案例中优于对比模型，平均DSC分数为0.75(Sim-CT)、0.68(MR-Linac)和0.80(CCTA)。

Abstract: Cardiac substructures are essential in thoracic radiation therapy planning to
minimize risk of radiation-induced heart disease. Deep learning (DL) offers
efficient methods to reduce contouring burden but lacks generalizability across
different modalities and overlapping structures. This work introduces and
validates a Modality-AGnostic Image Cascade (MAGIC) for comprehensive and
multi-modal cardiac substructure segmentation. MAGIC is implemented through
replicated encoding and decoding branches of an nnU-Net-based, U-shaped
backbone conserving the function of a single model. Twenty cardiac
substructures (heart, chambers, great vessels (GVs), valves, coronary arteries
(CAs), and conduction nodes) from simulation CT (Sim-CT), low-field MR-Linac,
and cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) modalities were manually delineated and used
to train (n=76), validate (n=15), and test (n=30) MAGIC. Twelve comparison
models (four segmentation subgroups across three modalities) were equivalently
trained. All methods were compared for training efficiency and against
reference contours using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and two-tailed
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (threshold, p<0.05). Average DSC scores were
0.75(0.16) for Sim-CT, 0.68(0.21) for MR-Linac, and 0.80(0.16) for CCTA. MAGIC
outperforms the comparison in 57% of cases, with limited statistical
differences. MAGIC offers an effective and accurate segmentation solution that
is lightweight and capable of segmenting multiple modalities and overlapping
structures in a single model. MAGIC further enables clinical implementation by
simplifying the computational requirements and offering unparalleled
flexibility for clinical settings.

Motivation: 新法西斯主义在西方国家迅速增长，对民主和少数群体构成威胁，需要采取行动防止其升级。

Method: 开发新法西斯主义编码方案，收集网络数据并标注，利用SLMs和LLMs训练分类模型。

Result: 模型成功分类新法西斯主义话语，发现此类论坛中新法西斯主义言论普遍存在。

Conclusion: 社会背景是研究新法西斯主义话语的关键，未来需继续此类研究以维护民主社会。

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled
with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The
neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical
circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear
responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be
performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network
was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic
time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through
manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to
learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical
neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical
systems using only external control parameters.

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

Result: 确定了37个最优类别，其中25个常见，14个可稳定分离，并对10个类别进行了初步解释。分类结果与已知物理机制一致。

Conclusion: 该方法有效分类雷达数据，关键参数为信号轨迹形状、散射高度和多普勒速度。

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and
the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为DUN-SRE的新型网络，用于动态MRI重建，通过时空旋转等变性显著提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态MRI具有时空对称性，现有方法未能有效利用时间对称性，限制了重建质量。

Method: 提出DUN-SRE网络，结合(2+1)D等变卷积架构，将数据一致性和近端映射模块统一到深度展开框架中。

Result: 在心脏CINE MRI数据集上，DUN-SRE表现出色，尤其在保留旋转对称结构方面。

Conclusion: DUN-SRE通过严格时空对称性约束，为动态MRI重建提供了更准确的建模方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在分割MRI中增强的脑肿瘤区域时性能不足，主要由于对MRI特异性特征（如复杂纹理和方向变化）考虑不充分。

Method: 提出HFF-Net，包含频域分解模块（FDD）、自适应拉普拉斯卷积（ALC）和频域交叉注意力（FDCA），以多尺度融合特征。

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors, particularly contrast-enhancing regions
visible in post-contrast MRI (areas highlighted by contrast agent injection),
is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains
challenging. However, current methods exhibit notable performance degradation
in segmenting these enhancing brain tumor areas, largely due to insufficient
consideration of MRI-specific tumor features such as complex textures and
directional variations. To address this, we propose the Harmonized Frequency
Fusion Network (HFF-Net), which rethinks brain tumor segmentation from a
frequency-domain perspective. To comprehensively characterize tumor regions, we
develop a Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) module that separates MRI images
into low-frequency components, capturing smooth tumor contours and
high-frequency components, highlighting detailed textures and directional
edges. To further enhance sensitivity to tumor boundaries, we introduce an
Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC) module that adaptively emphasizes critical
high-frequency details using dynamically updated convolution kernels. To
effectively fuse tumor features across multiple scales, we design a Frequency
Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) integrating semantic, positional, and
slice-specific information. We further validate and interpret frequency-domain
improvements through visualization, theoretical reasoning, and experimental
analyses. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that
HFF-Net achieves an average relative improvement of 4.48\% (ranging from 2.39\%
to 7.72\%) in the mean Dice scores across the three major subregions, and an
average relative improvement of 7.33% (ranging from 5.96% to 8.64%) in the
segmentation of contrast-enhancing tumor regions, while maintaining favorable
computational efficiency and clinical applicability. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像生成中数据稀缺问题限制了机器学习的发展，现有方法依赖短提示文本编码器、非医学LDMs或大量数据微调，限制了性能和科学可访问性。

Method: 提出CCELLA，一种双头条件化方法，结合非医学大语言模型编码的文本特征和病理分类，同时提出联合损失函数和数据高效的LDM训练框架。

Result: 在有限的前列腺MRI数据集上，3D FID得分为0.025，显著优于基线模型（FID 0.071）。合成图像提升了分类器准确率（69%到74%），且仅用合成图像训练的分类器性能接近真实图像。

Conclusion: CCELLA方法在数据稀缺条件下实现了高质量的医学图像生成，提升了模型性能和科学可访问性，为医学图像分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges
affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical
LDM training typically relies on performance- or scientific
accessibility-limiting strategies including a reliance on short-prompt text
encoders, the reuse of non-medical LDMs, or a requirement for fine-tuning with
large data volumes. We propose a Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language
model Adapter (CCELLA) to address these limitations. CCELLA is a novel
dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net
with non-medical large language model-encoded text features through
cross-attention and with pathology classification through the timestep
embedding. We also propose a joint loss function and a data-efficient LDM
training framework. In combination, these strategies enable
pathology-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis
given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance
and scientific accessibility. Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a
size-limited prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent
foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer
prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method to the training
dataset improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier
solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to
training on real images alone.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning has enabled accurate pathology detection in brain
MRI, but requires training data from diseased subjects that may not be readily
available in some scenarios, for example, in the case of rare diseases.
Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection, in particular using
diffusion models, has gained popularity in the medical field as it allows for
training on healthy images alone, eliminating the need for large
disease-specific cohorts. These methods assume that a model trained on normal
data cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this
assumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or
accurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In
this work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for
anomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly
supervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images
into the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.
To generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly
randomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary
dataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and
anatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology,
using both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS
dataset. In our extensive experiments, our model: (i) consistently outperforms
variational autoencoders, and conditional and unconditional latent diffusion;
and (ii) surpasses on most datasets, the performance of supervised inpainting
methods with access to paired diseased/healthy images.

Motivation: 由于颅内出血（ICH）标注数据的获取成本高且耗时，传统深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据的局限性凸显。半监督学习（SSL）为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 提出SWDL-Net框架，整合拉普拉斯金字塔（擅长边缘锐化）和深度卷积上采样（提升细节精度），通过差异学习机制实现互补优势。

Result: 在仅2%标注数据的ICH数据集和公开基准测试中，SWDL-Net表现优于现有方法；在BHSD数据集（5%标注数据）上进一步验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: SWDL-Net通过创新性地结合两种互补方法，有效解决了标注数据稀缺问题，为医学图像分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been
released at https://github.com/SIAT-CT-LAB/SWDL.

Result: 多领域实验表明ConStyX具有优越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: ConStyX通过内容和风格增强有效解决了领域泛化问题。

Abstract: Medical images are usually collected from multiple domains, leading to domain
shifts that impair the performance of medical image segmentation models. Domain
Generalization (DG) aims to address this issue by training a robust model with
strong generalizability. Recently, numerous domain randomization-based DG
methods have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from the following
limitations: 1) constrained efficiency of domain randomization due to their
exclusive dependence on image style perturbation, and 2) neglect of the adverse
effects of over-augmented images on model training. To address these issues, we
propose a novel domain randomization-based DG method, called content style
augmentation (ConStyX), for generalizable medical image segmentation.
Specifically, ConStyX 1) augments the content and style of training data,
allowing the augmented training data to better cover a wider range of data
domains, and 2) leverages well-augmented features while mitigating the negative
effects of over-augmented features during model training. Extensive experiments
across multiple domains demonstrate that our ConStyX achieves superior
generalization performance. The code is available at
https://github.com/jwxsp1/ConStyX.

Conclusion: 预训练的VRWKV编码器能有效提升模型性能，Med-URWKV是医学领域首个纯RWKV分割模型。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and key technology in
computer-aided diagnosis and treatment. Previous methods can be broadly
classified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based,
Transformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of
them has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or
the computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers.
Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a
promising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range
modeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have
also adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive
performance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the
Vision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring
the potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical
image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure
RWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates
ImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical
image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first
pure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a
large-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets
demonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation
performance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from
scratch. This validates the effectiveness of using a pretrained VRWKV encoder
in enhancing model performance. The codes will be released.

Abstract: Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology,
where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been
shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current
practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of
these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis.
Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting
artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage
deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and
scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in
digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation.
  We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by
analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types
or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a
map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to
specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and
effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues.
  From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images
were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed
software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple
models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet
was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a
limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together
(chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid
design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as
well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的强化学习框架具有通用性，结合加速技术可解决更复杂的流控制问题。

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined
with the proposed acceleration techniques.

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling
in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于时间感知知识蒸馏的框架，用于从鞋垫传感器数据中估计地面反作用力（GRF），解决了便携式传感器噪声大、精度低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跑步机测量GRF成本高且不便携，而便携式鞋垫传感器易受噪声干扰且精度不足，需要一种更准确的方法。

Method: 采用时间感知知识蒸馏框架，利用小批量数据中的相似性和时序特征，捕捉目标与输入数据的互补关系和时序特性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在GRF估计上优于现有基线，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 时间感知知识蒸馏框架为便携式GRF测量提供了一种高精度解决方案。

Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various
applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,
and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force
(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the
ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely
used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of
portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an
alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to
measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance
and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,
we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation
from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal
features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,
effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the
sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the
lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing
GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an
instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware
Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from
wearable sensor data.

Method: 使用精确对角化和数值求解器分析系统的谱特性和局域化特征，并通过无监督机器学习（PCA）分类系统相。

Result: 发现强AAH调制破坏拓扑边缘态，非厄米性导致体态边界局域化，Floquet驱动可设计拓扑绝缘体。

Conclusion: 广义SSH模型展示了丰富的拓扑现象，为理解一维拓扑系统提供了多角度视角。

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂异质过程的原子动力学提供了无参数拟合的数字化孪生模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

TLDR: AI5GTest是一个基于AI的自动化测试框架，用于验证O-RAN组件的合规性，显著减少了测试时间并提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN的分散架构带来了复杂的测试挑战，现有框架依赖人工且易出错，需要更高效、准确的解决方案。

Method: AI5GTest利用Gen-LLM、Val-LLM和Debug-LLM的协作框架，自动生成测试流程、验证合规性并进行根因分析。

Result: AI5GTest显著减少了测试执行时间，同时保持了高验证准确性。

Conclusion: AI5GTest为O-RAN测试提供了高效、自动化的解决方案，解决了现有框架的局限性。

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

Motivation: 月球表面无线通信系统需要满足高自主性、抗干扰性和环境适应性，但现有Space-O-RAN模型的决策逻辑静态且缺乏语义集成。

Method: 通过引入Model Context Protocol (MCP)和Agent-to-A2A协议，构建语义代理层，实现跨实时、近实时和非实时控制层的上下文感知决策。

Result: 分布式认知代理在月球车、着陆器和基站中实现了无线感知协调策略，包括延迟自适应推理和带宽感知语义压缩。

Conclusion: 该方案显著提升了月球表面无线通信系统的上下文感知能力和适应性。

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical deep learning (DL) approach for
energy-efficient traffic classification (TC) on resource-limited
microcontrollers, which are widely used in IoT-based smart systems and
communication networks. Our objective is to balance accuracy, computational
efficiency, and real-world deployability. To that end, we develop a lightweight
1D-CNN, optimized via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), which
achieves 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with only 88.26K
parameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations
(FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies
ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8,
suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32
counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two
microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive
Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and
115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference,
respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted

Motivation: 减少全球海洋生态系统模型启动的计算成本和时间。

Method: 使用CVAE构建参数到稳态年周期的映射，并作为初始值进行模型启动。

Result: CVAE预测的初始值可将迭代次数减少50-95%，远优于使用训练数据均值的方法。

Conclusion: CVAE方法显著加速模型启动，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

Result: 应用于2021年太平洋西北地区热浪，产生的温度异常比75成员集合中最极端成员高3.7°C。

Conclusion: 可微分气候模型能高效探索事件可能性的上限，为构建气候变化下极端天气的目标情景提供了新方法。

Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is
essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on
large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or
lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we
present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model,
NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent
worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest
heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above
the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature
intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks
of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate
models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing
a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather
under climate change.

is tested in AIFS-CRPS, a machine-learned weather forecasting model developed
at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS-CRPS is
trained by directly optimising the almost fair continuous ranked probability

without negatively impacting forecast skill. This opens up promising directions
for future work in scale-aware model training.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human

contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

Conclusion: 在高信噪比下，噪声情况与无噪声情况的样本复杂度一致，为高维数据学习提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

Conclusion: 3MSBM为多边际设置下的匹配框架训练开辟了新途径，显著提升了复杂系统轨迹推断的能力。

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅推广了已知的平滑设置，还为学习者在对抗性和随机性设置之间提供了更灵活的学习策略。

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

Result: 在CIFAR10数据集上验证了方法，发现语义信息传递在扩散中间阶段最高，且不同类别的熵率分布存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 不同类别的语义决策发生在扩散过程的不同中间时间点，揭示了生成过程中的动态特性。

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"
are located at different intermediate times.

### [401] [Box-Constrained Softmax Function and Its Application for Post-Hoc Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10572)
*Kyohei Atarashi,Satoshi Oyama,Hiromi Arai,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: stat.ML

TLDR: 提出了一种新的Box-Constrained Softmax（BCSoftmax）函数，用于在输出概率上强制施加上下界约束，解决了传统Softmax无法硬约束的问题，并通过实验验证了其在校准模型置信度上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Softmax函数只能通过温度参数实现软控制，无法满足某些应用中对输出概率的硬约束需求，影响了模型的可靠性和可信度。

Method: 提出了BCSoftmax函数，通过解决一个带约束的优化问题，实现了对输出概率的上下界约束，并开发了高效的计算算法。还提出了两种基于BCSoftmax的后校准方法。

Result: 在TinyImageNet、CIFAR-100和20NewsGroups数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著改善了模型的校准指标。

Conclusion: BCSoftmax及其校准方法能够有效提升模型的可靠性和可信度，适用于需要严格约束输出概率的场景。

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

TLDR: 本文研究了自适应离策略学习框架，通过迭代优化策略并重新部署以收集更高质量数据。基于PAC-Bayesian理论和Logarithmic Smoothing方法，提出了适用于自适应场景的改进框架，并在实验中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离策略学习通常依赖于静态行为策略收集的数据，但实际应用中需要更灵活的自适应方法，以通过迭代优化策略提升数据质量。

Method: 扩展了PAC-Bayesian理论和Logarithmic Smoothing方法，提出了一种适用于自适应场景的改进框架，并通过调整LS估计器支持多轮部署。

Result: 在静态场景中与现有方法表现相当，但在允许中间策略部署时显著优于离线方法，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 自适应数据收集和PAC-Bayesian框架的结合在多种场景中表现出优势，为离策略学习提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and
the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

Method: 引入一族无偏离策略估计器，从中选出方差最低的估计器。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果验证了所提方法的有效性和实用性，尤其在测试系统相似时方差降低显著。

Conclusion: 提出的估计器简单且能显著降低方差，适用于A/B测试中系统相似的情况。

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and
offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit
similarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

Motivation: 解决在隐藏混杂因素存在时因果效应估计的挑战，利用非参数工具变量回归方法。

Method: 采用基于谱特征的两阶段最小二乘估计器，并推导其泛化误差界。

Result: 性能取决于两个关键因素：谱对齐强度和特征值衰减速度，形成三种结果分类（好、坏、丑）。

Conclusion: 谱对齐和特征值衰减速度共同决定了方法的有效性，实验验证了分类的合理性。

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

Conclusion: 该方法能高效且严谨地利用现代AI模型进行数据集标注。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either
extensive human annotation or expensive experiments. We propose a method that
supplements such "expert" labels with AI predictions from pre-trained models to
construct labeled datasets more cost-effectively. Our approach results in
probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall
labeling error is small. This solution enables rigorous yet efficient dataset
curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology
through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with
pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

Method: 假设无评分误差和离散化误差，推导引导反向动力学的显式解，分析引导强度和维度对采样分布的影响。

Result: 引导会放大特定类别的区域并抑制共享区域，且1D和2D下行为不同；强引导下总变差衰减率为双指数。

Conclusion: 引导不仅影响输出分布，还控制采样轨迹的动态特性，理论分析得到实验支持。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法在保持物理一致性和渐近精度的同时，显著提高了计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为动力学UQ的大规模预测提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

Motivation: 解决音频描述多样性问题，并探索无需多任务指令调优的零样本指令跟随能力。

Method: 训练模型以对话形式生成响应，而非直接生成目标描述，从而捕捉描述的深层含义。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了模型能够跟随未见过的指令，表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 对话延续训练是一种有效的方法，能够提升音频理解模型的指令跟随能力。

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

Result: 在远场噪声增强的Common Voice数据集上，1分钟适应数据下词错误率相对改善20%，10分钟下改善29%。

Conclusion: 该方法在少量数据下显著提升了语音识别器的适应能力。

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in high-dimensional classification
tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

Result: 编码在π-i-calculus中实现了正确性和完备性，双模拟验证简化，且满足五项标准。

Conclusion: 该编码方法有效且合理，为后续形式化验证（如Coq）奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

Result: 实验表明，StepProof在证明成功率和效率上优于传统方法，且手动调整自然语言证明可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: StepProof填补了现有自动形式化方法的不足，为细粒度验证提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.
