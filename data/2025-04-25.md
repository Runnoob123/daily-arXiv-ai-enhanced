### [2] [Evaluating Argon2 Adoption and Effectiveness in Real-World Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17121)
*Pascal Tippe,Michael P. Berner*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文分析了Argon2密码哈希算法的实际应用效果，发现参数配置对安全性影响显著，但弱密码仍是主要风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Argon2在实际应用中的安全性，揭示参数配置和弱密码对安全的影响。

Method: 结合攻击模拟和GitHub仓库的大规模实证研究，评估Argon2的配置和安全性。

Result: OWASP推荐的46 MiB配置显著提升安全性，但弱密码仍易被破解；开发者配置普遍不足。

Conclusion: 仅靠安全算法不足以保证安全，需加强参数指导和开发者教育。

Abstract: Modern password hashing remains a critical defense against credential
cracking, yet the transition from theoretically secure algorithms to robust
real-world implementations remains fraught with challenges. This paper presents
a dual analysis of Argon2, the Password Hashing Competition winner, combining
attack simulations quantifying how parameter configurations impact guessing
costs under realistic budgets, with the first large-scale empirical study of
Argon2 adoption across public GitHub software repositories. Our economic model,
validated against cryptocurrency mining benchmarks, demonstrates that OWASP's
recommended 46 MiB configuration reduces compromise rates by 42.5% compared to
SHA-256 at \$1/account attack budgets for strong user passwords. However,
memory-hardness exhibits diminishing returns as increasing allocations to RFC
9106's 2048 MiB provides just 23.3% (\$1) and 17.7% (\$20) additional
protection despite 44.5 times greater memory demands. Crucially, both
configurations fail to mitigate risks from weak passwords, with 96.9-99.8%
compromise rates for RockYou-like credentials regardless of algorithm choice.
Our repository analysis shows accelerating Argon2 adoption, yet weak
configuration practices: 46.6% of deployments use weaker-than-OWASP parameters.
Surprisingly, sensitive applications (password managers, encryption tools) show
no stronger configurations than general software. Our findings highlight that a
secure algorithm alone cannot ensure security, effective parameter guidance and
developer education remain essential for realizing Argon2's theoretical
advantages.

### [3] [P$_\ell$-Kyber: Packing $\ell$ Plaintexts and Lattice Coding for Kyber](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17185)
*Shuiyin Liu,Amin Sakzad*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种结合编码和加密的设计方法，用于KEMs（如Kyber），通过密文打包和格打包技术，显著降低了解密失败率和通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设解码噪声条目独立，但实际中可能不成立。本文旨在消除这一假设，同时提升性能。

Method: 1. 扩展PVW方法到Kyber，实现密文打包（P$\ell$-Kyber）；2. 提出跨层格编码方案，进一步优化噪声独立性。

Result: 通过实验验证，P$\ell$-Kyber在$\ell=24$时，解密失败率（DFR）<2^{-281}，通信成本（CER）降低90%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅无需噪声独立假设，还显著提升了安全性和效率，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a joint design of encoding and encryption processes
for KEMs like Kyber, without assuming the independence of the decoding noise
entries. Our design features two techniques: ciphertext packing and lattice
packing. First, we extend the Peikert-Vaikuntanathan-Waters (PVW) method to the
Kyber: $\ell$ plaintexts are packed into a single ciphertext. This scheme is
referred to as P$_\ell$-Kyber. We prove that the P$_\ell$-Kyber is IND-CCA
secure under the M-LWE hardness assumption. We show that the decryption
decoding noise entries across the $\ell$ plaintexts (also known as layers) are
mutually independent. Second, we propose a cross-layer lattice encoding scheme
for the P$_\ell$-Kyber, where every $\ell$ cross-layer information symbols are
encoded to a lattice point. This way we obtain a \emph{coded} P$_\ell$-Kyber,
where the decoding noise entries for each lattice point are mutually
independent. Therefore, the decryption failure rate (DFR) analysis does not
require the assumption of independence among the decryption decoding noise
entries. Both DFR and communication cost (CER) are greatly decreased thanks to
ciphertext packing and lattice packing. Finally, we demonstrate that with
$\ell=24$ and Leech lattice encoder, the proposed coded P$_\ell$-KYBER1024
achieves DFR $<2^{-281}$ and CER $ = 4.6$, i.e., a decrease of CER by $90\%$
compared to KYBER1024.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于区块链的双层架构系统，结合Sia和Skynet，用于安全分发数字内容，提升保护与分发效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字内容分发的快速扩展，传统中心化系统存在单点故障和追踪困难等问题，亟需更安全的解决方案。

Method: 采用双层架构：链下用户认证和链上交易验证，结合智能合约和非对称加密，引入许可证和秘密块机制。

Result: 实验证明系统在多媒体文件分发中具有可行性和扩展性。

Conclusion: 该系统不仅提升内容安全性，还为未来去中心化应用和版权支付机制提供了基础。

Abstract: As digital content distribution expands rapidly through online platforms,
securing digital media and protecting intellectual property has become
increasingly complex. Traditional centralized systems, while widely adopted,
suffer from vulnerabilities such as single points of failure and limited
traceability of unauthorized access. This paper presents a blockchain-based
secure digital content distribution system that integrates Sia, a decentralized
storage network, and Skynet, a content delivery network, to enhance content
protection and distribution. The proposed system employs a dual-layer
architecture: off-chain for user authentication and on-chain for transaction
validation using smart contracts and asymmetric encryption. By introducing a
license issuance and secret block mechanism, the system ensures content
authenticity, privacy, and controlled access. Experimental results demonstrate
the feasibility and scalability of the system in securely distributing
multimedia files. The proposed platform not only improves content security but
also paves the way for future enhancements with decentralized applications and
integrated royalty payment mechanisms.

*Suhyeon Lee,Seungjoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文指出Saad等人的e-PoS协议对传统PoS模型的公平性问题的误解，认为其描述与传统PoS概念及实际加密货币不符。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清Saad等人对传统PoS模型的误解，强调其公平性问题描述的不准确性。

Method: 通过对比分析传统PoS概念与实际加密货币中的PoS应用，指出Saad等人的模型偏差。

Result: 发现Saad等人的e-PoS协议对传统PoS的公平性问题的描述存在偏差。

Conclusion: 传统PoS模型与Saad等人描述的公平性问题不符，需更准确的模型分析。

Abstract: Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a prominent Sybil control mechanism for
blockchain-based systems. In "e-PoS: Making PoS Decentralized and Fair," Saad
et al. (TPDS'21) introduced a new Proof-of-Stake protocol, e-PoS, to enhance
PoS applications' decentralization and fairness. In this comment paper, we
address a misunderstanding in the work of Saad et al. The conventional
Proof-of-Stake model that causes the fairness problem does not align with the
general concept of Proof-of-Stake nor the Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies
mentioned in their paper.

### [6] [Contrastive Learning for Continuous Touch-Based Authentication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17271)
*Mengyu Qiao,Yunpeng Zhai,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的统一框架，用于移动设备上的连续用户认证，结合了时序掩码自编码器和Siamese网络，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备处理敏感信息时需安全控制，基于触摸行为的连续认证是一种自然且无缝的解决方案。

Method: 使用时序掩码自编码器提取多传感器数据的时序模式，结合Siamese时序注意力卷积网络和对比学习框架，并引入多头注意力和通道注意力机制。

Result: 在公开基准和自收集数据集上表现优于现有方法，提供了可靠的移动设备用户认证方案。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在连续用户认证中表现出色，为移动设备安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Smart mobile devices have become indispensable in modern daily life, where
sensitive information is frequently processed, stored, and transmitted-posing
critical demands for robust security controls. Given that touchscreens are the
primary medium for human-device interaction, continuous user authentication
based on touch behavior presents a natural and seamless security solution.
While existing methods predominantly adopt binary classification under
single-modal learning settings, we propose a unified contrastive learning
framework for continuous authentication in a non-disruptive manner.
Specifically, the proposed method leverages a Temporal Masked Autoencoder to
extract temporal patterns from raw multi-sensor data streams, capturing
continuous motion and gesture dynamics. The pre-trained TMAE is subsequently
integrated into a Siamese Temporal-Attentive Convolutional Network within a
contrastive learning paradigm to model both sequential and cross-modal
patterns. To further enhance performance, we incorporate multi-head attention
and channel attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and
optimize inter-channel feature integration. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks and a self-collected dataset demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a reliable and effective
solution for user authentication on mobile devices.

### [7] [Proof of Useful Intelligence (PoUI): Blockchain Consensus Beyond Energy Waste](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17539)
*Zan-Kai Chong,Hiroyuki Ohsaki,Bryan Ng*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为PoUI的混合共识机制，结合AI任务与区块链验证，旨在平衡安全性与实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链的共识机制（如PoW和PoS）在安全性和效率之间存在权衡，而AI任务需要大量计算资源。PoUI旨在通过结合两者解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Proof of Useful Intelligence (PoUI)机制，通过让工作者完成AI任务（如语言处理或图像分析）来获得代币，并将代币质押以保障网络安全。

Result: PoUI通过智能合约协调去中心化节点（任务发布者、市场协调者、工作者和验证者），实现任务管理与奖励分配。

Conclusion: PoUI是一种创新的共识机制，将区块链安全性与AI实用性结合，有望提升资源利用效率。

Abstract: Blockchain technology enables secure, transparent data management in
decentralized systems, supporting applications from cryptocurrencies like
Bitcoin to tokenizing real-world assets like property. Its scalability and
sustainability hinge on consensus mechanisms balancing security and efficiency.
Proof of Work (PoW), used by Bitcoin, ensures security through energy-intensive
computations but demands significant resources. Proof of Stake (PoS), as in
Ethereum post-Merge, selects validators based on staked cryptocurrency,
offering energy efficiency but risking centralization from wealth
concentration. With AI models straining computational resources, we propose
Proof of Useful Intelligence (PoUI), a hybrid consensus mechanism. In PoUI,
workers perform AI tasks like language processing or image analysis to earn
coins, which are staked to secure the network, blending security with practical
utility. Decentralized nodes--job posters, market coordinators, workers, and
validators --collaborate via smart contracts to manage tasks and rewards.

transaction detection. Through comprehensive experimentation, we investigate
the impact of various adversarial attack strategies on model performance
metrics. Our findings, highlighting how prone those techniques are to simple
attacks, are alarming, and the inconsistency in the attacks' effect on
different algorithms promises ways for attack mitigation. We examine the
effectiveness of different mitigation strategies, including adversarial
training and enhanced feature selection, in enhancing model robustness and show
their effectiveness.

### [9] [User Profiles: The Achilles' Heel of Web Browsers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17692)
*Dolière Francis Somé,Moaz Airan,Zakir Durumeric,Cristian-Alexandru Staicu*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文首次系统研究了浏览器配置文件的磁盘存储安全性，发现除Tor浏览器外，现代浏览器对敏感数据的保护不足，攻击者可绕过加密措施并部署恶意根证书，甚至通过文件系统API直接操控用户文件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注浏览器本身的安全性，而忽视了其与操作系统及文件系统的交互，尤其是浏览器配置文件的存储安全问题。

Method: 通过系统化安全研究，分析了浏览器配置文件的存储方式及潜在攻击路径，包括绕过加密、部署恶意根证书等。

Result: 研究发现，除Tor浏览器外，其他浏览器对敏感数据的保护不足，攻击者可轻易绕过安全措施，甚至通过文件系统API直接攻击。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究者和浏览器厂商开发更安全的机制，保护用户浏览器数据免受文件系统攻击。

Abstract: Web browsers provide the security foundation for our online experiences.
Significant research has been done into the security of browsers themselves,
but relatively little investigation has been done into how they interact with
the operating system or the file system. In this work, we provide the first
systematic security study of browser profiles, the on-disk persistence layer of
browsers, used for storing everything from users' authentication cookies and
browser extensions to certificate trust decisions and device permissions. We
show that, except for the Tor Browser, all modern browsers store sensitive data
in home directories with little to no integrity or confidentiality controls. We
show that security measures like password and cookie encryption can be easily
bypassed. In addition, HTTPS can be sidestepped entirely by deploying malicious
root certificates within users' browser profiles. The Public Key Infrastructure
(PKI), the backbone of the secure Web. HTTPS can be fully bypassed with the
deployment of custom potentially malicious root certificates. More worryingly,
we show how these powerful attacks can be fully mounted directly from web
browsers themselves, through the File System Access API, a recent feature added
by Chromium browsers that enables a website to directly manipulate a user's
file system via JavaScript. In a series of case studies, we demonstrate how an
attacker can install malicious browser extensions, inject additional root
certificates, hijack HTTPS traffic, and enable websites to access hardware
devices like the camera and GPS. Based on our findings, we argue that
researchers and browser vendors need to develop and deploy more secure
mechanisms for protecting users' browser data against file system attackers.

### [10] [Identity Control Plane: The Unifying Layer for Zero Trust Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17759)
*Surya Teja Avirneni*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文介绍了身份控制平面（ICP），一种用于在人类用户、工作负载和自动化系统中实施身份感知零信任访问的架构框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在统一身份管理和零信任访问方面存在不足，ICP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ICP结合了SPIFFE工作负载身份、OIDC/SAML用户身份和代理发放的事务令牌，采用基于属性的访问控制（ABAC）策略引擎。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Identity Control Plane (ICP), an architectural
framework for enforcing identity-aware Zero Trust access across human users,
workloads, and automation systems. The ICP model unifies SPIFFE-based workload
identity, OIDC/SAML user identity, and scoped automation credentials via
broker-issued transaction tokens. We propose a composable enforcement layer
using ABAC policy engines (e.g., OPA, Cedar), aligned with IETF WIMSE drafts
and OAuth transaction tokens. The paper includes architectural components,
integration patterns, use cases, a comparative analysis with current models,
and theorized performance metrics. A FedRAMP and SLSA compliance mapping is
also presented. This is a theoretical infrastructure architecture paper
intended for security researchers and platform architects. No prior version of
this work has been published.

### [11] [Silenzio: Secure Non-Interactive Outsourced MLP Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17785)
*Jonas Sander,Thomas Eisenbarth*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: Silenzio是一种基于全同态加密（FHE）的非交互式外包MLP训练方案，支持128位安全性，无需多服务器假设或客户端交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限客户将ML训练外包到云端时的隐私风险，尤其是敏感训练数据的保护问题。

Method: 采用低比特宽度整数（不超过8位）和新型矩阵乘法技术，结合RNS-to-MRNS转换和块缩放机制，实现高效加密训练。

Result: 在标准MLP训练任务中，Silenzio的分类准确率与32位浮点PyTorch训练相当，同时保持隐私性。

Conclusion: Silenzio为隐私保护ML提供了新的基准，实现了安全且非交互的外包MLP训练。

Abstract: Outsourcing the ML training to cloud providers presents a compelling
opportunity for resource constrained clients, while it simultaneously bears
inherent privacy risks, especially for highly sensitive training data. We
introduce Silenzio, the first fully non-interactive outsourcing scheme for the
training of multi-layer perceptrons that achieves 128 bit security using FHE.
Unlike traditional MPC based protocols that necessitate interactive
communication between the client and server(s) or non-collusion assumptions
among multiple servers, Silenzio enables the fire-and-forget paradigm without
such assumptions. In this approach, the client encrypts the training data once,
and the cloud server performs the training without any further interaction.
  Silenzio operates over low bitwidth integers - never exceeding 8 bit - to
mitigate the computational overhead of FHE. Our approach features a novel
low-bitwidth matrix multiplication that leverages input-dependent residue
number systems and a Karatsuba-inspired multiplication routine, ensuring that
no intermediate FHE-processed value overflows 8 bit. Starting from an
RNS-to-MRNS conversion process, we propose an efficient block-scaling
mechanism, which approximately shifts encrypted tensor values to the
user-specified most significant bits. To instantiate the backpropagation of the
error, Silenzio introduces a low-bitwidth and TFHE friendly gradient
computation for the cross entropy loss.
  Implemented using the state-of-the-art Concrete library, we evaluate Silenzio
on standard MLP training tasks regarding runtime as well as model performance
and achieve similar classification accuracy as MLPs trained using standard
PyTorch with 32 bit floating-point computations. Our open-source implementation
represents a significant advancement in privacy-preserving ML, providing a new
baseline for secure and non-interactive outsourced MLP training.

### [12] [A Novel Graph Transformer Framework for Gene Regulatory Network Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16961)
*Binon Teji,Swarup Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为GT-GRN的图变换器模型，通过整合多源网络信息和基因表达数据，显著提升了基因调控网络（GRN）的推断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因调控网络（GRN）推断是理解复杂生物系统的关键，但现有方法易受噪声干扰且难以反映真实的生物调控关系。因此，需要一种更鲁棒的方法来整合多源信息和先验知识。

Method: 采用自编码器嵌入基因表达数据，利用随机游走和BERT模型编码先验网络结构，并结合图变换器模型（GT-GRN）整合拓扑信息和位置编码。

Result: 实验表明，GT-GRN在GRN推断中显著优于现有方法，具有更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GT-GRN通过整合多源信息和先验知识，为GRN推断提供了一种更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a foundational stride
towards deciphering the fundamentals of complex biological systems. Inferring a
possible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link
prediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may
not always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise
and misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN
inference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase.
Therefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior
knowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional
informations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more
confident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration
of multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory
Networks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene
expression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological
signals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming
them into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded
with a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene
across all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the
input gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within
the graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model,
termed GT-GRN, for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively utilizes the
topological structure of the ground truth network while incorporating the
enriched encoded information. Experimental results demonstrate that GT-GRN
significantly outperforms existing GRN inference methods, achieving superior
accuracy and highlighting the robustness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索训练阶段的参数压缩，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 采用率失真优化（RDO）实现模型精度与复杂度的灵活权衡。

Result: 内存使用减少60%-90%，且无精度损失；相比训练后压缩有显著优势。

Conclusion: Backslash具有高度通用性，适用于多种架构和任务，并能加速边缘设备推理。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large-language models (LLMs) has driven extensive
research into parameter compression after training has been completed, yet
compression during the training phase remains largely unexplored. In this work,
we introduce Rate-Constrained Training (Backslash), a novel training-time
compression approach based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO). Backslash
enables a flexible trade-off between model accuracy and complexity,
significantly reducing parameter redundancy while preserving performance.
Experiments in various architectures and tasks demonstrate that Backslash can
reduce memory usage by 60\% - 90\% without accuracy loss and provides
significant compression gain compared to compression after training. Moreover,
Backslash proves to be highly versatile: it enhances generalization with small
Lagrange multipliers, improves model robustness to pruning (maintaining
accuracy even at 80\% pruning rates), and enables network simplification for
accelerated inference on edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的海表温度（SST）预测框架，通过相空间重构和时空融合映射（STFM）高效捕捉SST动态，并在少量训练数据下实现高精度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海表温度（SST）对生产规划至关重要，但现有物理模拟方法计算复杂，数据驱动方法需大量数据且解释性差，因此需要一种高效且低数据依赖的预测方法。

Method: 利用相空间重构构建初始延迟吸引子对，并通过时空融合映射（STFM）揭示其内在联系，从而高效捕捉SST动态。

Result: 该方法在比较测试中以少量训练数据实现了高预测精度。

Conclusion: 提出的数据驱动框架为SST预测提供了一种高效且低数据依赖的解决方案，优于传统方法。

Abstract: The sea surface temperature (SST), a key environmental parameter, is crucial
to optimizing production planning, making its accurate prediction a vital
research topic. However, the inherent nonlinearity of the marine dynamic system
presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include
physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning
approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential
equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited
applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires
large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a
prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space
reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical
homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover
their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures
SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high
prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险场景中部署时，生成有害内容的风险是一个核心挑战。现有的后处理对齐方法脆弱且难以彻底移除不安全模式。

Method: 1. 使用10,000个GPT-4标记的样本训练安全分类器，过滤600B令牌；2. 生成100B令牌的合成安全数据集；3. 创建RefuseWeb和Moral Education数据集，将有害提示转化为拒绝对话和教育材料；4. 在预训练中注入有害性标签注释；5. 进行安全性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
settings, the risk of generating harmful or toxic content remains a central
challenge. Post-hoc alignment methods are brittle: once unsafe patterns are
learned during pretraining, they are hard to remove. We present a data-centric
pretraining framework that builds safety into the model from the start. Our
contributions include: (i) a safety classifier trained on 10,000 GPT-4 labeled
examples, used to filter 600B tokens; (ii) the largest synthetic safety dataset
to date (100B tokens) generated via recontextualization of harmful web data;
(iii) RefuseWeb and Moral Education datasets that convert harmful prompts into
refusal dialogues and web-style educational material; (iv) Harmfulness-Tag
annotations injected during pretraining to flag unsafe content and steer away
inference from harmful generations; and (v) safety evaluations measuring base
model behavior before instruction tuning. Our safety-pretrained models reduce
attack success rates from 38.8% to 8.4% with no performance degradation on
standard LLM safety benchmarks.

Motivation: 研究自动检测LLM产生的幻觉是否可行，为可靠部署LLM提供理论支持。

Method: 基于Gold-Angluin框架，将幻觉检测与语言识别任务等价，并分析不同训练数据（仅正确示例 vs. 专家标记反馈）的影响。

Result: 仅用正确示例训练时，幻觉检测不可行；引入专家标记反馈后，对所有可数语言集合均可行。

Conclusion: 专家标记反馈对训练幻觉检测器至关重要，支持基于反馈的方法（如RLHF）。

Abstract: Is automated hallucination detection possible? In this work, we introduce a
theoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting
hallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the
classical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent
adaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate
whether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language
$K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can
reliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute
hallucinations.
  First, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the
classical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination
detection method can be converted into a language identification method, and
conversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for
hallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language
identification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally
impossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only
correct examples from the target language.
  Second, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the
detector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples
(explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this
conclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination
detection becomes possible for all countable language collections.
  These results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in
training hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for
feedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of democratizing AI-driven global
weather forecasting models among university research groups by leveraging
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and freely available AI models, such as
NVIDIA's FourCastNetv2. FourCastNetv2 is an NVIDIA's advanced neural network
for weather prediction and is trained on a 73-channel subset of the European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset
at single levels and different pressure levels. Although the training
specifications for FourCastNetv2 are not released to the public, the training
documentation of the model's first generation, FourCastNet, is available to all
users. The training had 64 A100 GPUs and took 16 hours to complete. Although
NVIDIA's models offer significant reductions in both time and cost compared to
traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), reproducing published
forecasting results presents ongoing challenges for resource-constrained
university research groups with limited GPU availability. We demonstrate both
(i) leveraging FourCastNetv2 to create predictions through the designated
application programming interface (API) and (ii) utilizing NVIDIA hardware to
train the original FourCastNet model. Further, this paper demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of NVIDIA A100's for resource-limited research
groups in universities. We also explore data management, training efficiency,
and model validation, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using
limited high-performance computing resources. Consequently, this paper and its
corresponding GitHub materials may serve as an initial guide for other
university research groups and courses related to machine learning, climate
science, and data science to develop research and education programs on AI
weather forecasting, and hence help democratize the AI NWP in the digital
economy.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality synthetic data presents significant challenges
in machine learning research, particularly regarding statistical fidelity and
uncertainty quantification. Existing generative models produce compelling
synthetic samples but lack rigorous statistical guarantees about their relation
to the underlying data distribution, limiting their applicability in critical
domains requiring robust error bounds. We address this fundamental limitation
by presenting a novel framework that incorporates conformal prediction
methodologies into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By integrating
multiple conformal prediction paradigms including Inductive Conformal
Prediction (ICP), Mondrian Conformal Prediction, Cross-Conformal Prediction,
and Venn-Abers Predictors, we establish distribution-free uncertainty
quantification in generated samples. This approach, termed Conformalized GAN
(cGAN), demonstrates enhanced calibration properties while maintaining the
generative power of traditional GANs, producing synthetic data with provable
statistical guarantees. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing
finite-sample validity guarantees and asymptotic efficiency properties,
enabling the reliable application of synthetic data in high-stakes domains
including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Electromagnetic field reconstruction is crucial in many applications,
including antenna diagnostics, electromagnetic interference analysis, and
system modeling. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for
Far-Field to Near-Field (FF-NF) transformation using Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). The goal is to reconstruct near-field distributions from the

transformations. The CNNs are trained on paired far-field and near-field data
and evaluated using mean squared error (MSE). The best model achieves a
training error of 0.0199 and a test error of 0.3898. Moreover, visual
comparisons between the predicted and true near-field distributions demonstrate
the model's effectiveness in capturing complex electromagnetic field behavior,
highlighting the potential of deep learning in electromagnetic field
reconstruction.

Conclusion: 倾向得分匹配为公平性评估和缓解提供了原则性方法，且不影响预测性能。

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning aims to mitigate discrimination against specific
protected social groups (e.g., those categorized by gender, ethnicity, age)
while minimizing predictive performance loss. Despite efforts to improve
fairness in machine learning, prior studies have shown that many models remain
unfair when measured against various fairness metrics. In this paper, we
examine whether the way training and testing data are sampled affects the
reliability of reported fairness metrics. Since training and test sets are
often randomly sampled from the same population, bias present in the training
data may still exist in the test data, potentially skewing fairness
assessments. To address this, we propose FairMatch, a post-processing method
that applies propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias. FairMatch
identifies control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores in the
test set and adjusts decision thresholds for different subgroups accordingly.
For samples that cannot be matched, we perform probabilistic calibration using
fairness-aware loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach can (a) precisely locate subsets of the test data where the model is
unbiased, and (b) significantly reduce bias on the remaining data. Overall,
propensity score matching offers a principled way to improve both fairness
evaluation and mitigation, without sacrificing predictive performance.

Result: 发现Transformer模型易受重复基序影响，通过检索行为覆盖模型先验知识，且现象在RNA序列中同样存在。

Conclusion: 上下文学习可能导致语言模型对重复基序的预测失真，需谨慎应用于生物序列分析。

Abstract: Language models have emerged as powerful predictors of the viability of
biological sequences. During training these models learn the rules of the
grammar obeyed by sequences of amino acids or nucleotides. Once trained, these
models can take a sequence as input and produce a likelihood score as an
output; a higher likelihood implies adherence to the learned grammar and
correlates with experimental fitness measurements. Here we show that in-context
learning can distort the relationship between fitness and likelihood scores of
sequences. This phenomenon most prominently manifests as anomalously high
likelihood scores for sequences that contain repeated motifs. We use protein
language models with different architectures trained on the masked language
modeling objective for our experiments, and find transformer-based models to be
particularly vulnerable to this effect. This behavior is mediated by a look-up
operation where the model seeks the identity of the masked position by using
the other copy of the repeated motif as a reference. This retrieval behavior
can override the model's learned priors. This phenomenon persists for
imperfectly repeated sequences, and extends to other kinds of biologically
relevant features such as reversed complement motifs in RNA sequences that fold
into hairpin structures.

Result: SRL-VAE在图像重建、文本引导图像编辑中提升生成质量，并增强对攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 对抗训练可以同时提升生成模型的保真度和鲁棒性，为生成模型研究提供新范式。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have played a key role in scaling up
diffusion-based generative models, as in Stable Diffusion, yet questions
regarding their robustness remain largely underexplored. Although adversarial
training has been an established technique for enhancing robustness in
predictive models, it has been overlooked for generative models due to concerns
about potential fidelity degradation by the nature of trade-offs between
performance and robustness. In this work, we challenge this presumption,
introducing Smooth Robust Latent VAE (SRL-VAE), a novel adversarial training
framework that boosts both generation quality and robustness. In contrast to
conventional adversarial training, which focuses on robustness only, our
approach smooths the latent space via adversarial perturbations, promoting more
generalizable representations while regularizing with originality
representation to sustain original fidelity. Applied as a post-training step on
pre-trained VAEs, SRL-VAE improves image robustness and fidelity with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments show that SRL-VAE improves both generation
quality, in image reconstruction and text-guided image editing, and robustness,
against Nightshade attacks and image editing attacks. These results establish a
new paradigm, showing that adversarial training, once thought to be detrimental
to generative models, can instead enhance both fidelity and robustness.

Abstract: Antenna arrays are widely used in wireless communication, radar systems,
radio astronomy, and military defense to enhance signal strength, directivity,
and interference suppression. We introduce a deep learning-based optimization
approach that enhances the design of sparse phased arrays by reducing grating
lobes. This approach begins by generating sparse array configurations to
address the non-convex challenges and extensive degrees of freedom inherent in
array design. We use neural networks to approximate the non-convex cost
function that estimates the energy ratio between the main and side lobes. This
differentiable approximation facilitates cost function minimization through
gradient descent, optimizing the antenna elements' coordinates and leading to
an improved layout. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored penalty mechanism
that includes various physical and design constraints into the optimization
process, enhancing its robustness and practical applicability. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method by applying it to the ten array configurations
with the lowest initial costs, achieving further cost reductions ranging from
411% to 643%, with an impressive average improvement of 552%. By significantly
reducing side lobe levels in antenna arrays, this breakthrough paves the way
for ultra-precise beamforming, enhanced interference mitigation, and
next-generation wireless and radar systems with unprecedented efficiency and
clarity.

Abstract: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from
observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and
monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due
to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration
estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem,
which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm
called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a
non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence,
and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved
quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more
data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and
accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is
critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving
towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon
sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal,
we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or
non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer,
while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current
operational state-of-the-art.

Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel deep learning hybrid model that
integrates attention Transformer and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures
to improve the accuracy of cryptocurrency price predictions. By combining the
Transformer's strength in capturing long-range patterns with the GRU's ability
to model short-term and sequential trends, the hybrid model provides a
well-rounded approach to time series forecasting. We apply the model to predict
the daily closing prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum based on historical data that
include past prices, trading volumes, and the Fear and Greed index. We evaluate
the performance of our proposed model by comparing it with four other machine
learning models: two are non-sequential feedforward models: Radial Basis
Function Network (RBFN) and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and two
are bidirectional sequential memory-based models: Bidirectional Long-Short-Term
Memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU). The performance
of the model is assessed using several metrics, including Mean Squared Error
(MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean
Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), along with statistical validation through the
nonparametric Friedman test followed by a post hoc Wilcoxon signed rank test.
The results demonstrate that our hybrid model consistently achieves superior
accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness for financial prediction tasks. These
findings provide valuable insights for improving real-time decision making in
cryptocurrency markets and support the growing use of hybrid deep learning
models in financial analytics.

Abstract: Many knowledge graphs contain a substantial number of spatial entities, such

geographic nodes, ensuring that each reachable node is considered. Based on the
resulting flooded graph, we apply a modified version of RDF2Vec that biases
graph walks using spatial weights. Through evaluations on multiple benchmark
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms both non-location-aware
RDF2Vec and GeoTransE.

Result: OUI能更快收敛，显著提升泛化能力和验证分数，优于传统指标。

Conclusion: OUI为超参数调优提供高效工具，尤其适用于早期训练阶段。

Abstract: We introduce the Overfitting-Underfitting Indicator (OUI), a novel tool for
monitoring the training dynamics of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and identifying
optimal regularization hyperparameters. Specifically, we validate that OUI can
effectively guide the selection of the Weight Decay (WD) hyperparameter by
indicating whether a model is overfitting or underfitting during training
without requiring validation data. Through experiments on DenseNet-BC-100 with
CIFAR- 100, EfficientNet-B0 with TinyImageNet and ResNet-34 with ImageNet-1K,
we show that maintaining OUI within a prescribed interval correlates strongly
with improved generalization and validation scores. Notably, OUI converges
significantly faster than traditional metrics such as loss or accuracy,
enabling practitioners to identify optimal WD (hyperparameter) values within
the early stages of training. By leveraging OUI as a reliable indicator, we can
determine early in training whether the chosen WD value leads the model to
underfit the training data, overfit, or strike a well-balanced trade-off that

### [31] [A Double-Norm Aggregated Tensor Latent Factorization Model for Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17196)
*Jiawen Hou,Hao Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种结合$L_2$-norm和${SL}_1$-norm的损失函数方法TATSI，用于填补交通速度数据中的缺失值，提高了算法的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通速度数据常因传感器故障或传输延迟而缺失，现有基于张量分解的方法多依赖$L_2$-norm，导致算法鲁棒性不足。

Method: TATSI采用SLF-NMU方法，结合$L_2$-norm和${SL}_1$-norm构建损失函数，进行非负潜在因子分析。

Result: 在三个真实交通速度数据集上的实验表明，TATSI能更精确捕捉时间模式，填补缺失数据的准确性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TATSI通过结合两种范数，显著提升了交通速度数据填补的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), traffic management departments
rely on sensors, cameras, and GPS devices to collect real-time traffic data.
Traffic speed data is often incomplete due to sensor failures, data
transmission delays, or occlusions, resulting in missing speed data in certain
road segments. Currently, tensor decomposition based methods are extensively
utilized, they mostly rely on the $L_2$-norm to construct their learning
objectives, which leads to reduced robustness in the algorithms. To address
this, we propose Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation (TATSI), which
combines the $L_2$-norm and smooth $L_1$ (${SL}_1$)-norm in its loss function,
thereby achieving both high accuracy and robust performance in imputing missing
time-varying traffic speed data. TATSI adopts a single latent factor-dependent,
nonnegative, and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) approach, which serves as an
efficient solver for performing nonnegative latent factor analysis (LFA) on a
tensor. Empirical studies on three real-world time-varying traffic speed
datasets demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art traffic speed
predictors, TATSI more precisely captures temporal patterns, thereby yielding
the most accurate imputations for missing traffic speed data.

Abstract: Many data-driven modules in smart grid rely on access to high-quality power
flow data; however, real-world data are often limited due to privacy and
operational constraints. This paper presents a physics-informed generative
framework based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for
synthesizing feasible power flow data. By incorporating auxiliary training and
physics-informed loss functions, the proposed method ensures that the generated
data exhibit both statistical fidelity and adherence to power system
feasibility. We evaluate the approach on the IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus benchmark
systems, demonstrating its ability to capture key distributional properties and
generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios. Comparative results show that the
proposed model outperforms three baseline models in terms of feasibility,
diversity, and accuracy of statistical features. This work highlights the
potential of integrating generative modelling into data-driven power system
applications.

Result: 实验表明NeuralGrok显著加速泛化，提升训练稳定性，并通过AGE指标验证其降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: NeuralGrok为理解Transformer的泛化能力提供了新视角，揭示了模型复杂度与泛化的关系。

Abstract: Grokking is proposed and widely studied as an intricate phenomenon in which
generalization is achieved after a long-lasting period of overfitting. In this
work, we propose NeuralGrok, a novel gradient-based approach that learns an
optimal gradient transformation to accelerate the generalization of
transformers in arithmetic tasks. Specifically, NeuralGrok trains an auxiliary
module (e.g., an MLP block) in conjunction with the base model. This module
dynamically modulates the influence of individual gradient components based on
their contribution to generalization, guided by a bilevel optimization
algorithm. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralGrok significantly
accelerates generalization, particularly in challenging arithmetic tasks. We
also show that NeuralGrok promotes a more stable training paradigm, constantly
reducing the model's complexity, while traditional regularization methods, such
as weight decay, can introduce substantial instability and impede
generalization. We further investigate the intrinsic model complexity
leveraging a novel Absolute Gradient Entropy (AGE) metric, which explains that
NeuralGrok effectively facilitates generalization by reducing the model
complexity. We offer valuable insights on the grokking phenomenon of
Transformer models, which encourages a deeper understanding of the fundamental
principles governing generalization ability.

Abstract: Deep learning-based antimicrobial peptide (AMP) discovery faces critical
challenges such as low experimental hit rates as well as the need for nuanced
controllability and efficient modeling of peptide properties. To address these
challenges, we introduce OmegAMP, a framework that leverages a diffusion-based
generative model with efficient low-dimensional embeddings, precise
controllability mechanisms, and novel classifiers with drastically reduced
false positive rates for candidate filtering. OmegAMP enables the targeted
generation of AMPs with specific physicochemical properties, activity profiles,
and species-specific effectiveness. Moreover, it maximizes sample diversity
while ensuring faithfulness to the underlying data distribution during
generation. We demonstrate that OmegAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all stages of the AMP discovery pipeline, significantly advancing the
potential of computational frameworks in combating antimicrobial resistance.

Abstract: Downsampling layers are crucial building blocks in CNN architectures, which
help to increase the receptive field for learning high-level features and
reduce the amount of memory/computation in the model. In this work, we study
the generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant
architectures, e.g., G-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature
maps) on general finite groups with anti-aliasing. This involves the following:
(a) Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to
form a suitable choice of subgroup. (b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study
the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing.
Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical
sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our
method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed
by a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image
classification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation
improves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when
incorporated into G-equivariant networks

Conclusion: 符号化任务表示为生成AI提供了经济高效且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: We propose a symbolic generative task description language and a
corresponding inference engine capable of representing arbitrary multimodal
tasks as structured symbolic flows. Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on large-scale training and implicit neural representations to learn
cross-modal mappings, often at high computational cost and with limited
flexibility, our framework introduces an explicit symbolic representation
comprising three core primitives: functions, parameters, and topological logic.
Leveraging a pre-trained language model, our inference engine maps natural
language instructions directly to symbolic workflows in a training-free manner.
Our framework successfully performs over 12 diverse multimodal generative
tasks, demonstrating strong performance and flexibility without the need for
task-specific tuning. Experiments show that our method not only matches or
outperforms existing state-of-the-art unified models in content quality, but
also offers greater efficiency, editability, and interruptibility. We believe
that symbolic task representations provide a cost-effective and extensible
foundation for advancing the capabilities of generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering latent information from graphs under
$\varepsilon$-edge local differential privacy where the presence of
relationships/edges between two users/vertices remains confidential, even from
the data curator. For the class of generalized random dot-product graphs, we
show that a standard local differential privacy mechanism induces a specific
geometric distortion in the latent positions. Leveraging this insight, we show
that consistent recovery of the latent positions is achievable by appropriately
adjusting the statistical inference procedure for the privatized graph.
Furthermore, we prove that our procedure is nearly minimax-optimal under local
edge differential privacy constraints. Lastly, we show that this framework
allows for consistent recovery of geometric and topological information
underlying the latent positions, as encoded in their persistence diagrams. Our
results extend previous work from the private community detection literature to
a substantially richer class of models and inferential tasks.

Result: 实验表明，HeRB在多个基准数据集上表现优异，消融研究验证了组件的有效性。

Conclusion: HeRB通过解决异质性问题并转移同质性知识，显著提升了图神经网络的性能。

Abstract: Recent research has witnessed the remarkable progress of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) in the realm of graph data representation. However, GNNs still
encounter the challenge of structural imbalance. Prior solutions to this
problem did not take graph heterophily into account, namely that connected
nodes process distinct labels or features, thus resulting in a deficiency in
effectiveness. Upon verifying the impact of heterophily on solving the
structural imbalance problem, we propose to rectify the heterophily first and
then transfer homophilic knowledge. To the end, we devise a method named HeRB
(Heterophily-Resolved Structure Balancer) for GNNs. HeRB consists of two
innovative components: 1) A heterophily-lessening augmentation module which
serves to reduce inter-class edges and increase intra-class edges; 2) A
homophilic knowledge transfer mechanism to convey homophilic information from
head nodes to tail nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HeRB achieves
superior performance on two homophilic and six heterophilic benchmark datasets,
and the ablation studies further validate the efficacy of two proposed
components.

Result: ExOSITO优于医生策略和现有方法，减少成本且不遗漏关键测试。

Conclusion: ExOSITO为ICU实验室测试排序提供了一种高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Ordering a minimal subset of lab tests for patients in the intensive care
unit (ICU) can be challenging. Care teams must balance between ensuring the
availability of the right information and reducing the clinical burden and
costs associated with each lab test order. Most in-patient settings experience
frequent over-ordering of lab tests, but are now aiming to reduce this burden
on both hospital resources and the environment. This paper develops a novel
method that combines off-policy learning with privileged information to
identify the optimal set of ICU lab tests to order. Our approach, EXplainable
Off-policy learning with Side Information for ICU blood Test Orders (ExOSITO)
creates an interpretable assistive tool for clinicians to order lab tests by
considering both the observed and predicted future status of each patient. We
pose this problem as a causal bandit trained using offline data and a reward
function derived from clinically-approved rules; we introduce a novel learning
framework that integrates clinical knowledge with observational data to bridge
the gap between the optimal and logging policies. The learned policy function
provides interpretable clinical information and reduces costs without omitting
any vital lab orders, outperforming both a physician's policy and prior
approaches to this practical problem.

Motivation: 现有后门攻击的触发器通常不自然，容易被人工检测，因此需要更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 提出AttrBkd方法，通过三种策略生成自然触发器，并进行了全面的人工评估。

Result: AttrBkd比基线攻击更隐蔽且更有效，且人工评估揭示了自动化指标的不足。

Conclusion: 隐蔽的后门攻击可以绕过人工检测，同时保持高效，自动化指标与人工判断存在偏差。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks on text classifiers can cause them to predict a predefined
label when a particular "trigger" is present. Prior attacks often rely on
triggers that are ungrammatical or otherwise unusual, leading to conspicuous
attacks. As a result, human annotators, who play a critical role in curating
training data in practice, can easily detect and filter out these unnatural
texts during manual inspection, reducing the risk of such attacks. We argue
that a key criterion for a successful attack is for text with and without
triggers to be indistinguishable to humans. However, prior work neither
directly nor comprehensively evaluated attack subtlety and invisibility with
human involvement. We bridge the gap by conducting thorough human evaluations
to assess attack subtlety. We also propose \emph{AttrBkd}, consisting of three
recipes for crafting subtle yet effective trigger attributes, such as
extracting fine-grained attributes from existing baseline backdoor attacks. Our
human evaluations find that AttrBkd with these baseline-derived attributes is
often more effective (higher attack success rate) and more subtle (fewer
instances detected by humans) than the original baseline backdoor attacks,
demonstrating that backdoor attacks can bypass detection by being inconspicuous
and appearing natural even upon close inspection, while still remaining
effective. Our human annotation also provides information not captured by
automated metrics used in prior work, and demonstrates the misalignment of
these metrics with human judgment.

Abstract: The recent technological advances in digitalization have revolutionized the
industrial sector. Leveraging data analytics has now enabled the collection of
deep insights into the performance and, as a result, the optimization of
assets. Industrial drives, for example, already accumulate all the necessary
information to control electric machines. These signals include but are not
limited to currents, frequency, and temperature. Integrating machine learning
(ML) models responsible for predicting the evolution of those directly
collected or implicitly derived parameters enhances the smartness of industrial
systems even further. In this article, data already residing in most modern
electric drives has been used to develop a data-driven thermal model of a power
module. A test bench has been designed and used specifically for training and
validating the thermal digital twin undergoing various static and dynamic
operating profiles. Different approaches, from traditional linear models to
deep neural networks, have been implemented to emanate the best ML model for
estimating the case temperature of a power module. Several evaluation metrics
were then used to assess the investigated methods' performance and
implementation in industrial embedded systems.

Conclusion: 提出的方法简单有效，无需额外标注或预测，适用于资源有限场景，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Spurious correlations that lead models to correct predictions for the wrong
reasons pose a critical challenge for robust real-world generalization.
Existing research attributes this issue to group imbalance and addresses it by
maximizing group-balanced or worst-group accuracy, which heavily relies on
expensive bias annotations. A compromise approach involves predicting bias
information using extensively pretrained foundation models, which requires
large-scale data and becomes impractical for resource-limited rare domains. To
address these challenges, we offer a novel perspective by reframing the
spurious correlations as imbalances or mismatches in class-conditional
distributions, and propose a simple yet effective robust learning method that
eliminates the need for both bias annotations and predictions. With the goal of
reducing the mutual information between spurious factors and label information,
our method leverages a sample reweighting strategy to achieve class-conditional
distribution balancing, which automatically highlights minority groups and
classes, effectively dismantling spurious correlations and producing a debiased
data distribution for classification. Extensive experiments and analysis
demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers state-of-the-art
performance, rivaling methods that rely on bias supervision.

Conclusion: TCTO通过动态图优化和路径回溯，显著提升特征工程的效率和性能。

Abstract: Feature transformation methods aim to find an optimal mathematical
feature-feature crossing process that generates high-value features and
improves the performance of downstream machine learning tasks. Existing
frameworks, though designed to mitigate manual costs, often treat feature
transformations as isolated operations, ignoring dynamic dependencies between
transformation steps. To address the limitations, we propose TCTO, a
collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that automates
feature engineering through graph-driven path optimization. The framework's
core innovation lies in an evolving interaction graph that models features as
nodes and transformations as edges. Through graph pruning and backtracking, it
dynamically eliminates low-impact edges, reduces redundant operations, and
enhances exploration stability. This graph also provides full traceability to
empower TCTO to reuse high-utility subgraphs from historical transformations.
To demonstrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach, we conduct
comprehensive experiments and case studies, which show superior performance
across a range of datasets.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种双重自适应社会学习策略（A²SL），用于解决动态漂移下社会学习网络中的信念更新问题，确保代理最终选择真实假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态环境中，传统社会学习方法可能因模型和假设的漂移而导致决策错误，因此需要自适应策略来跟踪这些变化。

Method: A²SL策略结合了两阶段自适应：1）随机梯度下降更新以跟踪决策模型的漂移；2）自适应信念更新以跟踪真实假设的变化。

Result: 理论分析表明，所有代理在足够小的自适应参数下能一致学习，最终将信念集中在真实假设上，错误概率收敛至自适应参数的量级。

Conclusion: A²SL策略在合成数据和真实数据中均验证了其有效性，适用于动态环境下的社会学习问题。

Abstract: In social learning, a network of agents assigns probability scores (beliefs)
to some hypotheses of interest, which rule the generation of local streaming
data observed by each agent. Belief formation takes place by means of an
iterative two-step procedure where: i) the agents update locally their beliefs
by using some likelihood model; and ii) the updated beliefs are combined with
the beliefs of the neighboring agents, using a pooling rule. This procedure can
fail to perform well in the presence of dynamic drifts, leading the agents to
incorrect decision making. Here, we focus on the fully online setting where
both the true hypothesis and the likelihood models can change over time. We
propose the doubly adaptive social learning ($\text{A}^2\text{SL}$) strategy,
which infuses social learning with the necessary adaptation capabilities. This
goal is achieved by exploiting two adaptation stages: i) a stochastic gradient
descent update to learn and track the drifts in the decision model; ii) and an
adaptive belief update to track the true hypothesis changing over time. These
stages are controlled by two adaptation parameters that govern the evolution of
the error probability for each agent. We show that all agents learn
consistently for sufficiently small adaptation parameters, in the sense that
they ultimately place all their belief mass on the true hypothesis. In
particular, the probability of choosing the wrong hypothesis converges to
values on the order of the adaptation parameters. The theoretical analysis is
illustrated both on synthetic data and by applying the $\text{A}^2\text{SL}$
strategy to a social learning problem in the online setting using real data.

Result: 在多层感知机和ResNet-34等大规模深度神经网络上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方案在减少计算量方面具有竞争力，适用于硬件友好的实现。

Abstract: As state of the art neural networks (NNs) continue to grow in size, their
resource-efficient implementation becomes ever more important. In this paper,
we introduce a compression scheme that reduces the number of computations
required for NN inference on reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs. This is
achieved by combining pruning via regularized training, weight sharing and
linear computation coding (LCC). Contrary to common NN compression techniques,
where the objective is to reduce the memory used for storing the weights of the
NNs, our approach is optimized to reduce the number of additions required for
inference in a hardware-friendly manner. The proposed scheme achieves
competitive performance for simple multilayer perceptrons, as well as for large
scale deep NNs such as ResNet-34.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but
they require vast amounts of data and computational resources. In contrast,
smaller models (SMs), while less powerful, can be more efficient and tailored
to specific domains. In this position paper, we argue that taking a
collaborative approach, where large and small models work synergistically, can
accelerate the adaptation of LLMs to private domains and unlock new potential
in AI. We explore various strategies for model collaboration and identify
potential challenges and opportunities. Building upon this, we advocate for
industry-driven research that prioritizes multi-objective benchmarks on
real-world private datasets and applications.

TLDR: CHASe是一种针对联邦主动学习（FAL）的客户异构感知数据选择方法，通过跟踪认知变化（EVs）和校准决策边界，提高了模型准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FAL方法未考虑数据分布的异构性和模型参数波动，影响了模型准确性。

Method: CHASe通过分析训练周期中的推理不一致性跟踪EVs，使用新的对齐损失校准决策边界，并通过数据冻结和唤醒机制提高选择效率。

Result: 实验表明，CHASe在多个数据集和异构联邦设置下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CHASe有效解决了FAL中的数据异构性和模型波动问题，提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) reduces human annotation costs for machine learning
systems by strategically selecting the most informative unlabeled data for
annotation, but performing it individually may still be insufficient due to
restricted data diversity and annotation budget. Federated Active Learning
(FAL) addresses this by facilitating collaborative data selection and model
training, while preserving the confidentiality of raw data samples. Yet,
existing FAL methods fail to account for the heterogeneity of data distribution
across clients and the associated fluctuations in global and local model
parameters, adversely affecting model accuracy. To overcome these challenges,
we propose CHASe (Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection), specifically
designed for FAL. CHASe focuses on identifying those unlabeled samples with
high epistemic variations (EVs), which notably oscillate around the decision
boundaries during training. To achieve both effectiveness and efficiency,
\model{} encompasses techniques for 1) tracking EVs by analyzing inference
inconsistencies across training epochs, 2) calibrating decision boundaries of
inaccurate models with a new alignment loss, and 3) enhancing data selection
efficiency via a data freeze and awaken mechanism with subset sampling.
Experiments show that CHASe surpasses various established baselines in terms of
effectiveness and efficiency, validated across diverse datasets, model
complexities, and heterogeneous federation settings.

TLDR: HMI是一种基于分层知识管理的多租户推理系统，通过分层管理PLM知识，显著减少GPU内存使用，支持高效服务多达10,000个hPLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型（PLM）的高计算需求在多租户环境中效率低下，需要一种资源高效的管理方法。

Method: 将PLM知识分为通用、领域特定和任务特定三类，构建分层PLM（hPLM），并通过知识树和参数交换管理知识，同时优化系统资源利用。

Result: 实验表明，HMI能在单个GPU上高效服务10,000个hPLM，且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: HMI通过分层知识管理和系统优化，实现了多租户环境下PLM的高效推理。

Abstract: The significant computational demands of pretrained language models (PLMs),
which often require dedicated hardware, present a substantial challenge in
serving them efficiently, especially in multi-tenant environments. To address
this, we introduce HMI, a Hierarchical knowledge management-based Multi-tenant
Inference system, designed to manage tenants with distinct PLMs
resource-efficiently. Our approach is three-fold: Firstly, we categorize PLM
knowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific. Leveraging insights
on knowledge acquisition across different model layers, we construct
hierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) by extracting and storing knowledge at different
levels, significantly reducing GPU memory usage per tenant. Secondly, we
establish hierarchical knowledge management for hPLMs generated by various
tenants in HMI. We manage domain-specific knowledge with acceptable storage
increases by constructing and updating domain-specific knowledge trees based on
frequency. We manage task-specific knowledge within limited GPU memory through
parameter swapping. Finally, we propose system optimizations to enhance
resource utilization and inference throughput. These include fine-grained
pipelining via hierarchical knowledge prefetching to overlap CPU and I/O
operations with GPU computations, and optimizing parallel implementations with
batched matrix multiplications. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed HMI can efficiently serve up to 10,000 hPLMs (hBERTs and hGPTs) on a
single GPU, with only a negligible compromise in accuracy.

Motivation: 气候变化加剧极端降雨频率，对城市污水系统造成压力，传统物理模型成本高且难以适应动态变化，机器学习提供了一种更具适应性和成本效益的替代方案。

Method: 提出评估协议，比较全局模型和局部模型，引入误差模型评估模型抗干扰能力，重点关注峰值事件和关键波动。

Result: 全局模型预测性能更高，但局部模型在分散场景中更具鲁棒性；长预测范围的模型对数据扰动更具抵抗力。

Conclusion: 研究为可持续城市污水管理提供了可解释且可靠的机器学习解决方案，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Climate change increases the frequency of extreme rainfall, placing a
significant strain on urban infrastructures, especially Combined Sewer Systems
(CSS). Overflows from overburdened CSS release untreated wastewater into
surface waters, posing environmental and public health risks. Although
traditional physics-based models are effective, they are costly to maintain and
difficult to adapt to evolving system dynamics. Machine Learning (ML)
approaches offer cost-efficient alternatives with greater adaptability. To
systematically assess the potential of ML for modeling urban infrastructure
systems, we propose a protocol for evaluating Neural Network architectures for
CSS time series forecasting with respect to predictive performance, model
complexity, and robustness to perturbations. In addition, we assess model
performance on peak events and critical fluctuations, as these are the key
regimes for urban wastewater management. To investigate the feasibility of
lightweight models suitable for IoT deployment, we compare global models, which
have access to all information, with local models, which rely solely on nearby
sensor readings. Additionally, to explore the security risks posed by network
outages or adversarial attacks on urban infrastructure, we introduce error
models that assess the resilience of models. Our results demonstrate that while
global models achieve higher predictive performance, local models provide
sufficient resilience in decentralized scenarios, ensuring robust modeling of
urban infrastructure. Furthermore, models with longer native forecast horizons
exhibit greater robustness to data perturbations. These findings contribute to
the development of interpretable and reliable ML solutions for sustainable
urban wastewater management. The implementation is available in our GitHub
repository.

TLDR: GRANITE是一个在稀疏动态图上实现鲁棒学习的框架，通过历史感知的拜占庭抗性对等采样协议（HaPS）和自适应概率阈值（APT）来抵御拜占庭攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Gossip Learning（GL）在动态图中对拜占庭攻击（尤其是针对RPS协议的模型投毒攻击）的鲁棒性问题。

Method: GRANITE结合HaPS协议（减少对抗性影响）和APT（根据拜占庭节点比例设置聚合阈值）。

Result: GRANITE在30%拜占庭节点下仍能保持收敛，学习速度更快，且适用于比现有理论稀疏9倍的图。

Conclusion: GRANITE有效提升了动态稀疏图中GL的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Gossip Learning (GL) is a decentralized learning paradigm where users
iteratively exchange and aggregate models with a small set of neighboring
peers. Recent GL approaches rely on dynamic communication graphs built and
maintained using Random Peer Sampling (RPS) protocols. Thanks to graph
dynamics, GL can achieve fast convergence even over extremely sparse
topologies. However, the robustness of GL over dy- namic graphs to Byzantine
(model poisoning) attacks remains unaddressed especially when Byzantine nodes
attack the RPS protocol to scale up model poisoning. We address this issue by
introducing GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic
graphs in the presence of a fraction of Byzantine nodes. GRANITE relies on two
key components (i) a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol
(HaPS), which tracks previously encountered identifiers to reduce adversarial
influence over time, and (ii) an Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT), which
leverages an estimate of Byzantine presence to set aggregation thresholds with
formal guarantees. Empirical results confirm that GRANITE maintains convergence
with up to 30% Byzantine nodes, improves learning speed via adaptive filtering
of poisoned models and obtains these results in up to 9 times sparser graphs
than dictated by current theory.

Abstract: Developing lifelong learning agents is crucial for artificial general

open-source framework for benchmarking plasticity optimization in deep RL.
Plasticine provides single-file implementations of over 13 mitigation methods,
10 evaluation metrics, and learning scenarios with increasing non-stationarity

researchers to systematically quantify plasticity loss, evaluate mitigation
strategies, and analyze plasticity dynamics across different contexts. Our

Conclusion: 原型方法显著提升模拟器性能，数据驱动选择原型效果更佳。

Abstract: Data-driven emulators are increasingly being used to learn and emulate
physics-based simulations, reducing computational expense and run time. Here,
we present a structured way to improve the quality of these high-dimensional
emulated outputs, through the use of prototypes: an approximation of the
emulator's output passed as an input, which informs the model and leads to
better predictions. We demonstrate our approach to emulate atmospheric
dispersion, key for greenhouse gas emissions monitoring, by comparing a
baseline model to models trained using prototypes as an additional input. The
prototype models achieve better performance, even with few prototypes and even
if they are chosen at random, but we show that choosing the prototypes through
data-driven methods (k-means) can lead to almost 10\% increased performance in
some metrics.

Conclusion: 为创建更好连接预测与决策的预测系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Traditional time-series forecasting often focuses only on minimizing
prediction errors, ignoring the specific requirements of real-world
applications that employ them. This paper presents a new training methodology,
which allows a forecasting model to dynamically adjust its focus based on the
importance of forecast ranges specified by the end application. Unlike previous
methods that fix these ranges beforehand, our training approach breaks down
predictions over the entire signal range into smaller segments, which are then
dynamically weighted and combined to produce accurate forecasts. We tested our
method on standard datasets, including a new dataset from wireless
communication, and found that not only it improves prediction accuracy but also
improves the performance of end application employing the forecasting model.
This research provides a basis for creating forecasting systems that better
connect prediction and decision-making in various practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法依赖预定义的分子表示，可能导致信息丢失和偏差，而深度学习和LLM提供了更优的解决方案。

Method: 提出混合架构，将GCN与LLM嵌入结合，LLM嵌入预计算并存储，避免重复计算。

Result: 模型F1-score达88.8%，优于GCN（87.9%）、XGBoost（85.5%）和SVM（85.4%）。

Conclusion: 混合架构有效整合局部结构和全局化学知识，显著提升虚拟筛选性能。

Abstract: Virtual screening plays a critical role in modern drug discovery by enabling
the identification of promising candidate molecules for experimental
validation. Traditional machine learning methods such as support vector
machines (SVM) and XGBoost rely on predefined molecular representations, often
leading to information loss and potential bias. In contrast, deep learning
approaches-particularly Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-offer a more
expressive and unbiased alternative by operating directly on molecular graphs.
Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in drug design, thanks to their capacity to
capture complex chemical patterns from large-scale data via attention
mechanisms.
  In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates GCNs with
LLM-derived embeddings to combine localized structural learning with global
chemical knowledge. The LLM embeddings can be precomputed and stored in a
molecular feature library, removing the need to rerun the LLM during training
or inference and thus maintaining computational efficiency. We found that
concatenating the LLM embeddings after each GCN layer-rather than only at the
final layer-significantly improves performance, enabling deeper integration of
global context throughout the network. The resulting model achieves superior
results, with an F1-score of (88.8%), outperforming standalone GCN (87.9%),
XGBoost (85.5%), and SVM (85.4%) baselines.

Conclusion: 通过调整储层非线性匹配系统复杂性，为储层计算机设计提供了理论依据，并在资源受限场景中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We study how the degree of nonlinearity in the input data affects the optimal
design of reservoir computers, focusing on how closely the model's nonlinearity
should align with that of the data. By reducing minimal RCs to a single tunable
nonlinearity parameter, we explore how the predictive performance varies with
the degree of nonlinearity in the reservoir. To provide controlled testbeds, we
generalize to the fractional Halvorsen system, a novel chaotic system with
fractional exponents. Our experiments reveal that the prediction performance is
maximized when the reservoir's nonlinearity matches the nonlinearity present in
the data. In cases where multiple nonlinearities are present in the data, we
find that the correlation dimension of the predicted signal is reconstructed
correctly when the smallest nonlinearity is matched. We use this observation to
propose a method for estimating the minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series
by sweeping the reservoir exponent and identifying the transition to a
successful reconstruction. Applying this method to both synthetic and
real-world datasets, including financial time series, we demonstrate its
practical viability. Finally, we transfer these insights to classical RC by
augmenting traditional architectures with fractional, generalized reservoir
states. This yields performance gains, particularly in resource-constrained
scenarios such as physical reservoirs, where increasing reservoir size is
impractical or economically unviable. Our work provides a principled route
toward tailoring RCs to the intrinsic complexity of the systems they aim to
model.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在异质节点条件下有效平衡了全局协作与个性化需求，DSLTH为理论基础。

Abstract: To jointly tackle the challenges of data and node heterogeneity in
decentralized learning, we propose a distributed strong lottery ticket
hypothesis (DSLTH), based on which a communication-efficient personalized
learning algorithm is developed. In the proposed method, each local model is
represented as the Hadamard product of global real-valued parameters and a
personalized binary mask for pruning. The local model is learned by updating
and fusing the personalized binary masks while the real-valued parameters are
fixed among different agents. To further reduce the complexity of hardware
implementation, we incorporate a group sparse regularization term in the loss
function, enabling the learned local model to achieve structured sparsity.
Then, a binary mask aggregation algorithm is designed by introducing an
intermediate aggregation tensor and adding a personalized fine-tuning step in
each iteration, which constrains model updates towards the local data
distribution. The proposed method effectively leverages the relativity among
agents while meeting personalized requirements in heterogeneous node
conditions. We also provide a theoretical proof for the DSLTH, establishing it
as the foundation of the proposed method. Numerical simulations confirm the
validity of the DSLTH and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.

Conclusion: CTO-TP为复杂边缘计算场景提供了高效的任务卸载解决方案。

Abstract: Future networks (including 6G) are poised to accelerate the realisation of
Internet of Everything. However, it will result in a high demand for computing
resources to support new services. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising
solution, enabling to offload computation-intensive tasks to nearby edge
servers from the end-user devices, thereby reducing latency and energy
consumption. However, relying solely on a single MEC server for task offloading
can lead to uneven resource utilisation and suboptimal performance in complex
scenarios. Additionally, traditional task offloading strategies specialise in
centralised policy decisions, which unavoidably entail extreme transmission
latency and reach computational bottleneck. To fill the gaps, we propose a
latency and energy efficient Cooperative Task Offloading framework with
Transformer-driven Prediction (CTO-TP), leveraging asynchronous multi-agent
deep reinforcement learning to address these challenges. This approach fosters
edge-edge cooperation and decreases the synchronous waiting time by performing
asynchronous training, optimising task offloading, and resource allocation
across distributed networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the
proposed CTO-TP algorithm reduces up to 80% overall system latency and 87%
energy consumption compared to the baseline schemes.

Conclusion: TACO有效解决了Non-IID数据问题，提升了联邦学习的性能和效率。

Abstract: Non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data across edge
clients have long posed significant challenges to federated learning (FL)
training in edge computing environments. Prior works have proposed various
methods to mitigate this statistical heterogeneity. While these works can
achieve good theoretical performance, in this work we provide the first
investigation into a hidden over-correction phenomenon brought by the uniform
model correction coefficients across clients adopted by existing methods. Such
over-correction could degrade model performance and even cause failures in
model convergence. To address this, we propose TACO, a novel algorithm that
addresses the non-IID nature of clients' data by implementing fine-grained,
client-specific gradient correction and model aggregation, steering local
models towards a more accurate global optimum. Moreover, we verify that leading
FL algorithms generally have better model accuracy in terms of communication
rounds rather than wall-clock time, resulting from their extra computation
overhead imposed on clients. To enhance the training efficiency, TACO deploys a
lightweight model correction and tailored aggregation approach that requires
minimum computation overhead and no extra information beyond the synchronized
model parameters. To validate TACO's effectiveness, we present the first FL
convergence analysis that reveals the root cause of over-correction. Extensive
experiments across various datasets confirm TACO's superior and stable
performance in practice.

Abstract: The lack of generalization in learning-based autonomous driving applications
is shown by the narrow range of road scenarios that vehicles can currently
cover. A generalizable approach should capture many distinct road structures
and topologies, as well as consider traffic participants, and dynamic changes
in the environment, so that vehicles can navigate and perform motion planning
tasks even in the most difficult situations. Designing suitable feature spaces
for neural network-based motion planers that encapsulate all kinds of road
scenarios is still an open research challenge. This paper tackles this
learning-based generalization challenge and shows how graph representations of
road networks can be leveraged by using multidimensional scaling (MDS)
techniques in order to obtain such feature spaces. State-of-the-art graph
representations and MDS approaches are analyzed for the autonomous driving use
case. Finally, the option of embedding graph nodes is discussed in order to
perform easier learning procedures and obtain dimensionality reduction.

Abstract: Survival analysis often relies on Cox models, assuming both linearity and
proportional hazards (PH). This study evaluates machine and deep learning
methods that relax these constraints, comparing their performance with
penalized Cox models on a benchmark of three synthetic and three real datasets.
In total, eight different models were tested, including six non-linear models
of which four were also non-PH. Although Cox regression often yielded
satisfactory performance, we showed the conditions under which machine and deep
learning models can perform better. Indeed, the performance of these methods
has often been underestimated due to the improper use of Harrell's concordance
index (C-index) instead of more appropriate scores such as Antolini's
concordance index, which generalizes C-index in cases where the PH assumption
does not hold. In addition, since occasionally high C-index models happen to be
badly calibrated, combining Antolini's C-index with Brier's score is useful to
assess the overall performance of a survival method. Results on our benchmark
data showed that survival prediction should be approached by testing different
methods to select the most appropriate one according to sample size,
non-linearity and non-PH conditions. To allow an easy reproducibility of these
tests on our benchmark data, code and documentation are freely available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI内核编程复杂，尽管数据流模式清晰，但实现高性能仍需硬件优化。现有编译器在可用性和表达性上存在不足。

Method: TileLang将调度空间（线程绑定、布局、张量化等）与数据流解耦，通过注释和原语封装优化。

Result: 实验表明，TileLang在关键内核中达到最先进性能，其统一块线程范式与透明调度能力满足现代AI系统需求。

Conclusion: TileLang通过简化编程模型，显著提升AI内核开发效率与性能。

Abstract: Modern AI workloads rely heavily on optimized computing kernels for both
training and inference. These AI kernels follow well-defined data-flow
patterns, such as moving tiles between DRAM and SRAM and performing a sequence
of computations on those tiles. However, writing high-performance kernels
remains complex despite the clarity of these patterns. Achieving peak
performance requires careful, hardware-centric optimizations to fully leverage
modern accelerators. While domain-specific compilers attempt to reduce the
burden of writing high-performance kernels, they often struggle with usability
and expressiveness gaps. In this paper, we present TileLang, a generalized
tiled programming model for more efficient AI Kernel programming. TileLang
decouples scheduling space (thread binding, layout, tensorize and pipeline)
from dataflow, and encapsulated them as a set of customization annotations and
primitives. This approach allows users to focus on the kernel's data-flow
itself, while leaving most other optimizations to compilers. We conduct

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: LCC为大规模优化问题提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research in Cooperative Coevolution~(CC) have achieved promising
progress in solving large-scale global optimization problems. However, existing
CC paradigms have a primary limitation in that they require deep expertise for
selecting or designing effective variable decomposition strategies. Inspired by
advancements in Meta-Black-Box Optimization, this paper introduces LCC, a
pioneering learning-based cooperative coevolution framework that dynamically
schedules decomposition strategies during optimization processes. The
decomposition strategy selector is parameterized through a neural network,
which processes a meticulously crafted set of optimization status features to
determine the optimal strategy for each optimization step. The network is
trained via the Proximal Policy Optimization method in a reinforcement learning
manner across a collection of representative problems, aiming to maximize the
expected optimization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that LCC not only offers certain advantages over state-of-the-art baselines in
terms of optimization effectiveness and resource consumption, but it also
exhibits promising transferability towards unseen problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 算法通过高斯函数加权的线性变换构建高维到低维的非线性映射，每步变换可独立分析。

Result: 模型既能实现强大的降维，又能透明地展示变换过程，包括识别被抑制的维度和空间的扩展/收缩。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are fundamental for analyzing and
visualizing high-dimensional data. With established methods like t-SNE and PCA
presenting a trade-off between representational power and interpretability.
This paper introduces a novel approach that bridges this gap by combining the
interpretability of linear methods with the expressiveness of non-linear
transformations. The proposed algorithm constructs a non-linear mapping between
high-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces through a combination of linear
transformations, each weighted by Gaussian functions. This architecture enables
complex non-linear transformations while preserving the interpretability
advantages of linear methods, as each transformation can be analyzed
independently. The resulting model provides both powerful dimensionality
reduction and transparent insights into the transformed space. Techniques for
interpreting the learned transformations are presented, including methods for
identifying suppressed dimensions and how space is expanded and contracted.
These tools enable practitioners to understand how the algorithm preserves and
modifies geometric relationships during dimensionality reduction. To ensure the
practical utility of this algorithm, the creation of user-friendly software
packages is emphasized, facilitating its adoption in both academia and
industry.

TLDR: TarDiff是一种新型的目标导向扩散框架，通过任务特定的影响指导生成合成EHR数据，显著提升下游模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注复制真实数据的统计分布和时间依赖性，忽略了罕见但重要的情况，限制了模型性能。

Method: TarDiff通过量化合成样本对下游模型性能的预期贡献，将影响梯度嵌入反向扩散过程，生成效用优化的数据。

Result: 在六个公开EHR数据集上，TarDiff在AUPRC和AUROC上分别比现有方法提升20.4%和18.4%。

Conclusion: TarDiff不仅保持时间保真度，还显著提升模型性能，为医疗数据分析中的数据稀缺和类别不平衡提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series generation is crucial
for advancing clinical machine learning models, as it helps address data
scarcity by providing more training data. However, most existing approaches
focus primarily on replicating statistical distributions and temporal
dependencies of real-world data. We argue that fidelity to observed data alone
does not guarantee better model performance, as common patterns may dominate,
limiting the representation of rare but important conditions. This highlights
the need for generate synthetic samples to improve performance of specific
clinical models to fulfill their target outcomes. To address this, we propose
TarDiff, a novel target-oriented diffusion framework that integrates
task-specific influence guidance into the synthetic data generation process.
Unlike conventional approaches that mimic training data distributions, TarDiff
optimizes synthetic samples by quantifying their expected contribution to
improving downstream model performance through influence functions.
Specifically, we measure the reduction in task-specific loss induced by
synthetic samples and embed this influence gradient into the reverse diffusion
process, thereby steering the generation towards utility-optimized data.
Evaluated on six publicly available EHR datasets, TarDiff achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 20.4% in
AUPRC and 18.4% in AUROC. Our results demonstrate that TarDiff not only
preserves temporal fidelity but also enhances downstream model performance,
offering a robust solution to data scarcity and class imbalance in healthcare
analytics.

Motivation: 由于隐私和数据监管问题，联邦学习成为分布式时间序列数据的理想解决方案，但传统客户端-服务器架构存在单点故障和隐私泄露风险。

Method: DROCKS采用完全去中心化架构，通过ROCKET特征和节点间的结构化路径训练全局模型，每个节点优化模型并选择最有效的本地核。

Result: 在UCR存档上的实验表明，DROCKS优于现有客户端-服务器联邦学习方法，且对节点故障和恶意攻击更具弹性。

Conclusion: DROCKS为时间序列分类提供了一种高效、鲁棒且隐私保护的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a critical task with applications in
various domains, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Due
to privacy concerns and data regulations, Federated Learning has emerged as a
promising approach for learning from distributed time series data without
centralizing raw information. However, most FL solutions rely on a
client-server architecture, which introduces robustness and confidentiality
risks related to the distinguished role of the server, which is a single point
of failure and can observe knowledge extracted from clients. To address these
challenges, we propose DROCKS, a fully decentralized FL framework for TSC that
leverages ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) features. In DROCKS,
the global model is trained by sequentially traversing a structured path across
federation nodes, where each node refines the model and selects the most
effective local kernels before passing them to the successor. Extensive
experiments on the UCR archive demonstrate that DROCKS outperforms
state-of-the-art client-server FL approaches while being more resilient to node
failures and malicious attacks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨HESD行为在不同条件下的变化，以验证其作为泛化能力评估工具的适用性。

Method: 通过实验分析不同优化器、数据集及预处理方法对HESD的影响，并提出判断HESD类型的标准。

Result: 发现HESD主要为正值（MP-HESD）或负值（MN-HESD），后者由外部梯度操作引起，并提出了统一的HESD分析方法。

Conclusion: HESD类型与训练过程相关，准奇异HESD的出现对传统Hessian特征值与损失景观关系的假设提出了挑战。

Abstract: Hessians of neural network (NN) contain essential information about the
curvature of NN loss landscapes which can be used to estimate NN generalization
capabilities. We have previously proposed generalization criteria that rely on
the observation that Hessian eigenvalue spectral density (HESD) behaves
similarly for a wide class of NNs. This paper further studies their
applicability by investigating factors that can result in different types of
HESD. We conduct a wide range of experiments showing that HESD mainly has
positive eigenvalues (MP-HESD) for NN training and fine-tuning with various
optimizers on different datasets with different preprocessing and augmentation
procedures. We also show that mainly negative HESD (MN-HESD) is a consequence
of external gradient manipulation, indicating that the previously proposed
Hessian analysis methodology cannot be applied in such cases. We also propose
criteria and corresponding conditions to determine HESD type and estimate NN
generalization potential. These HESD types and previously proposed
generalization criteria are combined into a unified HESD analysis methodology.
Finally, we discuss how HESD changes during training, and show the occurrence
of quasi-singular (QS) HESD and its influence on the proposed methodology and
on the conventional assumptions about the relation between Hessian eigenvalues
and NN loss landscape curvature.

TLDR: PTCL提出了一种解决仅含最终标签的动态节点分类问题的方法，通过伪标签和时间课程学习策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态节点分类中，动态标签难以获取，而最终标签更易获得，因此需要一种方法利用最终标签解决动态分类问题。

Method: PTCL采用时间解耦架构（分离主干网络和解码器）和时间课程学习策略（通过指数衰减函数加权伪标签）。

Result: 实验表明PTCL在真实场景中优于其他方法，并贡献了新数据集CoOAG。

Conclusion: PTCL和FLiD框架为标签有限的动态节点分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like
financial transactions and academic collaborations. In such systems,
dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node
classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp. However,
it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to
high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels
in fraud detection). In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain
as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a
unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history
data. To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum
Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node
classification where only final labels are available. PTCL introduces: (1) a
temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware
representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which
generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that
prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them
higher weights using an exponentially decaying function. We contribute a new
academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic
graph. Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent
superiority over other methods adapted to this task. Beyond methodology, we
propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node
Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training
pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.

Motivation: 研究共形预测方法在数据稀缺且高度变化的真实世界场景中的表现，填补标准基准测试的不足。

Method: 使用预训练模型（MobileNet、DenseNet、ResNet）微调有限标记数据，生成预测集，并通过两种校准管道（带/不带温度缩放）评估性能。

Result: 共形预测即使在小样本和简单非一致性分数下也能提供有价值的预测集；温度缩放不一定能缩小预测集。

Conclusion: 共形预测在复杂任务中具有潜力，未来需研究噪声标签的影响及模型压缩策略。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal
prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse
events in unconstrained environments. Conformal prediction is a powerful
post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it
into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage
of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study
addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world
settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models
(MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to
generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of
calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature
scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and
average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how
calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency.
Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and
simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable
uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not
consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of
careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight
the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal
prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based
on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact
of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore
effective model reduction strategies.

Result: NPE-PF在基准任务和复杂科学逆问题中表现优异，仿真效率显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NPE-PF为SBI提供了一种无需训练、通用且高效的解决方案，适用于广泛的随机逆问题。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a flexible and general approach to
performing Bayesian inference: In SBI, a neural network is trained on synthetic
data simulated from a model and used to rapidly infer posterior distributions
for observed data. A key goal for SBI is to achieve accurate inference with as
few simulations as possible, especially for expensive simulators. In this work,
we address this challenge by repurposing recent probabilistic foundation models
for tabular data: We show how tabular foundation models -- specifically TabPFN
-- can be used as pre-trained autoregressive conditional density estimators for
SBI. We propose Neural Posterior Estimation with Prior-data Fitted Networks
(NPE-PF) and show that it is competitive with current SBI approaches in terms
of accuracy for both benchmark tasks and two complex scientific inverse
problems. Crucially, it often substantially outperforms them in terms of
simulation efficiency, sometimes requiring orders of magnitude fewer
simulations. NPE-PF eliminates the need for inference network selection,
training, and hyperparameter tuning. We also show that it exhibits superior
robustness to model misspecification and can be scaled to simulation budgets
that exceed the context size limit of TabPFN. NPE-PF provides a new direction
for SBI, where training-free, general-purpose inference models offer efficient,
easy-to-use, and flexible solutions for a wide range of stochastic inverse
problems.

Result: 在7台不同风力涡轮机上测试，显著提升了数据稀缺情况下的故障诊断性能，F1分数分别提高了10.3%（1个月数据）和16.8%（2周数据）。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据稀缺情况下的异常检测提供了新方向，能够在新安装的风电场中实现更早、更可靠的故障诊断。

Abstract: Intelligent condition monitoring of wind turbines is essential for reducing
downtimes. Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are
commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However,
data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of
training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault
diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep
learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training
data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data.
Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an
NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to one with severely limited data. We
demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7
substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault
diagnosis in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most
similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs
trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1
month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The
domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered
degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The
proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault diagnosis in newly
installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to
improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Multidrug Resistance (MDR) is a critical global
health issue, causing increased hospital stays, healthcare costs, and
mortality. This study proposes an interpretable Machine Learning (ML) framework
for MDR prediction, aiming for both accurate inference and enhanced
explainability.
  Methods: Patients are modeled as Multivariate Time Series (MTS), capturing
clinical progression and patient-to-patient interactions. Similarity among
patients is quantified using MTS-based methods: descriptive statistics, Dynamic
Time Warping, and Time Cluster Kernel. These similarity measures serve as
inputs for MDR classification via Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and
Support Vector Machines, with dimensionality reduction and kernel
transformations improving model performance. For explainability, patient
similarity networks are constructed from these metrics. Spectral clustering and
t-SNE are applied to identify MDR-related subgroups and visualize high-risk
clusters, enabling insight into clinically relevant patterns.
  Results: The framework was validated on ICU Electronic Health Records from
the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada, achieving an AUC of 81%. It outperforms
baseline ML and deep learning models by leveraging graph-based patient
similarity. The approach identifies key risk factors -- prolonged antibiotic
use, invasive procedures, co-infections, and extended ICU stays -- and reveals
clinically meaningful clusters. Code and results are available at
\https://github.com/oscarescuderoarnanz/DM4MTS.
  Conclusions: Patient similarity representations combined with graph-based
analysis provide accurate MDR prediction and interpretable insights. This
method supports early detection, risk factor identification, and patient
stratification, highlighting the potential of explainable ML in critical care.

Abstract: In industrial settings, surface defects on steel can significantly compromise
its service life and elevate potential safety risks. Traditional defect
detection methods predominantly rely on manual inspection, which suffers from
low efficiency and high costs. Although automated defect detection approaches
based on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly,
their reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties
during deep model training and overfitting issues. These limitations may lead
to detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering
automated detection processes unreliable. To address this challenge, we first
evaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data
that satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition
with test data. Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration
sample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate
and false discovery rate. Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous
threshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability
defective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g.,
defect regions). This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean
error rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk
level. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average
prediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a
statistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty.
Furthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the
expected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning
ratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial
intelligence, yet these models remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations,
undermining their reliability in high-stakes applications. While adversarial
robustness in vision-based neural networks has been extensively studied, LLM
robustness remains under-explored. We adapt the Robustness Measurement and
Assessment (RoMA) framework to quantify LLM resilience against adversarial
inputs without requiring access to model parameters. By comparing RoMA's
estimates to those of formal verification methods, we demonstrate its accuracy
with minimal error margins while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
empirical evaluation reveals that robustness varies significantly not only
between different models but also across categories within the same task and
between various types of perturbations. This non-uniformity underscores the
need for task-specific robustness evaluations, enabling practitioners to
compare and select models based on application-specific robustness
requirements. Our work provides a systematic methodology to assess LLM
robustness, advancing the development of more reliable language models for
real-world deployment.

machine learning advances providing promising tools for timely detection. In
this research, we propose a deep learning approach for early Parkinson's
disease detection from speech recordings, which also highlights the vocal
segments driving predictions to enhance interpretability. This approach seeks
to associate predictive speech patterns with articulatory features, providing a
basis for interpreting underlying neuromuscular impairments. We evaluated our
approach using the Italian Parkinson's Voice and Speech Database, containing
831 audio recordings from 65 participants, including both healthy individuals
and patients. Our approach showed competitive classification performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while providing enhanced interpretability
by identifying key speech features influencing predictions.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于Transformer和超网络的新方法，用于学习多个概率分布之间的最优传输映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代信号处理中分布数据的重要性增加，但现有神经OT方法主要局限于计算两个分布之间的单一映射。

Method: 使用Transformer架构生成分布数据的嵌入，再通过超网络生成神经OT映射。

Result: 通过数值实验验证了嵌入和生成的OT映射的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为多分布OT映射提供了一种高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Distributional data have become increasingly prominent in modern signal
processing, highlighting the necessity of computing optimal transport (OT) maps
across multiple probability distributions. Nevertheless, recent studies on
neural OT methods predominantly focused on the efficient computation of a
single map between two distributions. To address this challenge, we introduce a
novel approach to learning transport maps for new empirical distributions.
Specifically, we employ the transformer architecture to produce embeddings from
distributional data of varying length; these embeddings are then fed into a
hypernetwork to generate neural OT maps. Various numerical experiments were
conducted to validate the embeddings and the generated OT maps. The model
implementation and the code are provided on

TLDR: 提出了一种名为MSGCN的新方法，用于预测多层网络中的链接权重，通过空间嵌入信息实现高效预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN在链接权重预测任务中表现不足，尤其是在多层网络中，需要更复杂的方法。

Method: MSGCN模型通过空间图卷积扩展到多层网络，捕捉节点在多层的几何结构。

Result: 实验表明MSGCN在多种多层网络结构中具有鲁棒、准确且可泛化的链接权重预测性能。

Conclusion: MSGCN为多层网络中的链接权重预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various learning
tasks, ranging from node classification to link prediction. They have
demonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving
graph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely
link weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased
complexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction
becomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes
can be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we
propose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN),
which spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer
link weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to
multiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across
multiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link
information show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable
link weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network
structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备资源有限，传统数字计算架构在深度学习推理中能耗高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用无线广播模型权重和射频物理计算复杂矩阵乘法，实现低功耗推理。

Result: WISE在图像分类中达到95.7%准确率，每客户端功耗仅6.0 fJ/MAC，计算效率165.8 TOPS/W。

Conclusion: WISE比传统数字计算效率提升两个数量级，适用于无线连接的边缘设备。

Abstract: Modern edge devices, such as cameras, drones, and Internet-of-Things nodes,
rely on deep learning to enable a wide range of intelligent applications,
including object recognition, environment perception, and autonomous
navigation. However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often
resource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and
computational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing
architectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture
for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep
learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations:
disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation
of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio
frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast
model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image
classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per
client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This
approach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly
connected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement
in efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决大语言模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在计算和数据流受限的真实场景下。

Method: 采用LoRA（低秩适应）和最小回放机制，在医学问答、遗传学和法律三个领域进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，尽管灾难性遗忘仍然存在，但最小回放显著稳定并部分恢复了领域知识。

Conclusion: 该研究为资源受限的实际场景中部署适应性大语言模型提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Continual learning in large language models (LLMs) typically encounters the
critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired
knowledge deteriorates upon exposure to new data. While techniques like replay
buffers and parameter-efficient tuning (e.g., Low-Rank Adaptation or LoRA) have
been proposed, few studies investigate real-time domain adaptation under strict
computational and data-stream constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate a
lightweight method combining LoRA and a minimal replay mechanism in a realistic
streaming setting across three diverse knowledge domains: medical question
answering, genetics, and law. Using perplexity, semantic similarity, and
GPT-based human-like evaluation metrics, we quantify the model's adaptation,
forgetting, and recovery over time. Our experiments reveal that while
catastrophic forgetting naturally occurs, even minimal replay significantly
stabilizes and partially restores domain-specific knowledge. This study
contributes practical insights for deploying adaptable LLMs in
resource-constrained, real-world scenarios.

TLDR: GeneMamba是一种基于状态空间建模的高效单细胞转录组学基础模型，解决了scRNA-seq数据的高维度和稀疏性问题，优于传统的Transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: scRNA-seq数据的高维度、稀疏性和批次效应带来了计算挑战，而现有的Transformer模型在处理长距离依赖时效率不足。

Method: GeneMamba采用Bi-Mamba架构，通过线性时间复杂度的双向基因上下文建模，结合生物学启发的目标（如通路感知对比损失和基于排名的基因编码）。

Result: 在30百万细胞上预训练的GeneMamba在多批次整合、细胞类型注释和基因-基因相关性任务中表现出色，具有高性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: GeneMamba是Transformer方法的实用替代方案，推动了大规模单细胞数据分析工具的发展。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution analysis of
cellular heterogeneity, but its complexity, which is marked by high
dimensionality, sparsity, and batch effects, which poses major computational
challenges. Transformer-based models have made significant advances in this
domain but are often limited by their quadratic complexity and suboptimal
handling of long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce GeneMamba, a
scalable and efficient foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics built
on state space modeling. Leveraging the Bi-Mamba architecture, GeneMamba
captures bidirectional gene context with linear-time complexity, offering
substantial computational gains over transformer baselines. The model is
pretrained on nearly 30 million cells and incorporates biologically informed
objectives, including pathway-aware contrastive loss and rank-based gene
encoding. We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch
integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating
strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position
GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods,
advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for
large-scale single-cell data analysis.

TLDR: 论文比较了BPE、SentencePiece和字符级分词策略在低资源印度语言中的NER任务表现，发现SentencePiece在跨语言零样本设置中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索BPE在低资源印度语言NER任务中的适用性，并比较不同分词策略的效果。

Method: 使用IndicBERT对多种印度语言进行实验，评估分词策略的内在和外在性能。

Result: SentencePiece在实体一致性和跨语言泛化能力上优于BPE，尤其适合形态复杂的语言。

Conclusion: SentencePiece是低资源印度语言NER任务中更有效的分词策略。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of Natural Language Processing (NLP),
especially for low resource languages, where subword segmentation influences
vocabulary structure and downstream task accuracy. Although Byte Pair Encoding
(BPE) is a standard tokenization method in multilingual language models, its
suitability for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in low resource Indic languages
remains underexplored due to its limitations in handling morphological
complexity. In this work, we systematically compare BPE, SentencePiece, and
Character Level tokenization strategies using IndicBERT for NER tasks in low
resource Indic languages like Assamese, Bengali, Marathi, and Odia, as well as
extremely low resource Indic languages like Santali, Manipuri, and Sindhi. We
assess both intrinsic linguistic properties tokenization efficiency, out of
vocabulary (OOV) rates, and morphological preservation as well as extrinsic
downstream performance, including fine tuning and zero shot cross lingual
transfer.
  Our experiments show that SentencePiece is a consistently better performing
approach than BPE for NER in low resource Indic Languages, particularly in zero
shot cross lingual settings, as it better preserves entity consistency. While
BPE provides the most compact tokenization form, it is not capable of
generalization because it misclassifies or even fails to recognize entity
labels when tested on unseen languages. In contrast, SentencePiece constitutes
a better linguistic structural preservation model, benefiting extremely low
resource and morphologically rich Indic languages, such as Santali and
Manipuri, for superior entity recognition, as well as high generalization
across scripts, such as Sindhi, written in Arabic. The results point to
SentencePiece as the more effective tokenization strategy for NER within
multilingual and low resource Indic NLP applications.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为SAVA的新方法，通过词汇替换优化英语LLMs以适应意大利语，显著降低了token fertility和参数数量，并在下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有的LLMs可以处理多种语言，但它们在非英语语言上的表现并不高效，导致编码效率低和推理速度慢。

Method: 提出了SAVA方法，利用神经映射进行词汇替换，优化英语LLMs的词汇表以适应意大利语。

Result: SAVA显著降低了token fertility（25%）和参数数量（1 billion），并在多任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SAVA方法有效优化了LLMs在非英语语言上的性能，且通过少量持续训练即可恢复模型表现。

Abstract: The number of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasing steadily,
though the majority are designed predominantly for the English language. While
state-of-the-art LLMs can handle other languages, due to language contamination
or some degree of multilingual pretraining data, they are not optimized for
non-English languages, leading to inefficient encoding (high token "fertility")
and slower inference speed. In this work, we thoroughly compare a variety of
vocabulary adaptation techniques for optimizing English LLMs for the Italian
language, and put forward Semantic Alignment Vocabulary Adaptation (SAVA), a
novel method that leverages neural mapping for vocabulary substitution. SAVA
achieves competitive performance across multiple downstream tasks, enhancing
grounded alignment strategies. We adapt two LLMs: Mistral-7b-v0.1, reducing
token fertility by 25\%, and Llama-3.1-8B, optimizing the vocabulary and
reducing the number of parameters by 1 billion. We show that, following the
adaptation of the vocabulary, these models can recover their performance with a
relatively limited stage of continual training on the target language. Finally,
we test the capabilities of the adapted models on various multi-choice and
generative tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLMs）政治立场深度的方法，发现其信念稳定性具有主题特异性而非统一意识形态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常将LLMs的政治立场简单归类为左倾或右倾，但未深入探讨其信念是否真实或仅为表面与训练数据一致。

Method: 通过分析（1）论证一致性和（2）不确定性量化，评估12个LLMs在19项经济政策上的信念稳定性。

Result: LLMs表现出主题特异性信念稳定性，左倾和右倾模型的响应一致性分别高达95%和89%，语义熵能有效区分表面一致与真实信念（AUROC=0.78）。

Conclusion: LLMs并不具备稳定的人类意识形态，强调了在实际应用中需进行主题特异性可靠性评估的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping political discourse,
yet their responses often display inconsistency when subjected to scrutiny.
While prior research has primarily categorized LLM outputs as left- or
right-leaning to assess their political stances, a critical question remains:
Do these responses reflect genuine internal beliefs or merely surface-level
alignment with training data? To address this, we propose a novel framework for
evaluating belief depth by analyzing (1) argumentative consistency and (2)
uncertainty quantification. We evaluate 12 LLMs on 19 economic policies from
the Political Compass Test, challenging their belief stability with both
supportive and opposing arguments. Our analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit
topic-specific belief stability rather than a uniform ideological stance.
Notably, up to 95% of left-leaning models' responses and 89% of right-leaning
models' responses remain consistent under the challenge, enabling semantic
entropy to achieve high accuracy (AUROC=0.78), effectively distinguishing
between surface-level alignment from genuine belief. These findings call into
question the assumption that LLMs maintain stable, human-like political
ideologies, emphasizing the importance of conducting topic-specific reliability
assessments for real-world applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现有LLM性别错误评估方法是否具有收敛效度，即结果是否一致。

Method: 对三个数据集进行系统元评估，提出并行概率和生成评估方法，并自动评估6个模型。

Result: 发现评估方法在实例、数据集和模型层面存在分歧，20.2%的实例结果冲突，且自动评估与人类评估不一致。

Conclusion: 建议未来评估需改进方法，并质疑LLM评估中广泛假设方法一致性的惯例。

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to measure LLM misgendering, including
probability-based evaluations (e.g., automatically with templatic sentences)
and generation-based evaluations (e.g., with automatic heuristics or human
validation). However, it has gone unexamined whether these evaluation methods
have convergent validity, that is, whether their results align. Therefore, we
conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of these methods across three existing
datasets for LLM misgendering. We propose a method to transform each dataset to
enable parallel probability- and generation-based evaluation. Then, by
automatically evaluating a suite of 6 models from 3 families, we find that
these methods can disagree with each other at the instance, dataset, and model
levels, conflicting on 20.2% of evaluation instances. Finally, with a human
evaluation of 2400 LLM generations, we show that misgendering behaviour is
complex and goes far beyond pronouns, which automatic evaluations are not
currently designed to capture, suggesting essential disagreement with human
evaluations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future
evaluations of LLM misgendering. Our results are also more widely relevant, as
they call into question broader methodological conventions in LLM evaluation,
which often assume that different evaluation methods agree.

Motivation: 探讨LLM的语言风格如何影响用户偏好，揭示潜在的双刃剑效应（提升体验的同时增加错误信息风险）。

Method: 通过探索性和实验性用户研究，分析语言风格与用户偏好的关系。

Result: 语言风格确实影响用户偏好，但具体影响因用户群体和个体特质而异。

Conclusion: 初步研究表明语言风格的重要性，但需更大样本和多样性验证，未来将深入研究变量间的因果关系。

Abstract: What makes an interaction with the LLM more preferable for the user? While it
is intuitive to assume that information accuracy in the LLM's responses would
be one of the influential variables, recent studies have found that inaccurate
LLM's responses could still be preferable when they are perceived to be more
authoritative, certain, well-articulated, or simply verbose. These variables
interestingly fall under the broader category of language style, implying that
the style in the LLM's responses might meaningfully influence users'
preferences. This hypothesized dynamic could have double-edged consequences:
enhancing the overall user experience while simultaneously increasing their
susceptibility to risks such as LLM's misinformation or hallucinations. In this
short paper, we present our preliminary studies in exploring this subject.
Through a series of exploratory and experimental user studies, we found that
LLM's language style does indeed influence user's preferences, but how and
which language styles influence the preference varied across different user
populations, and more interestingly, moderated by the user's very own
individual traits. As a preliminary work, the findings in our studies should be
interpreted with caution, particularly given the limitations in our samples,
which still need wider demographic diversity and larger sample sizes. Our
future directions will first aim to address these limitations, which would
enable a more comprehensive joint effect analysis between the language style,
individual traits, and preferences, and further investigate the potential
causal relationship between and beyond these variables.

Abstract: Due to the proliferation of short-form content and the rapid adoption of AI,
opportunities for deep, reflective thinking have significantly diminished,
undermining users' critical thinking and reducing engagement with the reasoning
behind AI-generated outputs. To address this issue, we propose an Interactive
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Framework that enhances human-centered explainability
and responsible AI usage by making the model's inference process transparent,
modular, and user-editable. The framework decomposes reasoning into clearly
defined blocks that users can inspect, modify, and re-execute, encouraging
active cognitive engagement rather than passive consumption. It further
integrates a lightweight edit-adaptation mechanism inspired by preference
learning, allowing the system to align with diverse cognitive styles and user
intentions. Ethical transparency is ensured through explicit metadata
disclosure, built-in bias checkpoint functionality, and privacy-preserving
safeguards. This work outlines the design principles and architecture necessary
to promote critical engagement, responsible interaction, and inclusive
adaptation in AI systems aimed at addressing complex societal challenges.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained prominence as an effective
method for enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) through the incorporation of external knowledge. However, the evaluation

evaluation of both retrieval and generation tasks. We also introduce novel
evaluation metrics aimed at measuring RAG adaptability, encompassing dimensions
such as noise vulnerability, context acceptability, context insensitivity, and
context misinterpretation. Through comprehensive experiments across various

Motivation: 机器学习研究的代码实现通常不可用，导致复现和扩展工作缓慢且费力。利用LLM理解科学文档和生成高质量代码的能力，PaperCoder旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PaperCoder分为三个阶段：规划（构建路线图、设计架构）、分析（解释实现细节）和生成（生成模块化代码）。每个阶段由专门代理协作完成。

Conclusion: PaperCoder通过多代理LLM框架有效解决了机器学习论文代码生成的挑战，展示了其在实践中的强大潜力。

Abstract: Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code
implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for
researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime,
recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents
and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a
multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into
functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning,
where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with
diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files;
analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and
generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each
phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to
collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on
generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both
model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper
authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality,
faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the
recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by
substantial margins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在提供特定领域知识时存在局限性，尤其是在自然灾害等专业领域。为解决这一问题，研究团队开发了RAG框架的多智能体系统。

Method: 采用用户中心的多智能体设计，整合自然灾害数据、观测数据集和科学文献，通过RAG框架确保信息的准确性和上下文相关性。

Result: 在十个专家主导的案例研究中，WildfireGPT显著优于现有的基于LLM的决策支持解决方案。

Conclusion: WildfireGPT展示了RAG和多智能体设计在提升LLMs专业领域应用中的潜力，为决策支持提供了更精准的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a transformational capability at the
frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning that can support
decision-makers in addressing pressing societal challenges such as extreme
natural hazard events. As generalized models, LLMs often struggle to provide
context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized
knowledge. In this work we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based
multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in the context
of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of concept, we
present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire hazards. The
architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored
risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating natural hazard
and extreme weather projection data, observational datasets, and scientific
literature through an RAG framework, the system ensures both the accuracy and
contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten
expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms
existing LLM-based solutions for decision support.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该论文探讨了利用知识蒸馏（KD）优化大型语言模型（LLM）在捆绑生成任务中的效率问题，提出了一个综合框架，研究了知识格式、数量及利用方式对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型在捆绑生成任务中计算成本高，研究旨在通过知识蒸馏降低计算需求，同时保持性能。

Method: 提出一个综合KD框架，逐步提取知识（模式、规则、深度思考），并通过不同策略捕获不同数量的知识，结合LLM适应技术（如上下文学习、监督微调）优化学生模型。

Result: 实验表明，知识格式、数量及利用方法共同影响捆绑生成性能，KD能显著提升效率。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏为高效且有效的LLM捆绑生成提供了重要潜力。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly explored for bundle generation, thanks to their
reasoning capabilities and knowledge. However, deploying large-scale LLMs
introduces significant efficiency challenges, primarily high computational
costs during fine-tuning and inference due to their massive parameterization.
Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, transferring expertise
from large teacher models to compact student models. This study systematically
investigates knowledge distillation approaches for bundle generation, aiming to
minimize computational demands while preserving performance. We explore three
critical research questions: (1) how does the format of KD impact bundle
generation performance? (2) to what extent does the quantity of distilled
knowledge influence performance? and (3) how do different ways of utilizing the
distilled knowledge affect performance? We propose a comprehensive KD framework
that (i) progressively extracts knowledge (patterns, rules, deep thoughts);
(ii) captures varying quantities of distilled knowledge through different
strategies; and (iii) exploits complementary LLM adaptation techniques
(in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, combination) to leverage
distilled knowledge in small student models for domain-specific adaptation and
enhanced efficiency. Extensive experiments provide valuable insights into how
knowledge format, quantity, and utilization methodologies collectively shape
LLM-based bundle generation performance, exhibiting KD's significant potential
for more efficient yet effective LLM-based bundle generation.

Motivation: 临床医生短缺和心理污名化促使开发人机交互心理治疗工具，但现有方法未能有效模拟心理治疗过程。

Method: 提出CRDial框架，设计多轮对话的识别与重构阶段，整合支持性策略和多通道循环机制，并基于LLM生成高质量双语数据集Crisp。

Result: 训练了7B和14B规模的Crispers模型，在点对点、成对和干预评估中表现优越。

Conclusion: CRDial和Crispers为认知重构提供了高效的人机交互解决方案。

Abstract: Cognitive Restructuring (CR) is a psychotherapeutic process aimed at
identifying and restructuring an individual's negative thoughts, arising from
mental health challenges, into more helpful and positive ones via multi-turn
dialogues. Clinician shortage and stigma urge the development of human-LLM
interactive psychotherapy for CR. Yet, existing efforts implement CR via simple
text rewriting, fixed-pattern dialogues, or a one-shot CR workflow, failing to
align with the psychotherapeutic process for effective CR. To address this gap,
we propose CRDial, a novel framework for CR, which creates multi-turn dialogues
with specifically designed identification and restructuring stages of negative
thoughts, integrates sentence-level supportive conversation strategies, and
adopts a multi-channel loop mechanism to enable iterative CR. With CRDial, we
distill Crisp, a large-scale and high-quality bilingual dialogue dataset, from
LLM. We then train Crispers, Crisp-based conversational LLMs for CR, at 7B and
14B scales. Extensive human studies show the superiority of Crispers in
pointwise, pairwise, and intervention evaluations.

with transfer learning to address the performance gap in low-resource language
translation tasks.

Conclusion: JurisCTC在法律判决预测任务中展现出显著优势，为跨法律领域的知识迁移提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has gained significant
attention in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) owing to its
ability to enhance model generalization across diverse domains. However, its
application for knowledge transfer between distinct legal domains remains
largely unexplored. To address the challenges posed by lengthy and complex
legal texts and the limited availability of large-scale annotated datasets, we
propose JurisCTC, a novel model designed to improve the accuracy of Legal
Judgment Prediction (LJP) tasks. Unlike existing approaches, JurisCTC
facilitates effective knowledge transfer across various legal domains and
employs contrastive learning to distinguish samples from different domains.
Specifically, for the LJP task, we enable knowledge transfer between civil and
criminal law domains. Compared to other models and specific large language
models (LLMs), JurisCTC demonstrates notable advancements, achieving peak
accuracies of 76.59% and 78.83%, respectively.

Motivation: 尽管AI在医疗领域表现出色，但其可能放大人类偏见，尤其在文本生成领域公平性问题尚未充分研究。

Result: 算法显著减少了不同群体间的性能差异（30%以上），同时整体生成准确率变化不超过2%。

Conclusion: 该算法有效提升了医疗文本生成的公平性，为减少AI偏见提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those based on deep
learning models, have increasingly achieved expert-level performance in medical
applications. However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may
reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in
historically under-served populations. The fairness issue has attracted
considerable research interest in the medical imaging classification field, yet
it remains understudied in the text generation domain. In this study, we
investigate the fairness problem in text generation within the medical field
and observe significant performance discrepancies across different races,
sexes, and age groups, including intersectional groups, various model scales,
and different evaluation metrics. To mitigate this fairness issue, we propose
an algorithm that selectively optimizes those underperformed groups to reduce
bias. The selection rules take into account not only word-level accuracy but
also the pathology accuracy to the target reference, while ensuring that the
entire process remains fully differentiable for effective model training. Our
evaluations across multiple backbones, datasets, and modalities demonstrate
that our proposed algorithm enhances fairness in text generation without
compromising overall performance. Specifically, the disparities among various
groups across different metrics were diminished by more than 30% with our
algorithm, while the relative change in text generation accuracy was typically
within 2%. By reducing the bias generated by deep learning models, our proposed
approach can potentially alleviate concerns about the fairness and reliability
of text generation diagnosis in medical domain.

TLDR: CoheMark是一种高级句子级水印技术，通过利用句子间的连贯关系提升逻辑流畅性，同时保持强水印检测能力和文本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有句子级水印技术依赖随机分割或生成过程，限制了适用句子范围并影响生成内容质量，需平衡文本质量与水印检测鲁棒性。

Method: 采用模糊c均值聚类选择句子，并应用特定下一句选择标准，以增强逻辑连贯性。

Result: 实验表明，CoheMark在保持强水印强度的同时，对文本质量影响最小。

Conclusion: CoheMark有效解决了文本质量与水印检测鲁棒性之间的平衡问题。

Abstract: Watermarking technology is a method used to trace the usage of content
generated by large language models. Sentence-level watermarking aids in
preserving the semantic integrity within individual sentences while maintaining
greater robustness. However, many existing sentence-level watermarking
techniques depend on arbitrary segmentation or generation processes to embed
watermarks, which can limit the availability of appropriate sentences. This
limitation, in turn, compromises the quality of the generated response. To
address the challenge of balancing high text quality with robust watermark
detection, we propose CoheMark, an advanced sentence-level watermarking
technique that exploits the cohesive relationships between sentences for better
logical fluency. The core methodology of CoheMark involves selecting sentences
through trained fuzzy c-means clustering and applying specific next sentence
selection criteria. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CoheMark achieves
strong watermark strength while exerting minimal impact on text quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在语言变化下的鲁棒性评估缺乏系统性，FLUKE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FLUKE通过控制语言层面的变化（从拼写到方言和风格），结合LLMs和人工验证生成修改后的测试数据。

Result: 研究发现语言变化的影响因任务而异，LLMs整体鲁棒性更强但仍存在脆弱性，所有模型对否定修改普遍脆弱。

Conclusion: 系统化的鲁棒性测试对理解模型行为至关重要。

Abstract: We present FLUKE (Framework for LingUistically-driven and tasK-agnostic
robustness Evaluation), a task-agnostic framework for assessing model
robustness through systematic minimal variations of test data. FLUKE introduces
controlled variations across linguistic levels - from orthography to dialect
and style varieties - and leverages large language models (LLMs) with human
validation to generate modifications. We demonstrate FLUKE's utility by
evaluating both fine-tuned models and LLMs across four diverse NLP tasks, and
reveal that (1) the impact of linguistic variations is highly task-dependent,
with some tests being critical for certain tasks but irrelevant for others; (2)
while LLMs have better overall robustness compared to fine-tuned models, they
still exhibit significant brittleness to certain linguistic variations; (3) all
models show substantial vulnerability to negation modifications across most
tasks. These findings highlight the importance of systematic robustness testing
for understanding model behaviors.

Result: 实验表明DAE在基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAE为多模态虚假信息检测提供了新范式。

Abstract: In the digital era, social media has become a major conduit for information
dissemination, yet it also facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation.
Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level
features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation
process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework
(DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze
misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining
creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating
readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language
Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to
misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware
filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms
existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation
detection.

Result: 实验证实MRE在多模态任务中同样存在，且能促进三个相关任务的互增强。

Conclusion: MRE在多模态领域具有普适性，为跨任务互增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mutual Reinforcement Effect (MRE) is an emerging subfield at the intersection
of information extraction and model interpretability. MRE aims to leverage the
mutual understanding between tasks of different granularities, enhancing the
performance of both coarse-grained and fine-grained tasks through joint
modeling. While MRE has been explored and validated in the textual domain, its
applicability to visual and multimodal domains remains unexplored. In this
work, we extend MRE to the multimodal information extraction domain for the
first time. Specifically, we introduce a new task: Multimodal Mutual
Reinforcement Effect (M-MRE), and construct a corresponding dataset to support
this task. To address the challenges posed by M-MRE, we further propose a
Prompt Format Adapter (PFA) that is fully compatible with various Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that MRE can
also be observed in the M-MRE task, a multimodal text-image understanding
scenario. This provides strong evidence that MRE facilitates mutual gains
across three interrelated tasks, confirming its generalizability beyond the
textual domain.

Method: 基于LLMs合并技术，设计优化策略，利用数值推理模型调整超参数，避免直接训练患者数据。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上，AUROC提升7%，且比微调模型更不易泄露数据。

Conclusion: PatientDx在保护隐私的同时提升了模型性能，适用于敏感领域。

Abstract: Fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become the default practice
for improving model performance on a given task. However, performance
improvement comes at the cost of training on vast amounts of annotated data
which could be sensitive leading to significant data privacy concerns. In
particular, the healthcare domain is one of the most sensitive domains exposed
to data privacy issues. In this paper, we present PatientDx, a framework of
model merging that allows the design of effective LLMs for health-predictive
tasks without requiring fine-tuning nor adaptation on patient data. Our
proposal is based on recently proposed techniques known as merging of LLMs and
aims to optimize a building block merging strategy. PatientDx uses a pivotal
model adapted to numerical reasoning and tunes hyperparameters on examples
based on a performance metric but without training of the LLM on these data.
Experiments using the mortality tasks of the MIMIC-IV dataset show improvements
up to 7% in terms of AUROC when compared to initial models. Additionally, we
confirm that when compared to fine-tuned models, our proposal is less prone to
data leak problems without hurting performance. Finally, we qualitatively show
the capabilities of our proposal through a case study. Our best model is

Abstract: Long-context understanding poses significant challenges in natural language
processing, particularly for real-world dialogues characterized by speech-based
elements, high redundancy, and uneven information density. Although large
language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on existing benchmarks, these
datasets fail to reflect the complexities of such texts, limiting their
applicability to practical scenarios. To bridge this gap, we construct the
first spoken long-text dataset, derived from live streams, designed to reflect
the redundancy-rich and conversational nature of real-world scenarios. We
construct tasks in three categories: retrieval-dependent, reasoning-dependent,
and hybrid. We then evaluate both popular LLMs and specialized methods to
assess their ability to understand long-contexts in these tasks. Our results
show that current methods exhibit strong task-specific preferences and perform
poorly on highly redundant inputs, with no single method consistently
outperforming others. We propose a new baseline that better handles redundancy
in spoken text and achieves strong performance across tasks. Our findings
highlight key limitations of current methods and suggest future directions for
improving long-context understanding. Finally, our benchmark fills a gap in
evaluating long-context spoken language understanding and provides a practical
foundation for developing real-world e-commerce systems. The code and benchmark

Abstract: Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems are designed to fulfill user requests
through natural language interactions, yet existing systems often produce
generic, monotonic responses that lack individuality and fail to adapt to
users' personal attributes. To address this, we introduce PicPersona-TOD, a
novel dataset that incorporates user images as part of the persona, enabling
personalized responses tailored to user-specific factors such as age or
emotional context. This is facilitated by first impressions, dialogue
policy-guided prompting, and the use of external knowledge to reduce
hallucinations. Human evaluations confirm that our dataset enhances user
experience, with personalized responses contributing to a more engaging
interaction. Additionally, we introduce a new NLG model, Pictor, which not only
personalizes responses, but also demonstrates robust performance across unseen
domains https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PicPersona.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as topic modeling and
clustering, are often used to identify latent patterns in unstructured text
data in fields such as political science and sociology. These methods overcome
common concerns about reproducibility and costliness involved in the
labor-intensive process of human qualitative analysis. However, two major
limitations of topic models are their interpretability and their practicality
for answering targeted, domain-specific social science research questions. In
this work, we investigate opportunities for using LLM-generated text
augmentation to improve the usefulness of topic modeling output. We use a
political science case study to evaluate our results in a domain-specific
application, and find that topic modeling using GPT-4 augmentations creates
highly interpretable categories that can be used to investigate domain-specific
research questions with minimal human guidance.

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a critical technique for combating misinformation
and protecting intellectual property in large language models (LLMs). A recent
discovery, termed watermark radioactivity, reveals that watermarks embedded in
teacher models can be inherited by student models through knowledge
distillation. On the positive side, this inheritance allows for the detection
of unauthorized knowledge distillation by identifying watermark traces in
student models. However, the robustness of watermarks against scrubbing attacks
and their unforgeability in the face of spoofing attacks under unauthorized
knowledge distillation remain largely unexplored. Existing watermark attack
methods either assume access to model internals or fail to simultaneously
support both scrubbing and spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose
Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), a unified
framework that enables bidirectional attacks under unauthorized knowledge
distillation. Our approach employs contrastive decoding to extract corrupted or
amplified watermark texts via comparing outputs from the student model and
weakly watermarked references, followed by bidirectional distillation to train
new student models capable of watermark removal and watermark forgery,
respectively. Extensive experiments show that CDG-KD effectively performs
attacks while preserving the general performance of the distilled model. Our
findings underscore critical need for developing watermarking schemes that are
robust and unforgeable.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate responses that deviate from user
input or training data, a phenomenon known as "hallucination." These
hallucinations undermine user trust and hinder the adoption of generative AI
systems. Addressing hallucinations is essential for the advancement of LLMs.
This paper introduces a comprehensive hallucination benchmark, incorporating
both new extrinsic and existing intrinsic evaluation tasks, built upon clear
taxonomy of hallucination. A major challenge in benchmarking hallucinations is
the lack of a unified framework due to inconsistent definitions and
categorizations. We disentangle LLM hallucination from "factuality," proposing
a clear taxonomy that distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations, to promote consistency and facilitate research. Extrinsic
hallucinations, where the generated content is not consistent with the training
data, are increasingly important as LLMs evolve. Our benchmark includes dynamic
test set generation to mitigate data leakage and ensure robustness against such
leakage. We also analyze existing benchmarks, highlighting their limitations
and saturation. The work aims to: (1) establish a clear taxonomy of
hallucinations, (2) introduce new extrinsic hallucination tasks, with data that
can be dynamically regenerated to prevent saturation by leakage, (3) provide a
comprehensive analysis of existing benchmarks, distinguishing them from
factuality evaluations.

Motivation: 理解预训练时添加元数据如何影响模型性能，尤其是其在不同下游任务中的不一致表现。

Method: 通过人工生成的数据（如概率上下文无关文法）分析模型行为，研究元数据对潜在语义推断的影响。

Result: 元数据在上下文足够长时提升性能，但在上下文不足时反而降低性能。

Conclusion: 元数据的有效性依赖于下游任务提示是否能推断潜在语义，需根据任务特性调整使用。

Abstract: The ability to acquire latent semantics is one of the key properties that
determines the performance of language models. One convenient approach to
invoke this ability is to prepend metadata (e.g. URLs, domains, and styles) at
the beginning of texts in the pre-training data, making it easier for the model
to access latent semantics before observing the entire text. Previous studies
have reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained
models in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in
specific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token
prediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how
prepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining
its behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach
produces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We
demonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent
semantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically,
through investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free
grammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance
when the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics. In
contrast, the technique negatively impacts performance when the context lacks
the necessary information to make an accurate posterior inference.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
performance on various complex reasoning benchmarks, the academic community
still lacks an in-depth understanding of base model training processes and data
quality. To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded
reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of
varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by
multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of
Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance
reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating
that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning
rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we
significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a
pass rate of 79.2\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark. This
result surpasses most current distilled models and closely approaches
state-of-the-art performance. We provide detailed descriptions of our data
processing, difficulty assessment, and training methodology, and have publicly
released all datasets and methods to promote rapid progress in open-source
long-reasoning LLMs. The dataset is available at:

Method: 通过手动和自动评估五种LLMs在两个数学数据集上的生成程序，分析其数学规则基础性。

Result: 数学规则基础性分布受模型能力和问题难度影响，开源模型表现较差。MATH500数据集上基础性程序比例减半。

Conclusion: 需超越执行准确性，深入评估代码辅助LLMs在数学领域的能力和限制。

Abstract: Assisting LLMs with code generation improved their performance on
mathematical reasoning tasks. However, the evaluation of code-assisted LLMs is
generally restricted to execution correctness, lacking a rigorous evaluation of
their generated programs. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting an
in-depth analysis of code-assisted LLMs' generated programs in response to math
reasoning tasks. Our evaluation focuses on the extent to which LLMs ground
their programs to math rules, and how that affects their end performance. For
this purpose, we assess the generations of five different LLMs, on two
different math datasets, both manually and automatically. Our results reveal
that the distribution of grounding depends on LLMs' capabilities and the
difficulty of math problems. Furthermore, mathematical grounding is more
effective for closed-source models, while open-source models fail to employ
math rules in their solutions correctly. On MATH500, the percentage of grounded
programs decreased to half, while the ungrounded generations doubled in
comparison to ASDiv grade-school problems. Our work highlights the need for
in-depth evaluation beyond execution accuracy metrics, toward a better
understanding of code-assisted LLMs' capabilities and limits in the math
domain.

Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in
multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with
high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a
model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic
threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning
data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity
scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under
user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous
control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain
strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes
inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of
prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on
benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces
theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves
stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios,
underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous
systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between
theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems,
offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware
decision-making.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale in size and adoption, their
computational and environmental costs continue to rise. Prior benchmarking
efforts have primarily focused on latency reduction in idealized settings,
often overlooking the diverse real-world inference workloads that shape energy
use. In this work, we systematically analyze the energy implications of common
inference efficiency optimizations across diverse Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, including
conversational AI and code generation. We introduce a modeling approach that
approximates real-world LLM workflows through a binning strategy for
input-output token distributions and batch size variations. Our empirical
analysis spans software frameworks, decoding strategies, GPU architectures,
online and offline serving settings, and model parallelism configurations. We
show that the effectiveness of inference optimizations is highly sensitive to
workload geometry, software stack, and hardware accelerators, demonstrating
that naive energy estimates based on FLOPs or theoretical GPU utilization
significantly underestimate real-world energy consumption. Our findings reveal
that the proper application of relevant inference efficiency optimizations can
reduce total energy use by up to 73% from unoptimized baselines. These insights
provide a foundation for sustainable LLM deployment and inform energy-efficient
design strategies for future AI infrastructure.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of small language model(SLM) ensembles to
achieve accuracy comparable to proprietary large language models (LLMs). We
propose Ensemble Bayesian Inference (EBI), a novel approach that applies
Bayesian estimation to combine judgments from multiple SLMs, allowing them to
exceed the performance limitations of individual models. Our experiments on
diverse tasks(aptitude assessments and consumer profile analysis in both
Japanese and English) demonstrate EBI's effectiveness. Notably, we analyze
cases where incorporating models with negative Lift values into ensembles
improves overall performance, and we examine the method's efficacy across
different languages. These findings suggest new possibilities for constructing
high-performance AI systems with limited computational resources and for
effectively utilizing models with individually lower performance. Building on
existing research on LLM performance evaluation, ensemble methods, and
open-source LLM utilization, we discuss the novelty and significance of our
approach.

Conclusion: 建议在部署前验证LLMs在目标语言中的表现，确保其适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in educational
settings. These applications expand beyond English, though current LLMs remain
primarily English-centric. In this work, we ascertain if their use in education
settings in non-English languages is warranted. We evaluated the performance of
popular LLMs on four educational tasks: identifying student misconceptions,
providing targeted feedback, interactive tutoring, and grading translations in
six languages (Hindi, Arabic, Farsi, Telugu, Ukrainian, Czech) in addition to
English. We find that the performance on these tasks somewhat corresponds to
the amount of language represented in training data, with lower-resource
languages having poorer task performance. Although the models perform
reasonably well in most languages, the frequent performance drop from English
is significant. Thus, we recommend that practitioners first verify that the LLM
works well in the target language for their educational task before deployment.

Abstract: Conversational assistants are becoming more and more popular, including in

version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture,
and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is
more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on
ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors
and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no
preference for one over the other.

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力是增强Transformer长序列处理能力的关键工具，但需谨慎评估性能权衡。

Abstract: Sparse attention offers a promising strategy to extend long-context
capabilities in Transformer LLMs, yet its viability, its efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs, and systematic scaling studies remain unexplored. To address this
gap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods
at varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse
collection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural
language while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our
experiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis
reveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are
preferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while
statistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than
prefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear
strategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of
sparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even
moderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on
at least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal
solution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored
for sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold
true beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate
that sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer
LLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of
trade-offs for performance-sensitive applications.

Abstract: The United States Department of Defense (DOD) looks to accelerate the
development and deployment of AI capabilities across a wide spectrum of defense
applications to maintain strategic advantages. However, many common features of
AI algorithms that make them powerful, such as capacity for learning,
large-scale data ingestion, and problem-solving, raise new technical, security,
and ethical challenges. These challenges may hinder adoption due to uncertainty
in development, testing, assurance, processes, and requirements.
Trustworthiness through assurance is essential to achieve the expected value
from AI.
  This paper proposes a claims-based framework for risk management and
assurance of AI systems that addresses the competing needs for faster
deployment, successful adoption, and rigorous evaluation. This framework
supports programs across all acquisition pathways provide grounds for
sufficient confidence that an AI-enabled system (AIES) meets its intended
mission goals without introducing unacceptable risks throughout its lifecycle.
The paper's contributions are a framework process for AI assurance, a set of
relevant definitions to enable constructive conversations on the topic of AI
assurance, and a discussion of important considerations in AI assurance. The
framework aims to provide the DOD a robust yet efficient mechanism for swiftly
fielding effective AI capabilities without overlooking critical risks or
undermining stakeholder trust.

Motivation: FCA中的传统依赖关系（如蕴含）无法处理错误数据或异常情况，而非单调推理在FCA中尚未得到充分研究。

Result: 提出的方法在FCA中实现了非单调推理，且比命题逻辑更具上下文相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅保留了KLM框架的非单调性，还为FCA提供了更灵活的推理能力。

Abstract: Defeasible conditionals are a form of non-monotonic inference which enable
the expression of statements like "if $\phi$ then normally $\psi$". The KLM
framework defines a semantics for the propositional case of defeasible
conditionals by construction of a preference ordering over possible worlds. The
pattern of reasoning induced by these semantics is characterised by consequence
relations satisfying certain desirable properties of non-monotonic reasoning.
In FCA, implications are used to describe dependencies between attributes.
However, these implications are unsuitable to reason with erroneous data or
data prone to exceptions. Until recently, the topic of non-monotonic inference
in FCA has remained largely uninvestigated. In this paper, we provide a
construction of the KLM framework for defeasible reasoning in FCA and show that
this construction remains faithful to the principle of non-monotonic inference
described in the original framework. We present an additional argument that,
while remaining consistent with the original ideas around non-monotonic
reasoning, the defeasible reasoning we propose in FCA offers a more contextual
view on inference, providing the ability for more relevant conclusions to be
drawn when compared to the propositional case.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled conversational
AI from traditional dialogue systems into sophisticated agents capable of
autonomous actions, contextual awareness, and multi-turn interactions with
users. Yet, fundamental questions about their capabilities, limitations, and
paths forward remain open. This survey paper presents a desideratum for
next-generation Conversational Agents - what has been achieved, what challenges
persist, and what must be done for more scalable systems that approach
human-level intelligence. To that end, we systematically analyze LLM-driven
Conversational Agents by organizing their capabilities into three primary
dimensions: (i) Reasoning - logical, systematic thinking inspired by human
intelligence for decision making, (ii) Monitor - encompassing self-awareness
and user interaction monitoring, and (iii) Control - focusing on tool
utilization and policy following. Building upon this, we introduce a novel
taxonomy by classifying recent work on Conversational Agents around our
proposed desideratum. We identify critical research gaps and outline key
directions, including realistic evaluations, long-term multi-turn reasoning
skills, self-evolution capabilities, collaborative and multi-agent task
completion, personalization, and proactivity. This work aims to provide a
structured foundation, highlight existing limitations, and offer insights into
potential future research directions for Conversational Agents, ultimately
advancing progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). We maintain a

TLDR: 本文提出了一种新颖的多层分层HITL DRL算法，结合了三种学习方式和三种人类输入形式，并通过无人机案例验证了其高效性和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度强化学习（DRL）的普及，人机交互（HITL）方法有望革新决策问题解决方式，推动人机协作。

Method: 提出了一种多层分层的HITL DRL算法，整合了自主学习、模仿学习和迁移学习，并考虑了奖励、动作和演示三种人类输入形式。

Result: 实验表明，HITL能加速训练并提高性能，人类建议能降低方差，且建议量需适中以避免过训练或欠训练。

Conclusion: HITL DRL算法在复杂问题中表现出色，人机协作在过载和诱饵攻击等实际场景中发挥了重要作用。

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep reinforcement learning (DRL),
human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we
approach decision-making problems and create new opportunities for human-AI
collaboration. In this article, we introduce a novel multi-layered hierarchical
HITL DRL algorithm that comprises three types of learning: self learning,
imitation learning and transfer learning. In addition, we consider three forms
of human inputs: reward, action and demonstration. Furthermore, we discuss main
challenges, trade-offs and advantages of HITL in solving complex problems and
how human information can be integrated in the AI solution systematically. To
verify our technical results, we present a real-world unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAV) problem wherein a number of enemy drones attack a restricted area. The
objective is to design a scalable HITL DRL algorithm for ally drones to
neutralize the enemy drones before they reach the area. To this end, we first
implement our solution using an award-winning open-source HITL software called
Cogment. We then demonstrate several interesting results such as (a) HITL leads
to faster training and higher performance, (b) advice acts as a guiding
direction for gradient methods and lowers variance, and (c) the amount of
advice should neither be too large nor too small to avoid over-training and
under-training. Finally, we illustrate the role of human-AI cooperation in
solving two real-world complex scenarios, i.e., overloaded and decoy attacks.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种框架，用于生成形式化语言中的完整证明，结合自然语言生成、LLM生成形式化证明和启发式模块。通过两阶段微调训练LLM，并在miniF2F-test和Isabelle中验证框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM生成代码的兴起，形式化验证软件代码属性变得尤为重要，但通用定理证明仍是一个未解决的挑战。

Method: 框架包含三个组件：生成自然语言声明、LLM生成形式化证明、启发式模块构建最终证明。LLM通过两阶段微调训练（SFT和RL）。

Result: 在miniF2F-test和Isabelle中验证了框架的有效性，并设计了AWS S3桶访问策略代码的验证用例。

Conclusion: 该框架为形式化验证和定理证明提供了新途径，未来可基于FVEL数据集进一步扩展。

Abstract: Formally verifying properties of software code has been a highly desirable
task, especially with the emergence of LLM-generated code. In the same vein,
they provide an interesting avenue for the exploration of formal verification
and mechanistic interpretability. Since the introduction of code-specific
models, despite their successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the
task of generalized theorem proving still remains far from being fully solved
and will be a benchmark for reasoning capability in LLMs. In this work, we
introduce a framework that generates whole proofs in a formal language to be
used within systems that utilize the power of built-in tactics and
off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. Our framework includes 3 components:
generating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that
generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing
heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage
fine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model
to generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that
encourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover. We
validate our framework using the miniF2F-test benchmark and the Isabelle proof
assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness of the AWS S3 bucket
access policy code. We also curate a dataset based on the
FVEL\textsubscript{\textnormal{ER}} dataset for future training tasks.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种三阶段元判断选择流程，通过多智能体协作和综合评分标准，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLM）作为评估工具的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度增加，LLM评估的挑战性上升，而现有研究多关注对齐人类偏好，忽视了人类判断的偏见和错误。同时，如何从多个LLM响应中选择合适的判断尚未充分研究。

Method: 1) 与GPT-4和人类专家共同制定综合评分标准；2) 使用三个高级LLM智能体评分；3) 应用阈值过滤低分判断。

Result: 在JudgeBench数据集上，相比原始判断和单智能体基线，分别提升了15.55%和8.37%。

Conclusion: 研究展示了LLM作为元判断的潜力，为未来构建LLM作为判断工具的强化学习偏好数据集奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being widely applied across various fields,
but as tasks become more complex, evaluating their responses is increasingly
challenging. Compared to human evaluators, the use of LLMs to support
performance evaluation offers a more efficient alternative. However, most
studies focus mainly on aligning LLMs' judgments with human preferences,
overlooking the existence of biases and mistakes in human judgment.
Furthermore, how to select suitable LLM judgments given multiple potential LLM
responses remains underexplored. To address these two aforementioned issues, we
propose a three-stage meta-judge selection pipeline: 1) developing a
comprehensive rubric with GPT-4 and human experts, 2) using three advanced LLM
agents to score judgments, and 3) applying a threshold to filter out
low-scoring judgments. Compared to methods using a single LLM as both judge and
meta-judge, our pipeline introduces multi-agent collaboration and a more
comprehensive rubric. Experimental results on the JudgeBench dataset show about
15.55\% improvement compared to raw judgments and about 8.37\% improvement over
the single-agent baseline. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs as
meta-judges and lays the foundation for future research on constructing
preference datasets for LLM-as-a-judge reinforcement learning.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种利用生成和可解释AI技术解决自动驾驶车辆（AVs）中罕见故障模式（RFMs）问题的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆依赖AI检测物体，但难以识别罕见故障模式（RFMs），即“长尾挑战”。

Method: 通过分割掩码和环境掩码结合文本提示，使用定制扩散模型生成多样化环境图像，暴露AI系统的漏洞。

Result: 生成的自然语言描述可指导开发者和政策制定者提升AV系统的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法能增强AV系统的鲁棒性和可靠性，适用于模型训练和测试。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately
detect objects and interpret their surroundings. However, even when trained
using millions of miles of real-world data, AVs are often unable to detect rare
failure modes (RFMs). The problem of RFMs is commonly referred to as the
"long-tail challenge", due to the distribution of data including many instances
that are very rarely seen. In this paper, we present a novel approach that
utilizes advanced generative and explainable AI techniques to aid in
understanding RFMs. Our methods can be used to enhance the robustness and
reliability of AVs when combined with both downstream model training and
testing. We extract segmentation masks for objects of interest (e.g., cars) and
invert them to create environmental masks. These masks, combined with carefully
crafted text prompts, are fed into a custom diffusion model. We leverage the
Stable Diffusion inpainting model guided by adversarial noise optimization to
generate images containing diverse environments designed to evade object
detection models and expose vulnerabilities in AI systems. Finally, we produce
natural language descriptions of the generated RFMs that can guide developers
and policymakers to improve the safety and reliability of AV systems.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为CoGA的方法，通过意图驱动的动作空间约束和预训练视觉语言模型生成代码，显著提高了在稀疏奖励和大动作空间环境中的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图形用户界面（GUI）中，传统方法需要大量专家演示才能实现良好性能，而稀疏奖励和大动作空间环境进一步降低了样本效率。本文旨在解决低数据情况下的高效学习问题。

Method: 提出Code as Generative Affordances (CoGA)，利用预训练视觉语言模型生成代码，通过自动化程序生成和验证流程确定可行动作，并将其集成到强化学习代理中。

Result: 在MiniWob++基准测试中，CoGA比传统强化学习代理样本效率高几个数量级，其程序能在任务家族中泛化，且在少量专家演示下表现优于或与行为克隆相当。

Conclusion: CoGA通过约束动作空间和自动化程序生成，显著提高了样本效率，展示了在低数据环境中的潜力。

Abstract: Agents that can autonomously navigate the web through a graphical user
interface (GUI) using a unified action space (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions)
can require very large amounts of domain-specific expert demonstrations to
achieve good performance. Low sample efficiency is often exacerbated in
sparse-reward and large-action-space environments, such as a web GUI, where
only a few actions are relevant in any given situation. In this work, we
consider the low-data regime, with limited or no access to expert behavior. To
enable sample-efficient learning, we explore the effect of constraining the
action space through $\textit{intent-based affordances}$ -- i.e., considering
in any situation only the subset of actions that achieve a desired outcome. We
propose $\textbf{Code as Generative Affordances}$ $(\textbf{$\texttt{CoGA}$})$,
a method that leverages pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to generate
code that determines affordable actions through implicit intent-completion
functions and using a fully-automated program generation and verification
pipeline. These programs are then used in-the-loop of a reinforcement learning
agent to return a set of affordances given a pixel observation. By greatly
reducing the number of actions that an agent must consider, we demonstrate on a
wide range of tasks in the MiniWob++ benchmark that: $\textbf{1)}$
$\texttt{CoGA}$ is orders of magnitude more sample efficient than its RL agent,
$\textbf{2)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$'s programs can generalize within a family of
tasks, and $\textbf{3)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$ performs better or on par compared
with behavior cloning when a small number of expert demonstrations is
available.

Result: 研究发现，LLM显著提升了运营能力，但也引入了新的流程动态，需要进一步优化。

Conclusion: 研究证明了OCPM在现实场景中的实用性，同时指出了其优势和局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), have enhanced organizations' ability to reengineer
business processes by automating knowledge-intensive tasks. This automation
drives digital transformation, often through gradual transitions that improve
process efficiency and effectiveness. To fully assess the impact of such
automation, a data-driven analysis approach is needed - one that examines how
traditional and AI-enhanced process variants coexist during this transition.
Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) has emerged as a valuable method that
enables such analysis, yet real-world case studies are still needed to
demonstrate its applicability. This paper presents a case study from the
insurance sector, where an LLM was deployed in production to automate the
identification of claim parts, a task previously performed manually and
identified as a bottleneck for scalability. To evaluate this transformation, we
apply OCPM to assess the impact of AI-driven automation on process scalability.
Our findings indicate that while LLMs significantly enhance operational
capacity, they also introduce new process dynamics that require further
refinement. This study also demonstrates the practical application of OCPM in a
real-world setting, highlighting its advantages and limitations.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为HRLFS的新方法，通过结合LLM和分层强化学习，优化特征选择过程，提升下游机器学习任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法在复杂数据集上效率低下，主要问题在于每个特征使用一个代理的范式。

Method: 使用LLM提取特征的数学和语义信息，聚类特征并构建分层代理。

Result: HRLFS在性能和运行时间上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HRLFS是一种高效、可扩展且鲁棒的特征选择方法。

Abstract: Feature selection aims to preprocess the target dataset, find an optimal and
most streamlined feature subset, and enhance the downstream machine learning
task. Among filter, wrapper, and embedded-based approaches, the reinforcement
learning (RL)-based subspace exploration strategy provides a novel objective
optimization-directed perspective and promising performance. Nevertheless, even
with improved performance, current reinforcement learning approaches face
challenges similar to conventional methods when dealing with complex datasets.
These challenges stem from the inefficient paradigm of using one agent per
feature and the inherent complexities present in the datasets. This observation
motivates us to investigate and address the above issue and propose a novel
approach, namely HRLFS. Our methodology initially employs a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based hybrid state extractor to capture each feature's mathematical
and semantic characteristics. Based on this information, features are
clustered, facilitating the construction of hierarchical agents for each
cluster and sub-cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and robustness of our approach. Compared to contemporary or the
one-feature-one-agent RL-based approaches, HRLFS improves the downstream ML
performance with iterative feature subspace exploration while accelerating
total run time by reducing the number of agents involved.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for ontology
engineering. However, it is still unclear to what extent they are applicable to
the task of domain-specific ontology generation. In this study, we explore the
application of LLMs for automated ontology generation and evaluate their
performance across different domains. Specifically, we investigate the
generalizability of two state-of-the-art LLMs, DeepSeek and o1-preview, both
equipped with reasoning capabilities, by generating ontologies from a set of
competency questions (CQs) and related user stories. Our experimental setup
comprises six distinct domains carried out in existing ontology engineering
projects and a total of 95 curated CQs designed to test the models' reasoning
for ontology engineering. Our findings show that with both LLMs, the
performance of the experiments is remarkably consistent across all domains,
indicating that these methods are capable of generalizing ontology generation
tasks irrespective of the domain. These results highlight the potential of
LLM-based approaches in achieving scalable and domain-agnostic ontology
construction and lay the groundwork for further research into enhancing
automated reasoning and knowledge representation techniques.

Motivation: 随着AI向ASI发展，可能超出人类控制，引发灾难性后果，因此需要解决超级对齐问题。

Method: 提出外部监督（基于人类决策和自动化评估）与内在主动对齐（自我认知、同理心等）结合的框架。

Result: 通过内外结合的对齐方法，实现人机共生，确保ASI安全有益。

Conclusion: 超级对齐是实现安全ASI的关键，需通过持续互动和内外结合的方法达成人机共生。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming increasingly powerful and
autonomous, and may progress to surpass human intelligence levels, namely
Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). During the progression from AI to ASI, it
may exceed human control, violate human values, and even lead to irreversible
catastrophic consequences in extreme cases. This gives rise to a pressing issue
that needs to be addressed: superalignment, ensuring that AI systems much
smarter than humans, remain aligned with human (compatible) intentions and
values. Existing scalable oversight and weak-to-strong generalization methods
may prove substantially infeasible and inadequate when facing ASI. We must
explore safer and more pluralistic frameworks and approaches for
superalignment. In this paper, we redefine superalignment as the human-AI
co-alignment towards a sustainable symbiotic society, and highlight a framework
that integrates external oversight and intrinsic proactive alignment. External
oversight superalignment should be grounded in human-centered ultimate
decision, supplemented by interpretable automated evaluation and correction, to
achieve continuous alignment with humanity's evolving values. Intrinsic
proactive superalignment is rooted in a profound understanding of the self,
others, and society, integrating self-awareness, self-reflection, and empathy
to spontaneously infer human intentions, distinguishing good from evil and
proactively considering human well-being, ultimately attaining human-AI
co-alignment through iterative interaction. The integration of
externally-driven oversight with intrinsically-driven proactive alignment
empowers sustainable symbiotic societies through human-AI co-alignment, paving
the way for achieving safe and beneficial AGI and ASI for good, for human, and
for a symbiotic ecology.

Conclusion: AI生成的代码工作流有望成为用户与设备交互的新范式，提升效率和便捷性。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), prompt a reassessment of the interaction mechanisms
between users and their devices. Currently, users are required to use a set of
high-level applications to achieve their desired results. However, the advent
of AI may signal a shift in this regard, as its capabilities have generated
novel prospects for user-provided intent resolution through the deployment of
model-generated code, which is tantamount to the generation of workflows
comprising a multitude of interdependent steps. This development represents a
significant progression in the realm of hybrid workflows, where human and
artificial intelligence collaborate to address user intentions, with the former
responsible for defining these intentions and the latter for implementing the
solutions to address them. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of
generating and executing workflows through code generation that results from
prompting an LLM with a concrete user intention, such as \emph{Please send my
car title to my insurance company}, and a simplified application programming
interface for a GUI-less operating system. We provide in-depth analysis and
comparison of various user intentions, the resulting code, and its execution.
The findings demonstrate a general feasibility of our approach and that the
employed LLM, GPT-4o-mini, exhibits remarkable proficiency in the generation of
code-oriented workflows in accordance with provided user intentions.

Abstract: As generative AI models become increasingly integrated into high-stakes

becomes increasingly important. This paper introduces a five-dimensional audit
model -- assessing Analytic Quality, Breadth of Ethical Considerations, Depth
of Explanation, Consistency, and Decisiveness -- to evaluate the ethical logic
of leading large language models (LLMs). Drawing on traditions from applied
ethics and higher-order thinking, we present a multi-battery prompt approach,
including novel ethical dilemmas, to probe the models' reasoning across diverse
contexts. We benchmark seven major LLMs finding that while models generally
converge on ethical decisions, they vary in explanatory rigor and moral
prioritization. Chain-of-Thought prompting and reasoning-optimized models
significantly enhance performance on our audit metrics. This study introduces a
scalable methodology for ethical benchmarking of AI systems and highlights the
potential for AI to complement human moral reasoning in complex decision-making
contexts.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种新的密集估计技术，用于高效估算全球环境中的二氧化氮浓度，显著降低了计算资源需求，并提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有卫星空气质量估算方法计算密集且局限于点位置，无法高效满足大范围环境评估需求。

Method: 采用均匀随机偏移采样策略，将地面数据均匀分散到大区域，通过密集估计方法一步生成网格估算。

Result: 方法在MAE上比现有点方法提高9.45%，达到4.98 μg/m³，兼具高精度和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模环境监测提供了可行的解决方案，展示了其适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical environmental challenge of estimating
ambient Nitrogen Dioxide (NO$_2$) concentrations, a key issue in public health
and environmental policy. Existing methods for satellite-based air pollution
estimation model the relationship between satellite and in-situ measurements at
select point locations. While these approaches have advanced our ability to
provide air quality estimations on a global scale, they come with inherent
limitations. The most notable limitation is the computational intensity
required for generating comprehensive estimates over extensive areas. Motivated
by these limitations, this study introduces a novel dense estimation technique.
Our approach seeks to balance the accuracy of high-resolution estimates with
the practicality of computational constraints, thereby enabling efficient and
scalable global environmental assessment. By utilizing a uniformly random
offset sampling strategy, our method disperses the ground truth data pixel
location evenly across a larger patch. At inference, the dense estimation
method can then generate a grid of estimates in a single step, significantly
reducing the computational resources required to provide estimates for larger
areas. Notably, our approach also surpasses the results of existing point-wise
methods by a significant margin of $9.45\%$, achieving a Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of $4.98\ \mu\text{g}/\text{m}^3$. This demonstrates both high accuracy
and computational efficiency, highlighting the applicability of our method for
global environmental assessment. Furthermore, we showcase the method's
adaptability and robustness by applying it to diverse geographic regions. Our
method offers a viable solution to the computational challenges of large-scale
environmental monitoring.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉变换器中固定长度输出的低效问题，动态适应图像内容以减少计算成本。

Method: 包括动态令牌合并（DToMe）和虚拟令牌解合并（VTU），前者根据图像复杂度合并相似令牌，后者模拟完整序列的注意力动态。

Result: 实验显示DyMU能减少32%-85%的视觉令牌数量，性能与完整模型相当。

Conclusion: DyMU无需训练，适用于多种VLM架构，并提供用户对计算成本的控制。

Abstract: We present DyMU, an efficient, training-free framework that dynamically
reduces the computational burden of vision-language models (VLMs) while
maintaining high task performance. Our approach comprises two key components.
First, Dynamic Token Merging (DToMe) reduces the number of visual token
embeddings by merging similar tokens based on image complexity, addressing the
inherent inefficiency of fixed-length outputs in vision transformers. Second,
Virtual Token Unmerging (VTU) simulates the expected token sequence for large
language models (LLMs) by efficiently reconstructing the attention dynamics of
a full sequence, thus preserving the downstream performance without additional
fine-tuning. Unlike previous approaches, our method dynamically adapts token
compression to the content of the image and operates completely training-free,
making it readily applicable to most state-of-the-art VLM architectures.
Extensive experiments on image and video understanding tasks demonstrate that
DyMU can reduce the average visual token count by 32%-85% while achieving
comparable performance to full-length models across diverse VLM architectures,
including the recently popularized AnyRes-based visual encoders. Furthermore,
through qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that DToMe effectively adapts
token reduction based on image complexity and, unlike existing systems,
provides users more control over computational costs. Project page:

Abstract: Accurate depth estimation enhances endoscopy navigation and diagnostics, but
obtaining ground-truth depth in clinical settings is challenging. Synthetic
datasets are often used for training, yet the domain gap limits generalization
to real data. We propose a novel image-to-image translation framework that
preserves structure while generating realistic textures from clinical data. Our
key innovation integrates Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, conditioned on a
latent representation extracted from a Per-Pixel Shading (PPS) map. PPS
captures surface lighting effects, providing a stronger structural constraint
than depth maps. Experiments show our approach produces more realistic
translations and improves depth estimation over GAN-based MI-CycleGAN. Our code

Abstract: Autoregressive patch-based image generation has recently shown competitive
results in terms of image quality and scalability. It can also be easily
integrated and scaled within Vision-Language models. Nevertheless,
autoregressive models require a defined order for patch generation. While a
natural order based on the dictation of the words makes sense for text
generation, there is no inherent generation order that exists for image
generation. Traditionally, a raster-scan order (from top-left to bottom-right)
guides autoregressive image generation models. In this paper, we argue that
this order is suboptimal, as it fails to respect the causality of the image
content: for instance, when conditioned on a visual description of a sunset, an
autoregressive model may generate clouds before the sun, even though the color
of clouds should depend on the color of the sun and not the inverse. In this
work, we show that first by training a model to generate patches in
any-given-order, we can infer both the content and the location (order) of each
patch during generation. Secondly, we use these extracted orders to finetune
the any-given-order model to produce better-quality images. Through our
experiments, we show on two datasets that this new generation method produces
better images than the traditional raster-scan approach, with similar training
costs and no extra annotations.

Result: 在两项汽车目标检测任务中，实现了比现有方法更高的性能提升（最高2.8倍），并在实例分割中也有显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过结合场景合理性和生成模型，本文方法在数据增强任务中取得了新的最优性能。

Abstract: Generative image models are increasingly being used for training data
augmentation in vision tasks. In the context of automotive object detection,
methods usually focus on producing augmented frames that look as realistic as
possible, for example by replacing real objects with generated ones. Others try
to maximize the diversity of augmented frames, for example by pasting lots of
generated objects onto existing backgrounds. Both perspectives pay little
attention to the locations of objects in the scene. Frame layouts are either
reused with little or no modification, or they are random and disregard realism
entirely. In this work, we argue that optimal data augmentation should also
include realistic augmentation of layouts. We introduce a scene-aware
probabilistic location model that predicts where new objects can realistically
be placed in an existing scene. By then inpainting objects in these locations
with a generative model, we obtain much stronger augmentation performance than
existing approaches. We set a new state of the art for generative data
augmentation on two automotive object detection tasks, achieving up to
$2.8\times$ higher gains than the best competing approach ($+1.4$ vs. $+0.5$
mAP boost). We also demonstrate significant improvements for instance
segmentation.

Abstract: Dataset distillation has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
high-compression scenarios for image datasets. While video datasets inherently
contain greater redundancy, existing video dataset distillation methods
primarily focus on compression in the pixel space, overlooking advances in the
latent space that have been widely adopted in modern text-to-image and
text-to-video models. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a novel
video dataset distillation approach that operates in the latent space using a
state-of-the-art variational encoder. Furthermore, we employ a diversity-aware
data selection strategy to select both representative and diverse samples.
Additionally, we introduce a simple, training-free method to further compress
the distilled latent dataset. By combining these techniques, our approach
achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in dataset distillation,
outperforming prior methods on all datasets, e.g. on HMDB51 IPC 1, we achieve a
2.6% performance increase; on MiniUCF IPC 5, we achieve a 7.8% performance
increase.

Conclusion: 本文为RNA亚细胞定位研究提供了宝贵资源，并指出了未来发展的方向。

Abstract: The subcellular localization of RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other smaller RNAs,
plays a critical role in determining their biological functions. For instance,
lncRNAs are predominantly associated with chromatin and act as regulators of
gene transcription and chromatin structure, while mRNAs are distributed across
the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitating the transport of genetic information
for protein synthesis. Understanding RNA localization sheds light on processes
like gene expression regulation with spatial and temporal precision. However,
traditional wet lab methods for determining RNA localization, such as in situ
hybridization, are often time-consuming, resource-demanding, and costly. To
overcome these challenges, computational methods leveraging artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful
alternatives, enabling large-scale prediction of RNA subcellular localization.
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in
AI-based approaches for RNA subcellular localization prediction, covering
various RNA types and focusing on sequence-based, image-based, and hybrid
methodologies that combine both data types. We highlight the potential of these
methods to accelerate RNA research, uncover molecular pathways, and guide
targeted disease treatments. Furthermore, we critically discuss the challenges
in AI/ML approaches for RNA subcellular localization, such as data scarcity and
lack of benchmarks, and opportunities to address them. This review aims to
serve as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop innovative
solutions in the field of RNA subcellular localization and beyond.

### [143] [PhysioSync: Temporal and Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning Inspired by Physiological Synchronization for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17163)
*Kai Cui,Jia Li,Yu Liu,Xuesong Zhang,Zhenzhen Hu,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: PhysioSync是一个利用时间和跨模态对比学习的预训练框架，通过动态同步EEG和PPS信号提升情绪识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号虽能反映情绪状态，但易受噪声和个体差异影响，且现有方法忽略了模态间的动态同步和语义一致性。

Method: 提出PhysioSync框架，结合跨模态一致性对齐（CM-CA）和长短期时间对比学习（LS-TCL），预训练后通过分层融合和微调优化情绪识别。

Result: 在DEAP和DREAMER数据集上，PhysioSync在单模态和跨模态条件下均表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: PhysioSync通过建模模态间动态关系和捕捉多时间分辨率同步，显著提升了EEG情绪识别的效果。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide a promising and involuntary
reflection of brain activity related to emotional states, offering significant
advantages over behavioral cues like facial expressions. However, EEG signals
are often noisy, affected by artifacts, and vary across individuals,
complicating emotion recognition. While multimodal approaches have used
Peripheral Physiological Signals (PPS) like GSR to complement EEG, they often
overlook the dynamic synchronization and consistent semantics between the
modalities. Additionally, the temporal dynamics of emotional fluctuations
across different time resolutions in PPS remain underexplored. To address these
challenges, we propose PhysioSync, a novel pre-training framework leveraging
temporal and cross-modal contrastive learning, inspired by physiological
synchronization phenomena. PhysioSync incorporates Cross-Modal Consistency
Alignment (CM-CA) to model dynamic relationships between EEG and complementary
PPS, enabling emotion-related synchronizations across modalities. Besides, it
introduces Long- and Short-Term Temporal Contrastive Learning (LS-TCL) to
capture emotional synchronization at different temporal resolutions within
modalities. After pre-training, cross-resolution and cross-modal features are
hierarchically fused and fine-tuned to enhance emotion recognition. Experiments
on DEAP and DREAMER datasets demonstrate PhysioSync's advanced performance
under uni-modal and cross-modal conditions, highlighting its effectiveness for
EEG-centered emotion recognition.

Abstract: Foundation models have garnered increasing attention for representation
learning in remote sensing, primarily adopting approaches that have
demonstrated success in computer vision with minimal domain-specific
modification. However, the development and application of foundation models in
this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches
that each come with significant benefits and drawbacks. This paper examines
these approaches along with their roots in the computer vision field in order
to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls while outlining future
directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We
discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the
need for massive compute resources. We place emphasis on the multi-sensor
aspect of Earth observations, and the extent to which existing approaches
leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to
multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further
harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote
sensing observations.

Conclusion: 该方法为文本到视频生成提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的优化方案。

Abstract: Current text-to-video (T2V) generation models are increasingly popular due to
their ability to produce coherent videos from textual prompts. However, these
models often struggle to generate semantically and temporally consistent videos
when dealing with longer, more complex prompts involving multiple objects or
sequential events. Additionally, the high computational costs associated with
training or fine-tuning make direct improvements impractical. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce \(\projectname\), a novel zero-training video
refinement pipeline that leverages neuro-symbolic feedback to automatically
enhance video generation, achieving superior alignment with the prompts. Our
approach first derives the neuro-symbolic feedback by analyzing a formal video
representation and pinpoints semantically inconsistent events, objects, and
their corresponding frames. This feedback then guides targeted edits to the
original video. Extensive empirical evaluations on both open-source and
proprietary T2V models demonstrate that \(\projectname\) significantly enhances
temporal and logical alignment across diverse prompts by almost $40\%$.

Motivation: 视角感知是人类视觉理解的关键能力，但现有VLMs在此方面表现不足，存在自我中心偏见。通过模拟人类心理意象，旨在缩小VLMs与人类感知的差距。

Method: 提出Abstract Perspective Change (APC)框架，利用视觉基础模型（如目标检测、分割和方向估计）构建场景抽象并实现视角转换。

Result: 在合成和真实图像基准测试中，APC框架显著优于现有VLMs、微调的空间推理模型和基于新视角合成的方法。

Conclusion: APC框架通过心理意象模拟有效提升了VLMs的视角感知推理能力，为多视角理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a framework for perspective-aware reasoning in vision-language
models (VLMs) through mental imagery simulation. Perspective-taking, the
ability to perceive an environment or situation from an alternative viewpoint,
is a key benchmark for human-level visual understanding, essential for
environmental interaction and collaboration with autonomous agents. Despite
advancements in spatial reasoning within VLMs, recent research has shown that
modern VLMs significantly lack perspective-aware reasoning capabilities and
exhibit a strong bias toward egocentric interpretations. To bridge the gap
between VLMs and human perception, we focus on the role of mental imagery,
where humans perceive the world through abstracted representations that
facilitate perspective shifts. Motivated by this, we propose a framework for
perspective-aware reasoning, named Abstract Perspective Change (APC), that
effectively leverages vision foundation models, such as object detection,
segmentation, and orientation estimation, to construct scene abstractions and
enable perspective transformations. Our experiments on synthetic and real-image
benchmarks, compared with various VLMs, demonstrate significant improvements in
perspective-aware reasoning with our framework, further outperforming
fine-tuned spatial reasoning models and novel-view-synthesis-based approaches.

TLDR: MCAF是一种基于代理的无训练框架，通过多模态粗到细注意力聚焦进行视频理解，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解，尤其是长视频，信息冗余且复杂，需要模型全局分配注意力以提高准确性。

Method: MCAF通过多模态信息分层聚焦相关帧，并采用扩张时间扩展机制避免遗漏关键细节，结合自反机制迭代优化注意力。

Result: 在EgoSchema数据集上性能提升5%，在Next-QA和IntentQA数据集上分别提升0.2%和0.3%，在Video-MME数据集上也优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MCAF通过创新注意力策略显著提升视频理解性能，适用于长视频任务。

Abstract: Even in the era of rapid advances in large models, video understanding,
particularly long videos, remains highly challenging. Compared with textual or
image-based information, videos commonly contain more information with
redundancy, requiring large models to strategically allocate attention at a
global level for accurate comprehension. To address this, we propose MCAF, an
agent-based, training-free framework perform video understanding through
Multimodal Coarse-to-fine Attention Focusing. The key innovation lies in its
ability to sense and prioritize segments of the video that are highly relevant
to the understanding task. First, MCAF hierarchically concentrates on highly
relevant frames through multimodal information, enhancing the correlation
between the acquired contextual information and the query. Second, it employs a
dilated temporal expansion mechanism to mitigate the risk of missing crucial
details when extracting information from these concentrated frames. In
addition, our framework incorporates a self-reflection mechanism utilizing the
confidence level of the model's responses as feedback. By iteratively applying
these two creative focusing strategies, it adaptively adjusts attention to
capture highly query-connected context and thus improves response accuracy.
MCAF outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on average. On the
EgoSchema dataset, it achieves a remarkable 5% performance gain over the
leading approach. Meanwhile, on Next-QA and IntentQA datasets, it outperforms
the current state-of-the-art standard by 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. On the
Video-MME dataset, which features videos averaging nearly an hour in length,
MCAF also outperforms other agent-based methods.

Result: 在广泛采用的基准测试中，该方法在准确性和泛化性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 多尺度空间-频率分析框架为通用深度伪造检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deep generative models poses a critical challenge to
deepfake detection, as detectors trained on forgery-specific artifacts often
suffer significant performance degradation when encountering unseen forgeries.
While existing methods predominantly rely on spatial domain analysis, frequency
domain operations are primarily limited to feature-level augmentation, leaving
frequency-native artifacts and spatial-frequency interactions insufficiently
exploited. To address this limitation, we propose a novel detection framework
that integrates multi-scale spatial-frequency analysis for universal deepfake
detection. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a local spectral
feature extraction pipeline that combines block-wise discrete cosine transform
with cascaded multi-scale convolutions to capture subtle spectral artifacts;
(2) a global spectral feature extraction pipeline utilizing scale-invariant
differential accumulation to identify holistic forgery distribution patterns;
and (3) a multi-stage cross-modal fusion mechanism that incorporates
shallow-layer attention enhancement and deep-layer dynamic modulation to model
spatial-frequency interactions. Extensive evaluations on widely adopted
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art deepfake
detection methods in both accuracy and generalizability.

Motivation: 传统方法仅关注孤立面部特征，忽略了非语言线索，导致实际场景中鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出SoVTP框架，结合空间标注、生理信号和上下文提示，形成统一提示策略。

Result: 实验表明，SoVTP显著优于现有视觉提示方法。

Conclusion: SoVTP有效增强了VLLMs的视频情感识别能力。

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) exhibit promising potential for
multi-modal understanding, yet their application to video-based emotion
recognition remains limited by insufficient spatial and contextual awareness.
Traditional approaches, which prioritize isolated facial features, often
neglect critical non-verbal cues such as body language, environmental context,
and social interactions, leading to reduced robustness in real-world scenarios.
To address this gap, we propose Set-of-Vision-Text Prompting (SoVTP), a novel
framework that enhances zero-shot emotion recognition by integrating spatial
annotations (e.g., bounding boxes, facial landmarks), physiological signals
(facial action units), and contextual cues (body posture, scene dynamics,
others' emotions) into a unified prompting strategy. SoVTP preserves holistic
scene information while enabling fine-grained analysis of facial muscle
movements and interpersonal dynamics. Extensive experiments show that SoVTP
achieves substantial improvements over existing visual prompting methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing VLLMs' video emotion recognition
capabilities.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of poor quality of steganographic images and slow
network convergence of image steganography models based on deep learning, this
paper proposes a Steganography Curriculum Learning training strategy (STCL) for
deep learning image steganography models. So that only easy images are selected
for training when the model has poor fitting ability at the initial stage, and
gradually expand to more difficult images, the strategy includes a difficulty
evaluation strategy based on the teacher model and an knee point-based training
scheduling strategy. Firstly, multiple teacher models are trained, and the
consistency of the quality of steganographic images under multiple teacher
models is used as the difficulty score to construct the training subsets from
easy to difficult. Secondly, a training control strategy based on knee points
is proposed to reduce the possibility of overfitting on small training sets and
accelerate the training process. Experimental results on three large public
datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed image
steganography scheme is able to improve the model performance under multiple
algorithmic frameworks, which not only has a high PSNR, SSIM score, and
decoding accuracy, but also the steganographic images generated by the model
under the training of the STCL strategy have a low steganography analysis
scores. You can find our code at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像压缩技术对LiDAR点云的2D范围图像（RIs）压缩效果有限，因其与自然图像在比特精度和像素值分布上存在差异。

Method: 将RIs分割为深度和掩码图像，分别采用基于INR的块级和像素级架构，结合模型剪枝和量化进行压缩。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，该方法在低比特率和解码延迟下，优于现有图像、点云、RI和INR压缩方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效压缩LiDAR点云提供了新思路，支持高精度3D场景存档与分析。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel scheme to efficiently compress Light Detection
and Ranging~(LiDAR) point clouds, enabling high-precision 3D scene archives,
and such archives pave the way for a detailed understanding of the
corresponding 3D scenes. We focus on 2D range images~(RIs) as a lightweight
format for representing 3D LiDAR observations. Although conventional image
compression techniques can be adapted to improve compression efficiency for
RIs, their practical performance is expected to be limited due to differences
in bit precision and the distinct pixel value distribution characteristics
between natural images and RIs. We propose a novel implicit neural
representation~(INR)--based RI compression method that effectively handles
floating-point valued pixels. The proposed method divides RIs into depth and
mask images and compresses them using patch-wise and pixel-wise INR
architectures with model pruning and quantization, respectively. Experiments on
the KITTI dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing image,
point cloud, RI, and INR-based compression methods in terms of 3D
reconstruction and detection quality at low bitrates and decoding latency.

Conclusion: 该混合方法为现代图像质量评估提供了更全面的框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and widespread use of
smartphones have resulted in an exponential growth of image data, both real
(camera-captured) and virtual (AI-generated). This surge underscores the
critical need for robust image quality assessment (IQA) methods that accurately
reflect human visual perception. Traditional IQA techniques primarily rely on
spatial features - such as signal-to-noise ratio, local structural distortions,
and texture inconsistencies - to identify artifacts. While effective for
unprocessed or conventionally altered images, these methods fall short in the
context of modern image post-processing powered by deep neural networks (DNNs).
The rise of DNN-based models for image generation, enhancement, and restoration
has significantly improved visual quality, yet made accurate assessment
increasingly complex. To address this, we propose a novel IQA approach that
bridges the gap between deep learning methods and human perception. Our model
disentangles deep features into high-level semantic information and low-level
perceptual details, treating each stream separately. These features are then
combined with conventional IQA metrics to provide a more comprehensive
evaluation framework. This hybrid design enables the model to assess both
global context and intricate image details, better reflecting the human visual
process, which first interprets overall structure before attending to
fine-grained elements. The final stage employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
map the integrated features into a concise quality score. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves improved consistency with human perceptual
judgments compared to existing IQA models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in various generative tasks
such as image and video generation. This paper studies the problem of
leveraging pretrained diffusion models for performing discriminative tasks.
Specifically, we extend the discriminative capability of pretrained frozen
generative diffusion models from the classification task to the more complex
object detection task, by "inverting" a pretrained layout-to-image diffusion
model. To this end, a gradient-based discrete optimization approach for
replacing the heavy prediction enumeration process, and a prior distribution
model for making more accurate use of the Bayes' rule, are proposed
respectively. Empirical results show that this method is on par with basic
discriminative object detection baselines on COCO dataset. In addition, our
method can greatly speed up the previous diffusion-based method for
classification without sacrificing accuracy. Code and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种自适应步长量化（ASQ）方法，通过动态调整量化参数和非均匀量化方案，显著提升量化感知训练（QAT）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统QAT中量化参数固定导致的灵活性不足问题，尤其是处理分布差异大的激活值时。

Method: 1. 动态调整量化缩放因子；2. 提出基于POST的非均匀量化方案，结合LUT保持计算效率。

Result: ASQ在4位量化ResNet34上，ImageNet准确率提升1.2%，优于现有QAT方法。

Conclusion: ASQ通过自适应量化策略，在模型压缩和性能保持上取得显著优势。

Abstract: Quantization Aware Training (QAT) is a neural network quantization technique
that compresses model size and improves operational efficiency while
effectively maintaining model performance. The paradigm of QAT is to introduce
fake quantization operators during the training process, allowing the model to
autonomously compensate for information loss caused by quantization. Making
quantization parameters trainable can significantly improve the performance of
QAT, but at the cost of compromising the flexibility during inference,
especially when dealing with activation values with substantially different
distributions. In this paper, we propose an effective learnable adaptive neural
network quantization method, called Adaptive Step Size Quantization (ASQ), to
resolve this conflict. Specifically, the proposed ASQ method first dynamically
adjusts quantization scaling factors through a trained module capable of
accommodating different activations. Then, to address the rigid resolution
issue inherent in Power of Two (POT) quantization, we propose an efficient
non-uniform quantization scheme. We utilize the Power Of Square root of Two
(POST) as the basis for exponential quantization, effectively handling the
bell-shaped distribution of neural network weights across various bit-widths
while maintaining computational efficiency through a Look-Up Table method
(LUT). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASQ method
is superior to the state-of-the-art QAT approaches. Notably that the ASQ is
even competitive compared to full precision baselines, with its 4-bit quantized
ResNet34 model improving accuracy by 1.2\% on ImageNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为GTF的新方法，用于文本引导的语义图像编辑，支持多种语义操作且无需训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法效率低、扩展性差且通用性有限，而扩散模型中噪声的几何特性与语义变化密切相关。

Method: 通过控制噪声的几何关系实现多种语义操作（如添加、移除和风格迁移），无需调优或优化。

Result: 实验证明GTF能高效生成高质量结果，支持多模态任务。

Conclusion: GTF在语义操作领域具有潜力，可推动技术发展。

Abstract: Text-guided semantic manipulation refers to semantically editing an image
generated from a source prompt to match a target prompt, enabling the desired
semantic changes (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) while preserving
irrelevant contents. With the powerful generative capabilities of the diffusion
model, the task has shown the potential to generate high-fidelity visual
content. Nevertheless, existing methods either typically require time-consuming
fine-tuning (inefficient), fail to accomplish multiple semantic manipulations
(poorly extensible), and/or lack support for different modality tasks (limited
generalizability). Upon further investigation, we find that the geometric
properties of noises in the diffusion model are strongly correlated with the
semantic changes. Motivated by this, we propose a novel $\textit{GTF}$ for
text-guided semantic manipulation, which has the following attractive
capabilities: 1) $\textbf{Generalized}$: our $\textit{GTF}$ supports multiple
semantic manipulations (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) and can be
seamlessly integrated into all diffusion-based methods (i.e., Plug-and-play)
across different modalities (i.e., modality-agnostic); and 2)
$\textbf{Training-free}$: $\textit{GTF}$ produces high-fidelity results via
simply controlling the geometric relationship between noises without tuning or
optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach, highlighting its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in
semantics manipulation.

Conclusion: EdgePoint2在灵活性、鲁棒性和多功能性方面表现优异，是适应多样化计算和通信约束的理想选择。

Abstract: The field of keypoint extraction, which is essential for vision applications
like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM), has evolved from relying on handcrafted methods to leveraging deep
learning techniques. While deep learning approaches have significantly improved
performance, they often incur substantial computational costs, limiting their
deployment in real-time edge applications. Efforts to create lightweight neural
networks have seen some success, yet they often result in trade-offs between
efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the high-dimensional descriptors
generated by these networks poses challenges for distributed applications
requiring efficient communication and coordination, highlighting the need for
compact yet competitively accurate descriptors. In this paper, we present
EdgePoint2, a series of lightweight keypoint detection and description neural
networks specifically tailored for edge computing applications on embedded
system. The network architecture is optimized for efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. To train compact descriptors, we introduce a combination
of Orthogonal Procrustes loss and similarity loss, which can serve as a general
approach for hypersphere embedding distillation tasks. Additionally, we offer
14 sub-models to satisfy diverse application requirements. Our experiments
demonstrate that EdgePoint2 consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
accuracy and efficiency across various challenging scenarios while employing
lower-dimensional descriptors (32/48/64). Beyond its accuracy, EdgePoint2
offers significant advantages in flexibility, robustness, and versatility.
Consequently, EdgePoint2 emerges as a highly competitive option for visual
tasks, especially in contexts demanding adaptability to diverse computational
and communication constraints.

Conclusion: 创新策略在医学图像分析中具有显著效果，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变病灶的精确分割上。

Abstract: To improve the segmentation of diabetic retinopathy lesions (microaneurysms,
hemorrhages, exudates, and soft exudates), we implemented a binary segmentation
method specific to each type of lesion. As post-segmentation, we combined the
individual model outputs into a single image to better analyze the lesion
types. This approach facilitated parameter optimization and improved accuracy,
effectively overcoming challenges related to dataset limitations and annotation
complexity. Specific preprocessing steps included cropping and applying
contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization to the L channel of the LAB

further refine the model's efficacy. Our methodology utilized the DeepLabv3+
model, achieving a segmentation accuracy of 99%. These findings highlight the
efficacy of innovative strategies in advancing medical image analysis,
particularly in the precise segmentation of diabetic retinopathy lesions. The
IDRID dataset was utilized to validate and demonstrate the robustness of our
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频平台的快速增长需要实时视频理解系统，但现有视频大语言模型在流媒体场景中因无法高效处理冗余帧而受限。

Method: 提出DTD模块，灵感来自人类视觉感知的变化盲视现象，保留有意义的时间变化，过滤静态冗余内容。

Result: DTD减少82.8%的视频令牌，同时保持98%的性能，表明流媒体视频中80%以上内容是冗余的。

Conclusion: TimeChat-Online在流媒体和长视频任务中表现优异，其主动响应能力使其优于传统方法。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video platforms, particularly live streaming
services, has created an urgent need for real-time video understanding systems.
These systems must process continuous video streams and respond to user queries
instantaneously, presenting unique challenges for current Video Large Language
Models (VideoLLMs). While existing VideoLLMs excel at processing complete
videos, they face significant limitations in streaming scenarios due to their
inability to handle dense, redundant frames efficiently. We introduce
TimeChat-Online, a novel online VideoLLM that revolutionizes real-time video
interaction. At its core lies our innovative Differential Token Drop (DTD)
module, which addresses the fundamental challenge of visual redundancy in
streaming videos. Drawing inspiration from human visual perception's Change
Blindness phenomenon, DTD preserves meaningful temporal changes while filtering
out static, redundant content between frames. Remarkably, our experiments
demonstrate that DTD achieves an 82.8% reduction in video tokens while
maintaining 98% performance on StreamingBench, revealing that over 80% of
visual content in streaming videos is naturally redundant without requiring
language guidance. To enable seamless real-time interaction, we present
TimeChat-Online-139K, a comprehensive streaming video dataset featuring diverse
interaction patterns including backward-tracing, current-perception, and
future-responding scenarios. TimeChat-Online's unique Proactive Response
capability, naturally achieved through continuous monitoring of video scene
transitions via DTD, sets it apart from conventional approaches. Our extensive
evaluation demonstrates TimeChat-Online's superior performance on streaming
benchmarks (StreamingBench and OvOBench) and maintaining competitive results on
long-form video tasks such as Video-MME and MLVU.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为DRC的新型个性化图像生成框架，通过解耦表示组合增强LMMs，解决了现有方法在捕捉用户风格偏好和语义意图时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如扩散模型、大语言模型或LMMs）难以准确捕捉和融合用户的风格偏好与语义意图，尤其是LMMs方法存在视觉特征纠缠问题，导致生成的图像无法保留用户偏好或反映指定语义。

Method: DRC框架通过解耦表示组合，从历史图像和参考图像中分别提取用户风格偏好和语义意图，形成用户特定的潜在指令。包括两个关键学习阶段：解耦学习和个性化建模。

Result: 在两项基准测试中，DRC表现出竞争力，有效缓解了指导崩溃问题，证明了解耦表示学习对可控和有效的个性化图像生成的重要性。

Conclusion: DRC通过解耦表示组合显著提升了LMMs在个性化图像生成中的性能，为可控和有效的多模态内容创作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Personalized image generation has emerged as a promising direction in
multimodal content creation. It aims to synthesize images tailored to
individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances,
layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by
leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite
notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large
language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately
capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular,
the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual
features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to
preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics.
  To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image
generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation
Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic
intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form
user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs.
Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement
learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style
and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with
difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which
applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled
representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on
two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while
effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance
of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective
personalized image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统隐式神经表示（INRs）在回归问题中容易回归到均值，导致细节丢失和高频信息保留不足，限制了其在信号处理中的应用。

Method: 提出了迭代隐式神经表示（I-INRs），通过迭代细化过程提升信号重建质量，兼容现有INRs架构。

Result: 实验表明，I-INRs在图像恢复、去噪和物体占用预测等任务中优于基线方法（如WIRE、SIREN和Gauss）。

Conclusion: I-INRs通过迭代优化显著提升了信号重建的质量和鲁棒性，适用于多种计算机视觉任务。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have revolutionized signal processing
and computer vision by modeling signals as continuous, differentiable functions
parameterized by neural networks. However, their inherent formulation as a
regression problem makes them prone to regression to the mean, limiting their
ability to capture fine details, retain high-frequency information, and handle
noise effectively. To address these challenges, we propose Iterative Implicit
Neural Representations (I-INRs) a novel plug-and-play framework that enhances
signal reconstruction through an iterative refinement process. I-INRs
effectively recover high-frequency details, improve robustness to noise, and
achieve superior reconstruction quality. Our framework seamlessly integrates
with existing INR architectures, delivering substantial performance gains
across various tasks. Extensive experiments show that I-INRs outperform
baseline methods, including WIRE, SIREN, and Gauss, in diverse computer vision
applications such as image restoration, image denoising, and object occupancy
prediction.

Method: 提出TimeSoccer，结合MoFA-Select模块自适应选择代表性帧，并通过互补训练范式增强长时序处理能力。

Result: 实验表明TimeSoccer在SDVC任务上达到最优性能，生成高质量评论且时间对齐准确。

Conclusion: TimeSoccer解决了足球视频端到端处理的挑战，为长视频理解提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Soccer is a globally popular sporting event, typically characterized by long
matches and distinctive highlight moments. Recent advances in Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
video understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise
temporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video.
However, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption
generation, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some
traditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to
capture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the
above issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for
Single-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos.
TimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass,
enabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long
video understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a
training-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects
representative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates
complementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle
long temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer
achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end
form, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and
strong semantic relevance.

Abstract: Accurate 3D trajectory data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving. Yet,
traditional datasets are usually captured by fixed sensors mounted on a car and
are susceptible to occlusion. Additionally, such an approach can precisely
reconstruct the dynamic environment in the close vicinity of the measurement
vehicle only, while neglecting objects that are further away. In this paper, we
introduce the DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset (DSC3D), a high-quality,
occlusion-free dataset of 6 degrees of freedom bounding box trajectories
acquired through a novel monocular camera drone tracking pipeline. Our dataset
includes more than 175,000 trajectories of 14 types of traffic participants and
significantly exceeds existing datasets in terms of diversity and scale,
containing many unprecedented scenarios such as complex vehicle-pedestrian
interaction on highly populated urban streets and comprehensive parking
maneuvers from entry to exit. DSC3D dataset was captured in five various
locations in Europe and the United States and include: a parking lot, a crowded
inner-city, a steep urban intersection, a federal highway, and a suburban
intersection. Our 3D trajectory dataset aims to enhance autonomous driving
systems by providing detailed environmental 3D representations, which could
lead to improved obstacle interactions and safety. We demonstrate its utility
across multiple applications including motion prediction, motion planning,
scenario mining, and generative reactive traffic agents. Our interactive online

Result: 在三个数据集（FSC-147、CARPK、PUCPR+）上验证了SDVPT的有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: SDVPT显著提升了开放世界物体计数模型的性能，且参数和推理时间开销小。

Abstract: Open-world object counting leverages the robust text-image alignment of
pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to enable counting of arbitrary
categories in images specified by textual queries. However, widely adopted
naive fine-tuning strategies concentrate exclusively on text-image consistency
for categories contained in training, which leads to limited generalizability
for unseen categories. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Semantic-Driven
Visual Prompt Tuning framework (SDVPT) that transfers knowledge from the
training set to unseen categories with minimal overhead in parameters and
inference time. First, we introduce a two-stage visual prompt learning strategy
composed of Category-Specific Prompt Initialization (CSPI) and Topology-Guided
Prompt Refinement (TGPR). The CSPI generates category-specific visual prompts,
and then TGPR distills latent structural patterns from the VLM's text encoder
to refine these prompts. During inference, we dynamically synthesize the visual
prompts for unseen categories based on the semantic correlation between unseen
and training categories, facilitating robust text-image alignment for unseen
categories. Extensive experiments integrating SDVPT with all available
open-world object counting models demonstrate its effectiveness and
adaptability across three widely used datasets: FSC-147, CARPK, and PUCPR+.

Conclusion: PEFT技术为预训练地理空间模型的适应提供了高效途径，开源工具包TerraTorch支持快速、可扩展且经济高效的模型适配。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is crucial for monitoring environmental changes,
responding to disasters, and managing natural resources. In this context,
foundation models facilitate remote sensing image analysis to retrieve relevant
geoinformation accurately and efficiently. However, as these models grow in
size, fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging due to the associated
computational resources and costs, limiting their accessibility and
scalability. Furthermore, full fine-tuning can lead to forgetting pre-trained
features and even degrade model generalization. To address this,
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques offer a promising solution.
In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments with various foundation model
architectures and PEFT techniques to evaluate their effectiveness on five
different EO datasets. Our results provide a comprehensive comparison, offering
insights into when and how PEFT methods support the adaptation of pre-trained
geospatial models. We demonstrate that PEFT techniques match or even exceed
full fine-tuning performance and enhance model generalisation to unseen
geographic regions, while reducing training time and memory requirements.
Additional experiments investigate the effect of architecture choices such as
the decoder type or the use of metadata, suggesting UNet decoders and
fine-tuning without metadata as the recommended configuration. We have
integrated all evaluated foundation models and techniques into the open-source
package TerraTorch to support quick, scalable, and cost-effective model
adaptation.

Abstract: Collective Perception (CP) has emerged as a promising approach to overcome
the limitations of individual perception in the context of autonomous driving.
Various approaches have been proposed to realize collective perception;
however, the Sensor2Sensor domain gap that arises from the utilization of
different sensor systems in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) remains
mostly unaddressed. This is primarily due to the paucity of datasets containing
heterogeneous sensor setups among the CAVs. The recently released SCOPE
datasets address this issue by providing data from three different LiDAR
sensors for each CAV. This study is the first to tackle the Sensor2Sensor
domain gap in vehicle to vehicle (V2V) collective perception. First, we present
our sensor-domain robust architecture S2S-Net. Then an in-depth analysis of the
Sensor2Sensor domain adaptation capabilities of S2S-Net on the SCOPE dataset is
conducted. S2S-Net demonstrates the capability to maintain very high
performance in unseen sensor domains and achieved state-of-the-art results on
the SCOPE dataset.

Abstract: Stereo disparity estimation is crucial for obtaining depth information in
robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS). While current deep learning
methods have made significant advancements, challenges remain in achieving an
optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and inference speed. To address
these challenges, we propose the StereoMamba architecture, which is
specifically designed for stereo disparity estimation in RAMIS. Our approach is
based on a novel Feature Extraction Mamba (FE-Mamba) module, which enhances
long-range spatial dependencies both within and across stereo images. To
effectively integrate multi-scale features from FE-Mamba, we then introduce a
novel Multidimensional Feature Fusion (MFF) module. Experiments against the
state-of-the-art on the ex-vivo SCARED benchmark demonstrate that StereoMamba
achieves superior performance on EPE of 2.64 px and depth MAE of 2.55 mm, the
second-best performance on Bad2 of 41.49% and Bad3 of 26.99%, while maintaining
an inference speed of 21.28 FPS for a pair of high-resolution images
(1280*1024), striking the optimum balance between accuracy, robustness, and
efficiency. Furthermore, by comparing synthesized right images, generated from
warping left images using the generated disparity maps, with the actual right
image, StereoMamba achieves the best average SSIM (0.8970) and PSNR (16.0761),
exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization on the in-vivo RIS2017 and StereoMIS
datasets.

TLDR: 3DV-TON是一种基于扩散的框架，用于生成高质量且时间一致的视频试穿效果，通过动态3D网格指导和矩形掩码策略解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂服装图案和多样身体姿势时难以生成高质量且时间一致的结果。

Method: 使用生成的动画纹理3D网格作为帧级指导，结合自适应管道生成动态3D指导，并引入矩形掩码策略减少伪影传播。

Result: 定量和定性结果表明，3DV-TON在生成高保真和时间一致的视频试穿效果上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 3DV-TON通过动态3D指导和掩码策略显著提升了视频试穿的质量和一致性，并发布了HR-VVT数据集以推动研究。

Abstract: Video try-on replaces clothing in videos with target garments. Existing
methods struggle to generate high-quality and temporally consistent results
when handling complex clothing patterns and diverse body poses. We present
3DV-TON, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating high-fidelity and
temporally consistent video try-on results. Our approach employs generated
animatable textured 3D meshes as explicit frame-level guidance, alleviating the
issue of models over-focusing on appearance fidelity at the expanse of motion
coherence. This is achieved by enabling direct reference to consistent garment
texture movements throughout video sequences. The proposed method features an
adaptive pipeline for generating dynamic 3D guidance: (1) selecting a keyframe
for initial 2D image try-on, followed by (2) reconstructing and animating a
textured 3D mesh synchronized with original video poses. We further introduce a
robust rectangular masking strategy that successfully mitigates artifact
propagation caused by leaking clothing information during dynamic human and
garment movements. To advance video try-on research, we introduce HR-VVT, a
high-resolution benchmark dataset containing 130 videos with diverse clothing
types and scenarios. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate our
superior performance over existing methods. The project page is at this link

TLDR: UniME提出了一种两阶段框架，利用MLLMs学习多模态表示，解决了CLIP的局限性，并在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP框架在多模态表示学习中存在文本截断、孤立编码和组合性不足的问题，而MLLMs的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: UniME通过文本知识蒸馏和硬负样本增强指令调优两阶段方法，提升多模态表示的判别性和组合性。

Result: 在MMEB基准和多个检索任务中，UniME表现一致优于现有方法，展示了更强的判别和组合能力。

Conclusion: UniME为多模态表示学习提供了一种高效框架，显著提升了判别性和组合性，适用于多样化下游任务。

Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework has become a
widely used approach for multimodal representation learning, particularly in
image-text retrieval and clustering. However, its efficacy is constrained by
three key limitations: (1) text token truncation, (2) isolated image-text
encoding, and (3) deficient compositionality due to bag-of-words behavior.
While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant advances in generalized vision-language understanding, their
potential for learning transferable multimodal representations remains
underexplored.In this work, we present UniME (Universal Multimodal Embedding),
a novel two-stage framework that leverages MLLMs to learn discriminative
representations for diverse downstream tasks. In the first stage, we perform
textual discriminative knowledge distillation from a powerful LLM-based teacher
model to enhance the embedding capability of the MLLM\'s language component. In
the second stage, we introduce hard negative enhanced instruction tuning to
further advance discriminative representation learning. Specifically, we
initially mitigate false negative contamination and then sample multiple hard
negatives per instance within each batch, forcing the model to focus on
challenging samples. This approach not only improves discriminative power but
also enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks,
including short and long caption retrieval and compositional retrieval. Results
demonstrate that UniME achieves consistent performance improvement across all
tasks, exhibiting superior discriminative and compositional capabilities.

TLDR: POD是一种自改进框架，通过预测、优化和蒸馏的循环提升对4D物体理解的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过长期观察提升对物体3D状态的预测能力，现有系统多依赖多视角观察或监督数据集训练，POD旨在通过自改进循环实现更优性能。

Method: POD框架通过预测局部部分姿态、全局优化和蒸馏生成自标注数据，形成自改进循环，并引入准多视角挖掘策略减少深度模糊。

Result: 在14个真实和5个合成物体上测试，POD显著优于纯优化基线，性能随视频长度和迭代次数提升。

Conclusion: POD展示了通过自改进循环和额外观察提升性能的潜力，适用于复杂关节和多体配置的物体。

Abstract: Humans can resort to long-form inspection to build intuition on predicting
the 3D configurations of unseen objects. The more we observe the object motion,
the better we get at predicting its 3D state immediately. Existing systems
either optimize underlying representations from multi-view observations or
train a feed-forward predictor from supervised datasets. We introduce
Predict-Optimize-Distill (POD), a self-improving framework that interleaves
prediction and optimization in a mutually reinforcing cycle to achieve better
4D object understanding with increasing observation time. Given a multi-view
object scan and a long-form monocular video of human-object interaction, POD
iteratively trains a neural network to predict local part poses from RGB
frames, uses this predictor to initialize a global optimization which refines
output poses through inverse rendering, then finally distills the results of
optimization back into the model by generating synthetic self-labeled training
data from novel viewpoints. Each iteration improves both the predictive model
and the optimized motion trajectory, creating a virtuous cycle that bootstraps
its own training data to learn about the pose configurations of an object. We
also introduce a quasi-multiview mining strategy for reducing depth ambiguity
by leveraging long video. We evaluate POD on 14 real-world and 5 synthetic
objects with various joint types, including revolute and prismatic joints as
well as multi-body configurations where parts detach or reattach independently.
POD demonstrates significant improvement over a pure optimization baseline
which gets stuck in local minima, particularly for longer videos. We also find
that POD's performance improves with both video length and successive
iterations of the self-improving cycle, highlighting its ability to scale
performance with additional observations and looped refinement.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为FRAG的框架，通过选择输入中的相关帧而非处理长上下文，提升了大型多模态模型在长视频和多页文档上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长上下文多模态模型因计算成本高而受限，作者探索了一种无需长上下文处理的方法。

Method: FRAG框架独立评分每帧，通过Top-K选择最高分帧，基于所选帧生成输出，无需微调现有模型。

Result: 实验显示FRAG显著提升性能，在长视频和文档理解任务中达到SOTA，如InternVL2-76B在MLVU上提升5.8%。

Conclusion: FRAG证明了无需长上下文处理的简单框架能有效提升多模态模型性能，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: There has been impressive progress in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Recent
works extend these models to long inputs, including multi-page documents and
long videos. However, the model size and performance of these long context
models are still limited due to the computational cost in both training and
inference. In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction and process long
inputs without long context LMMs. We propose Frame Selection Augmented
Generation (FRAG), where the model first selects relevant frames within the
input, and then only generates the final outputs based on the selected frames.
The core of the selection process is done by scoring each frame independently,
which does not require long context processing. The frames with the highest
scores are then selected by a simple Top-K selection. We show that this
frustratingly simple framework is applicable to both long videos and multi-page
documents using existing LMMs without any fine-tuning. We consider two models,
LLaVA-OneVision and InternVL2, in our experiments and show that FRAG
consistently improves the performance and achieves state-of-the-art
performances for both long video and long document understanding. For videos,
FRAG substantially improves InternVL2-76B by 5.8% on MLVU and 3.7% on
Video-MME. For documents, FRAG achieves over 20% improvements on MP-DocVQA
compared with recent LMMs specialized in long document understanding. Code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注减少估计误差，但忽视了鲁棒性和安全性，导致系统易受对抗攻击。

Method: 提出TBA框架，结合DHNG（利用VAE和ControlNet生成多样化噪声）和自定义对抗损失函数，通过多梯度信号迭代优化对抗样本。

Result: 实验显示TBA显著提高了对抗攻击效果，估计误差增加了41.0%，平均提升约17.0%。

Conclusion: 当前EHPS模型存在严重安全漏洞，需加强数字人生成系统的防御能力。

Abstract: Expressive human pose and shape estimation (EHPS) is crucial for digital
human generation, especially in applications like live streaming. While
existing research primarily focuses on reducing estimation errors, it largely
neglects robustness and security aspects, leaving these systems vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. To address this significant challenge, we propose the
\textbf{Tangible Attack (TBA)}, a novel framework designed to generate
adversarial examples capable of effectively compromising any digital human
generation model. Our approach introduces a \textbf{Dual Heterogeneous Noise
Generator (DHNG)}, which leverages Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and
ControlNet to produce diverse, targeted noise tailored to the original image
features. Additionally, we design a custom \textbf{adversarial loss function}
to optimize the noise, ensuring both high controllability and potent
disruption. By iteratively refining the adversarial sample through
multi-gradient signals from both the noise and the state-of-the-art EHPS model,
TBA substantially improves the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate TBA's superiority, achieving a remarkable 41.0\%
increase in estimation error, with an average improvement of approximately
17.0\%. These findings expose significant security vulnerabilities in current
EHPS models and highlight the need for stronger defenses in digital human
generation systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出一种基于置信度趋势的样本选择方法，用于解决噪声标签下图像分类中正确标签样本与难学习样本的区分问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将小损失样本视为正确标签，但难学习样本在训练早期可能表现出高损失，导致样本选择时在精度和召回率之间存在权衡。

Method: 通过跟踪模型预测置信度趋势（使用Mann-Kendall检验），区分正确标签样本与噪声样本，并将其作为插件集成到现有方法中。

Result: 在多个标准基准和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提升了噪声标签学习的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效缓解样本选择中的权衡问题，提升噪声标签下的分类性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel sample selection method for image classification in the
presence of noisy labels. Existing methods typically consider small-loss
samples as correctly labeled. However, some correctly labeled samples are
inherently difficult for the model to learn and can exhibit high loss similar
to mislabeled samples in the early stages of training. Consequently, setting a
threshold on per-sample loss to select correct labels results in a trade-off
between precision and recall in sample selection: a lower threshold may miss
many correctly labeled hard-to-learn samples (low recall), while a higher
threshold may include many mislabeled samples (low precision). To address this
issue, our goal is to accurately distinguish correctly labeled yet
hard-to-learn samples from mislabeled ones, thus alleviating the trade-off
dilemma. We achieve this by considering the trends in model prediction
confidence rather than relying solely on loss values. Empirical observations
show that only for correctly labeled samples, the model's prediction confidence
for the annotated labels typically increases faster than for any other classes.
Based on this insight, we propose tracking the confidence gaps between the
annotated labels and other classes during training and evaluating their trends
using the Mann-Kendall Test. A sample is considered potentially correctly
labeled if all its confidence gaps tend to increase. Our method functions as a
plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing sample
selection techniques. Experiments on several standard benchmarks and real-world
datasets demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing
methods for learning with noisy labels.

Motivation: 现有评估方法要么仅关注文本对齐或主题保留，要么与人类判断不一致，或依赖昂贵的API评估，限制了领域进展。

Method: 引入RefVNLI，基于大规模视频推理基准和图像扰动数据集训练，评估文本对齐和主题保留。

Result: RefVNLI在多个基准和主题类别中表现优异，文本对齐提升6.4分，主题一致性提升8.5分，与人类偏好一致率达87%。

Conclusion: RefVNLI为T2I生成提供了高效、可靠的自动评估方法，解决了现有评估的局限性。

Abstract: Subject-driven text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to produce images that
align with a given textual description, while preserving the visual identity
from a referenced subject image. Despite its broad downstream applicability --
ranging from enhanced personalization in image generation to consistent
character representation in video rendering -- progress in this field is
limited by the lack of reliable automatic evaluation. Existing methods either
assess only one aspect of the task (i.e., textual alignment or subject
preservation), misalign with human judgments, or rely on costly API-based
evaluation. To address this, we introduce RefVNLI, a cost-effective metric that
evaluates both textual alignment and subject preservation in a single
prediction. Trained on a large-scale dataset derived from video-reasoning
benchmarks and image perturbations, RefVNLI outperforms or matches existing
baselines across multiple benchmarks and subject categories (e.g.,
\emph{Animal}, \emph{Object}), achieving up to 6.4-point gains in textual
alignment and 8.5-point gains in subject consistency. It also excels with
lesser-known concepts, aligning with human preferences at over 87\% accuracy.

Motivation: 现有领域泛化（DG）方法主要基于CNN或ViT架构，而Mamba模型在医学图像分割中表现出色，但其在DG中的应用尚未探索。

Method: 提出Mamba-Sea框架，结合全局和局部序列增强机制，模拟不同站点间的外观变化，抑制模型对领域特定信息的学习。

Conclusion: Mamba-Sea是首个探索Mamba在医学图像分割中泛化能力的工作，展示了其在领域偏移问题上的强大鲁棒性。

Abstract: To segment medical images with distribution shifts, domain generalization
(DG) has emerged as a promising setting to train models on source domains that
can generalize to unseen target domains. Existing DG methods are mainly based
on CNN or ViT architectures. Recently, advanced state space models, represented
by Mamba, have shown promising results in various supervised medical image
segmentation. The success of Mamba is primarily owing to its ability to capture
long-range dependencies while keeping linear complexity with input sequence
length, making it a promising alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Inspired by the
success, in the paper, we explore the potential of the Mamba architecture to
address distribution shifts in DG for medical image segmentation. Specifically,
we propose a novel Mamba-based framework, Mamba-Sea, incorporating
global-to-local sequence augmentation to improve the model's generalizability
under domain shift issues. Our Mamba-Sea introduces a global augmentation
mechanism designed to simulate potential variations in appearance across
different sites, aiming to suppress the model's learning of domain-specific
information. At the local level, we propose a sequence-wise augmentation along
input sequences, which perturbs the style of tokens within random continuous
sub-sequences by modeling and resampling style statistics associated with
domain shifts. To our best knowledge, Mamba-Sea is the first work to explore
the generalization of Mamba for medical image segmentation, providing an
advanced and promising Mamba-based architecture with strong robustness to
domain shifts. Remarkably, our proposed method is the first to surpass a Dice
coefficient of 90% on the Prostate dataset, which exceeds previous SOTA of
88.61%. The code is available at https://github.com/orange-czh/Mamba-Sea.

Result: 在TableGraph-24k数据集上达到最先进性能，且训练和推理效率更高。

Conclusion: TableCenterNet在表格结构解析中表现出高效性和适应性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Table structure recognition aims to parse tables in unstructured data into
machine-understandable formats. Recent methods address this problem through a
two-stage process or optimized one-stage approaches. However, these methods
either require multiple networks to be serially trained and perform more
time-consuming sequential decoding, or rely on complex post-processing
algorithms to parse the logical structure of tables. They struggle to balance
cross-scenario adaptability, robustness, and computational efficiency. In this
paper, we propose a one-stage end-to-end table structure parsing network called
TableCenterNet. This network unifies the prediction of table spatial and
logical structure into a parallel regression task for the first time, and
implicitly learns the spatial-logical location mapping laws of cells through a
synergistic architecture of shared feature extraction layers and task-specific
decoding. Compared with two-stage methods, our method is easier to train and
faster to infer. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that TableCenterNet can
effectively parse table structures in diverse scenarios and achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the TableGraph-24k dataset. Code is available

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量指标和图像质量（纹理和结构完整性）上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通过小样本学习实现了更精确和一致的图像修复效果。

Abstract: Image inpainting is a technique used to restore missing or damaged regions of
an image. Traditional methods primarily utilize information from adjacent
pixels for reconstructing missing areas, while they struggle to preserve
complex details and structures. Simultaneously, models based on deep learning
necessitate substantial amounts of training data. To address this challenge, an
encoding strategy-inspired diffusion model with few-shot learning for color
image inpainting is proposed in this paper. The main idea of this novel
encoding strategy is the deployment of a "virtual mask" to construct
high-dimensional objects through mutual perturbations between channels. This
approach enables the diffusion model to capture diverse image representations
and detailed features from limited training samples. Moreover, the encoding
strategy leverages redundancy between channels, integrates with low-rank
methods during iterative inpainting, and incorporates the diffusion model to
achieve accurate information output. Experimental results indicate that our
method exceeds current techniques in quantitative metrics, and the
reconstructed images quality has been improved in aspects of texture and
structural integrity, leading to more precise and coherent results.

Abstract: The recent global spread of monkeypox, particularly in regions where it has
not historically been prevalent, has raised significant public health concerns.
Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective disease management and
control. In response, this study proposes a novel deep learning-based framework
for the automated detection of monkeypox from skin lesion images, leveraging
the power of transfer learning, dimensionality reduction, and advanced machine
learning techniques. We utilize the newly developed Monkeypox Skin Lesion
Dataset (MSLD), which includes images of monkeypox, chickenpox, and measles, to
train and evaluate our models. The proposed framework employs the Xception
architecture for deep feature extraction, followed by Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and the Natural Gradient Boosting
(NGBoost) algorithm for classification. To optimize the model's performance and
generalization, we introduce the African Vultures Optimization Algorithm (AVOA)
for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring efficient exploration of the parameter
space. Our results demonstrate that the proposed AVOA-NGBoost model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an accuracy of 97.53%, F1-score of 97.72%
and an AUC of 97.47%. Additionally, we enhance model interpretability using
Grad-CAM and LIME techniques, providing insights into the decision-making
process and highlighting key features influencing classification. This
framework offers a highly precise and efficient diagnostic tool, potentially

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在辐射场渲染中同时捕捉粗尺度和细尺度的几何与外观细节，同时避免视图变化时的视觉伪影。

Method: 采用双尺度表示：2D surfels处理粗尺度几何和外观，3D高斯分布补充细尺度细节。渲染分为两个阶段：先通过标准图形管线栅格化surfels，再通过深度测试和颜色积累渲染高斯分布。

Result: GESs实现了超快速的渲染速度，避免了视图变化时的视觉伪影，并通过扩展支持抗锯齿、加速渲染和压缩存储。

Conclusion: GESs作为一种新型表示方法，在超快速高保真辐射场渲染中表现出色，并具有多种扩展潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Gaussian-enhanced Surfels (GESs), a bi-scale representation for
radiance field rendering, wherein a set of 2D opaque surfels with
view-dependent colors represent the coarse-scale geometry and appearance of
scenes, and a few 3D Gaussians surrounding the surfels supplement fine-scale
appearance details. The rendering with GESs consists of two passes -- surfels
are first rasterized through a standard graphics pipeline to produce depth and
color maps, and then Gaussians are splatted with depth testing and color
accumulation on each pixel order independently. The optimization of GESs from
multi-view images is performed through an elaborate coarse-to-fine procedure,
faithfully capturing rich scene appearance. The entirely sorting-free rendering
of GESs not only achieves very fast rates, but also produces view-consistent
images, successfully avoiding popping artifacts under view changes. The basic
GES representation can be easily extended to achieve anti-aliasing in rendering
(Mip-GES), boosted rendering speeds (Speedy-GES) and compact storage
(Compact-GES), and reconstruct better scene geometries by replacing 3D
Gaussians with 2D Gaussians (2D-GES). Experimental results show that GESs
advance the state-of-the-arts as a compelling representation for ultra-fast

Abstract: Knowledge-based Vision Question Answering (KB-VQA) extends general Vision
Question Answering (VQA) by not only requiring the understanding of visual and
textual inputs but also extensive range of knowledge, enabling significant
advancements across various real-world applications. KB-VQA introduces unique
challenges, including the alignment of heterogeneous information from diverse
modalities and sources, the retrieval of relevant knowledge from noisy or
large-scale repositories, and the execution of complex reasoning to infer
answers from the combined context. With the advancement of Large Language
Models (LLMs), KB-VQA systems have also undergone a notable transformation,
where LLMs serve as powerful knowledge repositories, retrieval-augmented
generators and strong reasoners. Despite substantial progress, no comprehensive
survey currently exists that systematically organizes and reviews the existing
KB-VQA methods. This survey aims to fill this gap by establishing a structured
taxonomy of KB-VQA approaches, and categorizing the systems into main stages:
knowledge representation, knowledge retrieval, and knowledge reasoning. By
exploring various knowledge integration techniques and identifying persistent
challenges, this work also outlines promising future research directions,
providing a foundation for advancing KB-VQA models and their applications.

*Lin Che,Yizi Chen,Tanhua Jin,Martin Raubal,Konrad Schindler,Peter Kiefer*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于无监督对比聚类和地理先验的街景图像分类方法，用于复杂城市环境中的土地利用分类与制图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感技术因缺乏地面细节在复杂城市环境中精度不足，而街景图像能捕捉更多与土地利用相关的人类和社会活动。现有监督分类方法受限于高质量标注数据的稀缺性和泛化能力不足。

Method: 引入一种结合地理先验的无监督对比聚类模型，通过简单的视觉分配聚类结果，提供灵活的土地利用制图方案。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能基于街景图像数据集生成两个城市的土地利用图，且具有适应性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法依赖地理空间数据的空间一致性，适用于街景图像可用的多种场景，支持无监督土地利用制图与更新。

Abstract: Urban land use classification and mapping are critical for urban planning,
resource management, and environmental monitoring. Existing remote sensing
techniques often lack precision in complex urban environments due to the
absence of ground-level details. Unlike aerial perspectives, street view images
provide a ground-level view that captures more human and social activities
relevant to land use in complex urban scenes. Existing street view-based
methods primarily rely on supervised classification, which is challenged by the
scarcity of high-quality labeled data and the difficulty of generalizing across
diverse urban landscapes. This study introduces an unsupervised contrastive
clustering model for street view images with a built-in geographical prior, to
enhance clustering performance. When combined with a simple visual assignment
of the clusters, our approach offers a flexible and customizable solution to
land use mapping, tailored to the specific needs of urban planners. We
experimentally show that our method can generate land use maps from geotagged
street view image datasets of two cities. As our methodology relies on the
universal spatial coherence of geospatial data ("Tobler's law"), it can be
adapted to various settings where street view images are available, to enable
scalable, unsupervised land use mapping and updating. The code will be
available at https://github.com/lin102/CCGP.

*Zebo Huang,Yinghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种针对内窥镜场景的自监督单目深度估计网络，通过遮挡感知框架和语义分割改进深度重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态光照和遮挡情况下表现不佳，导致深度估计不可靠。

Method: 引入遮挡掩码进行数据增强，结合非负矩阵分解的语义分割生成伪标签。

Result: 在SCARED数据集上达到最优性能，并在其他数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了内窥镜场景下的自监督深度估计性能。

Abstract: We propose a self-supervised monocular depth estimation network tailored for
endoscopic scenes, aiming to infer depth within the gastrointestinal tract from
monocular images. Existing methods, though accurate, typically assume
consistent illumination, which is often violated due to dynamic lighting and
occlusions caused by GI motility. These variations lead to incorrect geometric
interpretations and unreliable self-supervised signals, degrading depth
reconstruction quality. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware
self-supervised framework. First, we incorporate an occlusion mask for data
augmentation, generating pseudo-labels by simulating viewpoint-dependent
occlusion scenarios. This enhances the model's ability to learn robust depth
features under partial visibility. Second, we leverage semantic segmentation
guided by non-negative matrix factorization, clustering convolutional
activations to generate pseudo-labels in texture-deprived regions, thereby
improving segmentation accuracy and mitigating information loss from lighting
changes. Experimental results on the SCARED dataset show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised depth estimation.
Additionally, evaluations on the Endo-SLAM and SERV-CT datasets demonstrate
strong generalization across diverse endoscopic environments.

Motivation: 研究JPEG压缩过程中固定点的存在性及其潜在应用，尤其是图像防篡改检测。

Method: 分析JPEG压缩和解压过程，证明固定点的存在性，并提出一种基于固定点的防篡改图像生成方法。

Result: 固定点确实存在且可通过几次迭代达到，图像视觉质量保持良好。该方法能有效检测图像篡改。

Conclusion: JPEG压缩固定点的存在为图像防篡改提供了新思路，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: An intriguing phenomenon about JPEG compression has been observed since two
decades ago- after repeating JPEG compression and decompression, it leads to a
stable image that does not change anymore, which is a fixed point. In this
work, we prove the existence of fixed points in the essential JPEG procedures.
We analyze JPEG compression and decompression processes, revealing the
existence of fixed points that can be reached within a few iterations. These
fixed points are diverse and preserve the image's visual quality, ensuring
minimal distortion. This result is used to develop a method to create a
tamper-evident image from the original authentic image, which can expose
tampering operations by showing deviations from the fixed point image.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: HMAD网络通过分层模态聚合与分布，提升RGB-D跟踪的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RGB-D跟踪器效率低且仅关注单层特征，导致融合鲁棒性差且速度慢，无法满足实际应用需求。

Method: 提出HMAD网络，利用RGB和深度模态的独特特征表示优势，采用分层方法进行特征分布与融合。

Result: 在多个RGB-D数据集上实现最优性能，并在实时场景中有效应对多种跟踪挑战。

Conclusion: HMAD显著提升了RGB-D跟踪的鲁棒性和实时性。

Abstract: The integration of dual-modal features has been pivotal in advancing
RGB-Depth (RGB-D) tracking. However, current trackers are less efficient and
focus solely on single-level features, resulting in weaker robustness in fusion
and slower speeds that fail to meet the demands of real-world applications. In
this paper, we introduce a novel network, denoted as HMAD (Hierarchical
Modality Aggregation and Distribution), which addresses these challenges. HMAD
leverages the distinct feature representation strengths of RGB and depth
modalities, giving prominence to a hierarchical approach for feature
distribution and fusion, thereby enhancing the robustness of RGB-D tracking.
Experimental results on various RGB-D datasets demonstrate that HMAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, real-world experiments further validate
HMAD's capacity to effectively handle a spectrum of tracking challenges in
real-time scenarios.

Motivation: 解决开放世界目标定位问题，即在训练时仅使用有限类别的边界框信息，在推理时定位所有类别（包括未见类别）的目标。

Abstract: Our work addresses the problem of learning to localize objects in an
open-world setting, i.e., given the bounding box information of a limited
number of object classes during training, the goal is to localize all objects,
belonging to both the training and unseen classes in an image, during
inference. Towards this end, recent work in this area has focused on improving
the characterization of objects either explicitly by proposing new objective
functions (localization quality) or implicitly using object-centric
auxiliary-information, such as depth information, pixel/region affinity map
etc. In this work, we address this problem by incorporating background
information to guide the learning of the notion of objectness. Specifically, we
propose a novel framework to discover background regions in an image and train
an object proposal network to not detect any objects in these regions. We
formulate the background discovery task as that of identifying image regions
that are not discriminative, i.e., those that are redundant and constitute low
information content. We conduct experiments on standard benchmarks to showcase
the effectiveness of our proposed approach and observe significant improvements
over the previous state-of-the-art approaches for this task.

TLDR: 本文首次全面讨论和比较了无结构视觉定位方法，发现基于经典几何推理的方法在姿态精度上优于基于姿态回归的方法，但灵活性更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于结构的视觉定位方法虽精度高但灵活性不足，而无结构方法更易更新但研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过实验比较多种无结构方法，包括基于经典绝对或半广义相对姿态估计的方法与基于姿态回归的方法。

Result: 基于经典几何推理的方法在姿态精度上显著优于基于姿态回归的方法，但略逊于基于结构的方法。

Conclusion: 无结构方法在灵活性和精度之间存在权衡，为未来研究提供了有趣方向。

Abstract: Visual localization algorithms, i.e., methods that estimate the camera pose
of a query image in a known scene, are core components of many applications,
including self-driving cars and augmented / mixed reality systems.
State-of-the-art visual localization algorithms are structure-based, i.e., they
store a 3D model of the scene and use 2D-3D correspondences between the query
image and 3D points in the model for camera pose estimation. While such
approaches are highly accurate, they are also rather inflexible when it comes
to adjusting the underlying 3D model after changes in the scene. Structureless
localization approaches represent the scene as a database of images with known
poses and thus offer a much more flexible representation that can be easily
updated by adding or removing images. Although there is a large amount of
literature on structure-based approaches, there is significantly less work on
structureless methods. Hence, this paper is dedicated to providing the, to the
best of our knowledge, first comprehensive discussion and comparison of
structureless methods. Extensive experiments show that approaches that use a
higher degree of classical geometric reasoning generally achieve higher pose
accuracy. In particular, approaches based on classical absolute or
semi-generalized relative pose estimation outperform very recent methods based
on pose regression by a wide margin. Compared with state-of-the-art
structure-based approaches, the flexibility of structureless methods comes at
the cost of (slightly) lower pose accuracy, indicating an interesting direction
for future work.

TLDR: DiMeR提出了一种解耦的双流前馈模型，通过分离几何和纹理输入及框架，显著提升了稀疏视图网格重建的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB图像在几何重建中可能导致训练目标冲突且缺乏清晰性，因此需要一种更有效的方法来分离几何和纹理处理。

Method: DiMeR利用法线图作为几何分支的输入以减少复杂度，同时改进网格提取算法引入3D监督；纹理分支则使用RGB图像输入。

Result: DiMeR在稀疏视图重建、单图像到3D和文本到3D任务中表现优异，Chamfer Distance在GSO和OmniObject3D数据集上提升超过30%。

Conclusion: DiMeR通过解耦几何和纹理处理，显著提升了3D重建的性能和效率。

Abstract: With the advent of large-scale 3D datasets, feed-forward 3D generative
models, such as the Large Reconstruction Model (LRM), have gained significant
attention and achieved remarkable success. However, we observe that RGB images
often lead to conflicting training objectives and lack the necessary clarity
for geometry reconstruction. In this paper, we revisit the inductive biases
associated with mesh reconstruction and introduce DiMeR, a novel disentangled
dual-stream feed-forward model for sparse-view mesh reconstruction. The key
idea is to disentangle both the input and framework into geometry and texture
parts, thereby reducing the training difficulty for each part according to the
Principle of Occam's Razor. Given that normal maps are strictly consistent with
geometry and accurately capture surface variations, we utilize normal maps as
exclusive input for the geometry branch to reduce the complexity between the
network's input and output. Moreover, we improve the mesh extraction algorithm
to introduce 3D ground truth supervision. As for texture branch, we use RGB
images as input to obtain the textured mesh. Overall, DiMeR demonstrates robust
capabilities across various tasks, including sparse-view reconstruction,
single-image-to-3D, and text-to-3D. Numerous experiments show that DiMeR
significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving over 30% improvement in
Chamfer Distance on the GSO and OmniObject3D dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在受控环境下效果有限，无法泛化到自然图像和新物体类别。本文旨在开发一种适用于自然场景和多样物体的通用方法。

Method: 1. 构建PICO-db数据集，利用视觉基础模型检索3D物体网格，并通过2次点击标注接触点。2. 提出PICO-fit优化算法，利用接触点信息拟合3D人体和物体网格。

Result: PICO-fit能够处理多种物体类别，显著提升了在自然场景中的3D HOI恢复能力。

Conclusion: PICO方法通过新数据集和优化算法，实现了对自然图像中多样物体类别的3D HOI恢复，为实际应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering 3D Human-Object Interaction (HOI) from single color images is
challenging due to depth ambiguities, occlusions, and the huge variation in
object shape and appearance. Thus, past work requires controlled settings such
as known object shapes and contacts, and tackles only limited object classes.
Instead, we need methods that generalize to natural images and novel object
classes. We tackle this in two main ways: (1) We collect PICO-db, a new dataset
of natural images uniquely paired with dense 3D contact on both body and object
meshes. To this end, we use images from the recent DAMON dataset that are
paired with contacts, but these contacts are only annotated on a canonical 3D
body. In contrast, we seek contact labels on both the body and the object. To
infer these given an image, we retrieve an appropriate 3D object mesh from a
database by leveraging vision foundation models. Then, we project DAMON's body
contact patches onto the object via a novel method needing only 2 clicks per
patch. This minimal human input establishes rich contact correspondences
between bodies and objects. (2) We exploit our new dataset of contact
correspondences in a novel render-and-compare fitting method, called PICO-fit,
to recover 3D body and object meshes in interaction. PICO-fit infers contact
for the SMPL-X body, retrieves a likely 3D object mesh and contact from PICO-db
for that object, and uses the contact to iteratively fit the 3D body and object
meshes to image evidence via optimization. Uniquely, PICO-fit works well for
many object categories that no existing method can tackle. This is crucial to
enable HOI understanding to scale in the wild. Our data and code are available
at https://pico.is.tue.mpg.de.

Motivation: 旨在捕捉人类活动的复杂性，通过多传感器和分层标注设计，支持人工智能在人类中心应用中的研究。

Method: 数据集包含脚本和非脚本记录，标注分为三个层次（L1独立任务、L2共享动作、L3详细步骤），支持多模态传感器融合实验。

Conclusion: DARai为人类活动研究提供了丰富的数据资源，支持多模态和领域变体实验，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Daily Activity Recordings for Artificial Intelligence (DARai, pronounced
"Dahr-ree") is a multimodal, hierarchically annotated dataset constructed to
understand human activities in real-world settings. DARai consists of
continuous scripted and unscripted recordings of 50 participants in 10
different environments, totaling over 200 hours of data from 20 sensors
including multiple camera views, depth and radar sensors, wearable inertial
measurement units (IMUs), electromyography (EMG), insole pressure sensors,
biomonitor sensors, and gaze tracker.
  To capture the complexity in human activities, DARai is annotated at three
levels of hierarchy: (i) high-level activities (L1) that are independent tasks,
(ii) lower-level actions (L2) that are patterns shared between activities, and
(iii) fine-grained procedures (L3) that detail the exact execution steps for
actions. The dataset annotations and recordings are designed so that 22.7% of
L2 actions are shared between L1 activities and 14.2% of L3 procedures are
shared between L2 actions. The overlap and unscripted nature of DARai allows
counterfactual activities in the dataset.
  Experiments with various machine learning models showcase the value of DARai
in uncovering important challenges in human-centered applications.
Specifically, we conduct unimodal and multimodal sensor fusion experiments for
recognition, temporal localization, and future action anticipation across all
hierarchical annotation levels. To highlight the limitations of individual
sensors, we also conduct domain-variant experiments that are enabled by DARai's
multi-sensor and counterfactual activity design setup.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于生成场理论和通道风格潜在空间S的新图像编辑方法，以解决StyleGAN中特征控制的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: StyleGAN在生成高真实性人脸方面表现出色，但其低维潜在空间的强纠缠性导致特征控制困难。现有方法在W空间调制采样，但表达受限且需要预训练。

Method: 引入生成场理论解释StyleGAN的层次特征合成，并提出基于通道风格潜在空间S的新编辑流程，利用CNN的固有结构特征实现解耦控制。

Result: 新方法在特征合成时实现了更解耦的控制，避免了预训练需求，提升了编辑灵活性。

Conclusion: 生成场理论和通道风格潜在空间S为StyleGAN的特征控制提供了新思路，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: StyleGAN has demonstrated the ability of GANs to synthesize highly-realistic
faces of imaginary people from random noise. One limitation of GAN-based image
generation is the difficulty of controlling the features of the generated
image, due to the strong entanglement of the low-dimensional latent space.
Previous work that aimed to control StyleGAN with image or text prompts
modulated sampling in W latent space, which is more expressive than Z latent
space. However, W space still has restricted expressivity since it does not
control the feature synthesis directly; also the feature embedding in W space
requires a pre-training process to reconstruct the style signal, limiting its
application. This paper introduces the concept of "generative fields" to
explain the hierarchical feature synthesis in StyleGAN, inspired by the
receptive fields of convolution neural networks (CNNs). Additionally, we
propose a new image editing pipeline for StyleGAN using generative field theory
and the channel-wise style latent space S, utilizing the intrinsic structural
feature of CNNs to achieve disentangled control of feature synthesis at
synthesis time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为每种退化类型设计专用模型，成本高且复杂。现有方法缺乏对退化信息的细粒度建模，且难以平衡多任务冲突。

Method: 结合Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model（DP-SSM）和High-Frequency Enhancement Block（HEB），实现细粒度建模和高频信息补充。

Result: 在包含七种退化类型的混合数据集上，DPMambaIR取得了最佳性能（PSNR 27.69dB，SSIM 0.893）。

Conclusion: DPMambaIR作为一体化图像修复的统一解决方案，展现了其潜力和优越性。

Abstract: All-in-One image restoration aims to address multiple image degradation
problems using a single model, significantly reducing training costs and
deployment complexity compared to traditional methods that design dedicated
models for each degradation type. Existing approaches typically rely on
Degradation-specific models or coarse-grained degradation prompts to guide
image restoration. However, they lack fine-grained modeling of degradation
information and face limitations in balancing multi-task conflicts. To overcome
these limitations, we propose DPMambaIR, a novel All-in-One image restoration
framework. By integrating a Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM)
and a High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB), DPMambaIR enables fine-grained
modeling of complex degradation information and efficient global integration,
while mitigating the loss of high-frequency details caused by task competition.
Specifically, the DP-SSM utilizes a pre-trained degradation extractor to
capture fine-grained degradation features and dynamically incorporates them
into the state space modeling process, enhancing the model's adaptability to
diverse degradation types. Concurrently, the HEB supplements high-frequency
information, effectively addressing the loss of critical details, such as edges
and textures, in multi-task image restoration scenarios. Extensive experiments
on a mixed dataset containing seven degradation types show that DPMambaIR
achieves the best performance, with 27.69dB and 0.893 in PSNR and SSIM,
respectively. These results highlight the potential and superiority of
DPMambaIR as a unified solution for All-in-One image restoration.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) on smartglasses has various use cases,
including health/fitness tracking and input for context-aware AI assistants.
However, current approaches for egocentric activity recognition suffer from low
performance or are resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce a resource
(memory, compute, power, sample) efficient machine learning algorithm,
EgoCHARM, for recognizing both high level and low level activities using a
single egocentric (head-mounted) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Our
hierarchical algorithm employs a semi-supervised learning strategy, requiring
primarily high level activity labels for training, to learn generalizable low
level motion embeddings that can be effectively utilized for low level activity
recognition. We evaluate our method on 9 high level and 3 low level activities
achieving 0.826 and 0.855 F1 scores on high level and low level activity
recognition respectively, with just 63k high level and 22k low level model
parameters, allowing the low level encoder to be deployed directly on current
IMU chips with compute. Lastly, we present results and insights from a
sensitivity analysis and highlight the opportunities and limitations of
activity recognition using egocentric IMUs.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid
development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as
GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing
capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a
vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant
advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large
gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in
this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called
Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source
models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the
Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing
instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a
diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we
build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For
evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world
user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that
Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin
and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making
significant contributions to the field of image editing.

Abstract: Annotating camera poses on dynamic Internet videos at scale is critical for
advancing fields like realistic video generation and simulation. However,
collecting such a dataset is difficult, as most Internet videos are unsuitable

significant challenges even for state-of-theart methods. In this paper, we
introduce DynPose-100K, a large-scale dataset of dynamic Internet videos
annotated with camera poses. Our collection pipeline addresses filtering using
a carefully combined set of task-specific and generalist models. For pose
estimation, we combine the latest techniques of point tracking, dynamic
masking, and structure-from-motion to achieve improvements over the
state-of-the-art approaches. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that
DynPose-100K is both large-scale and diverse across several key attributes,

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Token-Shuffle的新方法，通过减少Transformer中的图像标记数量，解决了自回归模型在图像合成中的效率问题，并实现了2048x2048分辨率的高质量图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像合成中因需要大量图像标记而效率低下，限制了训练、推理效率和图像分辨率。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Token-Shuffle方法，通过合并局部标记（token-shuffle）和恢复空间排列（token-unshuffle）来减少标记数量，同时结合文本提示联合训练。

Result: 在GenAI-benchmark中，2.7B模型在困难提示下得分0.77，优于自回归模型LlamaGen（0.18）和扩散模型LDM（0.15），并支持2048x2048高分辨率生成。

Conclusion: Token-Shuffle为多模态大语言模型中的高效高分辨率图像生成提供了基础设计，展现了显著的生成能力。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, long dominant in language generation, are
increasingly applied to image synthesis but are often considered less
competitive than Diffusion-based models. A primary limitation is the
substantial number of image tokens required for AR models, which constrains
both training and inference efficiency, as well as image resolution. To address
this, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the
number of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional
redundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
where low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to
high-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key
operations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel
dimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which
untangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial
arrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy
requires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support
extremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction
way while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we
push the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048
with gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model
achieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen
by 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human
evaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of
text-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance. We hope that Token-Shuffle
can serve as a foundational design for efficient high-resolution image
generation within MLLMs.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的方法LiDPM，用于直接在户外场景的激光雷达点云上完成场景补全，避免了局部扩散过程的近似问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在户外场景中直接训练扩散模型生成激光雷达点云的细粒度细节的挑战，填补了局部扩散与全局扩散模型之间的空白。

Method: 采用原始的DDPM（去噪扩散概率模型）方法，通过选择合适的起始点，避免了局部扩散过程中的近似问题。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上展示了更好的场景补全效果。

Conclusion: LiDPM方法证明了原始DDPM在场景级别任务中的有效性，无需依赖局部扩散的近似处理。

Abstract: Training diffusion models that work directly on lidar points at the scale of
outdoor scenes is challenging due to the difficulty of generating fine-grained
details from white noise over a broad field of view. The latest works
addressing scene completion with diffusion models tackle this problem by
reformulating the original DDPM as a local diffusion process. It contrasts with
the common practice of operating at the level of objects, where vanilla DDPMs
are currently used. In this work, we close the gap between these two lines of
work. We identify approximations in the local diffusion formulation, show that
they are not required to operate at the scene level, and that a vanilla DDPM
with a well-chosen starting point is enough for completion. Finally, we
demonstrate that our method, LiDPM, leads to better results in scene completion
on SemanticKITTI. The project page is https://astra-vision.github.io/LiDPM .

TLDR: AdjointDiffusion是一种物理引导的框架，将伴随灵敏度梯度融入扩散模型的采样过程，显著减少了仿真需求，并提高了设计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的光子器件设计方法（如全局优化或深度学习）需要大量仿真和复杂后处理，AdjointDiffusion旨在克服这些限制。

Method: 通过训练扩散网络生成二进制掩模，并在推理阶段注入伴随梯度，引导生成高优值解。

Result: 在波导和CMOS图像传感器设计中，AdjointDiffusion在效率和可制造性上优于现有非线性优化器，且仿真需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: AdjointDiffusion为下一代光子器件设计提供了高效、仿真需求低且制造友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Designing free-form photonic devices is fundamentally challenging due to the
vast number of possible geometries and the complex requirements of fabrication
constraints. Traditional inverse-design approaches--whether driven by human
intuition, global optimization, or adjoint-based gradient methods--often
involve intricate binarization and filtering steps, while recent deep learning
strategies demand prohibitively large numbers of simulations (10^5 to 10^6). To
overcome these limitations, we present AdjointDiffusion, a physics-guided
framework that integrates adjoint sensitivity gradients into the sampling
process of diffusion models. AdjointDiffusion begins by training a diffusion
network on a synthetic, fabrication-aware dataset of binary masks. During
inference, we compute the adjoint gradient of a candidate structure and inject
this physics-based guidance at each denoising step, steering the generative
process toward high figure-of-merit (FoM) solutions without additional
post-processing. We demonstrate our method on two canonical photonic design
problems--a bent waveguide and a CMOS image sensor color router--and show that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers (such
as MMA and SLSQP) in both efficiency and manufacturability, while using orders
of magnitude fewer simulations (approximately 2 x 10^2) than pure deep learning
approaches (approximately 10^5 to 10^6). By eliminating complex binarization
schedules and minimizing simulation overhead, AdjointDiffusion offers a
streamlined, simulation-efficient, and fabrication-aware pipeline for
next-generation photonic device design. Our open-source implementation is
available at https://github.com/dongjin-seo2020/AdjointDiffusion.

modeling, highlighting its potential for advancement in structural biology.

Abstract: Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), a member of the Class A G protein-coupled
receptor superfamily, plays an important role in modulating dopaminergic
neuronal activity and eliciting opioid-independent analgesia. Recent studies
suggest that promoting \{beta}-arrestin-biased signaling in NTSR1 may diminish
drugs of abuse, such as psychostimulants, thereby offering a potential avenue
for treating human addiction-related disorders. In this study, we utilized a
novel computational and experimental approach that combined nudged elastic
band-based molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state models, temporal
communication network analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and conformational
biosensors, to explore the intricate mechanisms underlying NTSR1 activation and
biased signaling. Our study reveals a dynamic stepwise transition mechanism and
activated transmission network associated with NTSR1 activation. It also yields
valuable insights into the complex interplay between the unique polar network,
non-conserved ion locks, and aromatic clusters in NTSR1 signaling. Moreover, we
identified a cryptic allosteric site located in the intracellular region of the
receptor that exists in an intermediate state within the activation pathway.
Collectively, these findings contribute to a more profound understanding of
NTSR1 activation and biased signaling at the atomic level, thereby providing a
potential strategy for the development of NTSR1 allosteric modulators in the
realm of G protein-coupled receptor biology, biophysics, and medicine.

Abstract: Contraction metrics are crucial in control theory because they provide a
powerful framework for analyzing stability, robustness, and convergence of
various dynamical systems. However, identifying these metrics for complex
nonlinear systems remains an open challenge due to the lack of scalable and
effective tools. This paper explores the approach of learning verifiable
contraction metrics parametrized as neural networks (NNs) for discrete-time
nonlinear dynamical systems. While prior works on formal verification of
contraction metrics for general nonlinear systems have focused on convex
optimization methods (e.g. linear matrix inequalities, etc) under the
assumption of continuously differentiable dynamics, the growing prevalence of
NN-based controllers, often utilizing ReLU activations, introduces challenges
due to the non-smooth nature of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. To bridge
this gap, we establish a new sufficient condition for establishing formal
neural contraction metrics for general discrete-time nonlinear systems assuming
only the continuity of the dynamics. We show that from a computational
perspective, our sufficient condition can be efficiently verified using the
state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN, which scales
up non-convex neural network verification via novel integration of symbolic
linear bound propagation and branch-and-bound. Built upon our analysis tool, we
further develop a learning method for synthesizing neural contraction metrics
from sampled data. Finally, our approach is validated through the successful
synthesis and verification of NN contraction metrics for various nonlinear
examples.

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了MLLMs的视听能力，指出了改进方向并为未来研究提供了指导。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved great
success in processing and understanding information from diverse modalities
(e.g., text, audio, and visual signals). Despite their growing popularity,
there remains a lack of comprehensive evaluation measuring the audio-visual
capabilities of these models, especially in diverse scenarios (e.g.,
distribution shifts and adversarial attacks). In this paper, we present a
multifaceted evaluation of the audio-visual capability of MLLMs, focusing on
four key dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, generalizability, and
robustness. Through extensive experiments, we find that MLLMs exhibit strong
zero-shot and few-shot generalization abilities, enabling them to achieve great
performance with limited data. However, their success relies heavily on the
vision modality, which impairs performance when visual input is corrupted or
missing. Additionally, while MLLMs are susceptible to adversarial samples, they
demonstrate greater robustness compared to traditional models. The experimental
results and our findings provide insights into the audio-visual capabilities of
MLLMs, highlighting areas for improvement and offering guidance for future
research.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning involves approximating an unknown functional
relationship from a limited dataset of features and corresponding labels. The
classical approach to feature-based machine learning typically relies on
applying linear regression to standardized features, without considering their
physical meaning. This may limit model explainability, particularly in
scientific applications. This study proposes a physics-informed approach to
feature-based machine learning that constructs non-linear feature maps informed
by physical laws and dimensional analysis. These maps enhance model
interpretability and, when physical laws are unknown, allow for the
identification of relevant mechanisms through feature ranking. The method aims
to improve both predictive performance in regression tasks and classification
skill scores by integrating domain knowledge into the learning process, while
also enabling the potential discovery of new physical equations within the
context of explainable machine learning.

Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation is critical in medical
research. It provides insights into how treatment effects vary among
individuals, which can provide statistical evidence for precision medicine.
While most existing methods focus on binary treatment situations, real-world
applications often involve multiple interventions. However, current HTE
estimation methods are primarily designed for binary comparisons and often rely
on black-box models, which limit their applicability and interpretability in
multi-arm settings. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable
machine learning framework for HTE estimation in multi-arm trials. Our method
employs a rule-based ensemble approach consisting of rule generation, rule
ensemble, and HTE estimation, ensuring both predictive accuracy and
interpretability. Through extensive simulation studies and real data
applications, the performance of our method was evaluated against
state-of-the-art multi-arm HTE estimation approaches. The results indicate that
our approach achieved lower bias and higher estimation accuracy compared with
those of existing methods. Furthermore, the interpretability of our framework
allows clearer insights into how covariates influence treatment effects,
facilitating clinical decision making. By bridging the gap between accuracy and
interpretability, our study contributes a valuable tool for multi-arm HTE
estimation, supporting precision medicine.

Method: 提出EnVAE框架，采用确定性解码器，利用能量分数（一种适当的评分规则）构建重构损失，无需显式参数化密度函数。为提升计算效率，进一步提出FEnVAE，基于解码器的局部平滑性和潜在变量后验分布的锐度，设计高效的单样本训练目标。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，EnVAE在重构和生成质量上优于基于似然的基线方法。

Conclusion: EnVAE为生成建模提供了一种通用、可扩展且统计上合理的无似然分布学习替代方案。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) typically rely on a probabilistic decoder
with a predefined likelihood, most commonly an isotropic Gaussian, to model the
data conditional on latent variables. While convenient for optimization, this
choice often leads to likelihood misspecification, resulting in blurry
reconstructions and poor data fidelity, especially for high-dimensional data
such as images. In this work, we propose \textit{EnVAE}, a novel
likelihood-free generative framework that has a deterministic decoder and
employs the energy score -- a proper scoring rule -- to build the
reconstruction loss. This enables likelihood-free inference without requiring
explicit parametric density functions. To address the computational
inefficiency of the energy score, we introduce a fast variant, \textit{FEnVAE},
based on the local smoothness of the decoder and the sharpness of the posterior
distribution of latent variables. This yields an efficient single-sample
training objective that integrates seamlessly into existing VAE pipelines with
minimal overhead. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
\textit{EnVAE} achieves superior reconstruction and generation quality compared
to likelihood-based baselines. Our framework offers a general, scalable, and
statistically principled alternative for flexible and nonparametric
distribution learning in generative modeling.

Motivation: 现代机器学习中可靠的不确定性估计至关重要，但DGPs和DSPPs在分布偏移下的校准和鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 在回归（CASP数据集）和分类（ESR数据集）任务中评估DGPs和DSPPs，使用MAE、准确性、NLL和ECE等指标，并测试其在合成特征级分布偏移下的表现。

Result: DSPPs在分布内校准表现良好，但在分布偏移下表现脆弱；深度集成方法在性能和校准上均表现更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 深度GP方法在分布内校准表现良好，但其在分布偏移下的鲁棒性需谨慎评估；深度集成方法是一个鲁棒的基线。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial in modern machine learning. Deep
Gaussian Processes (DGPs) and Deep Sigma Point Processes (DSPPs) extend GPs
hierarchically, offering promising methods for uncertainty quantification
grounded in Bayesian principles. However, their empirical calibration and
robustness under distribution shift relative to baselines like Deep Ensembles
remain understudied. This work evaluates these models on regression (CASP
dataset) and classification (ESR dataset) tasks, assessing predictive
performance (MAE, Accu- racy), calibration using Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)
and Expected Calibration Error (ECE), alongside robustness under various
synthetic feature-level distribution shifts. Results indicate DSPPs provide
strong in-distribution calibration leveraging their sigma point approximations.
However, compared to Deep Ensembles, which demonstrated superior robustness in
both per- formance and calibration under the tested shifts, the GP-based
methods showed vulnerabilities, exhibiting particular sensitivity in the
observed metrics. Our findings underscore ensembles as a robust baseline,
suggesting that while deep GP methods offer good in-distribution calibration,
their practical robustness under distribution shift requires careful
evaluation. To facilitate reproducibility, we make our code available at

Conclusion: MVS框架及其R包为多视图数据提供了高效、可解释的解决方案，适用于高维和复杂数据场景。

Abstract: In biomedical science, a set of objects or persons can often be described by
multiple distinct sets of features obtained from different data sources or
modalities (called "multi-view data"). Classical machine learning methods
ignore the multi-view structure of such data, limiting model interpretability
and performance. The R package `mvs` provides methods that were designed
specifically for dealing with multi-view data, based on the multi-view stacking
(MVS) framework. MVS is a form of supervised (machine) learning used to train
multi-view classification or prediction models. MVS works by training a
learning algorithm on each view separately, estimating the predictive power of
each view-specific model through cross-validation, and then using another
learning algorithm to assign weights to the view-specific models based on their
estimated predictions. MVS is a form of ensemble learning, dividing the large
multi-view learning problem into smaller sub-problems. Most of these
sub-problems can be solved in parallel, making it computationally attractive.
Additionally, the number of features of the sub-problems is greatly reduced
compared with the full multi-view learning problem. This makes MVS especially
useful when the total number of features is larger than the number of
observations (i.e., high-dimensional data). MVS can still be applied even if
the sub-problems are themselves high-dimensional by adding suitable penalty
terms to the learning algorithms. Furthermore, MVS can be used to automatically
select the views which are most important for prediction. The R package `mvs`
makes fitting MVS models, including such penalty terms, easily and openly
accessible. `mvs` allows for the fitting of stacked models with any number of
levels, with different penalty terms, different outcome distributions, and
provides several options for missing data handling.

Abstract: Cloud computing environments demand dynamic and efficient resource management
to ensure optimal performance, reduced energy consumption, and adherence to
Service Level Agreements (SLAs). This paper presents a Genetic Algorithm
(GA)-based approach for Virtual Machine (VM) placement and consolidation,
aiming to minimize power usage while maintaining QoS constraints. The proposed
method dynamically adjusts VM allocation based on real-time workload
variations, outperforming traditional heuristics such as First Fit Decreasing
(FFD) and Best Fit Decreasing (BFD). Experimental results show notable
reductions in energy consumption, VM migrations, SLA violation rates, and
execution time. A correlation heatmap further illustrates strong relationships
among these key performance indicators, confirming the effectiveness of our
approach in optimizing cloud resource utilization.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于量子自编码器（QAE）的多变量时间序列异常检测框架，适用于企业级SAP系统，性能与传统神经网络自编码器相当但参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAE方法仅适用于单变量时间序列，无法满足企业级多变量时间序列异常检测的需求。

Result: 实验表明，该QAE性能与神经网络自编码器相当，且参数更少，适用于企业级系统。

Conclusion: 提出的QAE框架是企业级半监督异常检测的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) defines the task of identifying observations or events
that deviate from typical - or normal - patterns, a critical capability in IT
security for recognizing incidents such as system misconfigurations, malware
infections, or cyberattacks. In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud
systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate
time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of
quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional
latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One
approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method
with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior
applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data,
limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we
introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards
enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the
architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with
neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters.
We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and
show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for
semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRS的效率定义仅限于多项式时间量子计算机，限制了其在近量子计算机中的应用。

Method: 引入T-PRS，使用量子安全伪随机函数和伪随机函数构造，分析不同T(n)下的量子资源需求。

Result: 给出了T-PRS的构造方法，并量化了不同计算能力下所需的量子资源（相干性、纠缠和魔法）。

Conclusion: T-PRS为低资源模拟高资源提供了必要条件，计算能力越受限，资源差距越大。

Abstract: A pseudorandom quantum state (PRS) is an ensemble of quantum states
indistinguishable from Haar-random states to observers with efficient quantum
computers. It allows one to substitute the costly Haar-random state with
efficiently preparable PRS as a resource for cryptographic protocols, while
also finding applications in quantum learning theory, black hole physics,
many-body thermalization, quantum foundations, and quantum chaos. All existing
constructions of PRS equate the notion of efficiency to quantum computers which
runtime is bounded by a polynomial in its input size. In this work, we relax
the notion of efficiency for PRS with respect to observers with near-term
quantum computers implementing algorithms with runtime that scales slower than
polynomial-time. We introduce the $\mathbf{T}$-PRS which is indistinguishable
to quantum algorithms with runtime $\mathbf{T}(n)$ that grows slower than
polynomials in the input size $n$. We give a set of reasonable conditions that
a $\mathbf{T}$-PRS must satisfy and give two constructions by using
quantum-secure pseudorandom functions and pseudorandom functions. For
$\mathbf{T}(n)$ being linearithmic, linear, polylogarithmic, and logarithmic
function, we characterize the amount of quantum resources a $\mathbf{T}$-PRS
must possess, particularly on its coherence, entanglement, and magic. Our
quantum resource characterization applies generally to any two state ensembles
that are indistinguishable to observers with computational power
$\mathbf{T}(n)$, giving a general necessary condition of whether a low-resource
ensemble can mimic a high-resource ensemble, forming a
$\mathbf{T}$-pseudoresource pair. We demonstate how the necessary amount of
resource decreases as the observer's computational power is more restricted,
giving a $\mathbf{T}$-pseudoresource pair with larger resource gap for more
computationally limited observers.

Motivation: 量子分类器易受对抗攻击，对抗训练是一种潜在解决方案，但缺乏对其泛化误差的理论分析。

Method: 通过理论分析建立了对抗训练量子分类器的泛化误差边界，并探讨了量子嵌入的影响。

Result: 泛化误差随训练样本量$m$以$1/\sqrt{m}$缩放；高维输入下对抗训练样本复杂度增加可忽略；量子态攻击下误差与嵌入的希尔伯特空间维度相关。

Conclusion: 对抗训练能有效提升量子分类器的鲁棒性，且在高维输入下代价较低，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Quantum classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate
their input classical or quantum data. A promising countermeasure is
adversarial training, where quantum classifiers are trained by using an
attack-aware, adversarial loss function. This work establishes novel bounds on
the generalization error of adversarially trained quantum classifiers when
tested in the presence of perturbation-constrained adversaries. The bounds
quantify the excess generalization error incurred to ensure robustness to
adversarial attacks as scaling with the training sample size $m$ as
$1/\sqrt{m}$, while yielding insights into the impact of the quantum embedding.
For quantum binary classifiers employing \textit{rotation embedding}, we find
that, in the presence of adversarial attacks on classical inputs $\mathbf{x}$,
the increase in sample complexity due to adversarial training over conventional
training vanishes in the limit of high dimensional inputs $\mathbf{x}$. In
contrast, when the adversary can directly attack the quantum state
$\rho(\mathbf{x})$ encoding the input $\mathbf{x}$, the excess generalization
error depends on the choice of embedding only through its Hilbert space
dimension. The results are also extended to multi-class classifiers. We
validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.

Main category: cs.CE

TLDR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的替代模型框架，用于快速预测粗糙表面接触的有效接触面积，解决了传统数值方法计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粗糙表面接触的有效接触面积对多物理现象（如磨损、密封、热或电传导）至关重要，但传统数值方法（如边界元法）计算成本高，限制了其在多查询场景中的应用。

Method: 使用多种机器学习算法训练预计算数据集，输入为载荷和粗糙度参数，输出为有效接触面积，并进行超参数优化以比较预测准确性和计算效率。

Result: 核岭回归器在准确性和效率之间表现出最佳平衡，高斯过程回归器适用于需要不确定性量化的场景。

Conclusion: 该替代模型框架在多查询任务中实用且高效，核岭回归器具有较好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The effective contact area in rough surface contact plays a critical role in
multi-physics phenomena such as wear, sealing, and thermal or electrical
conduction. Although accurate numerical methods, like the Boundary Element
Method (BEM), are available to compute this quantity, their high computational
cost limits their applicability in multi-query contexts, such as uncertainty
quantification, parameter identification, and multi-scale algorithms, where
many repeated evaluations are required. This study proposes a surrogate
modeling framework for predicting the effective contact area using
fast-to-evaluate data-driven techniques. Various machine learning algorithms
are trained on a precomputed dataset, where the inputs are the imposed load and
statistical roughness parameters, and the output is the corresponding effective
contact area. All models undergo hyperparameter optimization to enable fair
comparisons in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency,
evaluated using established quantitative metrics. Among the models, the Kernel
Ridge Regressor demonstrates the best trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency, achieving high predictive accuracy, low prediction time, and
minimal training overhead-making it a strong candidate for general-purpose
surrogate modeling. The Gaussian Process Regressor provides an attractive
alternative when uncertainty quantification is required, although it incurs
additional computational cost due to variance estimation. The generalization
capability of the Kernel Ridge model is validated on an unseen simulation
scenario, confirming its ability to transfer to new configurations. Database
generation constitutes the dominant cost in the surrogate modeling process.
Nevertheless, the approach proves practical and efficient for multi-query
tasks, even when accounting for this initial expense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成聚合物的发展受限于漫长的设计周期，现有工具未能解决其3D结构生成的挑战，尤其是结构的多样性和灵活性。

Method: polyGen利用分子编码捕获聚合物连接性，通过联合学习DFT优化的分子结构增强训练，尽管数据集有限（3855个结构）。

Result: polyGen能有效生成线性和复杂支化结构的多样构象，但对高原子数重复单元的性能下降。

Conclusion: polyGen是聚合物科学中原子级结构生成的范式转变，首次实现了对真实聚合物构象的预测，考虑了其结构灵活性。

Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the
energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development
still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics
tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face
significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures
that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative
algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small
molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we
introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to
generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat
unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer
connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855
DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized
molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar
chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark
our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse
conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its
performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given
these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level
structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for
predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for
their intrinsic structural flexibility.

Motivation: 传统全局优化方法在处理少量设计参数时有效，但在高维解空间和多物理约束下表现不佳，因此需要新方法。

Method: 开发并数值测试了基于强化学习的优化框架，应用于ASIC芯片的键合互连几何优化和HI中介层组件布局。

Result: 成功优化了ASIC芯片的键合互连几何和HI中介层组件布局，满足了热弹性和设计约束。

Conclusion: 强化学习为高维解空间和多物理约束下的微电子组件设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of reinforcement learning based
techniques for the design of microelectronic components under multiphysics
constraints. While traditional design approaches based on global optimization
approaches are effective when dealing with a small number of design parameters,
as the complexity of the solution space and of the constraints increases
different techniques are needed. This is an important reason that makes the
design and optimization of microelectronic components (characterized by large
solution space and multiphysics constraints) very challenging for traditional
methods. By taking as prototypical elements an application-specific integrated
circuit (ASIC) and a heterogeneously integrated (HI) interposer, we develop and
numerically test an optimization framework based on reinforcement learning
(RL). More specifically, we consider the optimization of the bonded
interconnect geometry for an ASIC chip as well as the placement of components
on a HI interposer while satisfying thermoelastic and design constraints. This
placement problem is particularly interesting because it features a
high-dimensional solution space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著性图是解释神经网络分类的常用方法，但如何评估其效果仍是一个开放性问题。研究旨在比较不同评估方法对显著性图的评价是否一致。

Method: 通过一项涉及166名被试的对比研究，测试了三种显著性图方法在主观用户评价、客观用户评价和数学指标上的表现。

Result: 研究发现评估结果不一致：主观评价中无显著差异，Grad-CAM在提升用户能力上表现最佳，而Guided Backpropagation在数学指标上最优。部分数学指标与用户理解相关，但关系反直觉。

Conclusion: 研究强调了用户研究和数学指标在可解释AI评估中的互补性，并指出当前评估方法的不一致性。

Abstract: Saliency maps are a popular approach for explaining classifications of
(convolutional) neural networks. However, it remains an open question as to how
best to evaluate salience maps, with three families of evaluation methods
commonly being used: subjective user measures, objective user measures, and
mathematical metrics. We examine three of the most popular saliency map
approaches (viz., LIME, Grad-CAM, and Guided Backpropagation) in a between
subject study (N=166) across these families of evaluation methods. We test 1)
for subjective measures, if the maps differ with respect to user trust and
satisfaction; 2) for objective measures, if the maps increase users' abilities
and thus understanding of a model; 3) for mathematical metrics, which map
achieves the best ratings across metrics; and 4) whether the mathematical
metrics can be associated with objective user measures. To our knowledge, our
study is the first to compare several salience maps across all these evaluation
methods$-$with the finding that they do not agree in their assessment (i.e.,
there was no difference concerning trust and satisfaction, Grad-CAM improved
users' abilities best, and Guided Backpropagation had the most favorable
mathematical metrics). Additionally, we show that some mathematical metrics
were associated with user understanding, although this relationship was often
counterintuitive. We discuss these findings in light of general debates
concerning the complementary use of user studies and mathematical metrics in
the evaluation of explainable AI (XAI) approaches.

Motivation: 探究AI工具如何影响个体心理，尤其是自我物化和自尊，并关注性别差异。

Method: 两组样本使用不同版本的面部分析工具（批判性和中性），测量自我物化、自尊、情绪等指标。

Result: 高自我物化和低自尊与增强外貌行为相关，中性工具仍引发负面情绪，性别差异显著。

Conclusion: AI工具可能无意中强化社会偏见，需更负责任的设计，未来研究将关注训练数据的影响。

Abstract: AI-powered facial assessment tools are reshaping how individuals evaluate
appearance and internalize social judgments. This study examines the
psychological impact of such tools on self-objectification, self-esteem, and
emotional responses, with attention to gender differences. Two samples used
distinct versions of a facial analysis tool: one overtly critical (N=75; M=22.9
years), and another more neutral (N=51; M=19.9 years). Participants completed
validated self-objectification and self-esteem scales and custom items
measuring emotion, digital/physical appearance enhancement (DAE, PAEE), and
perceived social emotion (PSE). Results revealed consistent links between high
self-objectification, low self-esteem, and increased appearance enhancement
behaviors across both versions. Despite softer framing, the newer tool still
evoked negative emotional responses (U=1466.5, p=0.013), indicating implicit
feedback may reinforce appearance-related insecurities. Gender differences
emerged in DAE (p=0.025) and PSE (p<0.001), with females more prone to digital
enhancement and less likely to perceive emotional impact in others. These
findings reveal how AI tools may unintentionally reinforce and amplify existing
social biases and underscore the critical need for responsible AI design and
development. Future research will investigate how human ideologies embedded in
the training data of such tools shape their evaluative outputs, and how these,
in turn, influence user attitudes and decisions.

Motivation: 当前AV研究普遍忽视个体差异和情境多样性，导致沟通策略无法满足实际需求，阻碍AV的实际应用。

Method: 通过三项实证研究：1）极端驾驶环境中的沟通策略优化；2）错误沟通系统的后果分析；3）机器学习预测个人信任因素。

Result: 研究发现任务敏感、情境适应和个性化的沟通策略能提升驾驶表现、信任和信心。

Conclusion: AV系统需透明、适应性强且个性化，以满足不同需求和情境，并为未来人机交互研究提供指导。

Abstract: Unresolved questions about how autonomous vehicles (AVs) should meet the
informational needs of riders hinder real-world adoption. Complicating our
ability to satisfy rider needs is that different people, goals, and driving
contexts have different criteria for what constitutes interaction success.
Unfortunately, most human-AV research and design today treats all people and
situations uniformly. It is crucial to understand how an AV should communicate
to meet rider needs, and how communications should change when the human-AV
complex system changes. I argue that understanding the relationships between
different aspects of the human-AV system can help us build improved and
adaptable AV communications. I support this argument using three empirical
studies. First, I identify optimal communication strategies that enhance
driving performance, confidence, and trust for learning in extreme driving
environments. Findings highlight the need for task-sensitive,
modality-appropriate communications tuned to learner cognitive limits and
goals. Next, I highlight the consequences of deploying faulty communication
systems and demonstrate the need for context-sensitive communications. Third, I
use machine learning (ML) to illuminate personal factors predicting trust in
AVs, emphasizing the importance of tailoring designs to individual traits and
concerns. Together, this dissertation supports the necessity of transparent,
adaptable, and personalized AV systems that cater to individual needs, goals,
and contextual demands. By considering the complex system within which human-AV
interactions occur, we can deliver valuable insights for designers,
researchers, and policymakers. This dissertation also provides a concrete
domain to study theories of human-machine joint action and situational
awareness, and can be used to guide future human-AI interaction research.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的导航方法是一种舒适、自然且无需手持设备的替代方案，尤其适合提升虚拟现实的可访问性。

Abstract: Locomotion plays a crucial role in shaping the user experience within virtual
reality environments. In particular, hands-free locomotion offers a valuable
alternative by supporting accessibility and freeing users from reliance on
handheld controllers. To this end, traditional speech-based methods often
depend on rigid command sets, limiting the naturalness and flexibility of
interaction. In this study, we propose a novel locomotion technique powered by
large language models (LLMs), which allows users to navigate virtual
environments using natural language with contextual awareness. We evaluate
three locomotion methods: controller-based teleportation, voice-based steering,
and our language model-driven approach. Our evaluation measures include
eye-tracking data analysis, including explainable machine learning through SHAP
analysis as well as standardized questionnaires for usability, presence,
cybersickness, and cognitive load to examine user attention and engagement. Our
findings indicate that the LLM-driven locomotion possesses comparable
usability, presence, and cybersickness scores to established methods like
teleportation, demonstrating its novel potential as a comfortable, natural
language-based, hands-free alternative. In addition, it enhances user attention
within the virtual environment, suggesting greater engagement. Complementary to
these findings, SHAP analysis revealed that fixation, saccade, and
pupil-related features vary across techniques, indicating distinct patterns of
visual attention and cognitive processing. Overall, we state that our method
can facilitate hands-free locomotion in virtual spaces, especially in
supporting accessibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CSI定位系统多在小型受控环境中开发，缺乏泛化能力，且未充分利用未标记数据和CSI异质性。

Method: 采用图结构建模异质CSI数据，设计预训练任务利用未标记数据，并引入置信度感知微调策略。

Result: 在覆盖25,600平方米的实验中，中位定位误差为2.17米，楼层准确率达99.49%，MAE降低18.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架在大规模ISAC部署中显著提升了定位精度，验证了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, Channel State Information (CSI), recognized for its
fine-grained spatial characteristics, has attracted increasing attention in
WiFi-based indoor localization. However, despite its potential, CSI-based
approaches have yet to achieve the same level of deployment scale and
commercialization as those based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).
A key limitation lies in the fact that most existing CSI-based systems are
developed and evaluated in controlled, small-scale environments, limiting their
generalizability. To bridge this gap, we explore the deployment of a
large-scale CSI-based localization system involving over 400 Access Points
(APs) in a real-world building under the Integrated Sensing and Communication
(ISAC) paradigm. We highlight two critical yet often overlooked factors: the
underutilization of unlabeled data and the inherent heterogeneity of CSI
measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI-based
learning framework for WiFi localization, tailored for large-scale ISAC
deployments on the server side. Specifically, we employ a novel graph-based
structure to model heterogeneous CSI data and reduce redundancy. We further
design a pretext pretraining task that incorporates spatial and temporal priors
to effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled CSI data. Complementarily, we
introduce a confidence-aware fine-tuning strategy to enhance the robustness of
localization results. In a leave-one-smartphone-out experiment spanning five
floors and 25, 600 m2, we achieve a median localization error of 2.17 meters
and a floor accuracy of 99.49%. This performance corresponds to an 18.7%
reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the best-performing
baseline.

"deep fake pornography." We identify a "malicious technical ecosystem" or
"MTE," comprising of open-source face-swapping models and nearly 200
"nudifying" software programs that allow non-technical users to create AIG-NCII
within minutes. Then, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) AI 100-4 report as a reflection of current synthetic content governance
methods, we show how the current landscape of practices fails to effectively
regulate the MTE for adult AIG-NCII, as well as flawed assumptions explaining
these gaps.

Abstract: The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and
opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the
potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various
tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises
concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions
and user privacy. This paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine
various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of
solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated
into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM
by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students'
questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more
personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by
using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based
on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and
inclusive learning experience.

TLDR: 论文提出了Robo-Troj，一种针对基于LLM的任务规划器的多触发后门攻击方法，旨在揭示其安全漏洞并推动安全机器人系统的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基于LLM的任务规划器的安全性问题，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 开发Robo-Troj，一种多触发后门攻击方法，并通过优化选择最有效的触发词。

Result: 成功展示了基于LLM的规划器在面对多触发后门攻击时的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 通过揭示漏洞，呼吁开发更安全的机器人系统。

Abstract: Robots need task planning methods to achieve goals that require more than
individual actions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance in task planning. LLMs can generate a step-by-step
solution using a description of actions and the goal. Despite the successes in
LLM-based task planning, there is limited research studying the security
aspects of those systems. In this paper, we develop Robo-Troj, the first
multi-trigger backdoor attack for LLM-based task planners, which is the main
contribution of this work. As a multi-trigger attack, Robo-Troj is trained to
accommodate the diversity of robot application domains. For instance, one can
use unique trigger words, e.g., "herical", to activate a specific malicious
behavior, e.g., cutting hand on a kitchen robot. In addition, we develop an
optimization method for selecting the trigger words that are most effective.
Through demonstrating the vulnerability of LLM-based planners, we aim to
promote the development of secured robot systems.

TLDR: 提出了一种新方法，通过同时估计下一视点和姿态，提高了零售机器人对简单形状产品的姿态估计成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经网络的RGBD相机方法在纹理和形状特征少时精度下降，而传统数学模型方法难以估计有效的下一视点。

Method: 开发了一种新的姿态估计神经网络，同时估计下一视点，利用姿态估计与下一视点估计的关系。

Result: 实验结果显示，新方法将姿态估计成功率提高到77.3%，比数学模型方法高7.4个百分点，机器人成功展示84.2%的产品。

Conclusion: 新方法通过结合姿态和下一视点估计，显著提高了简单形状产品的姿态估计和展示效果。

Abstract: We have developed a new method to estimate a Next Viewpoint (NV) which is
effective for pose estimation of simple-shaped products for product display
robots in retail stores. Pose estimation methods using Neural Networks (NN)
based on an RGBD camera are highly accurate, but their accuracy significantly
decreases when the camera acquires few texture and shape features at a current
view point. However, it is difficult for previous mathematical model-based
methods to estimate effective NV which is because the simple shaped objects
have few shape features. Therefore, we focus on the relationship between the
pose estimation and NV estimation. When the pose estimation is more accurate,
the NV estimation is more accurate. Therefore, we develop a new pose estimation
NN that estimates NV simultaneously. Experimental results showed that our NV
estimation realized a pose estimation success rate 77.3\%, which was 7.4pt
higher than the mathematical model-based NV calculation did. Moreover, we
verified that the robot using our method displayed 84.2\% of products.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于BIM的漂移校正方法，通过将现实环境中的平面与BIM中的平面对齐，优化SLAM与BIM之间的转换，显著减少了建筑监控中AR应用的漂移误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑工地环境复杂，传统跟踪方法因特征缺失和动态变化导致数字模型与现实世界对齐不准确。

Method: 利用BIM作为先验结构知识，通过优化技术计算SLAM与BIM坐标系间的转换，实现平面匹配和漂移校正。

Result: 实验表明，该方法平均减少52.24%的角度偏差和60.8%的距离误差。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了AR在建筑监控中的长期定位和可视化精度。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) applications for construction monitoring rely on
real-time environmental tracking to visualize architectural elements. However,
construction sites present significant challenges for traditional tracking
methods due to featureless surfaces, dynamic changes, and drift accumulation,
leading to misalignment between digital models and the physical world. This
paper proposes a BIM-aware drift correction method to address these challenges.
Instead of relying solely on SLAM-based localization, we align ``as-built"
detected planes from the real-world environment with ``as-planned"
architectural planes in BIM. Our method performs robust plane matching and
computes a transformation (TF) between SLAM (S) and BIM (B) origin frames using
optimization techniques, minimizing drift over time. By incorporating BIM as
prior structural knowledge, we can achieve improved long-term localization and
enhanced AR visualization accuracy in noisy construction environments. The
method is evaluated through real-world experiments, showing significant
reductions in drift-induced errors and optimized alignment consistency. On
average, our system achieves a reduction of 52.24% in angular deviations and a
reduction of 60.8% in the distance error of the matched walls compared to the
initial manual alignment by the user.

Abstract: Learning-based methods, such as imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement
learning (RL), can produce excel control policies over challenging agile robot
tasks, such as sports robot. However, no existing work has harmonized
learning-based policy with model-based methods to reduce training complexity
and ensure the safety and stability for agile badminton robot control. In this
paper, we introduce \ourmethod, a novel hybrid control system for agile
badminton robots. Specifically, we propose a model-based strategy for chassis
locomotion which provides a base for arm policy. We introduce a
physics-informed ``IL+RL'' training framework for learning-based arm policy. In
this train framework, a model-based strategy with privileged information is
used to guide arm policy training during both IL and RL phases. In addition, we
train the critic model during IL phase to alleviate the performance drop issue
when transitioning from IL to RL. We present results on our self-engineered
badminton robot, achieving 94.5% success rate against the serving machine and
90.7% success rate against human players. Our system can be easily generalized
to other agile mobile manipulation tasks such as agile catching and table
tennis. Our project website: https://dreamstarring.github.io/HAMLET/.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的数据驱动方法，用于从单张波前传感器图像中估计Fried参数（r0），适用于自适应光学系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流会降低地面望远镜的天文观测质量，自适应光学系统需要实时校正，而Fried参数是关键控制参数。

Method: 采用计算机视觉中的机器学习方法，通过COMPASS AO仿真工具评估Shack-Hartmann和金字塔波前传感器。

Result: 方法在开环和闭环AO配置中均能准确估计r0，单次推断时间为0.83ms，适合实时控制。

Conclusion: 该方法为实时仪器控制提供了一种经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades the quality of astronomical observations in
ground-based telescopes, leading to distorted and blurry images. Adaptive
Optics (AO) systems are designed to counteract these effects, using atmospheric
measurements captured by a wavefront sensor to make real-time corrections to
the incoming wavefront. The Fried parameter, r0, characterises the strength of
atmospheric turbulence and is an essential control parameter for optimising the
performance of AO systems and more recently sky profiling for Free Space
Optical (FSO) communication channels. In this paper, we develop a novel
data-driven approach, adapting machine learning methods from computer vision
for Fried parameter estimation from a single Shack-Hartmann or pyramid
wavefront sensor image. Using these data-driven methods, we present a detailed
simulation-based evaluation of our approach using the open-source COMPASS AO
simulation tool to evaluate both the Shack-Hartmann and pyramid wavefront
sensors. Our evaluation is over a range of guide star magnitudes, and realistic
noise, atmospheric and instrument conditions. Remarkably, we are able to
develop a single network-based estimator that is accurate in both open and
closed-loop AO configurations. Our method accurately estimates the Fried
parameter from a single WFS image directly from AO telemetry to a few
millimetres. Our approach is suitable for real time control, exhibiting 0.83ms
r0 inference times on retail NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU hardware, and thereby
demonstrating a compelling economic solution for use in real-time instrument
control.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced AI
capabilities but pose considerable challenges for deployment on edge devices
due to high computational demands, memory bandwidth constraints, and energy
consumption. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting an efficient
framework for deploying the Qwen2.5-0.5B model on the Xilinx Kria KV260 edge
platform, a heterogeneous system integrating an ARM Cortex-A53 CPU with
reconfigurable FPGA logic. Leveraging Activation-aware Weight Quantization
(AWQ) with FPGA-accelerated execution pipelines, the proposed approach enhances
both model compression rate and system throughput. Additionally, we propose a
hybrid execution strategy that intelligently offloads compute-intensive
operations to the FPGA while utilizing the CPU for lighter tasks, effectively
balancing the computational workload and maximizing overall performance. Our
framework achieves a model compression rate of 55.08% compared to the original
model and produces output at a rate of 5.1 tokens per second, outperforming the
baseline performance of 2.8 tokens per second.

Motivation: LLM处理长文本时面临GPU内存容量与带宽的权衡问题，解码阶段的多头注意力（MHA）成为关键瓶颈。

Method: L3系统通过硬件重新设计、通信优化和自适应调度器，整合DIMM-PIM与GPU，提升LLM推理效率。

Result: 实验表明，L3比现有HBM-PIM方案快6.1倍，并显著提升批量处理能力。

Conclusion: L3通过创新设计有效解决了LLM解码阶段的内存瓶颈，为高性能LLM推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly require processing long text
sequences, but GPU memory limitations force difficult trade-offs between memory
capacity and bandwidth. While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its
capacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves
capacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the
critical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention
(MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and
high bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this
operation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM)
architectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.
  Based on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software
co-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three
innovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and
computational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference
utilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data
transfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler
coordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices.
Evaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\times$ speedup
over state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch
sizes.

Abstract: Foundation models, as a mainstream technology in artificial intelligence,
have demonstrated immense potential across various domains in recent years,
particularly in handling complex tasks and multimodal data. In the field of
geophysics, although the application of foundation models is gradually
expanding, there is currently a lack of comprehensive reviews discussing the
full workflow of integrating foundation models with geophysical data. To
address this gap, this paper presents a complete framework that systematically
explores the entire process of developing foundation models in conjunction with
geophysical data. From data collection and preprocessing to model architecture
selection, pre-training strategies, and model deployment, we provide a detailed
analysis of the key techniques and methodologies at each stage. In particular,
considering the diversity, complexity, and physical consistency constraints of
geophysical data, we discuss targeted solutions to address these challenges.
Furthermore, we discuss how to leverage the transfer learning capabilities of
foundation models to reduce reliance on labeled data, enhance computational
efficiency, and incorporate physical constraints into model training, thereby
improving physical consistency and interpretability. Through a comprehensive
summary and analysis of the current technological landscape, this paper not
only fills the gap in the geophysics domain regarding a full-process review of
foundation models but also offers valuable practical guidance for their
application in geophysical data analysis, driving innovation and advancement in
the field.

PR-AUC of 0.83 on unseen satellite imagery. Dargana can identify fine
structures like hedgerows and coppice below the training sample limit, and can
track temporal changes to canopy cover such as new woodland establishment. Our
results demonstrate how pre-trained Large Observation Models like EarthPT can
be specialised for granular, dynamic land cover monitoring from space,
providing a valuable, scalable tool for natural capital management and

TLDR: HydroStartML是一种机器学习模拟器，用于快速预测流域的初始地下水位深度（DTWT），显著加速水文模型的启动过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的水文模型启动过程需要大量计算资源，尤其是当初始DTWT配置远离稳态时。为了解决这一问题，开发了HydroStartML。

Method: 利用机器学习训练美国本土的稳态DTWT数据，基于传导性和地表坡度等数据预测流域的初始DTWT配置。

Result: HydroStartML的预测显著加速了模型启动过程，尤其是在DTWT较深的区域，且对未见过的地形配置也表现良好。

Conclusion: HydroStartML为混合机器学习与传统模拟的方法提供了可能，提高了水文预测的效率和准确性，有助于水资源管理和环境研究。

Abstract: Finding the initial depth-to-water table (DTWT) configuration of a catchment
is a critical challenge when simulating the hydrological cycle with integrated
models, significantly impacting simulation outcomes. Traditionally, this
involves iterative spin-up computations, where the model runs under constant
atmospheric settings until steady-state is achieved. These so-called model
spin-ups are computationally expensive, often requiring many years of simulated
time, particularly when the initial DTWT configuration is far from steady
state.
  To accelerate the model spin-up process we developed HydroStartML, a machine
learning emulator trained on steady-state DTWT configurations across the
contiguous United States. HydroStartML predicts, based on available data like
conductivity and surface slopes, a DTWT configuration of the respective
watershed, which can be used as an initial DTWT.
  Our results show that initializing spin-up computations with HydroStartML
predictions leads to faster convergence than with other initial configurations
like spatially constant DTWTs. The emulator accurately predicts configurations
close to steady state, even for terrain configurations not seen in training,
and allows especially significant reductions in computational spin-up effort in
regions with deep DTWTs. This work opens the door for hybrid approaches that
blend machine learning and traditional simulation, enhancing predictive
accuracy and efficiency in hydrology for improving water resource management
and understanding complex environmental interactions.

Abstract: When a plasma disrupts in a tokamak, significant heat and electromagnetic
loads are deposited onto the surrounding device components. These forces scale
with plasma current and magnetic field strength, making disruptions one of the
key challenges for future devices. Unfortunately, disruptions are not fully
understood, with many different underlying causes that are difficult to
anticipate. Data-driven models have shown success in predicting them, but they
only provide limited interpretability. On the other hand, large-scale
statistical analyses have been a great asset to understanding disruptive
patterns. In this paper, we leverage data-driven methods to find an
interpretable representation of the plasma state for disruption
characterization. Specifically, we use a latent variable model to represent
diagnostic measurements as a low-dimensional, latent representation. We build
upon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, and extend it for (1)
continuous projections of plasma trajectories; (2) a multimodal structure to
separate operating regimes; and (3) separation with respect to disruptive
regimes. Subsequently, we can identify continuous indicators for the disruption
rate and the disruptivity based on statistical properties of measurement data.
The proposed method is demonstrated using a dataset of approximately 1600 TCV
discharges, selecting for flat-top disruptions or regular terminations. We
evaluate the method with respect to (1) the identified disruption risk and its
correlation with other plasma properties; (2) the ability to distinguish
different types of disruptions; and (3) downstream analyses. For the latter, we
conduct a demonstrative study on identifying parameters connected to
disruptions using counterfactual-like analysis. Overall, the method can
adequately identify distinct operating regimes characterized by varying
proximity to disruptions in an interpretable manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化HRTF能提升定位精度，但测量过程耗时且需无噪环境，限制了其应用。

Method: 结合HRTF Denoisy U-Net去噪和AE-GAN上采样，仅需三个测量点。

Result: LSD误差5.41 dB，余弦相似度损失0.0070，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了HRTF测量的时间和环境限制，为虚拟沉浸音频提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The demand for realistic virtual immersive audio continues to grow, with
Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) playing a key role. HRTFs capture how
sound reaches our ears, reflecting unique anatomical features and enhancing
spatial perception. It has been shown that personalized HRTFs improve
localization accuracy, but their measurement remains time-consuming and
requires a noise-free environment. Although machine learning has been shown to
reduce the required measurement points and, thus, the measurement time, a
controlled environment is still necessary. This paper proposes a method to
address this constraint by presenting a novel technique that can upsample
sparse, noisy HRTF measurements. The proposed approach combines an HRTF Denoisy
U-Net for denoising and an Autoencoding Generative Adversarial Network (AE-GAN)
for upsampling from three measurement points. The proposed method achieves a
log-spectral distortion (LSD) error of 5.41 dB and a cosine similarity loss of
0.0070, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in HRTF upsampling.

Conclusion: ClearSep为自然音频场景中的声音分离提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Universal sound separation aims to extract clean audio tracks corresponding
to distinct events from mixed audio, which is critical for artificial auditory
perception. However, current methods heavily rely on artificially mixed audio
for training, which limits their ability to generalize to naturally mixed audio
collected in real-world environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose
ClearSep, an innovative framework that employs a data engine to decompose
complex naturally mixed audio into multiple independent tracks, thereby
allowing effective sound separation in real-world scenarios. We introduce two
remix-based evaluation metrics to quantitatively assess separation quality and
use these metrics as thresholds to iteratively apply the data engine alongside
model training, progressively optimizing separation performance. In addition,
we propose a series of training strategies tailored to these separated
independent tracks to make the best use of them. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ClearSep achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
sound separation tasks, highlighting its potential for advancing sound
separation in natural audio scenarios. For more examples and detailed results,

Method: 采用三种编码方式和四个问题实例，比较不同进化算法的表现，结合局部搜索和限制空间的方法。

Result: 遗传编程表现优于其他算法，但未达最优；遗传算法在限制条件下生成9变量非线性度为241的函数。

Conclusion: 进化算法在特定条件下可有效生成高非线性度布尔函数，但仍有改进空间。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of evolving Boolean functions of odd sizes
with high nonlinearity, a property of cryptographic relevance. Despite its
simple formulation, this problem turns out to be remarkably difficult. We
perform a systematic evaluation by considering three solution encodings and
four problem instances, analyzing how well different types of evolutionary
algorithms behave in finding a maximally nonlinear Boolean function. Our
results show that genetic programming generally outperforms other evolutionary
algorithms, although it falls short of the best-known results achieved by
ad-hoc heuristics. Interestingly, by adding local search and restricting the
space to rotation symmetric Boolean functions, we show that a genetic algorithm
with the bitstring encoding manages to evolve a $9$-variable Boolean function
with nonlinearity 241.

*Tran Thuy Nga Truong,Jooyong Kim*

Main category: cs.NE

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为双个体遗传算法（Dual-Individual GA）的改进遗传算法，用于优化神经网络的二分类任务（如猫与非猫分类）。该方法通过Leader和Follower两个参数集进行交叉，分别专注于开发和探索，实现了自适应的网络结构优化，并在实验中表现出优于传统梯度方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度方法在神经网络优化中存在结构调参困难和收敛速度慢的问题，因此需要一种更高效的自适应优化方法。

Method: 提出双个体遗传算法，通过Leader（开发）和Follower（探索）两个参数集的交替操作，结合自适应的网络层维度机制，优化神经网络结构。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在三层网络上实现了99.04%的训练准确率和80%的测试准确率（成本=0.034），优于传统梯度方法（98%训练准确率，80%测试准确率，成本=0.092）。

Conclusion: 双个体遗传算法在神经网络优化中表现出高效性和有效性，尤其在自适应网络结构优化方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced Genetic Algorithm technique called
Dual-Individual Genetic Algorithm (Dual-Individual GA), which optimizes neural
networks for binary image classification tasks, such as cat vs. non-cat
classification. The proposed method employs only two individuals for crossover,
represented by two parameter sets: Leader and Follower. The Leader focuses on
exploitation, representing the primary optimal solution at even-indexed
positions (0, 2, 4, ...), while the Follower promotes exploration by preserving
diversity and avoiding premature convergence, operating at odd-indexed
positions (1, 3, 5, ...). Leader and Follower are modeled as two phases or
roles. The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a self-adaptive
layer dimension mechanism that eliminates the need for manual tuning of layer
architectures; (2) generates two parameter sets, leader and follower parameter
sets, with 10 layer architecture configurations (5 for each set), ranked by
Pareto dominance and cost. post-optimization; and (3) demonstrated superior
performance compared to traditional gradient-based methods. Experimental
results show that the Dual-Individual GA achieves 99.04% training accuracy and
80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.034) on a three-layer network with architecture
[12288, 17, 4, 1], outperforming a gradient-based approach that achieves 98%
training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.092) on a four-layer
network with architecture [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1]. These findings highlight the
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing neural
networks.

Motivation: 传统SNN架构在序列建模中存在缺乏有效记忆机制、生物启发组件理论不足以及无法并行训练的问题。

Method: 系统分析了二元激活RNN型SNN序列模型中的重置操作和不应期机制，提出固定不应期SNN架构。

Result: 重新评估了生物机制的必要性，提供了新的理论解释，并提出了改进的SNN架构。

Conclusion: 固定不应期SNN架构为序列建模提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In the field of image recognition, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have
achieved performance comparable to conventional artificial neural networks
(ANNs). In such applications, SNNs essentially function as traditional neural
networks with quantized activation values. This article focuses on an another
alternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks.From this viewpoint, current SNN
architectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1)
Traditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence
modeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset
mechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically
under-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in
SNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps.To address these
challenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental
mechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in
binary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such
biological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking
patterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately
propose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling.

Motivation: 探讨DNNs与生物视觉对齐趋势的逆转原因，提出未来模型需更贴近人类视觉系统。

Method: 分析DNNs与灵长类神经反应的差异，提出基于生物视觉的数据和训练方法。

Result: 现代DNNs依赖非生物视觉特征，未来模型需调整训练策略。

Conclusion: 未来生物视觉模型需从AI独立，采用更接近人类视觉的训练方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) once showed increasing alignment with primate
neural responses as they improved on computer vision benchmarks. This trend
raised the exciting possibility that better models of biological vision would
come as a byproduct of the deep learning revolution in artificial intelligence.
However, the trend has reversed over recent years as DNNs have scaled to human
or superhuman recognition accuracy, a divergence that may stem from modern DNNs
learning to rely on different visual features than primates to solve tasks.
Where will better computational models of biological vision come from? We
propose that vision science must break from artificial intelligence to develop
algorithms that are designed with biological visual systems in mind instead of
internet data benchmarks. We predict that the next generation of deep learning
models of biological vision will be trained with data diets, training routines,
and objectives that are closer to those that shape human vision than those that
are in use today.

*Abdallah Alalem Albustami,Ahmad F. Taha*

Main category: eess.SY

TLDR: 本文系统分析了针对供水网络（WDNs）的传感器攻击，研究了物理约束、状态监测要求和入侵检测规避条件的组合，提出了多种攻击策略，并通过案例研究验证了其持久性和隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着供水网络与数字基础设施的连接增加，其面临更多网络攻击威胁，尤其是隐蔽的虚假数据注入攻击（SFDIAs）。现有研究多集中于检测方法或特定攻击形式，而攻击复杂性、系统知识需求与可实现影响之间的关系尚未探索。

Method: 本文提出了多种攻击策略，从满足物理和检测约束的定制策略到简单的测量操纵，这些攻击仅需目标传感器及其水力连接的知识，具有可扩展性和实用性。

Result: 通过在Net1和Net3基准网络上的案例研究，证明了这些攻击能持久增加运营成本并改变水流，同时长时间不被监测系统发现。

Conclusion: 分析为供水网络提供了漏洞评估的见解，并推动了结合物理和统计安全机制的保护策略的开发。

Abstract: As water distribution networks (WDNs) become increasingly connected with
digital infrastructures, they face greater exposure to cyberattacks that
threaten their operational integrity. Stealthy False Data Injection Attacks
(SFDIAs) are particularly concerning, as they manipulate sensor data to
compromise system operations while avoiding detection. While existing studies
have focused on either detection methods or specific attack formulations, the
relationship between attack sophistication, system knowledge requirements, and
achievable impact remains unexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis
of sensor attacks against WDNs, investigating different combinations of
physical constraints, state monitoring requirements, and intrusion detection
evasion conditions. We propose several attack formulations that range from
tailored strategies satisfying both physical and detection constraints to
simpler measurement manipulations. The proposed attacks are simple and local --
requiring knowledge only of targeted sensors and their hydraulic connections --
making them scalable and practical. Through case studies on Net1 and Net3
benchmark networks, we demonstrate how these attacks can persistently increase
operational costs and alter water flows while remaining undetected by
monitoring systems for extended periods. The analysis provides utilities with
insights for vulnerability assessment and motivates the development of
protection strategies that combine physical and statistical security
mechanisms.

Main category: eess.SY

TLDR: 论文提出了一种非线性对等感知成本估计算法（N-PACE），用于解决不完全信息动态博弈中目标函数未知的问题，通过迭代线性二次逼近和显式建模对等智能体的学习动态，实现快速无偏学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设一个智能体是完全信息的专家，这会导致估计偏差和协调失败。为了解决这一问题，论文提出N-PACE算法，以更准确地推断对等智能体的目标函数。

Method: N-PACE通过迭代线性二次逼近非线性博弈，显式建模对等智能体的学习动态，从而推断其目标函数。

Result: N-PACE实现了对未知目标函数的快速无偏学习，并支持多智能体系统中的意图通信。

Conclusion: N-PACE为解决不完全信息动态博弈中的协调问题提供了一种有效方法，同时增强了任务完成和安全性。

Abstract: Human-robot interactions can be modeled as incomplete-information general-sum
dynamic games since the objective functions of both agents are not explicitly
known to each other. However, solving for equilibrium policies for such games
presents a major challenge, especially if the games involve nonlinear
underlying dynamics. To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that
one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead
to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we
propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for
general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (LQ)
approximation of the nonlinear general-sum game, each agent explicitly models
the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective
functions, leading to unbiased fast learning in inferring the unknown objective
function of the peer agent, which is critical for task completion and safety
assurance. Additionally, we demonstrate how N-PACE enables \textbf{intent
communication} in such multi-agent systems by explicitly modeling the peer's
learning dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体控制和人机交互中信息不完全的线性二次微分博弈问题，尤其是当双方不了解对方成本函数时的复杂性。

Method: 提出PACE框架，将对方视为学习智能体而非静态最优智能体，建模其学习动态以推断其成本参数，并实时调整控制策略。

Result: 理论证明了参数估计的收敛性和系统状态的稳定性，数值研究表明PACE在稳定性和收敛速度上优于假设对方信息完全的方法。

Conclusion: PACE框架有效解决了信息不完全的微分博弈问题，通过动态学习对方成本参数提升了系统性能和适应性。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of a two-player linear quadratic
differential game with incomplete information, a scenario commonly encountered
in multi-agent control, human-robot interaction (HRI), and approximation
methods for solving general-sum differential games. While solutions to such
linear differential games are typically obtained through coupled Riccati
equations, the complexity increases when agents have incomplete information,
particularly when neither is aware of the other's cost function. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a model-based Peer-Aware Cost Estimation (PACE) framework
for learning the cost parameters of the other agent. In PACE, each agent treats
its peer as a learning agent rather than a stationary optimal agent, models
their learning dynamics, and leverages this dynamic to infer the cost function
parameters of the other agent. This approach enables agents to infer each
other's objective function in real time based solely on their previous state
observations and dynamically adapt their control policies. Furthermore, we
provide a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of parameter estimation and
the stability of system states in PACE. Additionally, in our numerical studies,
we demonstrate how modeling the learning dynamics of the other agent benefits
PACE, compared to approaches that approximate the other agent as having
complete information, particularly in terms of stability and convergence speed.

Result: 在三个社会经济预测任务中表现优异，且与图像嵌入结合可提升性能。

Conclusion: S2Vec能生成有效的地理空间表示，并与其他数据模态互补。

Abstract: Scalable general-purpose representations of the built environment are crucial
for geospatial artificial intelligence applications. This paper introduces
S2Vec, a novel self-supervised framework for learning such geospatial
embeddings. S2Vec uses the S2 Geometry library to partition large areas into
discrete S2 cells, rasterizes built environment feature vectors within cells as
images, and applies masked autoencoding on these rasterized images to encode
the feature vectors. This approach yields task-agnostic embeddings that capture
local feature characteristics and broader spatial relationships. We evaluate
S2Vec on three large-scale socioeconomic prediction tasks, showing its
competitive performance against state-of-the-art image-based embeddings. We
also explore the benefits of combining S2Vec embeddings with image-based
embeddings downstream, showing that such multimodal fusion can often improve
performance. Our results highlight how S2Vec can learn effective
general-purpose geospatial representations and how it can complement other data
modalities in geospatial artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Generative agents offer promising capabilities for simulating realistic urban
behaviors. However, existing methods oversimplify transportation choices in
modern cities, and require prohibitive computational resources for large-scale
population simulation. To address these limitations, we first present a virtual
city that features multiple functional buildings and transportation modes.
Then, we conduct extensive surveys to model behavioral choices and mobility
preferences among population groups. Building on these insights, we introduce a
simulation framework that captures the complexity of urban mobility while
remaining scalable, enabling the simulation of over 4,000 agents. To assess the
realism of the generated behaviors, we perform a series of micro and
macro-level analyses. Beyond mere performance comparison, we explore insightful
experiments, such as predicting crowd density from movement patterns and
identifying trends in vehicle preferences across agent demographics.

TLDR: SCRAG是一个基于社交计算的预测框架，用于预测社区对社交媒体帖子的反应，结合了检索增强生成技术，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）在动态社交媒体环境中预测社区反应时存在局限性，SCRAG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SCRAG整合了LLM和检索增强生成技术，通过检索历史社区反应和外部知识（如新闻文章）来预测社区对新帖子的反应。

Result: 在X平台（原Twitter）上的六种场景实验中，SCRAG在关键评估指标上平均提升了10%以上。

Conclusion: SCRAG为需要准确预测社区反应的应用提供了一个有效的社交计算工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces SCRAG, a prediction framework inspired by social
computing, designed to forecast community responses to real or hypothetical
social media posts. SCRAG can be used by public relations specialists (e.g., to
craft messaging in ways that avoid unintended misinterpretations) or public
figures and influencers (e.g., to anticipate social responses), among other
applications related to public sentiment prediction, crisis management, and
social what-if analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved
remarkable success in generating coherent and contextually rich text, their
reliance on static training data and susceptibility to hallucinations limit
their effectiveness at response forecasting in dynamic social media
environments. SCRAG overcomes these challenges by integrating LLMs with a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique rooted in social computing.
Specifically, our framework retrieves (i) historical responses from the target
community to capture their ideological, semantic, and emotional makeup, and
(ii) external knowledge from sources such as news articles to inject
time-sensitive context. This information is then jointly used to forecast the
responses of the target community to new posts or narratives. Extensive
experiments across six scenarios on the X platform (formerly Twitter), tested
with various embedding models and LLMs, demonstrate over 10% improvements on
average in key evaluation metrics. A concrete example further shows its
effectiveness in capturing diverse ideologies and nuances. Our work provides a
social computing tool for applications where accurate and concrete insights
into community responses are crucial.

Motivation: 现有LDP扰动机制导致值失真和效用下降，需改进方法以保持隐私和实用性。

Method: 提出CRIAD，通过随机化索引而非扰动值，结合多虚拟、多样本和多组策略。

Result: CRIAD在隐私保护和查询准确性上优于传统值扰动机制。

Conclusion: CRIAD是一种高效、灵活的LDP解决方案，适用于多种隐私需求和领域规模。

Abstract: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is the predominant privacy model for
safeguarding individual data privacy. Existing perturbation mechanisms
typically require perturbing the original values to ensure acceptable privacy,
which inevitably results in value distortion and utility deterioration. In this
work, we propose an alternative approach -- instead of perturbing values, we
apply randomization to indexes of values while ensuring rigorous LDP
guarantees. Inspired by the deniability of randomized indexes, we present CRIAD
for answering subset counting queries on set-value data. By integrating a
multi-dummy, multi-sample, and multi-group strategy, CRIAD serves as a fully
scalable solution that offers flexibility across various privacy requirements
and domain sizes, and achieves more accurate query results than any existing
methods. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experimental
evaluations, we validate the effectiveness of CRIAD and demonstrate its
superiority over traditional value-perturbation mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业环境中生产数据难以获取，传统数据生成方法无法满足复杂结构和语义关系的需求，导致测试覆盖率低。

Method: 结合LLM（如Gemini）及前后处理步骤，生成符合复杂结构约束和语义一致性的测试数据。

Result: 成功生成了支持复杂SQL查询（如连接、聚合、嵌套子查询）的高保真测试数据，提升了测试覆盖率。

Conclusion: LLM方法为工业级SQL代码生成服务提供了实用的高保真测试数据生成方案。

Abstract: The demand for high-fidelity test data is paramount in industrial settings
where access to production data is largely restricted. Traditional data
generation methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and the
ability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that are
critical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Language
to SQL (NL2SQL). In this paper, we address the critical need for generating
syntactically correct and semantically ``meaningful'' mock data for complex
schema that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently
encounter in Google SQL code generation workloads. We highlight the limitations
of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to
handle large and complex schema, as well as the lack of semantically coherent
test data that lead to limited test coverage. We demonstrate that by leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and
post-processing steps, we can generate realistic high-fidelity test data that
adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to
the test targets (SQL queries/functions). This approach supports comprehensive
testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply
nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services,
like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant services. Our results demonstrate the
practical utility of an out-of-the-box LLM (\textit{gemini}) based test data
generation for industrial SQL code generation services where generating
realistic test data is essential due to the frequent unavailability of
production datasets.

Result: 研究发现DFMs的可解释性挑战可能源于其本质特性，而非技术暂时不足。

Conclusion: 需重新思考DFMs的验证和治理方法，以应对其本质上的可解释性障碍。

Abstract: Deep Foundation Models (DFMs) offer unprecedented capabilities but their
increasing complexity presents profound challenges to understanding their
internal workings-a critical need for ensuring trust, safety, and
accountability. As we grapple with explaining these systems, a fundamental
question emerges: Are the difficulties we face merely temporary hurdles,
awaiting more sophisticated analytical techniques, or do they stem from
\emph{intrinsic barriers} deeply rooted in the nature of these large-scale
models themselves? This paper delves into this critical question by examining
the fundamental characteristics of DFMs and scrutinizing the limitations
encountered by current explainability methods when confronted with this
inherent challenge. We probe the feasibility of achieving satisfactory
explanations and consider the implications for how we must approach the
verification and governance of these powerful technologies.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important part of our everyday
lives, yet user requirements for designing AI-assisted systems in law
enforcement remain unclear. To address this gap, we conducted qualitative
research on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to
identify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and
understand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these
systems.
  Participants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of
processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime
detection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements
for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to
be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of
having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to
interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy.
To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users
need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and
government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and
monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the
system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed
they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the
system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the
system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature
of the law enforcement domain.

Abstract: The past years witnessed a significant amount of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

whether AI can generate accurate images using text from the Bible with respect

aesthetics. Finally, we discuss the use of the generated images and reflect on
the performance of the AI generators.

TLDR: 论文通过深度学习聚类德国天然气发电机组，发现非峰值机组灵活性较低，需政策调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发电机组灵活性假设对能源模型的影响，揭示市场激励和服务义务对实际运行的约束。

Method: 使用深度学习处理2019-2023年每小时调度数据，聚类分析60%以上德国天然气发电机组。

Result: 识别出两类峰值机组和两类非峰值机组，非峰值机组灵活性较低，占必须运行发电量的83%。

Conclusion: 需通过监管政策提升非峰值机组的市场响应能力，释放其灵活性。

Abstract: A key input to energy models are assumptions about the flexibility of power
generation units, i.e., how quickly and often they can start up. These
assumptions are usually calibrated on the technical characteristics of the
units, such as installed capacity or technology type. However, even if power
generation units technically can dispatch flexibly, service obligations and
market incentives may constrain their operation. Here, we cluster over 60% of
German national gas generation (generation units of 100 MWp or above) based on
their empirical flexibility. We process the hourly dispatch of sample units
between 2019 and 2023 using a novel deep learning approach, that transforms
time series into easy-to-cluster representations. We identify two clusters of
peaker units and two clusters of non-peaker units, whose different empirical
flexibility is quantified by cluster-level ramp rates. Non-peaker units, around
half of the sample, are empirically less flexible than peakers, and make up for
more than 83% of sample must-run generation. Regulatory changes addressing the
low market responsiveness of non-peakers are needed to unlock their
flexibility.

TLDR: 论文提出了一个五阶段跨学科框架，用于在机器学习模型开发中整合法律和技术分析，以解决法律合规性与预测性能之间的复杂权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习技术与法律要求的交叉带来了新的复杂性，现有方法未能充分解决法律合规性与模型性能之间的权衡问题。

Method: 引入一个五阶段跨学科框架，结合法律和技术分析，指导法律义务的操作化选择和评估指标的设计。

Result: 该框架能够帮助设计符合法律要求的机器学习模型，并找到在法律上合理且高性能的模型。

Conclusion: 通过法律与技术专家的协作，该框架填补了法律概念分析与机器学习确定性需求之间的空白，并通过反洗钱案例验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Organizations developing machine learning-based (ML) technologies face the
complex challenge of achieving high predictive performance while respecting the
law. This intersection between ML and the law creates new complexities. As ML
model behavior is inferred from training data, legal obligations cannot be
operationalized in source code directly. Rather, legal obligations require
"indirect" operationalization. However, choosing context-appropriate
operationalizations presents two compounding challenges: (1) laws often permit
multiple valid operationalizations for a given legal obligation-each with
varying degrees of legal adequacy; and, (2) each operationalization creates
unpredictable trade-offs among the different legal obligations and with
predictive performance. Evaluating these trade-offs requires metrics (or
heuristics), which are in turn difficult to validate against legal obligations.
Current methodologies fail to fully address these interwoven challenges as they
either focus on legal compliance for traditional software or on ML model
development without adequately considering legal complexities. In response, we
introduce a five-stage interdisciplinary framework that integrates legal and
ML-technical analysis during ML model development. This framework facilitates
designing ML models in a legally aligned way and identifying high-performing
models that are legally justifiable. Legal reasoning guides choices for
operationalizations and evaluation metrics, while ML experts ensure technical
feasibility, performance optimization and an accurate interpretation of metric
values. This framework bridges the gap between more conceptual analysis of law
and ML models' need for deterministic specifications. We illustrate its
application using a case study in the context of anti-money laundering.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法生成的用户嵌入难以理解和整合外部知识，限制了客户分割、搜索导航和产品推荐等应用的效果。

Method: 提出GPLR方法，利用预训练LLM推断客户角色，并通过随机游走技术扩展至全体用户；进一步提出RevAff算法，优化时间复杂度和误差保证。

Result: 在三个真实电商数据集上，基于角色的表示显著提升了推荐模型的性能（NDCG@K和F1-Score@K提升高达12%）。

Conclusion: 客户角色提供了一种可读且信息丰富的用户表示方法，显著提升了电商应用的性能。

Abstract: In e-commerce, user representations are essential for various applications.
Existing methods often use deep learning techniques to convert customer
behaviors into implicit embeddings. However, these embeddings are difficult to
understand and integrate with external knowledge, limiting the effectiveness of
applications such as customer segmentation, search navigation, and product
recommendations. To address this, our paper introduces the concept of the
customer persona. Condensed from a customer's numerous purchasing histories, a
customer persona provides a multi-faceted and human-readable characterization
of specific purchase behaviors and preferences, such as Busy Parents or Bargain
Hunters.
  This work then focuses on representing each customer by multiple personas
from a predefined set, achieving readable and informative explicit user
representations. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient solution
GPLR. To ensure effectiveness, GPLR leverages pre-trained LLMs to infer
personas for customers. To reduce overhead, GPLR applies LLM-based labeling to
only a fraction of users and utilizes a random walk technique to predict
personas for the remaining customers. We further propose RevAff, which provides
an absolute error $\epsilon$ guarantee while improving the time complexity of
the exact solution by a factor of at least
$O(\frac{\epsilon\cdot|E|N}{|E|+N\log N})$, where $N$ represents the number of
customers and products, and $E$ represents the interactions between them. We
evaluate the performance of our persona-based representation in terms of
accuracy and robustness for recommendation and customer segmentation tasks
using three real-world e-commerce datasets. Most notably, we find that
integrating customer persona representations improves the state-of-the-art
graph convolution-based recommendation model by up to 12% in terms of NDCG@K
and F1-Score@K.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社区平台需要动态个性化推荐，但实时优化模型以适应变化在大规模工业环境中仍具挑战性。

Method: IRA框架通过兴趣单元（Interest Units）和基于语义关系的检索机制，动态更新用户兴趣并消除点击信号的依赖。

Result: IRA在真实数据集上表现优异，并已部署在NAVER的CAFE平台中。

Conclusion: IRA能够持续适应用户兴趣变化，提供细粒度的个性化推荐，且不受过去训练分布的限制。

Abstract: Online community platforms require dynamic personalized retrieval and
recommendation that can continuously adapt to evolving user interests and new
documents. However, optimizing models to handle such changes in real-time
remains a major challenge in large-scale industrial settings. To address this,
we propose the Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA) framework, an
efficient and scalable approach that dynamically adapts to new interactions
through a cumulative structure. IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest
Units that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while
reinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval
process that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based
solely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to
mitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with
the retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences,
ensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by
past training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the
Home Section of NAVER's CAFE, South Korea's leading community platform.

Main category: cs.SE

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为RuleLLM的新工具，利用大语言模型（LLMs）自动生成规则，以应对软件供应链攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前安全工具依赖专家预定义规则，难以适应新兴的软件供应链攻击。

Method: RuleLLM通过提取恶意软件的元数据和代码片段，生成可直接部署的YARA和Semgrep规则，包括规则生成、优化和对齐三个子任务。

Result: 实验表明，RuleLLM生成了763条规则（452条YARA和311条Semgrep），准确率为85.2%，召回率为91.8%，优于现有工具。

Conclusion: RuleLLM在规则生成方面表现优异，并提出了一套规则分类法（11类38子类）。

Abstract: Today's security tools predominantly rely on predefined rules crafted by
experts, making them poorly adapted to the emergence of software supply chain
attacks. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel tool, RuleLLM, which
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate rule generation for OSS
ecosystems. RuleLLM extracts metadata and code snippets from malware as its
input, producing YARA and Semgrep rules that can be directly deployed in
software development. Specifically, the rule generation task involves three
subtasks: crafting rules, refining rules, and aligning rules. To validate
RuleLLM's effectiveness, we implemented a prototype system and conducted
experiments on the dataset of 1,633 malicious packages. The results are
promising that RuleLLM generated 763 rules (452 YARA and 311 Semgrep) with a
precision of 85.2\% and a recall of 91.8\%, outperforming state-of-the-art
(SOTA) tools and scored-based approaches. We further analyzed generated rules
and proposed a rule taxonomy: 11 categories and 38 subcategories.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件的广泛使用带来了安全风险，尤其是资源不足的关键项目。研究旨在揭示攻击者如何利用开发流程本身进行供应链攻击。

Method: 通过分析GitHub事件和开发记录，重构攻击时间线并分析攻击者策略的演变。

Result: 攻击者通过看似有益的贡献（如基础设施维护）绕过传统安全措施，长期控制项目。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了软件工程实践可能被武器化的风险，为保护开源生态系统提供了新视角。

Abstract: The digital economy runs on Open Source Software (OSS), with an estimated
90\% of modern applications containing open-source components. While this
widespread adoption has revolutionized software development, it has also
created critical security vulnerabilities, particularly in essential but
under-resourced projects. This paper examines a sophisticated attack on the XZ
Utils project (CVE-2024-3094), where attackers exploited not just code, but the
entire open-source development process to inject a backdoor into a fundamental
Linux compression library. Our analysis reveals a new breed of supply chain
attack that manipulates software engineering practices themselves -- from
community management to CI/CD configurations -- to establish legitimacy and
maintain long-term control. Through a comprehensive examination of GitHub
events and development artifacts, we reconstruct the attack timeline, analyze
the evolution of attacker tactics. Our findings demonstrate how attackers
leveraged seemingly beneficial contributions to project infrastructure and
maintenance to bypass traditional security measures. This work extends beyond
traditional security analysis by examining how software engineering practices
themselves can be weaponized, offering insights for protecting the open-source
ecosystem.

Abstract: Understanding source code is a topic of great interest in the software
engineering community, since it can help programmers in various tasks such as
software maintenance and reuse. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable program comprehension capabilities, while
transformer-based topic modeling techniques offer effective ways to extract
semantic information from text. This paper proposes and explores a novel
approach that combines these strengths to automatically identify meaningful
topics in a corpus of Python programs. Our method consists in applying topic
modeling on the descriptions obtained by asking an LLM to summarize the code.
To assess the internal consistency of the extracted topics, we compare them
against topics inferred from function names alone, and those derived from
existing docstrings. Experimental results suggest that leveraging LLM-generated
summaries provides interpretable and semantically rich representation of code
structure. The promising results suggest that our approach can be fruitfully
applied in various software engineering tasks such as automatic documentation
and tagging, code search, software reorganization and knowledge discovery in
large repositories.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注运行时指标，忽略了源代码注释等进化指标，导致对软件老化的理解不足。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合定性和定量分析，从源代码注释中提取SAAD模式并分类。

Result: 分析9000+开源仓库发现21%存在SAAD，其中“休眠AD”占主导。

Conclusion: 软件老化问题日益严重，提出的分类法有助于研究和实践中的维护策略优化。

Abstract: Context: Previous research on software aging is limited with focus on dynamic
runtime indicators like memory and performance, often neglecting evolutionary
indicators like source code comments and narrowly examining legacy issues
within the TD context. Objective: We introduce the concept of Aging Debt (AD),
representing the increased maintenance efforts and costs needed to keep
software updated. We study AD through Self-Admitted Aging Debt (SAAD) observed
in source code comments left by software developers. Method: We employ a
mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to
detect and measure AD in software. This includes framing SAAD patterns from the
source code comments after analysing the source code context, then utilizing
the SAAD patterns to detect SAAD comments. In the process, we develop a
taxonomy for SAAD that reflects the temporal aging of software and its
associated debt. Then we utilize the taxonomy to quantify the different types
of AD prevalent in OSS repositories. Results: Our proposed taxonomy categorizes
temporal software aging into Active and Dormant types. Our extensive analysis
of over 9,000+ Open Source Software (OSS) repositories reveals that more than
21% repositories exhibit signs of SAAD as observed from our gold standard SAAD
dataset. Notably, Dormant AD emerges as the predominant category, highlighting
a critical but often overlooked aspect of software maintenance. Conclusion: As
software volume grows annually, so do evolutionary aging and maintenance
challenges; our proposed taxonomy can aid researchers in detailed software
aging studies and help practitioners develop improved and proactive maintenance
strategies.

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: 该研究提出了一种基于多器官分割的方法，整合主动脉、门静脉、肺动脉和输尿管的图像衍生输入函数（IDIFs），以提高动态PET成像的动力学建模准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IDIFs仅从主动脉获取，忽略了解剖变异和复杂血管贡献，限制了动力学分析的准确性。

Method: 利用高分辨率CT分割肝脏、肺、肾脏和膀胱，整合器官特异性血液供应源，改进动力学建模。

Result: 在9名患者的动态[$^{18}$F]FDG PET数据中，肝脏和肺的均方误差（MSE）分别降低了13.39%和10.42%。

Conclusion: 多IDIFs方法有望提升解剖建模和动态PET成像的应用潜力，推动示踪动力学建模在临床中的常规化。

Abstract: Accurate kinetic analysis of [$^{18}$F]FDG distribution in dynamic positron
emission tomography (PET) requires anatomically constrained modelling of
image-derived input functions (IDIFs). Traditionally, IDIFs are obtained from
the aorta, neglecting anatomical variations and complex vascular contributions.
This study proposes a multi-organ segmentation-based approach that integrates
IDIFs from the aorta, portal vein, pulmonary artery, and ureters. Using
high-resolution CT segmentations of the liver, lungs, kidneys, and bladder, we
incorporate organ-specific blood supply sources to improve kinetic modelling.
Our method was evaluated on dynamic [$^{18}$F]FDG PET data from nine patients,
resulting in a mean squared error (MSE) reduction of $13.39\%$ for the liver
and $10.42\%$ for the lungs. These initial results highlight the potential of
multiple IDIFs in improving anatomical modelling and fully leveraging dynamic
PET imaging. This approach could facilitate the integration of tracer kinetic
modelling into clinical routine.

Motivation: 传统动态PET的动力学参数估计方法计算量大且空间分辨率有限，而深度神经网络（DNNs）需要大量训练数据和计算资源。

Result: 在[$^{18}$F]FDG动态PET/CT数据集上验证，显示更高的空间分辨率、更低的均方误差和更好的解剖一致性。

Conclusion: INRs在个性化、数据高效的示踪动力学建模中具有潜力，适用于肿瘤表征、分割和预后评估。

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) with [$^{18}$F]FDG enables
non-invasive quantification of glucose metabolism through kinetic analysis,
often modelled by the two-tissue compartment model (TCKM). However, voxel-wise
kinetic parameter estimation using conventional methods is computationally
intensive and limited by spatial resolution. Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer
an alternative but require large training datasets and significant
computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a
physiological neural representation based on implicit neural representations
(INRs) for personalized kinetic parameter estimation. INRs, which learn
continuous functions, allow for efficient, high-resolution parametric imaging
with reduced data requirements. Our method also integrates anatomical priors
from a 3D CT foundation model to enhance robustness and precision in kinetic
modelling. We evaluate our approach on an [$^{18}$F]FDG dynamic PET/CT dataset
and compare it to state-of-the-art DNNs. Results demonstrate superior spatial
resolution, lower mean-squared error, and improved anatomical consistency,
particularly in tumour and highly vascularized regions. Our findings highlight
the potential of INRs for personalized, data-efficient tracer kinetic
modelling, enabling applications in tumour characterization, segmentation, and
prognostic assessment.

Abstract: Skin, the primary regulator of heat exchange, relies on sweat glands for
thermoregulation. Alterations in sweat gland morphology play a crucial role in
various pathological conditions and clinical diagnoses. Current methods for
observing sweat gland morphology are limited by their two-dimensional, in
vitro, and destructive nature, underscoring the urgent need for real-time,
non-invasive, quantifiable technologies. We proposed a novel three-dimensional
(3D) transformer-based multi-object segmentation framework, integrating a
sliding window approach, joint spatial-channel attention mechanism, and
architectural heterogeneity between shallow and deep layers. Our proposed
network enables precise 3D sweat gland segmentation from skin volume data
captured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). For the first time, subtle
variations of sweat gland 3D morphology in response to temperature changes,
have been visualized and quantified. Our approach establishes a benchmark for
normal sweat gland morphology and provides a real-time, non-invasive tool for
quantifying 3D structural parameters. This enables the study of individual
variability and pathological changes in sweat gland structure, advancing
dermatological research and clinical applications, including thermoregulation
and bromhidrosis treatment.

Motivation: 传统MIL方法（如ABMIL）忽略空间交互，而TransMIL虽引入空间上下文但计算复杂度高。研究旨在验证显式建模实例关系是否能在ABMIL中带来性能提升。

Method: 提出GABMIL模型，在ABMIL框架中集成交互感知表示，显式捕捉实例间依赖关系。

Result: 在乳腺癌和肺癌肿瘤亚型分类任务中，GABMIL比ABMIL在AUPRC和Kappa分数上分别提升7%和5%，且计算开销几乎不变。

Conclusion: 显式建模实例关系对MIL框架至关重要，GABMIL在性能和效率上取得平衡。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising approach for weakly
supervised classification in pathology using whole slide images (WSIs).
However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple
Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among
patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such
as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and
inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly
modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which
relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs
Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the
cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we
enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to
address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly
captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency.
Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in
breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage
point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score
over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These
findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within
MIL frameworks.

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) pose a significant challenge in healthcare,
requiring precise and efficient wound assessment to enhance patient outcomes.
This study introduces the Attention Diffusion Zero-shot Unsupervised System
(ADZUS), a novel text-guided diffusion model that performs wound segmentation
without relying on labeled training data. Unlike conventional deep learning
models, which require extensive annotation, ADZUS leverages zero-shot learning
to dynamically adapt segmentation based on descriptive prompts, offering
enhanced flexibility and adaptability in clinical applications. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ADZUS surpasses traditional and state-of-the-art
segmentation models, achieving an IoU of 86.68\% and the highest precision of
94.69\% on the chronic wound dataset, outperforming supervised approaches such
as FUSegNet. Further validation on a custom-curated DFU dataset reinforces its
robustness, with ADZUS achieving a median DSC of 75\%, significantly surpassing
FUSegNet's 45\%. The model's text-guided segmentation capability enables
real-time customization of segmentation outputs, allowing targeted analysis of
wound characteristics based on clinical descriptions. Despite its competitive
performance, the computational cost of diffusion-based inference and the need
for potential fine-tuning remain areas for future improvement. ADZUS represents
a transformative step in wound segmentation, providing a scalable, efficient,
and adaptable AI-driven solution for medical imaging.

Method: 框架整合了三种核心机制：ABAC用于细粒度PHI治理，混合PHI清理管道（结合正则表达式和BERT模型）以减少泄漏，以及不可变审计跟踪用于合规验证。

Result: 提出的框架能够动态执行合规策略，有效管理PHI并减少数据泄漏风险。

Conclusion: 该框架为Agentic AI系统在医疗领域的合规应用提供了可行方案，但仍需进一步验证和完善。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) as their
foundational reasoning engine, are transforming clinical workflows such as
medical report generation and clinical summarization by autonomously analyzing
sensitive healthcare data and executing decisions with minimal human oversight.
However, their adoption demands strict compliance with regulatory frameworks
such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),
particularly when handling Protected Health Information (PHI). This
work-in-progress paper introduces a HIPAA-compliant Agentic AI framework that
enforces regulatory compliance through dynamic, context-aware policy
enforcement. Our framework integrates three core mechanisms: (1)
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granular PHI governance, (2) a hybrid
PHI sanitization pipeline combining regex patterns and BERT-based model to
minimize leakage, and (3) immutable audit trails for compliance verification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索易用工具在乳腺癌H&E染色全切片图像（WSI）中自动评估TILs的潜力。

Method: 1. 训练像素分类器分割肿瘤和基质；2. 使用预训练StarDist模型检测细胞并训练TILs分类器；3. 计算TIL密度并分类。

Result: 与病理学家评分对比，Cohen's kappa为0.71，验证了流程的可靠性。

Conclusion: 现有软件可为乳腺癌H&E-WSI中的TILs评估提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we built an end-to-end tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
assessment pipeline within QuPath, demonstrating the potential of easily
accessible tools to perform complex tasks in a fully automatic fashion. First,
we trained a pixel classifier to segment tumor, tumor-associated stroma, and
other tissue compartments in breast cancer H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSI)
to isolate tumor-associated stroma for subsequent analysis. Next, we applied a
pre-trained StarDist deep learning model in QuPath for cell detection and used
the extracted cell features to train a binary classifier distinguishing TILs
from other cells. To evaluate our TILs assessment pipeline, we calculated the
TIL density in each WSI and categorized them as low, medium, or high TIL
levels. Our pipeline was evaluated against pathologist-assigned TIL scores,
achieving a Cohen's kappa of 0.71 on the external test set, corroborating
previous research findings. These results confirm that existing software can
offer a practical solution for the assessment of TILs in H&E-stained WSIs of
breast cancer.

Result: 仅需15-20%的测量点即可高精度重建光谱，误差低于0.03 eV（峰值）和0.1 eV（吸收边）。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了数据采集效率，适用于静态和动态XANES实验，推动了自动化进程。

Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy is a powerful
technique for characterizing the chemical state and symmetry of individual
elements within materials, but requires collecting data at many energy points
which can be time-consuming. While adaptive sampling methods exist for
efficiently collecting spectroscopic data, they often lack domain-specific
knowledge about XANES spectra structure. Here we demonstrate a
knowledge-injected Bayesian optimization approach for adaptive XANES data
collection that incorporates understanding of spectral features like absorption
edges and pre-edge peaks. We show this method accurately reconstructs the
absorption edge of XANES spectra using only 15-20% of the measurement points
typically needed for conventional sampling, while maintaining the ability to
determine the x-ray energy of the sharp peak after absorption edge with errors
less than 0.03 eV, the absorption edge with errors less than 0.1 eV; and
overall root-mean-square errors less than 0.005 compared to compared to
traditionally sampled spectra. Our experiments on battery materials and
catalysts demonstrate the method's effectiveness for both static and dynamic
XANES measurements, improving data collection efficiency and enabling better
time resolution for tracking chemical changes. This approach advances the
degree of automation in XANES experiments reducing the common errors of under-
or over-sampling points in near the absorption edge and enabling dynamic
experiments that require high temporal resolution or limited measurement time.

Result: 实验显示该方法能显著减少模型规模，并加速单调性检查和参数提升算法。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为快速预处理步骤，提升pMC验证效率。

Abstract: Parametric Markov chains (pMC) are used to model probabilistic systems with
unknown or partially known probabilities. Although (universal) pMC verification
for reachability properties is known to be coETR-complete, there have been
efforts to approach it using potentially easier-to-check properties such as
asking whether the pMC is monotonic in certain parameters. In this paper, we
first reduce monotonicity to asking whether the reachability probability from a
given state is never less than that of another given state. Recent results for
the latter property imply an efficient algorithm to collapse same-value
equivalence classes, which in turn preserves verification results and
monotonicity. We implement our algorithm to collapse "trivial" equivalence
classes in the pMC and show empirical evidence for the following: First, the
collapse gives reductions in size for some existing benchmarks and significant
reductions on some custom benchmarks; Second, the collapse speeds up existing
algorithms to check monotonicity and parameter lifting, and hence can be used
as a fast pre-processing step in practice.

Conclusion: 扩展的PBR材料为复杂表面模型提供了更灵活和可控的合成方法。

Abstract: Realistic indoor or outdoor image synthesis is a core challenge in computer
vision and graphics. The learning-based approach is easy to use but lacks
physical consistency, while traditional Physically Based Rendering (PBR) offers
high realism but is computationally expensive. Intrinsic image representation
offers a well-balanced trade-off, decomposing images into fundamental
components (intrinsic channels) such as geometry, materials, and illumination
for controllable synthesis. However, existing PBR materials struggle with
complex surface models, particularly high-specular and transparent surfaces. In
this work, we extend intrinsic image representations to incorporate both
reflection and transmission properties, enabling the synthesis of transparent
materials such as glass and windows. We propose an explicit intrinsic
compositing framework that provides deterministic, interpretable image
synthesis. With the Extended PBR (ePBR) Materials, we can effectively edit the
materials with precise controls.

Conclusion: CasualHDRSplat提供了一种更灵活、高效的HDR场景重建方案。

Abstract: Recently, photo-realistic novel view synthesis from multi-view images, such
as neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have garnered
widespread attention due to their superior performance. However, most works
rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, which limits the capturing of richer
scene details. Some prior works have focused on high dynamic range (HDR) scene
reconstruction, typically require capturing of multi-view sharp images with
different exposure times at fixed camera positions during exposure times, which
is time-consuming and challenging in practice. For a more flexible data
acquisition, we propose a one-stage method: \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} to easily
and robustly reconstruct the 3D HDR scene from casually captured videos with
auto-exposure enabled, even in the presence of severe motion blur and varying
unknown exposure time. \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} contains a unified
differentiable physical imaging model which first applies continuous-time
trajectory constraint to imaging process so that we can jointly optimize
exposure time, camera response function (CRF), camera poses, and sharp 3D HDR
scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in terms of robustness and rendering quality. Our source code will be
available at https://github.com/WU-CVGL/CasualHDRSplat
