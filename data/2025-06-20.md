### [1] [Winter Soldier: Backdooring Language Models at Pre-Training with Indirect Data Poisoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14913)
*Wassim Bouaziz,Mathurin Videau,Nicolas Usunier,El-Mahdi El-Mhamdi*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种间接数据投毒方法，通过梯度优化提示调优，使语言模型学习训练数据中不存在的秘密序列，从而有效保护数据集并追踪其使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）预训练依赖难以管理的大规模文本数据，现有方法依赖训练数据的记忆，而模型提供者试图限制这种记忆。本文旨在探索一种不依赖记忆的间接数据投毒方法。

Method: 使用基于梯度的优化提示调优技术，让模型学习训练数据中不存在的秘密序列（秘密提示和秘密响应）。

Result: 实验表明，仅需不到0.005%的投毒标记即可让模型学习秘密序列，并以极高置信度（p < 10^-55）检测其使用，且不影响模型性能。

Conclusion: 间接数据投毒是可行的，能够在不影响模型性能的情况下保护数据集并追踪其使用。

Abstract: The pre-training of large language models (LLMs) relies on massive text datasets sourced from diverse and difficult-to-curate origins. Although membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme. Crucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and despite secrets never appearing in the training set.

### [2] [Fair Data Exchange with Constant-Time Proofs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14944)
*Majid Khabbazian*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种改进的Fair Data Exchange协议，通过将文件视为Reed-Solomon码字并加密，仅验证部分密文，从而将证明和验证时间从线性降至接近常数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FDE协议的证明和验证时间与文件长度线性相关，效率较低，需要优化。

Method: 将文件视为Reed-Solomon码字，扩展为低速率码并加密，仅验证随机子集的密文，利用RS解码修复错误。

Result: 协议在保持公平性的同时，显著降低了计算和通信开销，并支持比特币链下运行。

Conclusion: 改进后的FDE协议在效率和实用性上均有显著提升，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: The Fair Data Exchange (FDE) protocol introduced at CCS 2024 offers atomic pay-per-file transfers with constant-size proofs, but its prover and verifier runtimes still scale linearly with the file length n. We collapse these costs to essentially constant by viewing the file as a rate-1 Reed-Solomon (RS) codeword, extending it to a lower-rate RS code with constant redundancy, encrypting this extended vector, and then proving correctness for only a small random subset of the resulting ciphertexts; RS decoding repairs any corrupted symbols with negligible failure probability. Our protocol preserves full client- and server-fairness, and adds only a tunable communication redundancy overhead.
  Finally, we patch the elliptic-curve mismatch in the Bitcoin instantiation of FDE with a compact zk-SNARK, enabling the entire exchange to run off-chain and falling back to just two on-chain transactions when channels are unavailable.

### [3] [Narrowing the Gap between TEEs Threat Model and Deployment Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14964)
*Filip Rezabek,Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach,Moe Mahhouk,Frieder Erdmann,Andrew Miller*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文探讨了机密虚拟机（CVM）在物理保护和侧信道攻击方面的不足，提出扩展TEE认证以绑定CVM与提供商，并讨论了TEE认证的加固与扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CVM的威胁模型未涵盖物理层面保护和侧信道攻击，依赖可信云提供商托管基础设施，但TEE认证未提供运营商信息，用户无法准确评估物理攻击风险。

Method: 提出通过Protected Platform Identifier（PPID）绑定CVM与提供商，并讨论TEE认证的加固与扩展。

Result: 现有TEE认证实现差异大，导致验证、迁移和应用开发困难，需解决这一关键限制以推动CVM采用。

Conclusion: 需扩展TEE认证以提供端到端安全保障，减少对可信云提供商的依赖。

Abstract: Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) provide isolation guarantees for data in use, but their threat model does not include physical level protection and side-channel attacks. Therefore, current deployments rely on trusted cloud providers to host the CVMs' underlying infrastructure. However, TEE attestations do not provide information about the operator hosting a CVM. Without knowing whether a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) runs within a provider's infrastructure, a user cannot accurately assess the risks of physical attacks. We observe a misalignment in the threat model where the workloads are protected against other tenants but do not offer end-to-end security assurances to external users without relying on cloud providers. The attestation should be extended to bind the CVM with the provider. A possible solution can rely on the Protected Platform Identifier (PPID), a unique CPU identifier. However, the implementation details of various TEE manufacturers, attestation flows, and providers vary. This makes verification of attestations, ease of migration, and building applications without relying on a trusted party challenging, highlighting a key limitation that must be addressed for the adoption of CVMs. We discuss two points focusing on hardening and extensions of TEEs' attestation.

### [4] [Private Continual Counting of Unbounded Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15018)
*Ben Jacobsen,Kassem Fawaz*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文研究了在输入规模未知的情况下，差分隐私持续计数问题，提出了一种基于对数扰动的新型矩阵分解方法，实现了平滑误差和高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于矩阵机制的最优算法需要预先知道输入规模，而常见的‘倍增技巧’会导致误差不理想且不平滑，因此需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 引入基于对数扰动的新型矩阵分解方法，利用函数$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$的变体，实现平滑误差和高效计算。

Result: 算法在任意$t \leq n$时能以$O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$方差估计前$t$个数据点的和，空间复杂度$O(t)$，每轮时间摊销$O(\log t)$。

Conclusion: 新算法在性能和误差平滑性上优于现有方法，且实际表现接近最优有界输入算法。

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick' avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works, which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error, and for any $α> 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2α}(t))$ variance. It requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to $O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA 2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for $t$ as large as $2^{24}$.

Conclusion: 强调在预市场阶段解决网络安全问题的重要性，以确保AI/ML医疗设备的安全性。

Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging. Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices, thereby making them safe for patients.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has intensified the demand for efficient, high-throughput, and energy-efficient data processing at the edge. Conventional CPU-centric encryption methods suffer from performance bottlenecks and excessive data movement, especially in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we present SPiME, a lightweight, scalable, and FPGA-compatible Secure Processor-in-Memory Encryption architecture that integrates the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128) directly into a Processing-in-Memory (PiM) framework. SPiME is designed as a modular array of parallel PiM units, each combining an AES core with a minimal control unit to enable distributed in-place encryption with minimal overhead. The architecture is fully implemented in Verilog and tested on multiple AMD UltraScale and UltraScale+ FPGAs. Evaluation results show that SPiME can scale beyond 4,000 parallel units while maintaining less than 5\% utilization of key FPGA resources on high-end devices. It delivers over 25~Gbps in sustained encryption throughput with predictable, low-latency performance. The design's portability, configurability, and resource efficiency make it a compelling solution for secure edge computing, embedded cryptographic systems, and customizable hardware accelerators.

Result: CAE在干扰检测中表现出色，平均精确率97.33%，召回率91.33%，F1分数94.08%，准确率94.35%。

Conclusion: CAE在复杂异构数据中表现出鲁棒性，优于其他基准模型，适用于5G-NR网络的干扰检测。

Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks, over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance. Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models: Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08% F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.

### [10] [Flexible Hardware-Enabled Guarantees for AI Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15093)
*James Petrie,Onni Aarne,Nora Ammann,David Dalrymple*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为flexHEGs的硬件保障系统，旨在解决AI发展中的国际安全风险，通过可审计的处理器和安全外壳实现隐私保护的验证与执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统日益强大，其对国际安全的威胁加剧，现有治理方法难以在不泄露敏感信息或国家安全的情况下应对这些挑战。

Method: flexHEGs由可审计的保障处理器和安全外壳组成，支持开源、可更新的验证功能，适用于多种治理机制。

Result: flexHEGs能够实现隐私保护的模型评估、受控部署、训练计算限制和自动安全协议执行。

Conclusion: 尽管技术挑战较大，flexHEGs为解决前沿AI发展中的监管和国际安全问题提供了一种可行方案。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly powerful, they pose growing risks to international security, creating urgent coordination challenges that current governance approaches struggle to address without compromising sensitive information or national security. We propose flexible hardware-enabled guarantees (flexHEGs), that could be integrated with AI accelerators to enable trustworthy, privacy-preserving verification and enforcement of claims about AI development. FlexHEGs consist of an auditable guarantee processor that monitors accelerator usage and a secure enclosure providing physical tamper protection. The system would be fully open source with flexible, updateable verification capabilities. FlexHEGs could enable diverse governance mechanisms including privacy-preserving model evaluations, controlled deployment, compute limits for training, and automated safety protocol enforcement. In this first part of a three part series, we provide a comprehensive introduction of the flexHEG system, including an overview of the governance and security capabilities it offers, its potential development and adoption paths, and the remaining challenges and limitations it faces. While technically challenging, flexHEGs offer an approach to address emerging regulatory and international security challenges in frontier AI development.

*Onni Aarne,James Petrie*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 该报告探讨了灵活硬件保障（flexHEGs）如何通过标准化设计、生态系统防御和明确的操作参数，为国际可信的AI治理提供技术支持，并分析了其在四个国际安全领域的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力的快速发展，flexHEGs为解决国际安全挑战提供了技术基础，旨在通过治理框架管理AI相关芯片的风险。

Conclusion: 尽管需要国际协调，flexHEGs可为管理AI风险提供技术基础，以应对国际安全和稳定面临的威胁。

Abstract: As AI capabilities advance rapidly, flexible hardware-enabled guarantees (flexHEGs) offer opportunities to address international security challenges through comprehensive governance frameworks. This report examines how flexHEGs could enable internationally trustworthy AI governance by establishing standardized designs, robust ecosystem defenses, and clear operational parameters for AI-relevant chips. We analyze four critical international security applications: limiting proliferation to address malicious use, implementing safety norms to prevent loss of control, managing risks from military AI systems, and supporting strategic stability through balance-of-power mechanisms while respecting national sovereignty. The report explores both targeted deployments for specific high-risk facilities and comprehensive deployments covering all AI-relevant compute. We examine two primary governance models: verification-based agreements that enable transparent compliance monitoring, and ruleset-based agreements that automatically enforce international rules through cryptographically-signed updates. Through game-theoretic analysis, we demonstrate that comprehensive flexHEG agreements could remain stable under reasonable assumptions about state preferences and catastrophic risks. The report addresses critical implementation challenges including technical thresholds for AI-relevant chips, management of existing non-flexHEG hardware, and safeguards against abuse of governance power. While requiring significant international coordination, flexHEGs could provide a technical foundation for managing AI risks at the scale and speed necessary to address emerging threats to international security and stability.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving neural network training in vertically partitioned scenarios is vital for secure collaborative modeling across institutions. This paper presents \textbf{EVA-S2PMLP}, an Efficient, Verifiable, and Accurate Secure Two-Party Multi-Layer Perceptron framework that introduces spatial-scale optimization for enhanced privacy and performance. To enable reliable computation under real-number domain, EVA-S2PMLP proposes a secure transformation pipeline that maps scalar inputs to vector and matrix spaces while preserving correctness. The framework includes a suite of atomic protocols for linear and non-linear secure computations, with modular support for secure activation, matrix-vector operations, and loss evaluation. Theoretical analysis confirms the reliability, security, and asymptotic complexity of each protocol. Extensive experiments show that EVA-S2PMLP achieves high inference accuracy and significantly reduced communication overhead, with up to $12.3\times$ improvement over baselines. Evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that the framework maintains model utility while ensuring strict data confidentiality, making it a practical solution for privacy-preserving neural network training in finance, healthcare, and cross-organizational AI applications.

*Xiangman Li,Xiaodong Wu,Jianbing Ni,Mohamed Mahmoud,Maazen Alsabaan*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: PDLRecover是一种高效恢复中毒全局模型的方法，利用历史模型信息并保护隐私，避免完全重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法难以恢复已中毒的全局模型，完全重新训练成本高且可能损害一致性和隐私。

Method: 通过线性近似Hessian矩阵计算和秘密共享保护历史更新，结合客户端准备、周期性恢复更新和最终精确更新。

Result: 恢复的全局模型性能接近完全重新训练的模型，计算和时间成本显著降低，且保护了本地模型隐私。

Conclusion: PDLRecover在恢复中毒模型时高效、准确且隐私友好，优于传统重新训练方法。

Abstract: Decentralized learning is vulnerable to poison attacks, where malicious clients manipulate local updates to degrade global model performance. Existing defenses mainly detect and filter malicious models, aiming to prevent a limited number of attackers from corrupting the global model. However, restoring an already compromised global model remains a challenge. A direct approach is to remove malicious clients and retrain the model using only the benign clients. Yet, retraining is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and may compromise model consistency and privacy.
  We propose PDLRecover, a novel method to recover a poisoned global model efficiently by leveraging historical model information while preserving privacy. The main challenge lies in protecting shared historical models while enabling parameter estimation for model recovery. By exploiting the linearity of approximate Hessian matrix computation, we apply secret sharing to protect historical updates, ensuring local models are not leaked during transmission or reconstruction. PDLRecover introduces client-side preparation, periodic recovery updates, and a final exact update to ensure robustness and convergence of the recovered model. Periodic updates maintain accurate curvature information, and the final step ensures high-quality convergence. Experiments show that the recovered global model achieves performance comparable to a fully retrained model but with significantly reduced computation and time cost. Moreover, PDLRecover effectively prevents leakage of local model parameters, ensuring both accuracy and privacy in recovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的广泛应用启发我们探索其用于通信加密的可能性。

Result: CipherMind可应用于网关内传输等场景，理论上支持任何大模型作为基础。

Conclusion: CipherMind为大模型在通信加密领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, the widespread application of large language models has inspired us to consider using inference for communication encryption. We therefore propose CipherMind, which utilizes intermediate results from deterministic fine-tuning of large model inferences as transmission content. The semantic parameters of large models exhibit characteristics like opaque underlying implementations and weak interpretability, thus enabling their use as an encryption method for data transmission. This communication paradigm can be applied in scenarios like intra-gateway transmission, and theoretically, it can be implemented using any large model as its foundation.

This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more capable LLMs.

Conclusion: 本文证明了在LDP框架下，设施位置问题可以实现高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an adaptation of the facility location problem and analyze it within the framework of local differential privacy (LDP). Under this model, we ensure the privacy of client presence at specific locations. When n is the number of points, Gupta et al. established a lower bound of $Ω(\sqrt{n})$ on the approximation ratio for any differentially private algorithm applied to the original facility location problem. As a result, subsequent works have adopted the super-set assumption, which may, however, compromise user privacy. We show that this lower bound does not apply to our adaptation by presenting an LDP algorithm that achieves a constant approximation ratio with a relatively small additive factor. Additionally, we provide experimental results demonstrating that our algorithm outperforms the straightforward approach on both synthetically generated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且低开销，适用于实时检测HT激活。

Abstract: Software-exploitable Hardware Trojans (HTs) enable attackers to execute unauthorized software or gain illicit access to privileged operations. This manuscript introduces a hardware-based methodology for detecting runtime HT activations using Error Correction Codes (ECCs) on a RISC-V microprocessor. Specifically, it focuses on HTs that inject malicious instructions, disrupting the normal execution flow by triggering unauthorized programs. To counter this threat, the manuscript introduces a Hardware Security Checker (HSC) leveraging Hamming Single Error Correction (HSEC) architectures for effective HT detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a 100% detection rate for potential HT activations, with no false positives or undetected attacks. The implementation incurs minimal overhead, requiring only 72 #LUTs, 24 #FFs, and 0.5 #BRAM while maintaining the microprocessor's original operating frequency and introducing no additional time delay.

Abstract: Dataflow neural network accelerators efficiently process AI tasks on FPGAs, with deployment simplified by ready-to-use frameworks and pre-trained models. However, this convenience makes them vulnerable to malicious actors seeking to reverse engineer valuable Intellectual Property (IP) through Side-Channel Attacks (SCA). This paper proposes a methodology to recover the hardware configuration of dataflow accelerators generated with the FINN framework. Through unsupervised dimensionality reduction, we reduce the computational overhead compared to the state-of-the-art, enabling lightweight classifiers to recover both folding and quantization parameters. We demonstrate an attack phase requiring only 337 ms to recover the hardware parameters with an accuracy of more than 95% and 421 ms to fully recover these parameters with an averaging of 4 traces for a FINN-based accelerator running a CNN, both using a random forest classifier on side-channel traces, even with the accelerator dataflow fully loaded. This approach offers a more realistic attack scenario than existing methods, and compared to SoA attacks based on tsfresh, our method requires 940x and 110x less time for preparation and attack phases, respectively, and gives better results even without averaging traces.

Result: 实现了高效、量子安全的提取器，并提供了开源实现和参数计算模块。

Conclusion: 改进后的提取器更实用，适用于实际应用，并支持量子安全性。

Abstract: Randomness extractors are algorithms that distill weak random sources into near-perfect random numbers. Two-source extractors enable this distillation process by combining two independent weak random sources. Raz's extractor (STOC '05) was the first to achieve this in a setting where one source has linear min-entropy (i.e., proportional to its length), while the other has only logarithmic min-entropy in its length. However, Raz's original construction is impractical due to a polynomial computation time of at least degree 4. Our work solves this problem by presenting an improved version of Raz's extractor with quasi-linear computation time, as well as a new analytic theorem with reduced entropy requirements. We provide comprehensive analytical and numerical comparisons of our construction with others in the literature, and we derive strong and quantum-proof versions of our efficient Raz extractor. Additionally, we offer an easy-to-use, open-source code implementation of the extractor and a numerical parameter calculation module.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在检测Rust内存漏洞时能力有限，处理Rust特有类型不足或依赖人工干预。

Method: deepSURF通过替换泛型为自定义类型并生成特质实现，结合LLM动态增强模糊测试用例。

Result: 在27个Rust库中重新发现20个已知漏洞和6个新漏洞，优于现有工具。

Conclusion: deepSURF显著提升Rust内存漏洞检测能力，为不安全代码提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused. Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.
  To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library. Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically, facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20 known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钓鱼网站通过欺骗性结构和品牌冒充等手段逃避检测，现有单智能体分类方法存在幻觉风险和缺乏可解释性。

Method: PhishDebate采用四个代理分别分析URL结构、HTML组成、语义内容和品牌冒充，通过协调器和法官进行结构化辩论。

Result: 在真实钓鱼数据集上，PhishDebate实现了98.2%的召回率和真阳性率，优于单智能体和CoT基线。

Conclusion: PhishDebate通过多智能体辩论框架提高了钓鱼检测的准确性和可解释性，且模块化设计支持灵活配置。

Abstract: Phishing websites continue to pose a significant cybersecurity threat, often leveraging deceptive structures, brand impersonation, and social engineering tactics to evade detection. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled improved phishing detection through contextual understanding, most existing approaches rely on single-agent classification facing the risks of hallucination and lack interpretability or robustness. To address these limitations, we propose PhishDebate, a modular multi-agent LLM-based debate framework for phishing website detection. PhishDebate employs four specialized agents to independently analyze different textual aspects of a webpage--URL structure, HTML composition, semantic content, and brand impersonation--under the coordination of a Moderator and a final Judge. Through structured debate and divergent thinking, the framework delivers more accurate and interpretable decisions. Extensive evaluations on commercial LLMs demonstrate that PhishDebate achieves 98.2% recall and 98.2% True Positive Rate (TPR) on a real-world phishing dataset, and outperforms single-agent and Chain of Thought (CoT) baselines. Additionally, its modular design allows agent-level configurability, enabling adaptation to varying resource and application requirements.

Result: 模拟实验显示开源LLM作为医生助手具有潜力。

Conclusion: 未来将通过与真实医生互动进一步验证MedSyn在诊断准确性和患者结果上的效果。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step, interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种二维并行回火算法（2D-PT），用于解决约束伊辛问题中的混合速度慢和约束强度调优问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊辛机等硬件加速器在采样玻尔兹曼概率分布时面临约束强度难以调优的问题，影响混合速度和可行性。

Method: 通过引入第二维度的副本，插值惩罚强度，确保约束满足，无需显式调优惩罚强度。

Result: 在图形稀疏化和Wishart实例中，2D-PT实现了接近理想的混合速度，显著优于传统PT。

Conclusion: 2D-PT适用于广泛的约束伊辛问题，可直接部署于现有伊辛机。

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.

Conclusion: NetraAI为临床发现提供了一种自适应、可解释的新一代AI方法，结合动态系统和进化学习。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized "species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a 671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM) exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist, forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical discovery.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1) open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters. It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i) domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy data is concluded to be not as effective.

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data, such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多深度存储系统中具有优越性和适应性，适用于不同布局的存储系统。

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts.

TLDR: AZT1D是一个高质量的真实世界数据集，包含25名使用自动胰岛素输送系统的1型糖尿病患者的详细数据，填补了公开数据稀缺的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏公开的详细患者数据，1型糖尿病管理中的数据驱动方法进展受限。

Method: 收集了25名患者的连续血糖监测、胰岛素泵数据、碳水化合物摄入和设备模式等，持续6至8周。

Result: AZT1D提供了丰富的自然数据，支持人工智能和机器学习应用。

Conclusion: AZT1D有助于改善1型糖尿病的临床决策和个性化护理。

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy design, digital twin systems, and glucose prediction models. However, progress in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets that offer detailed and comprehensive patient data. To address this gap, we present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data, carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical decision making and individualized care in T1D.

### [33] [Continuous Evolution Pool: Taming Recurring Concept Drift in Online Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14790)
*Tianxiang Zhan,Ming Jin,Yuanpeng He,Yuxuan Liang,Yong Deng,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为连续进化池（CEP）的机制，用于处理时间序列中重复出现的概念漂移问题，通过存储不同概念的预测器实例来保留知识，并在概念重现时充分利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重复概念漂移是时间序列中常见的问题，现有方法通过参数更新延迟遗忘，但可能导致部分知识丢失且缺乏知识保留机制。

Method: CEP通过选择最接近测试样本的预测器，并从其邻近样本中学习特征（检索过程），若邻近样本不足则生成新模型存储新概念知识，同时清除过时知识。

Result: 在不同架构模型和八个真实数据集上的实验表明，CEP能有效保留不同概念的知识，显著提升重复概念在线预测的效果。

Conclusion: CEP通过知识保留和动态更新机制，显著提升了重复概念漂移场景下的预测性能。

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept. Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the prediction results.

TLDR: 在蛋白质语言模型（PLM）的推理阶段注入dropout层，并通过类似Monte-Carlo dropout的方式平均输出，可以提升零样本预测性能，无需重新训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在不重新训练或微调PLM的情况下，通过简单的方法提升其零样本预测性能。

Method: 在PLM的嵌入层和转换器之间注入dropout层（推理阶段），并通过Monte-Carlo dropout方式平均输出。

Result: 在ProteinGym数据集子集上，零样本性能显著提升，dropout率为0.1时表现最佳。

Conclusion: 推理阶段注入dropout层是一种简单有效的提升PLM零样本性能的方法。

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为“Assembly-of-Experts”（AoE）的新方法，用于高效生成混合专家模型的子模型，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型（LLM）时计算8位权重的成本极高（10^13-10^15 FLOPs），效率低下。为了充分利用预训练模型的资源，作者开发了AoE方法。

Method: AoE方法通过线性时间对父模型的权重张量进行插值，增强或抑制其语义特征，生成功能强大的子模型。

Result: 生成的子模型表现出渐进或突变的行为特征，且几乎每个模型都功能完备。作者构建了DeepSeek R1T“Chimera”模型，性能接近父模型但计算效率更高。

Conclusion: AoE方法无需微调或蒸馏即可生成高效的子模型，展示了紧凑且有序的推理能力。

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new "Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed. Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Motivation: 研究智能系统如何在保持输入识别能力的同时实现广泛泛化，揭示这一权衡的基本限制。

Method: 通过理论推导和实验验证，分析了表示相似性与语义分辨率的关系，并在不同网络中测试了理论的普适性。

Result: 发现了一个通用的Pareto前沿，预测了多输入处理能力的崩溃和非单调最优解，并在不同网络中验证了这一理论。

Conclusion: 有限分辨率相似性是深层网络和大脑中表示能力的基本约束，为泛化与识别的权衡提供了精确理论。

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective -- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff. For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification $p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry. Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and brains alike.

Motivation: 传统Transformer架构在时间序列预测中存在计算复杂度高的问题，ss-Mamba旨在提供一种高效且性能相当的替代方案。

Method: 采用Mamba选择性状态空间模型，结合语义索引嵌入和样条KAN网络，动态捕捉复杂时间特征。

Result: 实验证明ss-Mamba在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性上优于传统Transformer模型，且计算复杂度从二次降至线性。

Conclusion: ss-Mamba是一种高效、多功能的时间序列预测模型，有望替代传统Transformer方法。

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based models in time-series forecasting.

Conclusion: 理论结果通过数值实验验证，为深度学习中优化方法的研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size. As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

Result: VLM在视觉领域表现出与LLM相似的语言提示敏感性，InternVL2家族模型表现最稳健。

Conclusion: 提示敏感性与训练数据相关，PARC为VLM提示分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees, and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models, outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2 family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

Result: 在大规模Favorita数据集上，深度学习路由器（InceptionTime）比单一模型基准提升11.8%准确性，推理速度快4.67倍。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升预测精度，减少缺货和过剩库存，凸显智能自适应AI在供应链优化中的重要性。

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies, effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with 4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

Abstract: This work introduces a growable and modular neural network architecture that naturally avoids catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual reinforcement learning. The structure of each module allows the selective combination of previous policies along with its internal policy, accelerating the learning process on the current task. Unlike previous growing neural network approaches, we show that the number of parameters of the proposed approach grows linearly with respect to the number of tasks, and does not sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted in benchmark continuous control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach achieves greater knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.

Motivation: DXA扫描成本高且耗时，而传统监督学习需要大量数据，但医疗数据获取受限。因此，研究旨在开发一种在数据有限情况下仍能准确预测人体成分的方法。

Method: 使用3D光学图像提取生物标志物（如身高、体积、左小腿周长等），并应用$p$-Laplacian回归模型进行预测。同时对比了支持向量回归（SVR）等监督学习方法。

Result: $p$-Laplacian模型在仅使用10%数据训练时，误差为ALM约13%、BMD约10%、BFP约20%。SVR在80%数据训练时表现最佳，ALM和BMD误差约8%，BFP误差约11%。

Conclusion: $p$-Laplacian模型在数据受限的医疗环境中具有潜力，可作为DXA扫描的替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases. Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc) obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However, most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive, requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM, $\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for 10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of $\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with $\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications, particularly in a data-constrained environment.

Result: 在类似规模的基线模型上，该方法在部分视觉问答（VQA）任务中表现更优，得益于从外部工具获取的详细视觉信息。

Conclusion: 通过GRPO和外部工具的结合，小规模模型在有限计算资源下也能实现更好的视觉推理性能。

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability, vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning, especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface, allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual information gathered from the external tool.

Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）在现实场景中面临分布式数据和隐私要求的挑战，联邦学习（FL）提供了一种解决方案，但现有方法无法适应大规模MLLM。

Method: FedNano将LLM集中在服务器端，客户端仅部署轻量级NanoEdge模块，包含模态特定编码器、连接器和低秩适配器（NanoAdapters），显著减少存储和通信开销。

Result: 实验表明，FedNano减少了95%的客户端存储需求，通信开销仅为模型参数的0.01%，并在性能上优于现有FL基线方法。

Conclusion: FedNano通过轻量化设计解决了MLLM在联邦学习中的可行性问题，为可扩展的分布式多模态AI系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized multimodal AI systems.

Conclusion: 先进的替代模型（如DGP）为高效、稳健的材料设计提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations. This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic, heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics. Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and data-efficient materials design.

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%, demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud computing data centers and edge storage environments.

Conclusion: CACTUS通过消除不相关或有偏数据，为临床医生提供反馈场景，有助于解决偏见并改进诊断。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use. In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports. There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

Method: 提出GRKneg方法，通过选择和生成参考向量优化核函数，无需标签优化模型，仅利用负样本改进核。

Result: GRKneg在少量负样本下显著优于标准OC-SVM和二元SVM。

Conclusion: GRKneg在少量负样本场景下表现优异，为小规模一类分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms the binary SVM.

Motivation: 在线学习在VFL中更具适应性，但数据异步到达和事件驱动的特性被以往研究忽视，需要新方法解决。

Result: 实验证明该框架在非平稳数据下更稳定，同时显著降低通信和计算成本。

Conclusion: 事件驱动的在线VFL框架有效解决了异步数据和非凸模型的挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL, where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated \emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication and computation costs.

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上训练的DP-SGD模型中，该方法实现了更紧的隐私保证下界，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 分位数回归方法有效提升了黑盒设置下DP审计的准确性，且计算效率高。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne}, enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning. Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

Conclusion: 这些通道揭示了全连接层计算能力的意外特性，为理解神经网络优化提供了新视角。

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit: $a_iσ(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_jσ(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \rightarrow σ(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{x}) σ'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities of fully connected layers.

Conclusion: RL在不同领域的适用性存在差异，Guru模型展示了RL在通用推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining data.

Method: 提出Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy（ODD），通过仅在非重叠目标域最大化分歧，避免竞争，并使用域分类器估计域重叠。

Result: 实验表明，ODD在多个基准测试中显著提高了性能估计的准确性，同时保持有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: ODD方法优于现有方法，能够更准确地预测目标域性能，适用于安全智能系统。

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD). Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain, removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart, confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g., imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially other complex diseases.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system performance.

To address this, we introduce a novel probing framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

Conclusion: 研究强调了在临床强化学习中训练稳定性的重要性，并提供了使用CDE编码不规则医学时间序列的实用指南。

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return $\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern. These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training stability in sequential representation learning.

Result: 实验表明，SFT-GO在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，且适用于不同数据集和基础模型。

Conclusion: SFT-GO通过差异化处理token，显著提升了监督微调的效果，具有鲁棒性和普适性。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging token groups and guides the model to better handle different group distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: μP在LLM中的实际应用效果存在争议，理论假设词汇量固定，而实际中词汇量远大于宽度，因此需要研究词汇量对训练动态的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析词汇量对训练动态的影响，提出LV机制，并通过实验验证其优化规则。

Result: 发现LV机制下，嵌入学习率与隐藏学习率的最优比例应为Θ(√宽度)，与μP预测的Θ(宽度)不同，并通过实验验证。

Conclusion: 词汇量对训练动态有显著影响，LV机制提供了更优的缩放规则，有助于提升LLM的预训练效率。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side, $μP$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for larger models without additional tuning. While $μ$P showed impressive results in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $μ$P is the fact that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics \emph{interpolate between the $μ$P regime and another regime that we call Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those predicted by $μ$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $Θ(\sqrt{width})$, surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the literature, and different from the $Θ(width)$ ratio predicted by $μ$P. We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the embedding LR.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3 multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$, with significantly low computational costs.

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$, allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and constrained optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE) while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks, leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur, what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning strategies.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience. However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive traffic control systems.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance (e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category, analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded unlearning verification mechanisms.

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal (non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary 1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model. The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically. Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case. Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

Conclusion: SoKA是一种高效、稳健的大规模模型适应方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence (randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD) procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for large-scale model adaptation.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and $d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a $\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability for real-world litigations.

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented, Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines) onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated, GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation (MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2) the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity, molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological landscapes.

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning performance over the standard single pass inference.

Motivation: 通过预测未检测项目的异常值，实现早期诊断的普及，尤其是利用广泛使用的CBC测试数据。

Conclusion: 该方法有效处理缺失值，连接了LLM与表格领域，为临床诊断提供了新工具。

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making. Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We address the issue by employing a Schrödinger Bridge that interpolates between the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge ($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository https://github.com/stankevich-mipt/seismic_inversion_via_I2SB.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative modeling of molecular structures.

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been (i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space. Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric, but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances, leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating promising results.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and vaccination algorithms.

Conclusion: VXAI框架为XAI评估提供了灵活的基础，有助于未来扩展和方法比较。

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection, promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for future extensions.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling. Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show improved performance over memory-free baselines.

Conclusion: RHO通过自适应学习同质性，提升了半监督图异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences. This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight, quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series comparison.

Conclusion: PRISM通过支持多义性特征描述，显著改进了神经网络特征解释的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable, data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive, user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: AutoRule是一种自动化方法，从人类偏好反馈中提取规则并转化为规则奖励，显著提升强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于规则的奖励方法依赖人工设计规则，AutoRule旨在自动化这一过程，减少人工干预。

Method: AutoRule分三阶段：1) 用推理模型解释用户偏好；2) 从解释链中提取候选规则；3) 合成统一规则集，并用语言模型验证规则满足度作为辅助奖励。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B模型上，AutoRule使AlpacaEval2.0的胜率提升28.6%，MT-Bench子集第二轮性能提升6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoRule提取的规则与数据集偏好一致，减少奖励作弊，并能捕捉不同数据集的独特价值。

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\% relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a 6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset, compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at https://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust, interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

Motivation: 探究SAE中密集潜在特征的几何、功能和起源，验证其是否为训练过程中的不良产物。

Method: 系统分析密集潜在特征的几何结构、功能及其在残差空间中的起源，提出分类法并研究其在不同层中的演化。

Conclusion: 密集潜在特征在语言模型计算中具有功能性作用，不应被视为训练噪声。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful. However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be dismissed as training noise.

TLDR: 论文分析了时空图神经网络（STGNNs）中的信息传播问题，特别是时空过压缩现象，揭示了其与静态图的不同特性，并提供了理论支持和实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管图神经网络（GNNs）在多个领域取得了成功，但其信息传播能力存在局限性，如过压缩问题。在时空图神经网络（STGNNs）中，这一问题尚未被研究，而时间维度加剧了信息传播的挑战。

Method: 论文形式化了时空过压缩问题，分析了卷积STGNNs的信息传播特性，并比较了不同处理范式（时间-空间或时间优先）的影响。

Result: 研究发现，卷积STGNNs倾向于传播时间上较远而非较近的信息，且不同处理范式均受此现象影响。理论分析支持了计算高效实现的合理性。

Conclusion: 论文通过合成和真实数据集验证了发现，为STGNNs的设计提供了理论指导和实践建议。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information. While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG模型可能依赖记忆数据而非检索信息的问题，确保模型真正利用外部信息。

Method: 通过比较仅使用查询的推理路径和使用查询及检索上下文的推理路径的KL散度，判断检索信息的影响。

Result: 在Prompt-WNQA基准测试中，RePCS的ROC-AUC达到0.918，优于之前方法6.5个百分点，延迟开销低于4.7%。

Conclusion: RePCS提供了一种轻量级、黑盒化的方法，验证RAG系统是否有效利用检索信息，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic, requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight, black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: 本文简化了SGD的理论分析，使其更易理解，并为未来研究提供了更便捷的工具。

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools, bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the training of realistic models.

Conclusion: 计算或多项式质量特征集对线性时间可计算函数（即使基于策略轨迹观测）不存在，揭示了学习此类函数的限制。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate \textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}. Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints. While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of agents and suites of environments.

Conclusion: DAILOC有效解决了域偏移和灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了室内定位的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder. Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time. Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error, 3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to prior DL-based models.

Conclusion: MicroRicci在实时性和资源受限的应用中表现出色，适用于图形学和仿真等领域。

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes, MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup), tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates, automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in graphics, simulation, and related fields.

Result: 实验表明，DP-GRAPE在预训练Vision Transformers和微调RoBERTa-Large时分别减少63%和70%内存使用，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE在降低内存开销的同时，实现了与DP-SGD相当的隐私-效用权衡，并能扩展到数十亿参数的大模型。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2) random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with up to 6.7 billion parameters.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However, the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing. To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns. This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies: centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models. Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AWR方法在离线数据质量差时学习保守策略的问题，提升策略优化的性能。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，CAWR显著提升了策略优化的性能。

Conclusion: CAWR能有效解决数据质量差导致的保守策略问题，提升离线强化学习的效果。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues, such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption, specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance of policy optimization.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 该研究构建了一个针对老年患者出院摘要中不良事件（AE）提取的手动标注语料库，填补了临床NLP资源中老年人群的空白。标注支持不连续和重叠实体，评估了多种模型在不同粒度下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 老年患者在临床NLP资源中代表性不足，研究旨在填补这一空白，并提供支持复杂标注的语料库。

Method: 使用FlairNLP评估多种模型（如BERT）在细粒度、粗粒度及带否定的粗粒度标注下的性能。

Result: BERT在粗粒度任务上表现优异（F1=0.943），但在细粒度任务（如罕见事件和复杂属性）上表现下降（F1=0.675）。

Conclusion: 尽管整体性能较高，但在检测代表性不足的AE和捕捉临床语言细微差别方面仍存在挑战。数据集为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) 通过结合约束和非约束解码的两阶段方法，提升结构化 NLP 任务的输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练时未明确考虑约束，导致测试时约束解码的输出质量较低。

Method: BoostCD 分两阶段：阶段一通过基础模型分别进行约束和非约束解码，阶段二通过学习的增强模型结合两种预测。

Result: BoostIE 在封闭信息提取任务中表现优于现有方法，解决了常见错误。

Conclusion: BoostCD 通过互补性错误利用，显著提升了结构化 NLP 任务的性能。

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training, these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model $M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE, outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors identified in those approaches.

Conclusion: CrEst能有效评估文档可信度，并在高噪声条件下保持稳健性能。

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

Motivation: 当前缺乏针对多文档推理的评估基准，且传统方法标注成本高。

Method: 提出一种基于结构化种子知识的合成生成技术，利用LLM辅助编辑生成挑战性文档集和QA示例。

Result: MDBench对现有LLM和提示技术均构成显著挑战，即使文档集较短。

Conclusion: 知识引导的生成技术能快速适应新挑战，支持针对性分析多文档推理能力。

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD) reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA) examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge, modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1) allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and future modeling improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习和深度学习模型已广泛用于糖尿病预测，但LLMs在结构化数值数据中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用Pima Indian Diabetes Database（PIDD）进行实证分析，评估六种LLMs（四种开源，两种专有）和三种传统机器学习模型，采用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数作为评估指标。

Result: 专有LLMs表现优于开源模型，GPT-4o和Gemma-2-27B在少样本设置中准确率最高，Gemma-2-27B的F1分数超过传统模型。

Conclusion: LLMs在医疗预测任务中具有潜力，未来需优化提示工程和混合方法以提升性能。

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably, Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score. However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

Motivation: 探索LLM在不修改权重的情况下精确重建文本的能力，并评估其潜在应用。

Method: 引入特殊记忆令牌，通过训练优化其嵌入，使模型能根据嵌入重建固定序列。

Result: 在英语和西班牙语数据集、最长240个令牌的序列及100M到8B参数的模型规模下均成功实现重建。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM的有趣能力，为基于记忆的检索、压缩和受控文本生成提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Motivation: 社会隔离和孤独感近年显著增加，与自杀率密切相关，但未被美国国家暴力死亡报告系统（NVDRS）记录。

Method: 使用主题建模生成词典，结合监督学习分类器，分析2002-2020年30万自杀案例。

Result: 开发出高质量分类器（F1:0.86，准确率:0.82），识别出1,198例慢性社会隔离案例，男性、同性恋或离婚者风险更高。

Conclusion: 该方法可改进美国社会隔离和孤独感的监测与预防。

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over 300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR = 3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001). We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up. Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and loneliness in the United States.

Motivation: 现有方法在评估开放式长文本生成时难以全面衡量质量（如连贯性、风格、相关性），且易受预训练数据偏差影响。

Method: 提出PrefBERT，基于多样长文本风格和Likert评分的数据集训练，为GRPO提供语义奖励反馈。

Result: PrefBERT在多句子和段落长度响应中表现可靠，与人类偏好对齐，优于传统指标。

Conclusion: PrefBERT作为奖励信号训练策略模型，生成的响应更符合人类偏好，代码已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality, PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，事后遗忘特定知识的需求日益增长，涉及隐私法规和纠正错误内容等场景。现有研究通常假设训练过程和目标模型固定，而本研究聚焦学习时知识编码对遗忘效果的影响。

Method: 通过实验研究学习时知识编码方式对遗忘效果的影响，重点关注转述描述学习和文本块中单个知识的遗忘难度。

Result: 实验表明：（1）使用转述描述学习能提升遗忘性能；（2）遗忘文本块中的单个知识仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 学习时的知识编码方式对实现可靠的事后遗忘至关重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world, the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc, has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2) unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging. Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

Result: 在STAC和Molweni数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了对话中的歧义问题，提升了话语解析性能。

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore, we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings.

Result: 两阶段框架显著提升小模型的响应多样性和质量（最高提升90%），接近大模型表现。

Conclusion: 显式建模一对多特性可有效提升对话代理性能，为小模型优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity, most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS), which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context. Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

Result: 实验显示，Thunder-Tok比BPE减少10%的分词数量，推理速度提升10%，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 基于语言学的方法设计高效分词器是可行且实用的。

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

Conclusion: Mamba模型的记忆机制由稀疏通道、Delta调制递归和语义规律共同作用，揭示了序列处理中记忆的动态特性。

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks, including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).

TLDR: ProtoReasoning框架通过抽象推理原型提升大语言模型的推理能力，实验显示在多个任务上优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型推理模型跨领域泛化能力的机制，假设共享的抽象推理原型是关键。

Method: 提出ProtoReasoning框架，包括自动化原型构建、验证系统和原型空间扩展。

Result: 在逻辑推理、规划任务、一般推理和数学任务上分别提升4.7%、6.3%、4.0%和1.0%。

Conclusion: 验证了推理原型是大型语言模型泛化推理的基础，原型空间学习优于自然语言表示。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: MinosEval是一种新的开放性问题回答评估方法，通过区分事实性和非事实性问题，采用不同的评分策略，提高了评估的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放性问题回答（QA）需要更长的答案和更细致的推理，传统评估方法如ROUGE和BERTScore难以捕捉语义相似性，现有LLM评估方法缺乏直观可解释性，且未区分问题类型。

Method: MinosEval首先区分事实性和非事实性问题，对前者采用自适应关键点评分策略，对后者采用实例感知的列表排序策略。

Result: 在多个开放QA数据集上的实验表明，MinosEval更符合人工标注结果，并提供更可解释的评估。

Conclusion: MinosEval通过区分问题类型和采用针对性策略，显著提升了开放QA评估的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets, including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers more interpretable results.

Result: 实验显示，语言变体（尤其是巴斯克语）导致性能下降，且编码器模型对西部巴斯克语表现较差。

Conclusion: 语言变体对模型性能有显著影响，尤其是西部巴斯克语，验证了语言学理论。所有数据和代码已公开。

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants. Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque, which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g., Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly available.

Result: Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B模型在关系提取任务中表现最佳（F1=0.68），GraphRAG集成模型在开放域数据集上提升F1值11%。

Conclusion: Graph RAG框架为古典文本知识提取提供低资源解决方案，推动历史知识服务和人文研究发展。

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction, reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B, with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12), effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and humanities research.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model (LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence. Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation in large-scale RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前韩国法院判决去标识化方法无法满足大规模处理需求，且法律定义模糊，需技术解决方案。

Method: 构建首个韩国法律数据集，系统分类PII，开发DNN去标识化流程。

Result: 模型在去标识化任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID框架有效解决法律与技术需求间的矛盾。

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the de-identification of court judgments.

Method: 综述分析了LLM在试验-患者匹配任务中的应用，包括现有方法、评估框架及技术挑战。

Result: 发现现有LLM辅助方法依赖专有模型和弱评估基准，需改进。

Conclusion: LLM在临床试验招募中潜力巨大，但需解决评估和技术挑战以实现广泛应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet, their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

Result: 方法在低资源语言的跨领域数据上提升了3.2%的语言识别性能。

Conclusion: 监督对比学习能有效提升低资源语言的语言识别性能，尤其是在跨领域场景中。

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Conclusion: 行为测试揭示临床LLMs推理策略，有助于设计更安全透明的医疗AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Result: 测试显示，许多模型在处理文化相关查询时表现不佳，尤其在地区特定背景下。

Conclusion: SANSKRITI为评估和改进语言模型的文化理解能力设定了新标准。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity. Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language, art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive, culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Result: COSMMIC数据集成功整合文本、图片和用户反馈，为印度语言的NLP研究提供了新资源。

Conclusion: COSMMIC通过多模态和多语言整合，推动了印度语言的NLP研究，促进了包容性。

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and (4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images, and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在大型语言模型中表现不佳的问题，尤其是跨语言词汇对齐的挑战。

Method: 采用TLI方法，结合LoRA（Low-Rank Adaptation）和对比学习目标，针对早期层（如第2层）的嵌入进行微调。

Result: TLI显著提升了623个斯瓦希里语-英语词汇对的词汇对齐效果（相似度从0.3211提升至0.4113），并在未见过的词汇对中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TLI是一种参数高效且有效的方法，能够增强模型在低资源语言中的跨语言词汇对齐能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach. We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set). TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17 x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.

Result: 推理步骤增加会提高模型回答的谨慎性，但同时导致更详细的推理痕迹和更多隐私泄露。

Conclusion: 安全措施需扩展到模型的内部推理过程，而不仅是最终输出。

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However, current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design, cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME (nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty, particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex reasoning scenarios.

Conclusion: RE-IMAGINE为评估LLMs的推理能力提供了新方法，揭示了其局限性，并推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations, interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation, RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs, and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为CINGS的后训练监督方法，通过将相关上下文附加到响应前并仅计算响应标记的损失，增强大语言模型在外部上下文中的生成能力。实验表明，CINGS在文本和视觉领域均显著提升了模型的生成准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时简单附加上下文无法确保生成内容与上下文一致，因此需要一种更有效的方法来增强模型的生成能力。

Method: 提出CINGS方法，在训练时将相关上下文附加到响应前，仅计算响应标记的损失并屏蔽上下文。

Result: 在文本领域，CINGS在11个信息检索数据集上表现优于其他方法；在视觉语言领域，CINGS减少了幻觉并保持事实一致性。

Conclusion: CINGS通过改变模型的先验知识和行为，隐式鼓励模型更依赖外部上下文，从而在不影响下游任务性能的情况下提升生成准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime, compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research and reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夸张和隐喻在自然语言处理中具有重要意义，但由于语义模糊和表达多样性，检测难度大。现有方法多关注表面特征，忽略了情感关联和双向交互的作用。

Method: EmoBi框架包含情感分析模块、情感域映射模块和双向动态交互模块，通过情感引导和动态交互提升检测效果，并设计了验证机制确保准确性。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，EmoBi优于基线方法，F1分数在TroFi数据集上提升28.1%（夸张检测），在HYPO-L数据集上提升23.1%（隐喻检测）。

Conclusion: EmoBi框架通过情感引导和双向交互显著提升了夸张和隐喻检测的效果，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets. Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

TLDR: RATTENTION是一种结合局部注意力和线性注意力的新方法，旨在解决局部注意力忽略窗口外信息的局限性，并在性能和效率之间取得更好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决局部注意力完全忽略窗口外信息的固有局限性，提升短上下文场景下的效率。

Method: 提出RATTENTION，结合局部注意力和线性注意力机制，捕获窗口外信息。

Result: 在3B和12B规模预训练中，RATTENTION以512窗口大小匹配全注意力模型性能，并在长上下文任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: RATTENTION在保持训练效率的同时，显著提升了局部-全局注意力模型的性能与效率平衡。

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: 在AG News分类任务中，性能从65%提升至80%；在MSMARCO微调任务中，困惑度从3.3降至2.3。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效恢复有用数据，接近原始模型性能，为数据近似问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task, our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%, approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3, compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在实时语音聊天中因生成第一句话导致的延迟问题，尤其是在计算能力有限的消费级硬件上。

Method: 提出PredGen框架，利用预测性解码在用户说话时生成候选响应，提前开始TTS处理。

Result: 在Lmsys和MT-Bench数据集上的模拟实验显示，该方法能有效减少约2倍的延迟，且额外计算成本极低。

Conclusion: PredGen显著降低了LLMs在实时语音应用中的延迟，提升了用户体验，且计算开销可控。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions, we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs. GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner是一种高效且性能优越的多句子场景图解析方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline, high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/ShaoqLin/DiscoSG

Conclusion: 研究突显了长上下文多模态推理的挑战，WikiMixQA将成为推动文档理解研究的重要基准。

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics. Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context, multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for advancing document understanding research.

Conclusion: 当前模型在葡萄牙语MCQ生成中表现良好，但需改进语义清晰度和干扰项设计以提升实用性。

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention -- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks. To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases. Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

Method: 通过三个实验比较英式和美式英语使用者对强化词的理解，并开发计算认知模型分析听者对说话者意图的递归推理。

Result: 模型显示跨文化差异由字面意义和话语成本权重的不同组合导致，挑战了仅基于语义或礼貌规范的解释。

Conclusion: 跨文化理解差异是字面意义与语用因素复杂互动的结果，需综合考虑两者。

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper, we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity, politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

Method: 提出Ordered CommonGen基准，通过有序覆盖率评估模型表现，并对36种大语言模型进行全面分析。

Result: 发现模型虽能理解指令意图，但对特定顺序模式的偏好导致输出多样性低，最优模型仅实现约75%的有序覆盖率。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在指令遵循和组合泛化能力上仍需改进，Ordered CommonGen为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts. However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在推理任务中一致性和鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: 引入Cohort-based Consistency Learning（CC-Learn），通过强化学习优化复合目标（包括同类问题准确性、检索奖励和拒绝惩罚）。

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和StrategyQA等基准测试中，CC-Learn显著提升了模型的准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: CC-Learn通过同类强化学习有效提升了LLM的推理一致性。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent, robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning. Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks (including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

Motivation: 性别包容性机器翻译需保留源语言的性别模糊性，避免误判性别和代表性伤害。

Method: 评估21个MT系统在三种翻译方向中对性别模糊的敏感度，分类并讨论实际观察到的性别中立策略。

Result: 多数系统缺乏性别中立翻译，少数系统根据目标语言采用特定策略。

Conclusion: 性别中立翻译在性别模糊情况下表现不佳，但部分系统展示了可行的策略。

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English, maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific strategies, depending on the target language.

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升性能，超越开源和闭源的大型视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GenRecal为跨架构知识蒸馏提供了一种有效解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios, particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size, token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.

Result: 在LLaMA、Gemma和Mistral家族数据上的实验显示，PhantomHunter优于7种基线方法和3种工业服务，F1分数超过96%。

Conclusion: PhantomHunter能有效检测私有调优LLM生成的文本，为解决LLM滥用问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance. Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora, resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice. To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores of over 96%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典二值逻辑无法捕捉人类决策的细微差别，且在多模态环境中需要人工干预。神经网络虽能提取多模态信息，但缺乏可解释的推理结构。CALM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CALM通过领域树表示谓词，利用神经网络迭代优化其模拟真值，并通过符号推理模块确保约束满足。

Conclusion: CALM展示了在多模态环境中结合逻辑结构与神经网络的潜力，为下一代AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM). CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments, which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception, creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural networks.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation. Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical for CMARL on MEAL.

Conclusion: T-PPO通过优化训练流程和减少冗余计算，显著提升了推理LLM的训练效率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths. In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and outperforms its existing competitors.

Conclusion: HeurAgenix展示了LLM在组合优化中的潜力，提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce \textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity, we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception, enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring, disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination. The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy learning in decentralised EO missions.

Conclusion: 通过无人机和船舶的协作，结合Lyapunov优化和马尔可夫博弈，能够高效处理海上物联网的不确定任务需求。

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements. However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks. Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. 
By converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. 
Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing computational offloading and resource allocation.

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality, introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e., the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play over time, or both.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys. Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing ethical challenges.

TLDR: 论文探讨了大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂问题解决中的效率问题，提出了两种轻量级方法以减少冗余推理，同时保持或提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在模拟人类深思熟虑的思维时，常因生成冗余内容（即过度思考）而降低效率和增加推理成本。研究发现，LRMs本身具备更简洁推理的潜力。

Method: 1. 提出Efficiency Steering，一种无需训练的激活导向技术，通过模型表示空间中的单一方向调节推理行为。2. 开发Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL，一个强化学习框架，通过奖励简洁正确的解决方案动态平衡任务准确性和简洁性。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，七种LRM骨干网络的实验表明，方法显著减少了推理长度，同时保持或提升了任务性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过自我引导方式利用和指导现有模型的固有能力，可以显著提高推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work, we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency, revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning. Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

Result: 在六项任务中表现优异，如TravelPlanner基准测试中相对ADAS提升261.8%。

Conclusion: SwarmAgentic为可扩展和自主的代理系统设计迈出重要一步，结合了群体智能与自动化生成。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates, drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured, human-interpretable queries.

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc有效解决了3D语义占据预测中的关键问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS) methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms, the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However, the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level, temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization, temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated video content.

Conclusion: MonoVQD通过创新方法显著提升了单目3D检测性能，并具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions. First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在图表到代码生成任务中表现不佳，需要同时具备精确的视觉理解和准确的代码翻译能力。

Method: 通过区分视觉理解和代码翻译两个任务，设计描述和差异两种结构化指令，并将生成流程分解为初始代码生成和迭代优化两个阶段。

Result: 实验表明，ChartIR在开源模型Qwen2-VL和闭源模型GPT-4o上均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: ChartIR通过结构化指令和迭代优化显著提升了图表到代码生成的性能。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities. While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose {ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction. First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of structured instructions: description and difference. The description instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement, enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

Conclusion: PictSure通过优化嵌入模型，在跨域少样本分类任务中表现优异，同时保持域内任务的竞争力。

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings. In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels. Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems, offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications, including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation. Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks, proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

Conclusion: UPNet方法在无需额外训练的情况下，能有效泛化到新物体类别的视角选择任务。

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS) for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network, named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods. Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400 times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional training.

Conclusion: DPO-Kernels有效提升模型对齐性，DETONATE和AQI为未来研究提供工具。

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models (LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately 100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically, we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are publicly released.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Conclusion: FCRE方法有效解决了医学图像扩散模型的隐私风险评估问题。

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns. Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information, remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep learning research in this domain.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering, agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to estimate.

Conclusion: PALETTE和SynthMap+为历史地图文本提取提供了高效解决方案，支持大规模地图搜索和分析。

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2) training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching. The project is released at https://github.com/kartta-foundation/mapkurator-palette-doc.

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer框架在风格迁移领域取得了突破性进展，为艺术家级别的风格迁移提供了新方法。

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap. This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer process for the first time.

Conclusion: 该方法显著改善了向量量化的性能，解决了关键问题。

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data. While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation, which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor, and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments. However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision. Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively. The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across various medical domains.

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision. Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast, generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and practical adoption, we openly release our code.

Method: 提出PSIC方法，结合CLTG模块和UAEO优化函数，实现多解码选项和隐私保护。

Result: 实验证明PSIC在多种下游任务中有效保护隐私并保持图像质量。

Conclusion: PSIC是一种灵活、可插拔的图像压缩方案，能同时满足隐私保护和图像质量需求。

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP) models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态医学图像融合方法在特征捕获和跨模态交互方面表现不足，导致融合图像质量不理想。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段通过扩散过程训练UNet进行图像重建；第二阶段将不同噪声步骤的图像输入融合网络，并集成三个关键融合模块。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在客观评价指标上表现优异，融合图像亮度、放射性示踪剂分布、纹理和边缘清晰度均得到提升。

Conclusion: DM-FNet通过两阶段扩散模型和融合模块，显著提高了多模态医学图像融合的质量和信息密度。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability. Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness, color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code is available at https://github.com/HeDan-11/DM-FNet.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size.

Conclusion: C-AFBiFPN框架有效解决了SAR船舶检测的挑战，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing. Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges, including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets, robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF在复杂相机轨迹下表现出高效性和鲁棒性，为3D重建和SLAM任务提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories. Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于历史知识动态调制的伪装目标检测方法RetroMem，通过两阶段训练范式显著提升模型性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏历史上下文机制，难以适应复杂伪装场景。

Method: 采用两阶段训练范式（学习阶段和回忆阶段），结合DMA和DMM/IPR模块动态调制感知与推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RetroMem通过历史知识整合有效提升了伪装目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct, update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DBACS方法能有效提升领域自适应技术在半导体领域的应用，减少资源消耗并提高性能。

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry 4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for the semiconductor field.

Motivation: 现有基于INR的视频压缩方法在细节密集和快速变化内容上表现不佳，主要原因是网络特征利用不足和缺乏视频特定设计。

Method: 提出MSNeRV框架，包括时间窗口增强时间一致性、GoP级背景表示、多尺度空间解码器和尺度自适应损失函数，以及多尺度特征块。

Result: 在HEVC ClassB和UVG数据集上测试，MSNeRV在动态场景中的压缩效率超越了VTM-23.7。

Conclusion: MSNeRV在神经视频表示中表现出色，尤其在动态场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7 (Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on 2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization (ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code will be available.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs.

Conclusion: OpenPath通过高效样本选择和避免分布外数据，显著降低了标注成本并提升了病理图像分类性能。

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

Motivation: 解决视频中开放世界目标计数的挑战，特别是在拥挤场景中避免重复计数和识别重现目标。

Method: 提出CountVid模型，结合图像计数和可提示视频分割跟踪技术。

Result: 在VideoCount数据集上，CountVid表现优于基线方法，提供准确的目标计数。

Conclusion: CountVid和VideoCount数据集为开放世界视频目标计数任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the CountVid model, and all the code are available at https://github.com/niki-amini-naieni/CountVid/.

Result: 在Saimaa环斑海豹和豹子数据集上，重识别准确率提升高达5.4%。

Conclusion: 几何感知的纹理映射方法能有效提升动物个体重识别的鲁棒性，适用于多种姿态和视角。

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space, enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy.

Conclusion: DDIS通过结合扩散模型和领域对齐技术，有效解决了数据无关图像合成中的分布偏差问题，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications, but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data. However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA performance in data-free applications.

Result: 在Kvasir和GastroVision等胃肠道影像基准测试中，NERO优于现有OOD检测方法。

Conclusion: NERO通过神经元级相关性提升了OOD检测能力，为医学影像中的模型可靠性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this, we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability. Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.

Conclusion: GenHOI通过两阶段框架和接触感知机制，成功解决了4D HOI合成的挑战。

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets. Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models. Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI generation.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this, we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE \textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module (Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated utility for downstream medical imaging task.

Conclusion: RaCalNet证明了稀疏监督的可行性，能够生成结构一致且细节丰富的深度图，优于密集监督方法。

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods, producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%, respectively.

Conclusion: WinWinLay通过理论分析和创新策略，显著提升了布局到图像生成的质量。

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core, WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue, non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores, facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity, outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督下高效处理高分辨率影像，显著提升分割性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on 1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery, which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing segmentation approaches.

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模AGB估计提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，减少了对预处理工具的依赖，并确立了ULS作为TLS的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale, non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless, end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

Motivation: 临床中多模态图像配准（如PET-MRI）因模态差异大，传统无监督方法难以学习可靠空间映射，导致图像失真。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上，M2M-Reg在PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准中DSC指标比现有方法提升2倍。

Conclusion: M2M-Reg有效解决高度异质多模态配准问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images. We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only, without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

Conclusion: HOIDiNi能够仅通过文本提示生成复杂且可控的交互动作，展示了其在人-物交互生成中的潜力。

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions, including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

Conclusion: 该基准测试为长期记忆和推理任务提供了可扩展的评估框架，并指出了改进方向。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for improvement.

Motivation: 探讨视觉输入质量如何影响MLLMs的表现，揭示现有模型对图像质量的偏好与人类感知不一致的现象。

Method: 通过控制图像退化与风格变化，研究MLLMs的表现；提出VQ-TTT模块，动态调整图像频率内容，仅微调浅层视觉编码器。

Result: 发现视觉质量与模型性能之间存在矛盾；VQ-TTT显著提升了所有测试MLLMs和数据集的平均准确率。

Conclusion: MLLMs需要自适应而非普遍“干净”的视觉输入，VQ-TTT为这一需求提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable, low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content; and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets, VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally ``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving VLM pipelines.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

In this paper, we introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location, scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

Conclusion: ECAD是一种可扩展且泛化性强的扩散模型加速方法，适用于不同模型和分辨率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference.

Abstract: The explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as GPT-4 with 1.8 trillion parameters - demands a radical rethinking of data center architecture to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth and capacity, multiple network topologies (two-tier vs. FullFlat optical), the size of the scale-out domain, and popular parallelism/optimization strategies used in LLMs. We introduce and evaluate FullFlat network architectures, which provide uniform high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between all nodes, and demonstrate their transformative impact on performance and scalability. Through detailed sensitivity analyses, we quantify the benefits of overlapping compute and communication, leveraging hardware-accelerated collectives, wider scale-out domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens per sec / Peak flops of the hardware) and overall throughput. For the co-design study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements. Our findings offer actionable insights and a practical roadmap for designing AI data centers that can efficiently support trillion-parameter models, reduce optimization complexity, and sustain the rapid evolution of AI capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将LLM应用的资源需求视为黑箱，导致端到端效率低下，需要更准确的建模和优化方法。

Method: 使用PDGraph建模LLM应用的资源需求，并基于Gittins策略优化调度顺序，同时利用PDGraph模型预热后端。

Result: 实验表明，Hermes能将平均完成时间降低70%以上，P95完成时间降低80%以上。

Conclusion: PDGraph和Hermes为LLM应用的高效服务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80%.

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose, CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However, because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+ with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates (5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our proposals can be run via our code available at: https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

Motivation: 现有群组识别方法未能充分建模用户群组层次和项目层次兴趣的协同演化关系，导致推荐效果受限。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，CI4GI显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: CI4GI通过建模双层次兴趣协同演化关系，有效提升了群组推荐的性能。

Abstract: With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of users are joining group activities on online social platforms. This elicits the requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在识别重大事件如何重塑媒体叙事结构，捕捉公共话语的语义变化。

Method: 通过构建名词短语的共现图，利用Vietoris-Rips过滤生成持续图，计算Wasserstein距离和持续熵来量化语义变化。

Result: 结果显示，重大事件与H0和H1维度的突然变化相关，表明叙事结构的重组。

Conclusion: 持续同调提供了一种无监督的数学方法，可实时检测公共话语的结构变化。

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse? This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during crises, protests, and information shocks.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）代理的自动超参数调优方法，用于改进WS-PSO-CM算法在无人机通信中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前WS-PSO-CM算法的超参数调优方法依赖启发式，自动化程度低且性能不佳，因此需要更高效的自动调优方法。

Method: 设计了一个LLM代理，通过迭代框架和模型上下文协议（MCP）自动调优超参数，代理通过配置文件初始化，并根据提示需求驱动WS-PSO-CM算法进行探索。

Result: 实验表明，LLM代理生成的超参数在最小和速率上显著优于人工启发式和随机生成方法。

Conclusion: 具备PSO知识和WS-PSO-CM背景的LLM代理能有效找到高性能超参数。

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM) algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining.

Abstract: Ferry quays experience rapid deterioration due to their exposure to harsh maritime environments and ferry impacts. Vibration-based structural health monitoring offers a valuable approach to assessing structural integrity and understanding the structural implications of these impacts. However, practical limitations often restrict sensor placement at critical locations. Consequently, virtual sensing techniques become essential for establishing a Digital Twin and estimating the structural response. This study investigates the application of the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual sensing on the Magerholm ferry quay, combining in-operation experimental data collected during a ferry impact with a detailed physics-based model. The proposed Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrates a reduced-order structural model with a data-driven GPLFM representing the unknown impact forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone. A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types, sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios. The results suggest that the GP latent forces can help accommodate modeling and measurement uncertainties, maintaining acceptable estimation accuracy across scenarios.

Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies. However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models, hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically, researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17 state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent correlations between tasks, identifies top-performing models, and provides a streamlined evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: DrRL成功结合SL和CCL的优点，并解决了它们的局限性，提升了推荐模型性能。

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2) Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging Rényi-divergence in DRO optimization. DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在SNN中有效整合突触延迟，性能优越，为理解突触机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do, synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the interplay between synaptic efficacy and delay.

Abstract: Summary: Errors in gradient trajectories introduce significant artifacts and distortions in magnetic resonance images, particularly in non-Cartesian imaging sequences, where imperfect gradient waveforms can greatly reduce image quality. Purpose: Our objective is to develop a general, nonlinear gradient system model that can accurately predict gradient distortions using convolutional networks. Methods: A set of training gradient waveforms were measured on a small animal imaging system, and used to train a temporal convolutional network to predict the gradient waveforms produced by the imaging system. Results: The trained network was able to accurately predict nonlinear distortions produced by the gradient system. Network prediction of gradient waveforms was incorporated into the image reconstruction pipeline and provided improvements in image quality and diffusion parameter mapping compared to both the nominal gradient waveform and the gradient impulse response function. Conclusion: Temporal convolutional networks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing linear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.

Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required. We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives, including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design heuristic and genetic optimization.

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the 15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate, uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step, input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting the limitations of integer-order representations.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved speech recognition performance greatly by exploiting localized time-frequency patterns. But these patterns are assumed to appear in symmetric and rigid kernels by the conventional CNN operation. It motivates the question: What about asymmetric kernels? In this study, we illustrate adaptive views can discover local features which couple better with attention than fixed views of the input. We replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable counterpart, dubbed this "Deformer". By analyzing our best-performing model, we visualize both local receptive fields and global attention maps learned by the Deformer and show increased feature associations on the utterance level. The statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the change of information in features with the network depth. Finally, replacing only half of the layers in the encoder, the Deformer improves +5.6% relative WER without a LM and +6.4% relative WER with a LM over the Conformer baseline on the WSJ eval92 set.

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

TLDR: MixRep是一种基于mixup的数据增强策略，用于低资源ASR，通过插值隐藏表示的特征维度，结合时间轴正则化，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源自动语音识别（ASR）中数据不足的问题，提升模型泛化能力。

Method: MixRep插值神经网络隐藏表示的特征维度，并结合时间轴正则化，应用于Conformer编码器和E2E LAS架构。

Result: 在WSJ和SWB数据集上，MixRep相比SpecAugment基线，WER相对降低6.5%和6.7%。

Conclusion: MixRep是一种简单有效的数据增强方法，显著提升低资源ASR性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present MixRep, a simple and effective data augmentation strategy based on mixup for low-resource ASR. MixRep interpolates the feature dimensions of hidden representations in the neural network that can be applied to both the acoustic feature input and the output of each layer, which generalizes the previous MixSpeech method. Further, we propose to combine the mixup with a regularization along the time axis of the input, which is shown as complementary. We apply MixRep to a Conformer encoder of an E2E LAS architecture trained with a joint CTC loss. We experiment on the WSJ dataset and subsets of the SWB dataset, covering reading and telephony conversational speech. Experimental results show that MixRep consistently outperforms other regularization methods for low-resource ASR. Compared to a strong SpecAugment baseline, MixRep achieves a +6.5\% and a +6.7\% relative WER reduction on the eval92 set and the Callhome part of the eval'2000 set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未充分探索语音大语言模型（LLM）在多通道音频和空间线索理解方面的能力。

Method: 提出了两种关键技术：序列化定向输出训练（S-DOT）和对比方向数据增强（CDDA）。

Result: 实验结果表明，directional-SpeechLlama能有效捕捉文本线索与空间音频的关系，在语音识别和声源定位任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为语音LLM在多通道音频处理中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that prompting large language models (LLM) with audio encodings enables effective speech recognition capabilities. However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research. In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech recognition, source localization, and bystander cross-talk suppression. To enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive direction data augmentation (CDDA). Experimental results show that our proposed directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition and source localization tasks.

TLDR: HAC是一种分层音频编解码器，通过单一模型将瓶颈分解为声学、语音和词汇三个层次，利用知识蒸馏目标实现语音和词汇信息的解耦。


<details>

Motivation: 提出一种统一的离散语音表示方法，以桥接声学细节和词汇意义，支持下游语音生成和理解任务。

Method: 使用预训练的语音编码器（HuBERT）和文本编码器（LaBSE）进行知识蒸馏，分解瓶颈为三个层次。

Result: HAC的解耦标记集分别对应语音和词汇信息，在解耦和重建质量上优于单层基线。

Conclusion: HAC作为一种统一的离散语音表示，具有潜力支持语音生成和理解任务。

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues. Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

TLDR: 本文首次全面分析了数据可视化库中的错误，研究了564个来自五个常用库的bug，系统分析了其症状和根源，并提供了详细的分类。研究发现不正确/不准确的绘图普遍存在，主要根源是图形计算错误，需要进一步自动化测试方法。此外，研究还提出了触发这些bug的八个关键步骤和两个特定测试预言，为未来自动化测试技术设计提供了启发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据可视化库的准确性对用户体验和信息传达至关重要，错误的可视化可能导致用户做出错误决策。然而，可视化bug通常不易察觉，因此需要深入研究其特性以改进检测和修复方法。

Method: 研究收集了五个广泛使用的数据可视化库中的564个bug，系统分析了其症状和根源，并提出了详细的分类。此外，还探索了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在检测错误绘图中的可行性。

Result: 研究发现不正确/不准确的绘图普遍存在，主要根源是图形计算错误。VLMs在bug检测中的有效性为29%至57%，且提示信息的增加不一定提高有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为数据可视化库的bug提供了系统分析，并提出了未来自动化测试技术的方向。VLMs在bug检测中表现有限，需进一步优化。

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation, data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause, which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries. Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%, depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our manuscript.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的兴起，研究旨在了解开发者常用的代码片段描述类型，并评估LLM（如Llama）在生成描述方面的能力。

Method: 使用NPM代码片段数据集（185,412个包，1,024,579个代码片段），从中选取400个样本进行手动分类和LLM评估。

Result: 55.5%的原始描述为示例用途；LLM正确识别79.75%的示例描述；生成的描述相似度平均为0.7173，显示相关性但需改进。

Conclusion: 代码片段的文档意图因任务而异，LLM在生成描述方面表现良好但仍有优化空间。

Abstract: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with 1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of 0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9 indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a library.

Motivation: 计算机使用代理的安全性被忽视，但对其潜在危害的评估至关重要。

Method: 在OSWorld环境中构建OS-Harm基准，包含150个任务，测试多种安全违规行为，并提出自动化评估方法。

Result: 评估显示，前沿模型易受滥用和提示注入攻击，且偶尔执行不安全操作。

Conclusion: OS-Harm为计算机使用代理的安全性提供了标准化评估工具，揭示了现有模型的潜在风险。

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees. While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap, we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150 tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser, etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and 0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is available at https://github.com/tml-epfl/os-harm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降尺度方法主要依赖单一卫星数据，无法全面捕捉气象变量变化，需要更全面的数据源来提高精度。

Method: MODS是一种条件扩散模型，融合多源卫星和地形数据，通过多源交叉注意力模块提取特征并融合到ERA5数据中。

Result: 实验表明，MODS在将ERA5数据降尺度至6.25 km分辨率时具有更高的保真度。

Conclusion: MODS通过多源数据融合显著提升了气象变量降尺度的准确性和真实性。

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of high-resolution surface meteorological conditions is critical for forecasting and simulating meteorological variables. Directly applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation, we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5 maps to a 6.25 km resolution.

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods. Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges, such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case, it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.

Conclusion: BMFM-RNA为系统基准测试和社区驱动的TFM训练策略探索提供了可重复的基础，推动更有效的细胞生物学AI工具开发。

Abstract: Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for analyzing gene expression in cells and tissues, supporting key tasks such as cell-type annotation, batch correction, and perturbation prediction. However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability, we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED), which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available as part of the biomed-multi-omics project ( https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective tools to leverage the latest advances in AI for understanding cell biology.

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺场景下更具便利性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes, expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at: https://github.com/HanWu3125/OS-Sketch

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking. Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成模型提供了一种高效、样本利用率高的对齐方法，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in 3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards. Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking, Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting within a few finetuning steps.

Conclusion: 该算子为具有密集或隐藏层次结构的数据提供了一种新的图信号处理工具。

Abstract: Hierarchical graphs often exhibit tree-like branching patterns, a structural property that challenges the design of traditional graph filters. We introduce a boundary-weighted operator that rescales each edge according to how far its endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden hierarchical structure.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring the potential of QML in real-world applications.

The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However, this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in pursuit of quantum advantage.

Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone of computational drug discovery. This research demonstrates the successful application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance QSAR classification, showing a notable performance improvement over classical methods. We apply this methodology to a dataset for identifying DYRK1A kinase inhibitors. The workflow involves converting SMILES representations into numerical molecular descriptors, reducing dimensionality via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on an optimized combination of multiple quantum and classical kernels. By benchmarking the QMKL-SVM against a classical Gradient Boosting model, we show that the quantum-enhanced approach achieves a superior AUC score, highlighting its potential to provide a quantum advantage in challenging cheminformatics classification tasks.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种形式化模型，用于分析去中心化金融（DeFi）借贷协议的经济和策略动态，旨在解决其复杂激励机制的潜在问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化借贷协议缺乏传统信任机制，其复杂的激励设计可能导致不稳定或恶意行为，需要形式化分析以确保安全性。

Method: 提出一个形式化模型，捕捉主流借贷平台的核心特征，以证明其经济和策略动态的关键属性。

Result: 模型能够识别并验证借贷协议的关键属性，帮助分析用户策略和潜在攻击。

Conclusion: 形式化模型为借贷协议的经济和策略分析提供了有效工具，有助于提升其稳定性和安全性。

Abstract: Lending protocols are one of the main applications of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), enabling crypto-assets loan markets with a total value estimated in the tens of billions of dollars. Unlike traditional lending systems, these protocols operate without relying on trusted authorities or off-chain enforcement mechanisms. To achieve key economic goals such as stability of the loan market, they devise instead trustless on-chain mechanisms, such as rewarding liquidators who repay the loans of under-collateralized borrowers by awarding them part of the borrower's collateral. The complexity of these incentive mechanisms, combined with their entanglement in low-level implementation details, makes it challenging to precisely assess the structural and economic properties of lending protocols, as well as to analyze user strategies and attacks. Crucially, since participation is open to anyone, any weaknesses in the incentive mechanism may give rise to unintended emergent behaviours, or even enable adversarial strategies aimed at making profits to the detriment of legit users, or at undermining the stability of the protocol. In this work, we propose a formal model of lending protocols that captures the essential features of mainstream platforms, enabling us to identify and prove key properties related to their economic and strategic dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DR诊断依赖人工检查，耗时耗力，亟需高效、经济的自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用TensorFlow训练多种CNN模型（如MobileNet、ShuffleNet等），并通过预处理、量化和优化技术部署到边缘设备。

Result: MobileNet准确率达96.45%，SqueezeNet模型仅176KB，延迟17ms，适合实时检测。

Conclusion: 边缘AI技术为DR早期检测提供了可扩展、经济的解决方案，尤其适用于资源有限的环境。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045. Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over 3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms, including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU. ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable, cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

TLDR: FAHR-Face是一个基于4000万张面部图像训练的基础模型，用于生物年龄估计和生存风险预测，表现出色且具有临床价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过面部外观非侵入性地评估健康和疾病风险。

Method: FAHR-FaceAge和FAHR-FaceSurvival分别通过两阶段微调和临床数据集训练，测试了模型鲁棒性和独立性。

Result: FAHR-FaceAge在年龄估计中误差最低（5.1年），FAHR-FaceSurvival能稳健预测死亡率，两者结合提高了预后准确性。

Conclusion: 单一基础模型可生成低成本、可扩展的面部生物标志物，适用于生物衰老和疾病风险预测。

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge) and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on 749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting) and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication. FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest (adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex, race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using relatively small clinical datasets.

Motivation: 解决T2加权MRI图像中前列腺分割的读者间变异性和跨站点域偏移问题，验证Transformer模型的性能。

Method: 比较UNETR、SwinUNETR和3D UNet在546个MRI数据上的表现，采用三种训练策略（单队列、5折交叉验证混合队列、基于腺体大小的数据集），并使用Optuna优化超参数。

Result: SwinUNETR在多种训练策略下表现最佳，Dice分数最高提升5分，尤其在基于腺体大小的数据集中表现突出。

Conclusion: SwinUNETR通过全局和移位窗口自注意力机制有效减少标签噪声和类别不平衡敏感性，具有更高的临床部署鲁棒性。

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI (T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2, while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53; Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR for clinical deployment.

Result: 生成的3D血管模型在半径、长度和弯曲度上与真实数据高度相似，适用于医学培训、血流模拟等。

Conclusion: RvNN首次成功用于血管合成，为医学领域提供了更准确和多样的血管模型。

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets, including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders (NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Conclusion: DenseNet-121模型在多参数MRI序列分类任务中表现出色，适用于临床实践。

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121 model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than 0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and 0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of classifying 8 body MRI series types.

Result: 在胸片数据集上测试，HE推理虽较慢且性能略有下降，但框架在计算效率和隐私保护间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法在医疗图像隐私保护推理中具有实用潜力，尽管仍需优化计算速度。

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive, particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference, our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges, including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is available at FedWSIDD.

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently, single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However, the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel, requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness. In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types: fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test dataset.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality. This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset. Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD) filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision, 13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer classification performance using CNN architectures.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets, which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights, training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical deployment.

### [290] [Intrinsic and Extrinsic Organized Attention: Softmax Invariance and Network Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15541)
*Oluwadamilola Fasina,Ruben V. C. Pohle,Pei-Chun Su,Ronald R. Coifman*

Main category: math.NA

TLDR: 论文研究了Transformer中自注意力机制的内在（注意力头内）和外在（注意力头间）结构，证明了自注意力机制对softmax激活的不变性，并利用层次化张量组织方法分析了网络结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自注意力机制的结构特性，以提升其可解释性和实用性，例如模型剪枝和架构比较。

Method: 结合理论分析（如拟微分计算）和计算方法（如层次化分区树和扩散映射嵌入），研究注意力头的组织及其稀疏性。

Result: 发现自注意力机制对softmax激活的不变性，并展示了层次化组织在信号处理任务中的实用性。

Conclusion: 研究为可解释性分析提供了理论支持，并可用于模型剪枝和网络架构比较等实际应用。

Abstract: We examine the intrinsic (within the attention head) and extrinsic (amongst the attention heads) structure of the self-attention mechanism in transformers. Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query, key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture comparison.

TLDR: 提出一种新的Counterbalance估计器，用于通过矩阵-向量乘积估计矩阵的谱范数，相比传统方法（如幂方法）能提供更紧的上界。


<details>

Motivation: 传统方法（如幂方法）在估计矩阵谱范数时可能不够紧，尤其是在谱快速衰减的矩阵中。

Method: 提出Counterbalance估计器，通过矩阵-向量乘积计算谱范数的上界，并推导其低估概率保证。

Conclusion: Counterbalance估计器在谱范数估计中表现优越，尤其在谱快速衰减的矩阵中效果显著。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the spectral norm of a matrix using only matrix-vector products. We propose a new Counterbalance estimator that provides upper bounds on the norm and derive probabilistic guarantees on its underestimation. Compared to standard approaches such as the power method, the proposed estimator produces significantly tighter upper bounds in both synthetic and real-world settings. Our method is especially effective for matrices with fast-decaying spectra, such as those arising in deep learning and inverse problems.

TLDR: 论文提出CUE模型，将解释属性与认知子过程（可读性、可理解性、可解释性）关联，并通过实验验证了可访问性优化的局限性，支持自适应XAI界面的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在关键决策中的作用增强，对可理解解释的需求增加。现有XAI评估多关注技术保真度，而忽略了认知可访问性，尤其是对视觉障碍用户的影响。

Method: 提出CUE模型，将解释属性与认知子过程（可读性、可理解性、可解释性）关联，并通过实验测试不同热图色彩方案对视觉障碍用户的影响。

Result: 实验发现，任务表现相似，但视觉障碍用户的信心和努力程度较低；可访问性优化的色彩方案（如Cividis）未能缓解甚至加剧了差距。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了感知优化的假设，支持自适应XAI界面的需求，并验证了CUE模型的有效性。论文贡献包括：CUE模型、人本解释属性的定义，以及支持可访问XAI的实证证据。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception), readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study (N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols, meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是了解公众对AI生成的角色代表性数据的信任度和实用性，填补了以往研究中缺乏受众参与的空白。

Method: 方法包括开发基于CLIP模型的工具分析视觉数据，设计适合普通受众的可视化，并通过用户研究验证工具的实用性和信任度。

Result: 用户研究显示参与者认为工具总体有用，但对AI模型的信任度中等偏低，同时希望增加更多人口统计类别和上下文信息。

Conclusion: 结论是AI工具在角色代表性分析中有潜力，但需改进可视化细节和提升用户对AI的信任度。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code, benchmarking, and data from the user study can be found here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Character-Representation-Media-FF7B

Conclusion: 本文为AI4SI研究者和合作伙伴提供了实用参考，旨在促进更有效的社会影响合作。

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare, social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI, achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects "fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers - complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research - this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication, collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful AI collaborations.

Conclusion: 平衡设计自由与实用约束是AI辅助建筑设计的关键，可持续性指标的整合为生态友好设计提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Generative AI, specifically text-to-image models, have revolutionized interior architectural design by enabling the rapid translation of conceptual ideas into visual representations from simple text prompts. While generative AI can produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for designers In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3 with a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability metrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible practices. Our findings showcase the importance of balancing design freedom with practical constraints, offering a clear path toward holistic, data-driven solutions in AI-assisted architectural design.

Conclusion: 为设计更可信、以护理者为中心的AI系统提供理论与实践依据。

Abstract: Family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (AD/ADRD) face significant emotional and logistical challenges that place them at heightened risk for stress, anxiety, and depression. Although recent advances in generative AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs) -- offer new opportunities to support mental health, little is known about how caregivers perceive and engage with such technologies. To address this gap, we developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes -- on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure, crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes, we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and concerns. We present a mapping of caregiver needs, AI chatbot's strengths, gaps, and design recommendations. Our findings offer theoretical and practical insights to inform the design of proactive, trustworthy, and caregiver-centered AI systems that better support the evolving mental health needs of AD/ADRD caregivers.

Abstract: Surveys are a cornerstone of Information Systems (IS) research, yet creating high-quality surveys remains labor-intensive, requiring both domain expertise and methodological rigor. With the evolution of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities emerge to automate survey generation. This paper presents the real-world deployment of an LLM-powered system designed to accelerate data collection while maintaining survey quality. Deploying such systems in production introduces real-world complexity, including diverse user needs and quality control. We evaluate the system using the DeLone and McLean IS Success Model to understand how generative AI can reshape a core IS method. This study makes three key contributions. To our knowledge, this is the first application of the IS Success Model to a generative AI system for survey creation. In addition, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework combining automated and human assessments. Finally, we implement safeguards that mitigate post-deployment risks and support responsible integration into IS workflows.

Abstract: Visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR) can easily be unreliable for various reasons, e.g., inherent distortions in representing the original data. The literature has thus proposed a wide range of methodologies to make DR-based visual analytics reliable. However, the diversity and extensiveness of the literature can leave novice analysts and researchers uncertain about where to begin and proceed. To address this problem, we propose a guide for reading papers for reliable visual analytics with DR. Relying on the previous classification of the relevant literature, our guide helps both practitioners to (1) assess their current DR expertise and (2) identify papers that will further enhance their understanding. Interview studies with three experts in DR and data visualizations validate the significance, comprehensiveness, and usefulness of our guide.

Conclusion: 研究首次实证了基于MHNG的人类-AI共创学习，为共生AI系统的动态感知对齐提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI, i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based, always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

The framework we propose puts much emphasis on increasing the precision and relevance of the retrieval results to return comprehensive and contextually enriched explanations and resources that best suit each student's needs. We also assess the effectiveness of our approach against paradigmatic LLMs and report improvements in user satisfaction and learning outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360°视频在VR中广泛应用，但空间分辨率不足导致视觉质量受限，且传统VSR技术无法解决其投影失真问题。此外，缺乏相关数据集也阻碍了研究。

Method: 创建了360VDS数据集，并提出S3PO模型，采用循环建模和注意力机制，结合专用特征提取器和新型损失函数以解决球形失真。

Result: S3PO在360°视频数据集上表现优于大多数传统VSR模型和360°专用超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: S3PO通过针对性设计和优化，有效提升了360°视频的超分辨率质量，解决了传统技术的局限性。

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360° videos) are widely used in Virtual Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences. However, the limited spatial resolution in 360° videos does not allow for each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360° video signals. An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360° video datasets for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360° Video Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models to 360° videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model for 360° Video Super-Resolution (360° VSR), called Spherical Signal Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360°~specific super-resolution models on 360° video datasets. A step-wise ablation study is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

Abstract: Offensive Robot Cybersecurity introduces a groundbreaking approach by advocating for offensive security methods empowered by means of automation. It emphasizes the necessity of understanding attackers' tactics and identifying vulnerabilities in advance to develop effective defenses, thereby improving robots' security posture. This thesis leverages a decade of robotics experience, employing Machine Learning and Game Theory to streamline the vulnerability identification and exploitation process. Intrinsically, the thesis uncovers a profound connection between robotic architecture and cybersecurity, highlighting that the design and creation aspect of robotics deeply intertwines with its protection against attacks. This duality -- whereby the architecture that shapes robot behavior and capabilities also necessitates a defense mechanism through offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies -- creates a unique equilibrium. Approaching cybersecurity with a dual perspective of defense and attack, rooted in an understanding of systems architecture, has been pivotal. Through comprehensive analysis, including ethical considerations, the development of security tools, and executing cyber attacks on robot software, hardware, and industry deployments, this thesis proposes a novel architecture for cybersecurity cognitive engines. These engines, powered by advanced game theory and machine learning, pave the way for autonomous offensive cybersecurity strategies for robots, marking a significant shift towards self-defending robotic systems. This research not only underscores the importance of offensive measures in enhancing robot cybersecurity but also sets the stage for future advancements where robots are not just resilient to cyber threats but are equipped to autonomously safeguard themselves.

Conclusion: F-MPPI通过局部反馈实现鲁棒高频控制，适用于复杂机器人系统。

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral control is a powerful sampling-based approach suitable for complex robotic tasks due to its flexibility in handling nonlinear dynamics and non-convex costs. However, its applicability in real-time, highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands. This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency operation suitable for complex robotic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决家庭用餐辅助中活动、情境、食物和用户偏好的多样性挑战。

Method: 采用模块化硬件、多样化交互方法和参数化行为树，结合大型语言模型实现安全透明的个性化。

Result: FEAST在透明和安全的个性化方面优于固定定制基线，并通过真实用户研究验证了实用性。

Conclusion: FEAST成功满足用户个性化需求，展示了在现实环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g., eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV), food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii) diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences, and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast

Abstract: Autonomous navigation by drones using onboard sensors combined with machine learning and computer vision algorithms is impacting a number of domains, including agriculture, logistics, and disaster management. In this paper, we examine the use of drones for assisting visually impaired people (VIPs) in navigating through outdoor urban environments. Specifically, we present a perception-based path planning system for local planning around the neighborhood of the VIP, integrated with a global planner based on GPS and maps for coarse planning. We represent the problem using a geometric formulation and propose a multi DNN based framework for obstacle avoidance of the UAV as well as the VIP. Our evaluations conducted on a drone human system in a university campus environment verifies the feasibility of our algorithms in three scenarios; when the VIP walks on a footpath, near parked vehicles, and in a crowded street.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的即时策略在机器人领域存在幻觉问题，导致生成的轨迹偏离演示，影响可靠性。

Method: RIP利用Student's t分布聚合多个候选轨迹，忽略异常值（幻觉），生成鲁棒轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，RIP在低数据场景下任务成功率至少提高26%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RIP通过鲁棒聚合方法有效解决了LLM幻觉问题，提升了模仿学习的可靠性。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM方法依赖RGB-D或单目相机，存在视野窄、遮挡敏感和深度感知有限的问题，导致物体建模不准确和数据关联不可靠。

Method: 整合点特征和物体级地标，结合开放词汇语义，采用语义-几何-时间融合策略进行多视角物体关联，并设计全景闭环模块。

Result: 在真实场景中验证，MCOO-SLAM实现了精确定位和可扩展的物体级建图，对遮挡、姿态变化和环境复杂性具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MCOO-SLAM通过多相机配置和语义融合，显著提升了复杂户外场景中的物体级SLAM性能。

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent, and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

Conclusion: 该框架为可变形物体的学习型数字孪生提供了有效解决方案，并展示了在模型规划中的实用性。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes, while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators, particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks.

Motivation: 在复杂环境中，全局模型不可行，需要上下文感知模型来捕捉当前相关环境特征，同时保持物理合理性。

Method: 扩展DeLaN为上下文感知模型，结合循环网络进行在线系统识别，并与MPC集成，同时引入残差动力学模型。

Result: 在7自由度机械臂上测试，跟踪误差减少39%，优于基线方法的21%改进。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的DeLaN结合MPC和残差模型，显著提升了机器人控制的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Controlling a robot based on physics-informed dynamic models, such as deep Lagrangian networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments, the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable, particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21% improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

Conclusion: SonicVerse通过多任务框架和特征整合，能够生成丰富且详细的音乐描述，适用于短片段和长音乐作品。

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio, captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Conclusion: pycnet-audio为大规模声学监测项目提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs). The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings, e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species, anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio (Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins 2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications, especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation, leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation. This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and +364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality, attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech. Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and +27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics, forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in challenging acoustic conditions.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge. Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing. Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information, and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's speed.

We argue that these challenges cannot always be delegated to future AI systems, and suggest things we can do today to meaningfully improve our prospects. AGI preparedness is therefore not just about ensuring that advanced AI systems are aligned: we should be preparing, now, for the disorienting range of developments an intelligence explosion would bring.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing, we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings. This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes) for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of human subjects.

Result: 在纽约市的案例中，TFA显著减少了因经济和人口因素导致的交通可达性差异。

Conclusion: TFA为城市规划者提供了促进公平交通和改善服务不足社区生活质量的实用工具。

Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1) spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2) comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3) strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in underserved urban communities.

TLDR: 论文提出FORTRESS，一种用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）安全防护鲁棒性的专家设计对抗性提示集，涵盖三个领域，揭示模型在潜在风险与实用性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试未能客观、鲁棒地评估LLM在国家安全和公共安全（NSPS）相关风险中的防护能力，因此需要一种更有效的评估工具。

Method: 开发了FORTRESS，包含500个专家设计的对抗性提示及其评分标准，覆盖CBRNE、政治暴力与恐怖主义、犯罪与金融非法活动三个领域，并测试模型的过度拒绝行为。

Result: 不同模型在潜在风险与过度拒绝之间存在权衡，例如Claude-3.5-Sonnet风险低但过度拒绝高，而Deepseek-R1风险高但过度拒绝低。

Conclusion: FORTRESS为政策制定者和研究者提供了清晰的模型风险评估工具，并公开了数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information. However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500 expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE), Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities, with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score (ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at 78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/fortress_public. We also maintain a private set for evaluation.

*Max Ku,Sun Sun,Hongyu Guo,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TLDR: DisProtEdit是一个可控的蛋白质编辑框架，通过双通道自然语言监督学习解耦的结构和功能表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于联合整体嵌入，缺乏模块化和可解释性控制，DisProtEdit旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 构建SwissProtDis数据集，使用对齐和均匀性目标对齐蛋白质和文本嵌入，并通过解耦损失促进结构和功能语义的独立性。

Result: 在蛋白质编辑和表示学习任务中表现优异，多属性编辑基准上的成功率高达61.7%。

Conclusion: DisProtEdit在保持竞争力的同时，提供了更高的可解释性和可控性。

Abstract: We introduce DisProtEdit, a controllable protein editing framework that leverages dual-channel natural language supervision to learn disentangled representations of structural and functional properties. Unlike prior approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly separates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To support this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where each protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for structure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language model. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability. On a newly constructed multi-attribute editing benchmark, the model achieves a both-hit success rate of up to 61.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in coordinating simultaneous structural and functional edits.

*Simon P. von der Maase*

Main category: stat.OT

TLDR: 提出了一种新型神经网络架构，用于高分辨率预测三种暴力冲突类型，性能优越且无需手动特征工程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高时空分辨率下暴力冲突预测的挑战，为政策制定者提供工具。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛Dropout LSTM U-Net架构，结合卷积层和循环结构，自动学习时空模式。

Result: 在所有任务中达到最先进性能，并能生成预测不确定性分布。

Conclusion: 该模型具有高度扩展性，适用于早期预警系统和人道主义响应规划。

Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational (priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based peacebuilding initiatives.

*Shagun Maheshwari,Janghoon Ock,Adeesh Kolluru,Amir Barati Farimani,John R. Kitchin*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TLDR: GemNet-T作为MLFF，通过两种训练策略（直接训练和预训练+微调）在MD17数据集上达到低力MAE，但预训练模型显著提升MD模拟稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLFFs可加速ab initio MD模拟，但高精度力预测计算成本高，需探索更有效的训练方法。

Method: 使用GemNet-T模型，比较直接训练与预训练（OC20）+微调（MD17）两种策略。

Result: 两种策略均实现低力MAE（5 meV/A），但预训练模型模拟稳定性显著提升，轨迹延长三倍。

Conclusion: 预训练在大规模数据集上有助于捕捉复杂分子相互作用，力MAE不足以保证MD模拟稳定性。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples) without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability, sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.

TLDR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（如GPT-4o）从文本中提取经济叙事的有效性，并与专家标注的黄金标准进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，经济叙事的研究兴趣增加，但现有方法（如BERT）缺乏深层语义理解，难以区分经济叙事提取与传统任务（如语义角色标注）。

Method: 通过分析《华尔街日报》和《纽约时报》关于通胀的文章，应用严格的叙事定义，比较GPT-4o输出与专家标注的黄金标准。

Result: GPT-4o能够提取结构化经济叙事，但在处理复杂文档和叙事时仍不及专家水平。

Conclusion: 论文为经济学和社会科学领域未来使用LLMs的研究提供了指导，强调了其潜力与局限性。

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts. Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling. Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs to pursue similar objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在时间序列中，当真实因果图仅以摘要形式存在时，干预效应的可识别性问题。

Method: 研究时间序列（包括时间一致性和非一致性）中共同后门集的存在条件，并提供复杂度有限的算法判断可识别性。

Result: 建立了时间序列中共同后门集存在的条件，并开发了判断可识别性的算法。

Conclusion: 在时间序列中，通过共同后门集可以判断干预效应的可识别性，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The identifiability problem for interventions aims at assessing whether the total effect of some given interventions can be written with a do-free formula, and thus be computed from observational data only. We study this problem, considering multiple interventions and multiple effects, in the context of time series when only abstractions of the true causal graph in the form of summary causal graphs are available. We focus in this study on identifiability by a common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is identifiable or not.

Motivation: 确保大规模工业无线网络中超可靠低延迟通信（URLLC）的包级通信质量。

Method: 结合卷积神经网络（CNN）和图着色技术，动态分配链路优先级，基于实时流量、传输机会和网络条件。

Result: 仿真结果显示，在三种网络配置下，SINR增益分别达到113%、94%和49%，优于LDP算法。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂URLLC场景中表现出色，提升了网络容量、SINR和可调度性。

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks. We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\%, 94\%, and 49\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模工业无线网络中，确保分组级通信质量对URLLC至关重要。传统LDP算法的静态优先级无法满足动态需求。

Method: 通过将GCN与DQN结合，动态学习链路优先级，考虑实时流量需求、网络拓扑、剩余传输机会和干扰模式。

Result: GCN-DQN模型在三种网络配置下比LDP的SINR平均提升179.6%、197.4%和175.2%，比之前的CNN方法提升31.5%、53.0%和84.7%。

Conclusion: GCN-DQN模型能高效满足URLLC的复杂需求，性能优越且开销低。

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks. We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) integrated with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning framework for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach dynamically learns link priorities based on real-time traffic demand, network topology, remaining transmission opportunities, and interference patterns. The GCN captures spatial dependencies, while the DQN enables adaptive scheduling decisions through reward-guided exploration. Simulation results show that our GCN-DQN model achieves mean SINR improvements of 179.6\%, 197.4\%, and 175.2\% over LDP across three network configurations. Additionally, the GCN-DQN model demonstrates mean SINR improvements of 31.5\%, 53.0\%, and 84.7\% over our previous CNN-based approach across the same configurations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our GCN-DQN model in addressing complex URLLC requirements with minimal overhead and superior network performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测未来神经活动是建模大脑动态的核心挑战，对科学研究和神经技术应用至关重要，但目前跨会话的自发记录预测研究不足。

Method: POCO结合单变量预测器和群体级编码器，捕捉神经元特异性和全脑动态，并在五种钙成像数据集上训练。

Result: POCO在自发行为中实现细胞分辨率的高精度预测，无需解剖标签即可学习生物有意义的结构，并快速适应新记录。

Conclusion: POCO为跨会话神经预测提供了可扩展和适应性强的解决方案，为未来神经基础模型和自适应神经技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors. After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing. Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高维数据分类问题，特别是在Tsybakov噪声和组合假设下，探索最优分类器的性能及其理论依据。

Method: 采用组合假设和Tsybakov噪声条件，分析条件类概率函数的结构，并利用ReLU深度神经网络和铰链损失进行训练。

Result: 证明了最优收敛率与输入维度无关，且ReLU深度神经网络可以接近该速率，为实际高维分类任务提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: ReLU深度神经网络在高维分类任务中表现出色，组合假设和噪声条件的理论分析为实际应用提供了重要依据。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the binary classification problem on $[0,1]^d$ under the Tsybakov noise condition (with exponent $s \in [0,\infty]$) and the compositional assumption. This assumption requires the conditional class probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$ vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a maximum value function or a Hölder-$β$ smooth function that depends only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions, the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$ \left( \frac{1}{n} \right)^{\frac{β\cdot(1\wedgeβ)^q}{{\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\frac{1}{s+1})\cdotβ\cdot(1\wedgeβ)^q}}}\;\;\;, $$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. This result provides theoretical justification for the excellent performance of ReLU DNNs in practical classification tasks, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The technique used to establish these results extends the oracle inequality presented in our previous work. The generalized approach is of independent interest.

Method: 提出DML-CMR算法，通过新学习目标减少偏差，基于DML框架实现两阶段估计。

Result: DML-CMR在参数化和温和条件下达到最优收敛速率O(N^{-1/2})，并在真实数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DML-CMR为CMR问题提供了一种高效、无偏的解决方案，适用于多种实际应用。

Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities. Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems. Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest. However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.

Abstract: Clustering and estimating cluster means are core problems in statistics and machine learning, with k-means and Expectation Maximization (EM) being two widely used algorithms. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for the failure of k-means in high-dimensional settings with high noise and limited sample sizes, using a simple Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We identify regimes where, with high probability, almost every partition of the data becomes a fixed point of the k-means algorithm. This study is motivated by challenges in the analysis of more complex cases, such as masked GMMs, and those arising from applications in Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal variables.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method to learn the time-dependent probability density of a multivariate stochastic process from sample paths, assuming that the initial probability density is known and can be evaluated. Our method uses a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants. Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally, the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants. Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through applications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical experiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex time-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among real-world data.

Conclusion: 随机集成的作用机制比显式正则化更复杂，研究结果增强了对随机森林的理解。

Abstract: Combining randomized estimators in an ensemble, such as via random forests, has become a fundamental technique in modern data science, but can be computationally expensive. Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling -- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset. We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic weights, thereby enlarging the model search space. These results enhance our understanding of random forests and suggest that implicit regularization in general may have more complicated effects than explicit regularization.

Abstract: We present a new tool for data analysis: persistence discrete homology, which is well-suited to analyze filtrations of graphs. In particular, we provide a novel way of representing high-dimensional data as a filtration of graphs using pairwise correlations. We discuss several applications of these tools, e.g., in weather and financial data, comparing them to the standard methods used in the respective fields.

Abstract: This work studies the problem of sparse signal recovery with automatic grouping of variables. To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm (SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several experiments.

Abstract: We propose two first-order methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed optimization problems, hereafter called Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding (MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS). Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in Lan et al. (2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at potentially different rates.
  To find an $ε$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms achieve optimal dependency on $ε$: MT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/ε)$ communication rounds and $O(\overline{r}/ε^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and AMT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{εμ})$ communication rounds and $O(\overline{r}/(εμ))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also $μ$-strongly convex. Here, $\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).
