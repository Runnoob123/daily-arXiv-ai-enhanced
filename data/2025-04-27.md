Abstract: As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the need for advanced tools to
analyze and understand complex cyber environments has become increasingly
critical. Graph theory offers a powerful framework for modeling relationships
within cyber ecosystems, making it highly applicable to cybersecurity. This
paper focuses on the development of an enriched version of the widely

### [2] [Evaluating Argon2 Adoption and Effectiveness in Real-World Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17121)
*Pascal Tippe,Michael P. Berner*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文分析了Argon2密码哈希算法的实际应用效果，发现尽管其理论安全性高，但在实际部署中参数配置不当导致保护效果有限，尤其是对弱密码的防护不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Argon2从理论安全算法到实际部署中的挑战，评估其在不同参数配置下的防护效果及开发者实践中的问题。

Method: 结合攻击模拟和GitHub仓库的大规模实证研究，分析Argon2的参数配置对破解成本的影响及其实际采用情况。

Result: OWASP推荐的46 MiB配置在强密码下降低42.5%的破解率，但对弱密码防护效果差；开发者普遍配置较弱。

Conclusion: 仅靠安全算法不足以保证安全性，需加强参数指导和开发者教育以实现Argon2的理论优势。

Abstract: Modern password hashing remains a critical defense against credential
cracking, yet the transition from theoretically secure algorithms to robust
real-world implementations remains fraught with challenges. This paper presents
a dual analysis of Argon2, the Password Hashing Competition winner, combining
attack simulations quantifying how parameter configurations impact guessing
costs under realistic budgets, with the first large-scale empirical study of
Argon2 adoption across public GitHub software repositories. Our economic model,
validated against cryptocurrency mining benchmarks, demonstrates that OWASP's
recommended 46 MiB configuration reduces compromise rates by 42.5% compared to
SHA-256 at \$1/account attack budgets for strong user passwords. However,
memory-hardness exhibits diminishing returns as increasing allocations to RFC
9106's 2048 MiB provides just 23.3% (\$1) and 17.7% (\$20) additional
protection despite 44.5 times greater memory demands. Crucially, both
configurations fail to mitigate risks from weak passwords, with 96.9-99.8%
compromise rates for RockYou-like credentials regardless of algorithm choice.
Our repository analysis shows accelerating Argon2 adoption, yet weak
configuration practices: 46.6% of deployments use weaker-than-OWASP parameters.
Surprisingly, sensitive applications (password managers, encryption tools) show
no stronger configurations than general software. Our findings highlight that a
secure algorithm alone cannot ensure security, effective parameter guidance and
developer education remain essential for realizing Argon2's theoretical
advantages.

### [3] [P$_\ell$-Kyber: Packing $\ell$ Plaintexts and Lattice Coding for Kyber](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17185)
*Shuiyin Liu,Amin Sakzad*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种结合编码和加密的KEM设计，通过密文打包和格打包技术，显著降低了解密失败率和通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KEM设计中解码噪声条目独立性的假设限制了性能优化，本文旨在消除这一假设并提升效率。

Method: 扩展PVW方法至Kyber，实现多层明文打包；提出跨层格编码方案，确保解码噪声条目独立。

Result: 在ℓ=24和Leech格编码下，DFR<2^{-281}，CER降至4.6，比KYBER1024降低90%。

Conclusion: 提出的编码P_ℓ-Kyber方案在安全性和效率上均有显著提升，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a joint design of encoding and encryption processes
for KEMs like Kyber, without assuming the independence of the decoding noise
entries. Our design features two techniques: ciphertext packing and lattice
packing. First, we extend the Peikert-Vaikuntanathan-Waters (PVW) method to the
Kyber: $\ell$ plaintexts are packed into a single ciphertext. This scheme is
referred to as P$_\ell$-Kyber. We prove that the P$_\ell$-Kyber is IND-CCA
secure under the M-LWE hardness assumption. We show that the decryption
decoding noise entries across the $\ell$ plaintexts (also known as layers) are
mutually independent. Second, we propose a cross-layer lattice encoding scheme
for the P$_\ell$-Kyber, where every $\ell$ cross-layer information symbols are
encoded to a lattice point. This way we obtain a \emph{coded} P$_\ell$-Kyber,
where the decoding noise entries for each lattice point are mutually
independent. Therefore, the decryption failure rate (DFR) analysis does not
require the assumption of independence among the decryption decoding noise
entries. Both DFR and communication cost (CER) are greatly decreased thanks to
ciphertext packing and lattice packing. Finally, we demonstrate that with
$\ell=24$ and Leech lattice encoder, the proposed coded P$_\ell$-KYBER1024
achieves DFR $<2^{-281}$ and CER $ = 4.6$, i.e., a decrease of CER by $90\%$
compared to KYBER1024.

### [4] [Developing a Blockchain-Based Secure Digital Contents Distribution System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17194)
*Syed Mohiuddin Qadri,Sangwhan Cha*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于区块链的安全数字内容分发系统，结合去中心化存储网络Sia和内容分发网络Skynet，通过双层架构（链下用户认证和链上交易验证）提升内容保护和分发效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字内容分发的快速扩展，传统集中式系统存在单点故障和未授权访问追踪困难等问题，亟需更安全的解决方案。

Method: 系统采用双层架构：链下处理用户认证，链上通过智能合约和非对称加密验证交易，并引入许可证发放和秘密块机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，系统在安全分发多媒体文件方面具有可行性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该系统不仅提升了内容安全性，还为未来去中心化应用和集成版税支付机制奠定了基础。

Abstract: As digital content distribution expands rapidly through online platforms,
securing digital media and protecting intellectual property has become
increasingly complex. Traditional centralized systems, while widely adopted,
suffer from vulnerabilities such as single points of failure and limited
traceability of unauthorized access. This paper presents a blockchain-based
secure digital content distribution system that integrates Sia, a decentralized
storage network, and Skynet, a content delivery network, to enhance content
protection and distribution. The proposed system employs a dual-layer
architecture: off-chain for user authentication and on-chain for transaction
validation using smart contracts and asymmetric encryption. By introducing a
license issuance and secret block mechanism, the system ensures content
authenticity, privacy, and controlled access. Experimental results demonstrate
the feasibility and scalability of the system in securely distributing
multimedia files. The proposed platform not only improves content security but
also paves the way for future enhancements with decentralized applications and
integrated royalty payment mechanisms.

### [5] [A Comment on "e-PoS: Making PoS Decentralized and Fair"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17256)
*Suhyeon Lee,Seungjoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文讨论了Saad等人提出的e-PoS协议，指出其误解了传统PoS模型的公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清传统PoS模型与e-PoS协议之间的误解，强调公平性问题并非PoS的普遍特征。

Method: 通过分析传统PoS模型和e-PoS协议的设计，指出其概念上的不一致。

Result: 发现Saad等人的研究对传统PoS模型的描述存在偏差。

Conclusion: 传统PoS模型的公平性问题并非普遍存在，e-PoS协议的提出基于误解。

Abstract: Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a prominent Sybil control mechanism for
blockchain-based systems. In "e-PoS: Making PoS Decentralized and Fair," Saad
et al. (TPDS'21) introduced a new Proof-of-Stake protocol, e-PoS, to enhance
PoS applications' decentralization and fairness. In this comment paper, we
address a misunderstanding in the work of Saad et al. The conventional
Proof-of-Stake model that causes the fairness problem does not align with the
general concept of Proof-of-Stake nor the Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies
mentioned in their paper.

### [6] [Contrastive Learning for Continuous Touch-Based Authentication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17271)
*Mengyu Qiao,Yunpeng Zhai,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的统一框架，用于移动设备上的连续用户认证，通过多传感器数据流提取时序模式，并整合注意力机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备处理敏感信息需求高安全性，基于触摸行为的连续认证是一种自然且无缝的安全解决方案。现有方法多为单模态学习下的二元分类，缺乏统一性和高效性。

Method: 结合Temporal Masked Autoencoder（TMAE）提取多传感器数据的时序模式，并集成Siamese Temporal-Attentive Convolutional Network进行对比学习，引入多头注意力和通道注意力机制优化特征整合。

Result: 在公开基准和自收集数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有技术，提供了可靠且高效的移动设备用户认证方案。

Conclusion: 提出的统一对比学习框架通过时序模式和注意力机制显著提升了连续认证的性能，为移动设备安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Smart mobile devices have become indispensable in modern daily life, where
sensitive information is frequently processed, stored, and transmitted-posing
critical demands for robust security controls. Given that touchscreens are the
primary medium for human-device interaction, continuous user authentication
based on touch behavior presents a natural and seamless security solution.
While existing methods predominantly adopt binary classification under
single-modal learning settings, we propose a unified contrastive learning
framework for continuous authentication in a non-disruptive manner.
Specifically, the proposed method leverages a Temporal Masked Autoencoder to
extract temporal patterns from raw multi-sensor data streams, capturing
continuous motion and gesture dynamics. The pre-trained TMAE is subsequently
integrated into a Siamese Temporal-Attentive Convolutional Network within a
contrastive learning paradigm to model both sequential and cross-modal
patterns. To further enhance performance, we incorporate multi-head attention
and channel attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and
optimize inter-channel feature integration. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks and a self-collected dataset demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a reliable and effective
solution for user authentication on mobile devices.

### [7] [Proof of Useful Intelligence (PoUI): Blockchain Consensus Beyond Energy Waste](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17539)
*Zan-Kai Chong,Hiroyuki Ohsaki,Bryan Ng*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种名为PoUI的混合共识机制，结合AI任务与区块链安全，旨在平衡资源利用与去中心化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链共识机制（如PoW和PoS）在安全性与效率之间存在矛盾，而AI任务需要大量计算资源，PoUI试图解决这两者的需求。

Method: PoUI通过让工作者执行AI任务（如语言处理或图像分析）来获得代币，并将这些代币质押以保障网络安全。

Result: PoUI结合了安全性与实用性，通过智能合约协调任务和奖励，实现去中心化协作。

Conclusion: PoUI为区块链和AI资源的结合提供了一种创新解决方案，有望提升可持续性和实用性。

Abstract: Blockchain technology enables secure, transparent data management in
decentralized systems, supporting applications from cryptocurrencies like
Bitcoin to tokenizing real-world assets like property. Its scalability and
sustainability hinge on consensus mechanisms balancing security and efficiency.
Proof of Work (PoW), used by Bitcoin, ensures security through energy-intensive
computations but demands significant resources. Proof of Stake (PoS), as in
Ethereum post-Merge, selects validators based on staked cryptocurrency,
offering energy efficiency but risking centralization from wealth
concentration. With AI models straining computational resources, we propose
Proof of Useful Intelligence (PoUI), a hybrid consensus mechanism. In PoUI,
workers perform AI tasks like language processing or image analysis to earn
coins, which are staked to secure the network, blending security with practical
utility. Decentralized nodes--job posters, market coordinators, workers, and
validators --collaborate via smart contracts to manage tasks and rewards.

Conclusion: 对抗攻击对模型构成严重威胁，但通过特定缓解策略可显著提升防御能力。

Abstract: This paper explores the vulnerability of machine learning models to simple
single-feature adversarial attacks in the context of Ethereum fraudulent
transaction detection. Through comprehensive experimentation, we investigate
the impact of various adversarial attack strategies on model performance
metrics. Our findings, highlighting how prone those techniques are to simple
attacks, are alarming, and the inconsistency in the attacks' effect on
different algorithms promises ways for attack mitigation. We examine the
effectiveness of different mitigation strategies, including adversarial
training and enhanced feature selection, in enhancing model robustness and show
their effectiveness.

### [9] [User Profiles: The Achilles' Heel of Web Browsers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17692)
*Dolière Francis Somé,Moaz Airan,Zakir Durumeric,Cristian-Alexandru Staicu*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 该论文首次系统研究了浏览器配置文件的安全性，发现除Tor浏览器外，现代浏览器在存储敏感数据时缺乏完整性或保密性控制，且易受攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究浏览器与操作系统或文件系统交互的安全性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过分析浏览器配置文件的存储方式，展示攻击者如何绕过安全措施（如密码加密和HTTPS）。

Result: 发现攻击者可通过文件系统API直接操纵用户文件，安装恶意扩展、劫持HTTPS流量等。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发更安全的机制保护用户浏览器数据。

Abstract: Web browsers provide the security foundation for our online experiences.
Significant research has been done into the security of browsers themselves,
but relatively little investigation has been done into how they interact with
the operating system or the file system. In this work, we provide the first
systematic security study of browser profiles, the on-disk persistence layer of
browsers, used for storing everything from users' authentication cookies and
browser extensions to certificate trust decisions and device permissions. We
show that, except for the Tor Browser, all modern browsers store sensitive data
in home directories with little to no integrity or confidentiality controls. We
show that security measures like password and cookie encryption can be easily
bypassed. In addition, HTTPS can be sidestepped entirely by deploying malicious
root certificates within users' browser profiles. The Public Key Infrastructure
(PKI), the backbone of the secure Web. HTTPS can be fully bypassed with the
deployment of custom potentially malicious root certificates. More worryingly,
we show how these powerful attacks can be fully mounted directly from web
browsers themselves, through the File System Access API, a recent feature added
by Chromium browsers that enables a website to directly manipulate a user's
file system via JavaScript. In a series of case studies, we demonstrate how an
attacker can install malicious browser extensions, inject additional root
certificates, hijack HTTPS traffic, and enable websites to access hardware
devices like the camera and GPS. Based on our findings, we argue that
researchers and browser vendors need to develop and deploy more secure
mechanisms for protecting users' browser data against file system attackers.

### [10] [Identity Control Plane: The Unifying Layer for Zero Trust Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17759)
*Surya Teja Avirneni*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为身份控制平面（ICP）的架构框架，用于在人类用户、工作负载和自动化系统中实施身份感知的零信任访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的身份管理模型缺乏统一性，难以实现跨用户、工作负载和自动化系统的零信任访问控制。ICP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ICP通过结合SPIFFE工作负载身份、OIDC/SAML用户身份和代理颁发的交易令牌，提出了一种可组合的强制执行层，使用ABAC策略引擎。

Result: 论文提出了ICP的架构组件、集成模式、用例、与现有模型的比较分析以及理论性能指标，并展示了FedRAMP和SLSA的合规性映射。

Conclusion: ICP为安全研究人员和平台架构师提供了一种理论性的基础设施架构，有望实现更统一的零信任访问控制。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Identity Control Plane (ICP), an architectural
framework for enforcing identity-aware Zero Trust access across human users,
workloads, and automation systems. The ICP model unifies SPIFFE-based workload
identity, OIDC/SAML user identity, and scoped automation credentials via
broker-issued transaction tokens. We propose a composable enforcement layer
using ABAC policy engines (e.g., OPA, Cedar), aligned with IETF WIMSE drafts
and OAuth transaction tokens. The paper includes architectural components,
integration patterns, use cases, a comparative analysis with current models,
and theorized performance metrics. A FedRAMP and SLSA compliance mapping is
also presented. This is a theoretical infrastructure architecture paper
intended for security researchers and platform architects. No prior version of
this work has been published.

### [11] [Silenzio: Secure Non-Interactive Outsourced MLP Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17785)
*Jonas Sander,Thomas Eisenbarth*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: Silenzio是一种完全非交互式的MLP训练外包方案，利用FHE实现128位安全性，避免了传统MPC协议的交互需求，同时通过低比特宽度整数运算降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限的客户将ML训练外包给云提供商具有吸引力，但敏感数据的隐私风险是主要挑战。

Method: 采用低比特宽度整数运算（不超过8位），结合输入相关的余数系统和Karatsuba乘法，提出高效的块缩放机制和低比特宽度梯度计算。

Result: 在标准MLP训练任务中，Silenzio的模型性能与32位浮点计算的PyTorch相当，分类准确率接近。

Conclusion: Silenzio为隐私保护的ML提供了新的基准，实现了安全且非交互式的MLP训练外包。

Abstract: Outsourcing the ML training to cloud providers presents a compelling
opportunity for resource constrained clients, while it simultaneously bears
inherent privacy risks, especially for highly sensitive training data. We
introduce Silenzio, the first fully non-interactive outsourcing scheme for the
training of multi-layer perceptrons that achieves 128 bit security using FHE.
Unlike traditional MPC based protocols that necessitate interactive
communication between the client and server(s) or non-collusion assumptions
among multiple servers, Silenzio enables the fire-and-forget paradigm without
such assumptions. In this approach, the client encrypts the training data once,
and the cloud server performs the training without any further interaction.
  Silenzio operates over low bitwidth integers - never exceeding 8 bit - to
mitigate the computational overhead of FHE. Our approach features a novel
low-bitwidth matrix multiplication that leverages input-dependent residue
number systems and a Karatsuba-inspired multiplication routine, ensuring that
no intermediate FHE-processed value overflows 8 bit. Starting from an
RNS-to-MRNS conversion process, we propose an efficient block-scaling
mechanism, which approximately shifts encrypted tensor values to the
user-specified most significant bits. To instantiate the backpropagation of the
error, Silenzio introduces a low-bitwidth and TFHE friendly gradient
computation for the cross entropy loss.
  Implemented using the state-of-the-art Concrete library, we evaluate Silenzio
on standard MLP training tasks regarding runtime as well as model performance
and achieve similar classification accuracy as MLPs trained using standard
PyTorch with 32 bit floating-point computations. Our open-source implementation
represents a significant advancement in privacy-preserving ML, providing a new
baseline for secure and non-interactive outsourced MLP training.

### [12] [A Novel Graph Transformer Framework for Gene Regulatory Network Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16961)
*Binon Teji,Swarup Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 本文提出了一种名为GT-GRN的图变换器模型，通过整合多源网络信息和基因表达数据，显著提升了基因调控网络（GRN）的推断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因调控网络推断是理解复杂生物系统的关键，但现有方法易受噪声干扰且难以反映真实的生物调控关系。因此，需要结合多源信息和先验知识以提高推断的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 利用自编码器嵌入基因表达数据，通过随机游走和BERT模型编码先验网络结构信息，并结合位置编码，构建GT-GRN模型进行GRN推断。

Result: 实验表明，GT-GRN在GRN推断中显著优于现有方法，具有更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GT-GRN通过整合多源信息和先验知识，为GRN推断提供了一种高效且可靠的新方法。

Abstract: The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a foundational stride
towards deciphering the fundamentals of complex biological systems. Inferring a
possible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link
prediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may
not always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise
and misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN
inference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase.
Therefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior
knowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional
informations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more
confident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration
of multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory
Networks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene
expression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological
signals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming
them into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded
with a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene
across all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the
input gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within
the graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model,
termed GT-GRN, for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively utilizes the
topological structure of the ground truth network while incorporating the
enriched encoded information. Experimental results demonstrate that GT-GRN
significantly outperforms existing GRN inference methods, achieving superior
accuracy and highlighting the robustness of our approach.

*Jun Wu,Jiangtao Wen,Yuxing Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Backslash的训练时压缩方法，通过率失真优化实现模型精度与复杂度的灵活权衡，显著减少参数冗余且保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的参数压缩研究主要集中在训练后阶段，而训练时的压缩仍未被充分探索。

Method: 采用率失真优化（RDO）的Rate-Constrained Training（Backslash）方法，在训练过程中实现压缩。

Result: 实验表明，Backslash可减少60%-90%内存使用且无精度损失，优于训练后压缩，并提升泛化性、鲁棒性和推理效率。

Conclusion: Backslash是一种高效且多功能的训练时压缩方法，适用于多种架构和任务。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large-language models (LLMs) has driven extensive
research into parameter compression after training has been completed, yet
compression during the training phase remains largely unexplored. In this work,
we introduce Rate-Constrained Training (Backslash), a novel training-time
compression approach based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO). Backslash
enables a flexible trade-off between model accuracy and complexity,
significantly reducing parameter redundancy while preserving performance.
Experiments in various architectures and tasks demonstrate that Backslash can
reduce memory usage by 60\% - 90\% without accuracy loss and provides
significant compression gain compared to compression after training. Moreover,
Backslash proves to be highly versatile: it enhances generalization with small
Lagrange multipliers, improves model robustness to pruning (maintaining
accuracy even at 80\% pruning rates), and enables network simplification for
accelerated inference on edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动技术的海表温度（SST）预测框架，通过相空间重构和时空融合映射（STFM）高效捕捉SST动态，并在少量训练数据下实现高精度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海表温度（SST）是优化生产规划的关键环境参数，但海洋动力系统的非线性特性使其预测具有挑战性。现有物理模拟方法计算复杂，数据驱动方法需要大量数据且可解释性差。

Method: 利用相空间重构构建初始延迟吸引子对，并通过时空融合映射（STFM）揭示其内在联系，高效捕捉SST动态。

Result: 该方法在比较测试中以少量训练数据实现了高预测精度。

Conclusion: 提出的数据驱动框架为SST预测提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The sea surface temperature (SST), a key environmental parameter, is crucial
to optimizing production planning, making its accurate prediction a vital
research topic. However, the inherent nonlinearity of the marine dynamic system
presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include
physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning
approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential
equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited
applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires
large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a
prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space
reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical
homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover
their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures
SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high
prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
settings, the risk of generating harmful or toxic content remains a central
challenge. Post-hoc alignment methods are brittle: once unsafe patterns are
learned during pretraining, they are hard to remove. We present a data-centric
pretraining framework that builds safety into the model from the start. Our
contributions include: (i) a safety classifier trained on 10,000 GPT-4 labeled
examples, used to filter 600B tokens; (ii) the largest synthetic safety dataset
to date (100B tokens) generated via recontextualization of harmful web data;
(iii) RefuseWeb and Moral Education datasets that convert harmful prompts into
refusal dialogues and web-style educational material; (iv) Harmfulness-Tag
annotations injected during pretraining to flag unsafe content and steer away
inference from harmful generations; and (v) safety evaluations measuring base
model behavior before instruction tuning. Our safety-pretrained models reduce
attack success rates from 38.8% to 8.4% with no performance degradation on
standard LLM safety benchmarks.

Abstract: Is automated hallucination detection possible? In this work, we introduce a
theoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting
hallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the
classical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent
adaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate
whether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language
$K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can
reliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute
hallucinations.
  First, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the
classical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination
detection method can be converted into a language identification method, and
conversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for
hallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language
identification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally
impossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only
correct examples from the target language.
  Second, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the
detector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples
(explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this
conclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination
detection becomes possible for all countable language collections.
  These results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in
training hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for
feedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of democratizing AI-driven global
weather forecasting models among university research groups by leveraging
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and freely available AI models, such as
NVIDIA's FourCastNetv2. FourCastNetv2 is an NVIDIA's advanced neural network
for weather prediction and is trained on a 73-channel subset of the European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset
at single levels and different pressure levels. Although the training
specifications for FourCastNetv2 are not released to the public, the training
documentation of the model's first generation, FourCastNet, is available to all
users. The training had 64 A100 GPUs and took 16 hours to complete. Although
NVIDIA's models offer significant reductions in both time and cost compared to
traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), reproducing published
forecasting results presents ongoing challenges for resource-constrained
university research groups with limited GPU availability. We demonstrate both
(i) leveraging FourCastNetv2 to create predictions through the designated
application programming interface (API) and (ii) utilizing NVIDIA hardware to
train the original FourCastNet model. Further, this paper demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of NVIDIA A100's for resource-limited research
groups in universities. We also explore data management, training efficiency,
and model validation, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using
limited high-performance computing resources. Consequently, this paper and its
corresponding GitHub materials may serve as an initial guide for other
university research groups and courses related to machine learning, climate
science, and data science to develop research and education programs on AI
weather forecasting, and hence help democratize the AI NWP in the digital

Abstract: The generation of high-quality synthetic data presents significant challenges
in machine learning research, particularly regarding statistical fidelity and
uncertainty quantification. Existing generative models produce compelling
synthetic samples but lack rigorous statistical guarantees about their relation
to the underlying data distribution, limiting their applicability in critical
domains requiring robust error bounds. We address this fundamental limitation
by presenting a novel framework that incorporates conformal prediction
methodologies into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By integrating
multiple conformal prediction paradigms including Inductive Conformal
Prediction (ICP), Mondrian Conformal Prediction, Cross-Conformal Prediction,
and Venn-Abers Predictors, we establish distribution-free uncertainty
quantification in generated samples. This approach, termed Conformalized GAN
(cGAN), demonstrates enhanced calibration properties while maintaining the
generative power of traditional GANs, producing synthetic data with provable
statistical guarantees. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing
finite-sample validity guarantees and asymptotic efficiency properties,
enabling the reliable application of synthetic data in high-stakes domains
including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Electromagnetic field reconstruction is crucial in many applications,
including antenna diagnostics, electromagnetic interference analysis, and
system modeling. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for
Far-Field to Near-Field (FF-NF) transformation using Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). The goal is to reconstruct near-field distributions from the

training error of 0.0199 and a test error of 0.3898. Moreover, visual
comparisons between the predicted and true near-field distributions demonstrate
the model's effectiveness in capturing complex electromagnetic field behavior,
highlighting the potential of deep learning in electromagnetic field
reconstruction.

Result: 实验表明，FairMatch能准确定位测试数据中模型公平的子集，并显著减少剩余数据的偏差。

Conclusion: 倾向得分匹配为公平性评估和缓解提供了有效方法，且不影响预测性能。

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning aims to mitigate discrimination against specific
protected social groups (e.g., those categorized by gender, ethnicity, age)
while minimizing predictive performance loss. Despite efforts to improve
fairness in machine learning, prior studies have shown that many models remain
unfair when measured against various fairness metrics. In this paper, we
examine whether the way training and testing data are sampled affects the
reliability of reported fairness metrics. Since training and test sets are
often randomly sampled from the same population, bias present in the training
data may still exist in the test data, potentially skewing fairness
assessments. To address this, we propose FairMatch, a post-processing method
that applies propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias. FairMatch
identifies control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores in the
test set and adjusts decision thresholds for different subgroups accordingly.
For samples that cannot be matched, we perform probabilistic calibration using
fairness-aware loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach can (a) precisely locate subsets of the test data where the model is
unbiased, and (b) significantly reduce bias on the remaining data. Overall,
propensity score matching offers a principled way to improve both fairness
evaluation and mitigation, without sacrificing predictive performance.

Result: 发现Transformer模型易受重复基序影响，通过检索行为覆盖先验知识，导致异常高似然分数。此现象也适用于不完全重复序列和RNA发夹结构。

Conclusion: 上下文学习可能导致语言模型在生物序列预测中产生偏差，需谨慎评估其应用。

Abstract: Language models have emerged as powerful predictors of the viability of
biological sequences. During training these models learn the rules of the
grammar obeyed by sequences of amino acids or nucleotides. Once trained, these
models can take a sequence as input and produce a likelihood score as an
output; a higher likelihood implies adherence to the learned grammar and
correlates with experimental fitness measurements. Here we show that in-context
learning can distort the relationship between fitness and likelihood scores of
sequences. This phenomenon most prominently manifests as anomalously high
likelihood scores for sequences that contain repeated motifs. We use protein
language models with different architectures trained on the masked language
modeling objective for our experiments, and find transformer-based models to be
particularly vulnerable to this effect. This behavior is mediated by a look-up
operation where the model seeks the identity of the masked position by using
the other copy of the repeated motif as a reference. This retrieval behavior
can override the model's learned priors. This phenomenon persists for
imperfectly repeated sequences, and extends to other kinds of biologically
relevant features such as reversed complement motifs in RNA sequences that fold
into hairpin structures.

Conclusion: 对抗训练可以同时增强生成模型的保真度和鲁棒性，打破了传统认知。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have played a key role in scaling up
diffusion-based generative models, as in Stable Diffusion, yet questions
regarding their robustness remain largely underexplored. Although adversarial
training has been an established technique for enhancing robustness in
predictive models, it has been overlooked for generative models due to concerns
about potential fidelity degradation by the nature of trade-offs between
performance and robustness. In this work, we challenge this presumption,
introducing Smooth Robust Latent VAE (SRL-VAE), a novel adversarial training
framework that boosts both generation quality and robustness. In contrast to
conventional adversarial training, which focuses on robustness only, our
approach smooths the latent space via adversarial perturbations, promoting more
generalizable representations while regularizing with originality
representation to sustain original fidelity. Applied as a post-training step on
pre-trained VAEs, SRL-VAE improves image robustness and fidelity with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments show that SRL-VAE improves both generation
quality, in image reconstruction and text-guided image editing, and robustness,
against Nightshade attacks and image editing attacks. These results establish a
new paradigm, showing that adversarial training, once thought to be detrimental
to generative models, can instead enhance both fidelity and robustness.

Abstract: Antenna arrays are widely used in wireless communication, radar systems,
radio astronomy, and military defense to enhance signal strength, directivity,
and interference suppression. We introduce a deep learning-based optimization
approach that enhances the design of sparse phased arrays by reducing grating
lobes. This approach begins by generating sparse array configurations to
address the non-convex challenges and extensive degrees of freedom inherent in
array design. We use neural networks to approximate the non-convex cost
function that estimates the energy ratio between the main and side lobes. This
differentiable approximation facilitates cost function minimization through
gradient descent, optimizing the antenna elements' coordinates and leading to
an improved layout. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored penalty mechanism
that includes various physical and design constraints into the optimization
process, enhancing its robustness and practical applicability. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method by applying it to the ten array configurations
with the lowest initial costs, achieving further cost reductions ranging from
411% to 643%, with an impressive average improvement of 552%. By significantly
reducing side lobe levels in antenna arrays, this breakthrough paves the way
for ultra-precise beamforming, enhanced interference mitigation, and
next-generation wireless and radar systems with unprecedented efficiency and
clarity.

Abstract: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from
observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and
monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due
to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration
estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem,
which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm
called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a
non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence,
and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved
quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more
data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and
accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is
critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving
towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon
sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal,
we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or
non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer,
while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current
operational state-of-the-art.

Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel deep learning hybrid model that
integrates attention Transformer and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures
to improve the accuracy of cryptocurrency price predictions. By combining the
Transformer's strength in capturing long-range patterns with the GRU's ability
to model short-term and sequential trends, the hybrid model provides a
well-rounded approach to time series forecasting. We apply the model to predict
the daily closing prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum based on historical data that
include past prices, trading volumes, and the Fear and Greed index. We evaluate
the performance of our proposed model by comparing it with four other machine
learning models: two are non-sequential feedforward models: Radial Basis
Function Network (RBFN) and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and two
are bidirectional sequential memory-based models: Bidirectional Long-Short-Term
Memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU). The performance
of the model is assessed using several metrics, including Mean Squared Error
(MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean
Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), along with statistical validation through the
nonparametric Friedman test followed by a post hoc Wilcoxon signed rank test.
The results demonstrate that our hybrid model consistently achieves superior
accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness for financial prediction tasks. These
findings provide valuable insights for improving real-time decision making in
cryptocurrency markets and support the growing use of hybrid deep learning
models in financial analytics.

Abstract: Many knowledge graphs contain a substantial number of spatial entities, such

approaches for learning entity representations do not take these geometries
into account. In this paper, we introduce a variant of RDF2Vec that
incorporates geometric information to learn location-aware embeddings of
entities. Our approach expands different nodes by flooding the graph from
geographic nodes, ensuring that each reachable node is considered. Based on the
resulting flooded graph, we apply a modified version of RDF2Vec that biases
graph walks using spatial weights. Through evaluations on multiple benchmark
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms both non-location-aware
RDF2Vec and GeoTransE.

Result: OUI能更快收敛，显著提高泛化能力，并帮助早期确定最佳权重衰减值。

Conclusion: OUI为超参数调优提供了高效可靠的指标，适用于多种DNN和数据集。

Abstract: We introduce the Overfitting-Underfitting Indicator (OUI), a novel tool for
monitoring the training dynamics of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and identifying
optimal regularization hyperparameters. Specifically, we validate that OUI can
effectively guide the selection of the Weight Decay (WD) hyperparameter by
indicating whether a model is overfitting or underfitting during training
without requiring validation data. Through experiments on DenseNet-BC-100 with
CIFAR- 100, EfficientNet-B0 with TinyImageNet and ResNet-34 with ImageNet-1K,
we show that maintaining OUI within a prescribed interval correlates strongly
with improved generalization and validation scores. Notably, OUI converges
significantly faster than traditional metrics such as loss or accuracy,
enabling practitioners to identify optimal WD (hyperparameter) values within
the early stages of training. By leveraging OUI as a reliable indicator, we can
determine early in training whether the chosen WD value leads the model to
underfit the training data, overfit, or strike a well-balanced trade-off that
maximizes validation scores. This enables more precise WD tuning for optimal
performance on the tested datasets and DNNs. All code for reproducing these

### [31] [A Double-Norm Aggregated Tensor Latent Factorization Model for Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17196)
*Jiawen Hou,Hao Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为TATSI的方法，结合$L_2$-norm和$SL_1$-norm的损失函数，用于填补交通速度数据中的缺失值，提高了算法的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通速度数据常因传感器故障或传输延迟而缺失，现有基于张量分解的方法依赖$L_2$-norm，导致算法鲁棒性不足。

Method: TATSI采用SLF-NMU方法，结合$L_2$-norm和$SL_1$-norm的损失函数，进行非负潜在因子分析。

Result: 在三个真实交通速度数据集上的实验表明，TATSI能更精确捕捉时间模式，填补缺失数据的效果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TATSI通过结合两种范数，显著提升了交通速度数据填补的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), traffic management departments
rely on sensors, cameras, and GPS devices to collect real-time traffic data.
Traffic speed data is often incomplete due to sensor failures, data
transmission delays, or occlusions, resulting in missing speed data in certain
road segments. Currently, tensor decomposition based methods are extensively
utilized, they mostly rely on the $L_2$-norm to construct their learning
objectives, which leads to reduced robustness in the algorithms. To address
this, we propose Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation (TATSI), which
combines the $L_2$-norm and smooth $L_1$ (${SL}_1$)-norm in its loss function,
thereby achieving both high accuracy and robust performance in imputing missing
time-varying traffic speed data. TATSI adopts a single latent factor-dependent,
nonnegative, and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) approach, which serves as an
efficient solver for performing nonnegative latent factor analysis (LFA) on a
tensor. Empirical studies on three real-world time-varying traffic speed
datasets demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art traffic speed
predictors, TATSI more precisely captures temporal patterns, thereby yielding
the most accurate imputations for missing traffic speed data.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了生成模型在数据驱动电力系统应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Many data-driven modules in smart grid rely on access to high-quality power
flow data; however, real-world data are often limited due to privacy and
operational constraints. This paper presents a physics-informed generative
framework based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for
synthesizing feasible power flow data. By incorporating auxiliary training and
physics-informed loss functions, the proposed method ensures that the generated
data exhibit both statistical fidelity and adherence to power system
feasibility. We evaluate the approach on the IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus benchmark
systems, demonstrating its ability to capture key distributional properties and
generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios. Comparative results show that the
proposed model outperforms three baseline models in terms of feasibility,
diversity, and accuracy of statistical features. This work highlights the
potential of integrating generative modelling into data-driven power system
applications.

Result: 实验表明NeuralGrok显著加速泛化，提升训练稳定性，并通过AGE指标验证其降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: NeuralGrok为Transformer的Grokking现象提供新见解，促进对泛化能力的理解。

Abstract: Grokking is proposed and widely studied as an intricate phenomenon in which
generalization is achieved after a long-lasting period of overfitting. In this
work, we propose NeuralGrok, a novel gradient-based approach that learns an
optimal gradient transformation to accelerate the generalization of
transformers in arithmetic tasks. Specifically, NeuralGrok trains an auxiliary
module (e.g., an MLP block) in conjunction with the base model. This module
dynamically modulates the influence of individual gradient components based on
their contribution to generalization, guided by a bilevel optimization
algorithm. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralGrok significantly
accelerates generalization, particularly in challenging arithmetic tasks. We
also show that NeuralGrok promotes a more stable training paradigm, constantly
reducing the model's complexity, while traditional regularization methods, such
as weight decay, can introduce substantial instability and impede
generalization. We further investigate the intrinsic model complexity
leveraging a novel Absolute Gradient Entropy (AGE) metric, which explains that
NeuralGrok effectively facilitates generalization by reducing the model
complexity. We offer valuable insights on the grokking phenomenon of
Transformer models, which encourages a deeper understanding of the fundamental
principles governing generalization ability.

Abstract: Deep learning-based antimicrobial peptide (AMP) discovery faces critical
challenges such as low experimental hit rates as well as the need for nuanced
controllability and efficient modeling of peptide properties. To address these
challenges, we introduce OmegAMP, a framework that leverages a diffusion-based
generative model with efficient low-dimensional embeddings, precise
controllability mechanisms, and novel classifiers with drastically reduced
false positive rates for candidate filtering. OmegAMP enables the targeted
generation of AMPs with specific physicochemical properties, activity profiles,
and species-specific effectiveness. Moreover, it maximizes sample diversity
while ensuring faithfulness to the underlying data distribution during
generation. We demonstrate that OmegAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all stages of the AMP discovery pipeline, significantly advancing the
potential of computational frameworks in combating antimicrobial resistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下采样层在CNN架构中至关重要，但现有方法在群等变架构中的泛化能力有限，因此需要研究一种适用于有限群的抗混叠下采样方法。

Method: 提出了一种算法来选择适合的子群，并研究了带限性和抗混叠方法，将经典采样理论推广到群等变架构中。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将经典下采样理论推广到群等变架构中，为相关研究提供了新的思路和工具。

Abstract: Downsampling layers are crucial building blocks in CNN architectures, which
help to increase the receptive field for learning high-level features and
reduce the amount of memory/computation in the model. In this work, we study
the generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant
architectures, e.g., G-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature
maps) on general finite groups with anti-aliasing. This involves the following:
(a) Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to
form a suitable choice of subgroup. (b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study
the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing.
Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical
sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our
method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed
by a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image
classification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation
improves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when
incorporated into G-equivariant networks

Motivation: 传统生成模型依赖大规模训练和隐式神经表示，计算成本高且灵活性有限，因此需要一种更高效、可编辑的方法。

Result: 在12种多模态生成任务中表现优异，内容质量与现有统一模型相当或更好，且更高效、可编辑和可中断。

Conclusion: 符号化任务表示为生成AI提供了成本效益高且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: We propose a symbolic generative task description language and a
corresponding inference engine capable of representing arbitrary multimodal
tasks as structured symbolic flows. Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on large-scale training and implicit neural representations to learn
cross-modal mappings, often at high computational cost and with limited
flexibility, our framework introduces an explicit symbolic representation
comprising three core primitives: functions, parameters, and topological logic.
Leveraging a pre-trained language model, our inference engine maps natural
language instructions directly to symbolic workflows in a training-free manner.
Our framework successfully performs over 12 diverse multimodal generative
tasks, demonstrating strong performance and flexibility without the need for
task-specific tuning. Experiments show that our method not only matches or
outperforms existing state-of-the-art unified models in content quality, but
also offers greater efficiency, editability, and interruptibility. We believe
that symbolic task representations provide a cost-effective and extensible
foundation for advancing the capabilities of generative AI.

TLDR: N/A


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering latent information from graphs under
$\varepsilon$-edge local differential privacy where the presence of
relationships/edges between two users/vertices remains confidential, even from
the data curator. For the class of generalized random dot-product graphs, we
show that a standard local differential privacy mechanism induces a specific
geometric distortion in the latent positions. Leveraging this insight, we show
that consistent recovery of the latent positions is achievable by appropriately
adjusting the statistical inference procedure for the privatized graph.
Furthermore, we prove that our procedure is nearly minimax-optimal under local
edge differential privacy constraints. Lastly, we show that this framework
allows for consistent recovery of geometric and topological information
underlying the latent positions, as encoded in their persistence diagrams. Our
results extend previous work from the private community detection literature to
a substantially richer class of models and inferential tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在图形数据表示方面取得了显著进展，但仍面临结构不平衡的挑战，且现有方法未考虑图形异质性。

Method: HeRB包含两个创新组件：1) 减少异质性的增强模块；2) 同质性知识转移机制。

Result: 实验表明，HeRB在两类同质性和六类异质性基准数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: HeRB通过解决异质性问题并转移同质性知识，有效提升了GNN的性能。

Abstract: Recent research has witnessed the remarkable progress of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) in the realm of graph data representation. However, GNNs still
encounter the challenge of structural imbalance. Prior solutions to this
problem did not take graph heterophily into account, namely that connected
nodes process distinct labels or features, thus resulting in a deficiency in
effectiveness. Upon verifying the impact of heterophily on solving the
structural imbalance problem, we propose to rectify the heterophily first and
then transfer homophilic knowledge. To the end, we devise a method named HeRB
(Heterophily-Resolved Structure Balancer) for GNNs. HeRB consists of two
innovative components: 1) A heterophily-lessening augmentation module which
serves to reduce inter-class edges and increase intra-class edges; 2) A
homophilic knowledge transfer mechanism to convey homophilic information from
head nodes to tail nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HeRB achieves
superior performance on two homophilic and six heterophilic benchmark datasets,
and the ablation studies further validate the efficacy of two proposed
components.

TLDR: 提出了一种结合离策略学习和特权信息的新方法（ExOSITO），用于优化ICU实验室测试订单，减少过度测试并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU中实验室测试的过度订购增加了临床负担和成本，需要一种平衡信息获取与资源优化的方法。

Method: 结合离策略学习和特权信息，提出ExOSITO框架，通过因果赌博问题和离线数据训练，生成可解释的临床辅助工具。

Result: ExOSITO优于医生策略和现有方法，减少成本且不遗漏关键测试订单。

Conclusion: ExOSITO为ICU实验室测试订单提供了一种高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Ordering a minimal subset of lab tests for patients in the intensive care
unit (ICU) can be challenging. Care teams must balance between ensuring the
availability of the right information and reducing the clinical burden and
costs associated with each lab test order. Most in-patient settings experience
frequent over-ordering of lab tests, but are now aiming to reduce this burden
on both hospital resources and the environment. This paper develops a novel
method that combines off-policy learning with privileged information to
identify the optimal set of ICU lab tests to order. Our approach, EXplainable
Off-policy learning with Side Information for ICU blood Test Orders (ExOSITO)
creates an interpretable assistive tool for clinicians to order lab tests by
considering both the observed and predicted future status of each patient. We
pose this problem as a causal bandit trained using offline data and a reward
function derived from clinically-approved rules; we introduce a novel learning
framework that integrates clinical knowledge with observational data to bridge
the gap between the optimal and logging policies. The learned policy function
provides interpretable clinical information and reduces costs without omitting
any vital lab orders, outperforming both a physician's policy and prior
approaches to this practical problem.

*Wencong You,Daniel Lowd*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 本文提出了一种更隐蔽的后门攻击方法AttrBkd，通过人类评估验证其攻击成功率和隐蔽性优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本分类器的后门攻击通常依赖不自然或语法错误的触发词，容易被人工检测。本文旨在设计更隐蔽的攻击方法，使其在人类检查下难以察觉。

Method: 提出AttrBkd方法，通过提取基线后门攻击的细粒度属性，设计三种触发属性生成策略，并进行全面的人类评估。

Result: 实验表明，AttrBkd的攻击成功率和隐蔽性均优于基线方法，且人类评估揭示了自动化指标与人类判断的差异。

Conclusion: AttrBkd证明了后门攻击可以通过设计更自然的触发词绕过人工检测，同时保持攻击有效性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks on text classifiers can cause them to predict a predefined
label when a particular "trigger" is present. Prior attacks often rely on
triggers that are ungrammatical or otherwise unusual, leading to conspicuous
attacks. As a result, human annotators, who play a critical role in curating
training data in practice, can easily detect and filter out these unnatural
texts during manual inspection, reducing the risk of such attacks. We argue
that a key criterion for a successful attack is for text with and without
triggers to be indistinguishable to humans. However, prior work neither
directly nor comprehensively evaluated attack subtlety and invisibility with
human involvement. We bridge the gap by conducting thorough human evaluations
to assess attack subtlety. We also propose \emph{AttrBkd}, consisting of three
recipes for crafting subtle yet effective trigger attributes, such as
extracting fine-grained attributes from existing baseline backdoor attacks. Our
human evaluations find that AttrBkd with these baseline-derived attributes is
often more effective (higher attack success rate) and more subtle (fewer
instances detected by humans) than the original baseline backdoor attacks,
demonstrating that backdoor attacks can bypass detection by being inconspicuous
and appearing natural even upon close inspection, while still remaining
effective. Our human annotation also provides information not captured by
automated metrics used in prior work, and demonstrates the misalignment of
these metrics with human judgment.

Abstract: The recent technological advances in digitalization have revolutionized the
industrial sector. Leveraging data analytics has now enabled the collection of
deep insights into the performance and, as a result, the optimization of
assets. Industrial drives, for example, already accumulate all the necessary
information to control electric machines. These signals include but are not
limited to currents, frequency, and temperature. Integrating machine learning
(ML) models responsible for predicting the evolution of those directly
collected or implicitly derived parameters enhances the smartness of industrial
systems even further. In this article, data already residing in most modern
electric drives has been used to develop a data-driven thermal model of a power
module. A test bench has been designed and used specifically for training and
validating the thermal digital twin undergoing various static and dynamic
operating profiles. Different approaches, from traditional linear models to
deep neural networks, have been implemented to emanate the best ML model for
estimating the case temperature of a power module. Several evaluation metrics
were then used to assess the investigated methods' performance and
implementation in industrial embedded systems.

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能优异，媲美依赖偏置监督的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，无需偏置信息即可实现鲁棒学习。

Abstract: Spurious correlations that lead models to correct predictions for the wrong
reasons pose a critical challenge for robust real-world generalization.
Existing research attributes this issue to group imbalance and addresses it by
maximizing group-balanced or worst-group accuracy, which heavily relies on
expensive bias annotations. A compromise approach involves predicting bias
information using extensively pretrained foundation models, which requires
large-scale data and becomes impractical for resource-limited rare domains. To
address these challenges, we offer a novel perspective by reframing the
spurious correlations as imbalances or mismatches in class-conditional
distributions, and propose a simple yet effective robust learning method that
eliminates the need for both bias annotations and predictions. With the goal of
reducing the mutual information between spurious factors and label information,
our method leverages a sample reweighting strategy to achieve class-conditional
distribution balancing, which automatically highlights minority groups and
classes, effectively dismantling spurious correlations and producing a debiased
data distribution for classification. Extensive experiments and analysis
demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers state-of-the-art
performance, rivaling methods that rely on bias supervision.

Conclusion: TCTO通过动态图优化和子图重用，显著提升了特征工程的效率和性能。

Abstract: Feature transformation methods aim to find an optimal mathematical
feature-feature crossing process that generates high-value features and
improves the performance of downstream machine learning tasks. Existing
frameworks, though designed to mitigate manual costs, often treat feature
transformations as isolated operations, ignoring dynamic dependencies between
transformation steps. To address the limitations, we propose TCTO, a
collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that automates
feature engineering through graph-driven path optimization. The framework's
core innovation lies in an evolving interaction graph that models features as
nodes and transformations as edges. Through graph pruning and backtracking, it
dynamically eliminates low-impact edges, reduces redundant operations, and
enhances exploration stability. This graph also provides full traceability to
empower TCTO to reuse high-utility subgraphs from historical transformations.
To demonstrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach, we conduct
comprehensive experiments and case studies, which show superior performance
across a range of datasets.

Result: 理论分析表明，所有代理在足够小的适应参数下能一致学习，最终将信念集中在真实假设上。

Conclusion: A²SL策略在合成数据和真实数据中均验证了其有效性，适用于动态在线环境。

Abstract: In social learning, a network of agents assigns probability scores (beliefs)
to some hypotheses of interest, which rule the generation of local streaming
data observed by each agent. Belief formation takes place by means of an
iterative two-step procedure where: i) the agents update locally their beliefs
by using some likelihood model; and ii) the updated beliefs are combined with
the beliefs of the neighboring agents, using a pooling rule. This procedure can
fail to perform well in the presence of dynamic drifts, leading the agents to
incorrect decision making. Here, we focus on the fully online setting where
both the true hypothesis and the likelihood models can change over time. We
propose the doubly adaptive social learning ($\text{A}^2\text{SL}$) strategy,
which infuses social learning with the necessary adaptation capabilities. This
goal is achieved by exploiting two adaptation stages: i) a stochastic gradient
descent update to learn and track the drifts in the decision model; ii) and an
adaptive belief update to track the true hypothesis changing over time. These
stages are controlled by two adaptation parameters that govern the evolution of
the error probability for each agent. We show that all agents learn
consistently for sufficiently small adaptation parameters, in the sense that
they ultimately place all their belief mass on the true hypothesis. In
particular, the probability of choosing the wrong hypothesis converges to
values on the order of the adaptation parameters. The theoretical analysis is
illustrated both on synthetic data and by applying the $\text{A}^2\text{SL}$
strategy to a social learning problem in the online setting using real data.

Motivation: 随着神经网络规模增大，资源高效实现变得尤为重要，现有压缩技术主要关注减少权重存储，而本文旨在减少推理时的加法操作。

Method: 结合剪枝、权重共享和LCC，优化硬件友好的推理计算。

Result: 在多层感知机和ResNet-34等大规模深度神经网络上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方案在减少计算量的同时保持了竞争力，适用于硬件实现。

Abstract: As state of the art neural networks (NNs) continue to grow in size, their
resource-efficient implementation becomes ever more important. In this paper,
we introduce a compression scheme that reduces the number of computations
required for NN inference on reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs. This is
achieved by combining pruning via regularized training, weight sharing and
linear computation coding (LCC). Contrary to common NN compression techniques,
where the objective is to reduce the memory used for storing the weights of the
NNs, our approach is optimized to reduce the number of additions required for
inference in a hardware-friendly manner. The proposed scheme achieves
competitive performance for simple multilayer perceptrons, as well as for large
scale deep NNs such as ResNet-34.

collaborative approach, where large and small models work synergistically, can
accelerate the adaptation of LLMs to private domains and unlock new potential
in AI. We explore various strategies for model collaboration and identify
potential challenges and opportunities. Building upon this, we advocate for
industry-driven research that prioritizes multi-objective benchmarks on
real-world private datasets and applications.

*Jun Zhang,Jue Wang,Huan Li,Zhongle Xie,Ke Chen,Lidan Shou*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: CHASe（Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection）是一种针对联邦主动学习（FAL）的方法，通过关注高认知变化（EVs）的样本，解决数据分布异质性和模型参数波动问题，提升模型准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FAL方法未考虑客户端数据分布的异质性及全局与局部模型参数的波动，影响了模型准确性。

Method: CHASe通过分析训练周期中的推理不一致性跟踪EVs，使用新的对齐损失校准不准确模型的决策边界，并通过数据冻结与唤醒机制提升数据选择效率。

Result: 实验表明，CHASe在多种数据集、模型复杂度和异质联邦设置下，均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CHASe有效解决了FAL中的数据异质性和模型波动问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) reduces human annotation costs for machine learning
systems by strategically selecting the most informative unlabeled data for
annotation, but performing it individually may still be insufficient due to
restricted data diversity and annotation budget. Federated Active Learning
(FAL) addresses this by facilitating collaborative data selection and model
training, while preserving the confidentiality of raw data samples. Yet,
existing FAL methods fail to account for the heterogeneity of data distribution
across clients and the associated fluctuations in global and local model
parameters, adversely affecting model accuracy. To overcome these challenges,
we propose CHASe (Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection), specifically
designed for FAL. CHASe focuses on identifying those unlabeled samples with
high epistemic variations (EVs), which notably oscillate around the decision
boundaries during training. To achieve both effectiveness and efficiency,
\model{} encompasses techniques for 1) tracking EVs by analyzing inference
inconsistencies across training epochs, 2) calibrating decision boundaries of
inaccurate models with a new alignment loss, and 3) enhancing data selection
efficiency via a data freeze and awaken mechanism with subset sampling.
Experiments show that CHASe surpasses various established baselines in terms of
effectiveness and efficiency, validated across diverse datasets, model
complexities, and heterogeneous federation settings.

TLDR: HMI是一种基于分层知识管理的多租户推理系统，旨在高效管理不同PLM租户，显著减少GPU内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练语言模型（PLM）在多租户环境中计算资源需求高的问题。

Method: 1. 将PLM知识分为通用、领域特定和任务特定三类；2. 构建分层PLM（hPLM）并管理知识；3. 系统优化（如分层知识预取和并行计算优化）。

Result: HMI可在单个GPU上高效服务多达10,000个hPLM，且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: HMI通过分层知识管理和系统优化，显著提升了多租户环境中PLM的资源利用效率。

Abstract: The significant computational demands of pretrained language models (PLMs),
which often require dedicated hardware, present a substantial challenge in
serving them efficiently, especially in multi-tenant environments. To address
this, we introduce HMI, a Hierarchical knowledge management-based Multi-tenant
Inference system, designed to manage tenants with distinct PLMs
resource-efficiently. Our approach is three-fold: Firstly, we categorize PLM
knowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific. Leveraging insights
on knowledge acquisition across different model layers, we construct
hierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) by extracting and storing knowledge at different
levels, significantly reducing GPU memory usage per tenant. Secondly, we
establish hierarchical knowledge management for hPLMs generated by various
tenants in HMI. We manage domain-specific knowledge with acceptable storage
increases by constructing and updating domain-specific knowledge trees based on
frequency. We manage task-specific knowledge within limited GPU memory through
parameter swapping. Finally, we propose system optimizations to enhance
resource utilization and inference throughput. These include fine-grained
pipelining via hierarchical knowledge prefetching to overlap CPU and I/O
operations with GPU computations, and optimizing parallel implementations with
batched matrix multiplications. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed HMI can efficiently serve up to 10,000 hPLMs (hBERTs and hGPTs) on a
single GPU, with only a negligible compromise in accuracy.

Motivation: 气候变化导致极端降雨频率增加，传统物理模型成本高且难以适应动态变化，机器学习提供了一种更经济高效且适应性强的替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种评估神经网络架构的协议，比较全局模型和局部模型的预测性能、复杂性和鲁棒性，并引入误差模型评估安全性。

Result: 全局模型预测性能更高，但局部模型在分散场景中更具鲁棒性；长预测范围的模型对数据扰动更稳健。

Conclusion: 研究为可持续城市污水管理提供了可解释且可靠的机器学习解决方案，相关实现已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Climate change increases the frequency of extreme rainfall, placing a
significant strain on urban infrastructures, especially Combined Sewer Systems
(CSS). Overflows from overburdened CSS release untreated wastewater into
surface waters, posing environmental and public health risks. Although
traditional physics-based models are effective, they are costly to maintain and
difficult to adapt to evolving system dynamics. Machine Learning (ML)
approaches offer cost-efficient alternatives with greater adaptability. To
systematically assess the potential of ML for modeling urban infrastructure
systems, we propose a protocol for evaluating Neural Network architectures for
CSS time series forecasting with respect to predictive performance, model
complexity, and robustness to perturbations. In addition, we assess model
performance on peak events and critical fluctuations, as these are the key
regimes for urban wastewater management. To investigate the feasibility of
lightweight models suitable for IoT deployment, we compare global models, which
have access to all information, with local models, which rely solely on nearby
sensor readings. Additionally, to explore the security risks posed by network
outages or adversarial attacks on urban infrastructure, we introduce error
models that assess the resilience of models. Our results demonstrate that while
global models achieve higher predictive performance, local models provide
sufficient resilience in decentralized scenarios, ensuring robust modeling of
urban infrastructure. Furthermore, models with longer native forecast horizons
exhibit greater robustness to data perturbations. These findings contribute to
the development of interpretable and reliable ML solutions for sustainable
urban wastewater management. The implementation is available in our GitHub
repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Gossip Learning方法在动态图中对拜占庭攻击（尤其是针对RPS协议的攻击）缺乏鲁棒性，需要一种解决方案。

Method: GRANITE结合了历史感知的拜占庭弹性对等采样协议（HaPS）和自适应概率阈值（APT），以减少对抗性影响并设置聚合阈值。

Result: 实验证明，GRANITE在30%拜占庭节点下仍能保持收敛，学习速度更快，且适用于比现有理论稀疏9倍的图。

Conclusion: GRANITE为稀疏动态图中的鲁棒学习提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了对抗拜占庭攻击的能力。

Abstract: Gossip Learning (GL) is a decentralized learning paradigm where users
iteratively exchange and aggregate models with a small set of neighboring
peers. Recent GL approaches rely on dynamic communication graphs built and
maintained using Random Peer Sampling (RPS) protocols. Thanks to graph
dynamics, GL can achieve fast convergence even over extremely sparse
topologies. However, the robustness of GL over dy- namic graphs to Byzantine
(model poisoning) attacks remains unaddressed especially when Byzantine nodes
attack the RPS protocol to scale up model poisoning. We address this issue by
introducing GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic
graphs in the presence of a fraction of Byzantine nodes. GRANITE relies on two
key components (i) a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol
(HaPS), which tracks previously encountered identifiers to reduce adversarial
influence over time, and (ii) an Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT), which
leverages an estimate of Byzantine presence to set aggregation thresholds with
formal guarantees. Empirical results confirm that GRANITE maintains convergence
with up to 30% Byzantine nodes, improves learning speed via adaptive filtering
of poisoned models and obtains these results in up to 9 times sparser graphs
than dictated by current theory.

Abstract: Developing lifelong learning agents is crucial for artificial general

open-source framework for benchmarking plasticity optimization in deep RL.
Plasticine provides single-file implementations of over 13 mitigation methods,
10 evaluation metrics, and learning scenarios with increasing non-stationarity
levels from standard to open-ended environments. This framework enables
researchers to systematically quantify plasticity loss, evaluate mitigation
strategies, and analyze plasticity dynamics across different contexts. Our

Abstract: Data-driven emulators are increasingly being used to learn and emulate
physics-based simulations, reducing computational expense and run time. Here,
we present a structured way to improve the quality of these high-dimensional
emulated outputs, through the use of prototypes: an approximation of the
emulator's output passed as an input, which informs the model and leads to
better predictions. We demonstrate our approach to emulate atmospheric
dispersion, key for greenhouse gas emissions monitoring, by comparing a
baseline model to models trained using prototypes as an additional input. The
prototype models achieve better performance, even with few prototypes and even
if they are chosen at random, but we show that choosing the prototypes through
data-driven methods (k-means) can lead to almost 10\% increased performance in
some metrics.

Conclusion: 为预测与决策在实际应用中的更好结合提供了基础。

Abstract: Traditional time-series forecasting often focuses only on minimizing
prediction errors, ignoring the specific requirements of real-world
applications that employ them. This paper presents a new training methodology,
which allows a forecasting model to dynamically adjust its focus based on the
importance of forecast ranges specified by the end application. Unlike previous
methods that fix these ranges beforehand, our training approach breaks down
predictions over the entire signal range into smaller segments, which are then
dynamically weighted and combined to produce accurate forecasts. We tested our
method on standard datasets, including a new dataset from wireless
communication, and found that not only it improves prediction accuracy but also
improves the performance of end application employing the forecasting model.
This research provides a basis for creating forecasting systems that better
connect prediction and decision-making in various practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法（如SVM和XGBoost）依赖预定义的分子表示，可能导致信息丢失和偏差，而深度学习方法（如GCN）和LLM提供了更优的解决方案。

Method: 设计了一种混合架构，将GCN与LLM嵌入结合，并在每个GCN层后拼接LLM嵌入，以深度融合全局化学知识。

Result: 模型表现优异，F1分数达88.8%，优于单独使用GCN（87.9%）、XGBoost（85.5%）和SVM（85.4%）。

Conclusion: 混合架构成功结合了GCN和LLM的优势，为虚拟筛选提供了更高效和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual screening plays a critical role in modern drug discovery by enabling
the identification of promising candidate molecules for experimental
validation. Traditional machine learning methods such as support vector
machines (SVM) and XGBoost rely on predefined molecular representations, often
leading to information loss and potential bias. In contrast, deep learning
approaches-particularly Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-offer a more
expressive and unbiased alternative by operating directly on molecular graphs.
Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in drug design, thanks to their capacity to
capture complex chemical patterns from large-scale data via attention
mechanisms.
  In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates GCNs with
LLM-derived embeddings to combine localized structural learning with global
chemical knowledge. The LLM embeddings can be precomputed and stored in a
molecular feature library, removing the need to rerun the LLM during training
or inference and thus maintaining computational efficiency. We found that
concatenating the LLM embeddings after each GCN layer-rather than only at the
final layer-significantly improves performance, enabling deeper integration of
global context throughout the network. The resulting model achieves superior
results, with an F1-score of (88.8%), outperforming standalone GCN (87.9%),
XGBoost (85.5%), and SVM (85.4%) baselines.

Result: 预测性能在储层非线性与数据非线性匹配时达到最佳；提出了一种估计未知时间序列最小非线性的方法。

Conclusion: 为储层计算机设计提供了依据，特别是在资源受限场景中，通过匹配系统内在复杂性提升性能。

Abstract: We study how the degree of nonlinearity in the input data affects the optimal
design of reservoir computers, focusing on how closely the model's nonlinearity
should align with that of the data. By reducing minimal RCs to a single tunable
nonlinearity parameter, we explore how the predictive performance varies with
the degree of nonlinearity in the reservoir. To provide controlled testbeds, we
generalize to the fractional Halvorsen system, a novel chaotic system with
fractional exponents. Our experiments reveal that the prediction performance is
maximized when the reservoir's nonlinearity matches the nonlinearity present in
the data. In cases where multiple nonlinearities are present in the data, we
find that the correlation dimension of the predicted signal is reconstructed
correctly when the smallest nonlinearity is matched. We use this observation to
propose a method for estimating the minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series
by sweeping the reservoir exponent and identifying the transition to a
successful reconstruction. Applying this method to both synthetic and
real-world datasets, including financial time series, we demonstrate its
practical viability. Finally, we transfer these insights to classical RC by
augmenting traditional architectures with fractional, generalized reservoir
states. This yields performance gains, particularly in resource-constrained
scenarios such as physical reservoirs, where increasing reservoir size is
impractical or economically unviable. Our work provides a principled route
toward tailoring RCs to the intrinsic complexity of the systems they aim to
model.

Abstract: To jointly tackle the challenges of data and node heterogeneity in
decentralized learning, we propose a distributed strong lottery ticket
hypothesis (DSLTH), based on which a communication-efficient personalized
learning algorithm is developed. In the proposed method, each local model is
represented as the Hadamard product of global real-valued parameters and a
personalized binary mask for pruning. The local model is learned by updating
and fusing the personalized binary masks while the real-valued parameters are
fixed among different agents. To further reduce the complexity of hardware
implementation, we incorporate a group sparse regularization term in the loss
function, enabling the learned local model to achieve structured sparsity.
Then, a binary mask aggregation algorithm is designed by introducing an
intermediate aggregation tensor and adding a personalized fine-tuning step in
each iteration, which constrains model updates towards the local data
distribution. The proposed method effectively leverages the relativity among
agents while meeting personalized requirements in heterogeneous node
conditions. We also provide a theoretical proof for the DSLTH, establishing it
as the foundation of the proposed method. Numerical simulations confirm the
validity of the DSLTH and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.

Result: CTO-TP算法相比基线方案，系统延迟降低80%，能耗减少87%。

Conclusion: CTO-TP框架有效解决了复杂场景下的任务卸载问题，显著提升了性能和能效。

Abstract: Future networks (including 6G) are poised to accelerate the realisation of
Internet of Everything. However, it will result in a high demand for computing
resources to support new services. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising
solution, enabling to offload computation-intensive tasks to nearby edge
servers from the end-user devices, thereby reducing latency and energy
consumption. However, relying solely on a single MEC server for task offloading
can lead to uneven resource utilisation and suboptimal performance in complex
scenarios. Additionally, traditional task offloading strategies specialise in
centralised policy decisions, which unavoidably entail extreme transmission
latency and reach computational bottleneck. To fill the gaps, we propose a
latency and energy efficient Cooperative Task Offloading framework with
Transformer-driven Prediction (CTO-TP), leveraging asynchronous multi-agent
deep reinforcement learning to address these challenges. This approach fosters
edge-edge cooperation and decreases the synchronous waiting time by performing
asynchronous training, optimising task offloading, and resource allocation
across distributed networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the
proposed CTO-TP algorithm reduces up to 80% overall system latency and 87%
energy consumption compared to the baseline schemes.

Conclusion: TACO有效解决非独立同分布数据问题，提升联邦学习效率和模型准确性。

Abstract: Non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data across edge
clients have long posed significant challenges to federated learning (FL)
training in edge computing environments. Prior works have proposed various
methods to mitigate this statistical heterogeneity. While these works can
achieve good theoretical performance, in this work we provide the first
investigation into a hidden over-correction phenomenon brought by the uniform
model correction coefficients across clients adopted by existing methods. Such
over-correction could degrade model performance and even cause failures in
model convergence. To address this, we propose TACO, a novel algorithm that
addresses the non-IID nature of clients' data by implementing fine-grained,
client-specific gradient correction and model aggregation, steering local
models towards a more accurate global optimum. Moreover, we verify that leading
FL algorithms generally have better model accuracy in terms of communication
rounds rather than wall-clock time, resulting from their extra computation
overhead imposed on clients. To enhance the training efficiency, TACO deploys a
lightweight model correction and tailored aggregation approach that requires
minimum computation overhead and no extra information beyond the synchronized
model parameters. To validate TACO's effectiveness, we present the first FL
convergence analysis that reveals the root cause of over-correction. Extensive
experiments across various datasets confirm TACO's superior and stable
performance in practice.

Conclusion: 通过图表示和MDS技术，可以提升自动驾驶系统的泛化能力，适应复杂道路场景。

Abstract: The lack of generalization in learning-based autonomous driving applications
is shown by the narrow range of road scenarios that vehicles can currently
cover. A generalizable approach should capture many distinct road structures
and topologies, as well as consider traffic participants, and dynamic changes
in the environment, so that vehicles can navigate and perform motion planning
tasks even in the most difficult situations. Designing suitable feature spaces
for neural network-based motion planers that encapsulate all kinds of road
scenarios is still an open research challenge. This paper tackles this
learning-based generalization challenge and shows how graph representations of
road networks can be leveraged by using multidimensional scaling (MDS)
techniques in order to obtain such feature spaces. State-of-the-art graph
representations and MDS approaches are analyzed for the autonomous driving use
case. Finally, the option of embedding graph nodes is discussed in order to
perform easier learning procedures and obtain dimensionality reduction.

Motivation: 传统的Cox模型假设线性和比例风险（PH），但在实际应用中这些假设可能不成立。研究旨在评估机器学习和深度学习方法在放松这些约束后的表现。

Method: 研究测试了八种模型（包括六种非线性模型，其中四种为非PH模型），在三个合成数据集和三个真实数据集上比较其性能。

Result: Cox回归通常表现良好，但机器学习和深度学习模型在非线性或非PH条件下表现更优。Antolini's C-index和Brier's score的组合更适合评估模型性能。

Conclusion: 生存预测应根据样本量、非线性和非PH条件选择合适方法，研究提供了代码和文档以便复现。

Abstract: Survival analysis often relies on Cox models, assuming both linearity and
proportional hazards (PH). This study evaluates machine and deep learning
methods that relax these constraints, comparing their performance with
penalized Cox models on a benchmark of three synthetic and three real datasets.
In total, eight different models were tested, including six non-linear models
of which four were also non-PH. Although Cox regression often yielded
satisfactory performance, we showed the conditions under which machine and deep
learning models can perform better. Indeed, the performance of these methods
has often been underestimated due to the improper use of Harrell's concordance
index (C-index) instead of more appropriate scores such as Antolini's
concordance index, which generalizes C-index in cases where the PH assumption
does not hold. In addition, since occasionally high C-index models happen to be
badly calibrated, combining Antolini's C-index with Brier's score is useful to
assess the overall performance of a survival method. Results on our benchmark
data showed that survival prediction should be approached by testing different
methods to select the most appropriate one according to sample size,
non-linearity and non-PH conditions. To allow an easy reproducibility of these
tests on our benchmark data, code and documentation are freely available at

Result: 实验表明，TileLang在关键内核中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TileLang的统一块-线程范式和透明调度能力满足了现代AI系统开发的需求。

Abstract: Modern AI workloads rely heavily on optimized computing kernels for both
training and inference. These AI kernels follow well-defined data-flow
patterns, such as moving tiles between DRAM and SRAM and performing a sequence
of computations on those tiles. However, writing high-performance kernels
remains complex despite the clarity of these patterns. Achieving peak
performance requires careful, hardware-centric optimizations to fully leverage
modern accelerators. While domain-specific compilers attempt to reduce the
burden of writing high-performance kernels, they often struggle with usability
and expressiveness gaps. In this paper, we present TileLang, a generalized
tiled programming model for more efficient AI Kernel programming. TileLang
decouples scheduling space (thread binding, layout, tensorize and pipeline)
from dataflow, and encapsulated them as a set of customization annotations and
primitives. This approach allows users to focus on the kernel's data-flow
itself, while leaving most other optimizations to compilers. We conduct

Result: 实验表明LCC在优化效果和资源消耗上优于现有方法，并具有向未见问题的迁移能力。

Conclusion: LCC为大规模全局优化问题提供了一种无需专家知识的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research in Cooperative Coevolution~(CC) have achieved promising
progress in solving large-scale global optimization problems. However, existing
CC paradigms have a primary limitation in that they require deep expertise for
selecting or designing effective variable decomposition strategies. Inspired by
advancements in Meta-Black-Box Optimization, this paper introduces LCC, a
pioneering learning-based cooperative coevolution framework that dynamically
schedules decomposition strategies during optimization processes. The
decomposition strategy selector is parameterized through a neural network,
which processes a meticulously crafted set of optimization status features to
determine the optimal strategy for each optimization step. The network is
trained via the Proximal Policy Optimization method in a reinforcement learning
manner across a collection of representative problems, aiming to maximize the
expected optimization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that LCC not only offers certain advantages over state-of-the-art baselines in
terms of optimization effectiveness and resource consumption, but it also
exhibits promising transferability towards unseen problems.

Result: 算法实现了强大的降维效果，同时提供对转换过程的透明理解，包括维度抑制和空间变形分析。

Conclusion: 该算法在学术和工业中具有实用价值，配套的软件工具进一步促进了其应用。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are fundamental for analyzing and
visualizing high-dimensional data. With established methods like t-SNE and PCA
presenting a trade-off between representational power and interpretability.
This paper introduces a novel approach that bridges this gap by combining the
interpretability of linear methods with the expressiveness of non-linear
transformations. The proposed algorithm constructs a non-linear mapping between
high-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces through a combination of linear
transformations, each weighted by Gaussian functions. This architecture enables
complex non-linear transformations while preserving the interpretability
advantages of linear methods, as each transformation can be analyzed
independently. The resulting model provides both powerful dimensionality
reduction and transparent insights into the transformed space. Techniques for
interpreting the learned transformations are presented, including methods for
identifying suppressed dimensions and how space is expanded and contracted.
These tools enable practitioners to understand how the algorithm preserves and
modifies geometric relationships during dimensionality reduction. To ensure the
practical utility of this algorithm, the creation of user-friendly software
packages is emphasized, facilitating its adoption in both academia and
industry.

TLDR: TarDiff是一种新型目标导向扩散框架，通过任务特定影响指导生成合成EHR时间序列数据，显著提升下游模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅复制真实数据的统计分布和时序依赖，但无法保证模型性能提升，尤其是对罕见但重要条件的表示不足。

Method: TarDiff通过影响函数量化合成样本对下游模型性能的贡献，并将影响梯度嵌入反向扩散过程，生成优化数据。

Result: 在六个公开EHR数据集上，TarDiff的AUPRC和AUROC分别提升20.4%和18.4%，表现最优。

Conclusion: TarDiff不仅保持时序保真度，还能增强模型性能，为医疗数据分析中的数据稀缺和类别不平衡提供解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series generation is crucial
for advancing clinical machine learning models, as it helps address data
scarcity by providing more training data. However, most existing approaches
focus primarily on replicating statistical distributions and temporal
dependencies of real-world data. We argue that fidelity to observed data alone
does not guarantee better model performance, as common patterns may dominate,
limiting the representation of rare but important conditions. This highlights
the need for generate synthetic samples to improve performance of specific
clinical models to fulfill their target outcomes. To address this, we propose
TarDiff, a novel target-oriented diffusion framework that integrates
task-specific influence guidance into the synthetic data generation process.
Unlike conventional approaches that mimic training data distributions, TarDiff
optimizes synthetic samples by quantifying their expected contribution to
improving downstream model performance through influence functions.
Specifically, we measure the reduction in task-specific loss induced by
synthetic samples and embed this influence gradient into the reverse diffusion
process, thereby steering the generation towards utility-optimized data.
Evaluated on six publicly available EHR datasets, TarDiff achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 20.4% in
AUPRC and 18.4% in AUROC. Our results demonstrate that TarDiff not only
preserves temporal fidelity but also enhances downstream model performance,
offering a robust solution to data scarcity and class imbalance in healthcare
analytics.

Motivation: 由于隐私和数据监管问题，联邦学习成为分布式时间序列数据学习的可行方案，但传统客户端-服务器架构存在单点故障和隐私泄露风险。

Method: DROCKS采用完全去中心化架构，利用ROCKET特征，通过节点间顺序传递和优化模型及核函数。

Result: 在UCR存档上的实验表明，DROCKS优于现有客户端-服务器联邦学习方法，且对节点故障和恶意攻击更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DROCKS为时间序列分类提供了一种高效、安全且去中心化的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a critical task with applications in
various domains, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Due
to privacy concerns and data regulations, Federated Learning has emerged as a
promising approach for learning from distributed time series data without
centralizing raw information. However, most FL solutions rely on a
client-server architecture, which introduces robustness and confidentiality
risks related to the distinguished role of the server, which is a single point
of failure and can observe knowledge extracted from clients. To address these
challenges, we propose DROCKS, a fully decentralized FL framework for TSC that
leverages ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) features. In DROCKS,
the global model is trained by sequentially traversing a structured path across
federation nodes, where each node refines the model and selects the most
effective local kernels before passing them to the successor. Extensive
experiments on the UCR archive demonstrate that DROCKS outperforms
state-of-the-art client-server FL approaches while being more resilient to node
failures and malicious attacks. Our code is available at

TLDR: 本文研究了神经网络（NN）Hessian矩阵特征值谱密度（HESD）的行为及其对NN泛化能力的影响，提出了统一的HESD分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hessian矩阵包含NN损失曲面的曲率信息，可用于估计泛化能力。本文旨在进一步验证HESD的适用性，并研究影响HESD类型的因素。

Method: 通过实验研究不同优化器、数据集及预处理方法对HESD的影响，提出判断HESD类型的条件和标准。

Result: 发现HESD主要为正值（MP-HESD）或负值（MN-HESD），后者由外部梯度操作引起。提出统一HESD分析方法，并讨论训练中HESD的变化及准奇异（QS）HESD的影响。

Conclusion: HESD类型和泛化标准可结合为统一分析方法，但需注意QS-HESD对传统Hessian特征值与损失曲面关系假设的影响。

Abstract: Hessians of neural network (NN) contain essential information about the
curvature of NN loss landscapes which can be used to estimate NN generalization
capabilities. We have previously proposed generalization criteria that rely on
the observation that Hessian eigenvalue spectral density (HESD) behaves
similarly for a wide class of NNs. This paper further studies their
applicability by investigating factors that can result in different types of
HESD. We conduct a wide range of experiments showing that HESD mainly has
positive eigenvalues (MP-HESD) for NN training and fine-tuning with various
optimizers on different datasets with different preprocessing and augmentation
procedures. We also show that mainly negative HESD (MN-HESD) is a consequence
of external gradient manipulation, indicating that the previously proposed
Hessian analysis methodology cannot be applied in such cases. We also propose
criteria and corresponding conditions to determine HESD type and estimate NN
generalization potential. These HESD types and previously proposed
generalization criteria are combined into a unified HESD analysis methodology.
Finally, we discuss how HESD changes during training, and show the occurrence
of quasi-singular (QS) HESD and its influence on the proposed methodology and
on the conventional assumptions about the relation between Hessian eigenvalues
and NN loss landscape curvature.

TLDR: PTCL是一种解决仅依赖最终标签的动态节点分类问题的新方法，通过伪标签和时间课程学习策略提高分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态系统中，动态节点分类需要捕捉节点信息变化，但现实中难以获取所有时间戳的标签，而最终标签更易获得。

Method: PTCL采用时间解耦架构（分离主干和解码器）和时间课程学习策略（优先处理接近最终时间戳的伪标签）。

Result: 实验表明PTCL在多个真实场景中优于其他方法，并贡献了新数据集CoOAG。

Conclusion: PTCL和统一框架FLiD为标签有限的动态节点分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like
financial transactions and academic collaborations. In such systems,
dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node
classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp. However,
it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to
high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels
in fraud detection). In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain
as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a
unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history
data. To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum
Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node
classification where only final labels are available. PTCL introduces: (1) a
temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware
representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which
generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that
prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them
higher weights using an exponentially decaying function. We contribute a new
academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic
graph. Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent
superiority over other methods adapted to this task. Beyond methodology, we
propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node
Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training
pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.

Method: 利用预训练模型（MobileNet、DenseNet、ResNet）微调有限标记数据，评估有无温度标定的两种流程，关注覆盖率和预测集大小。

Result: 共形预测即使在小样本和简单非共形分数下也能提供有价值的不确定性估计；温度标定不一定减小预测集大小。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注噪声标签对共形预测的影响，并探索模型压缩策略在资源受限环境中的应用。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal
prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse
events in unconstrained environments. Conformal prediction is a powerful
post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it
into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage
of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study
addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world
settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models
(MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to
generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of
calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature
scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and
average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how
calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency.
Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and
simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable
uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not
consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of
careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight
the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal
prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based
on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact
of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore
effective model reduction strategies.

Result: NPE-PF在基准任务和复杂科学逆问题中表现优异，模拟效率显著提升。

Conclusion: NPE-PF为SBI提供了一种无需训练、高效且灵活的新方向。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a flexible and general approach to
performing Bayesian inference: In SBI, a neural network is trained on synthetic
data simulated from a model and used to rapidly infer posterior distributions
for observed data. A key goal for SBI is to achieve accurate inference with as
few simulations as possible, especially for expensive simulators. In this work,
we address this challenge by repurposing recent probabilistic foundation models
for tabular data: We show how tabular foundation models -- specifically TabPFN
-- can be used as pre-trained autoregressive conditional density estimators for
SBI. We propose Neural Posterior Estimation with Prior-data Fitted Networks
(NPE-PF) and show that it is competitive with current SBI approaches in terms
of accuracy for both benchmark tasks and two complex scientific inverse
problems. Crucially, it often substantially outperforms them in terms of
simulation efficiency, sometimes requiring orders of magnitude fewer
simulations. NPE-PF eliminates the need for inference network selection,
training, and hyperparameter tuning. We also show that it exhibits superior
robustness to model misspecification and can be scaled to simulation budgets
that exceed the context size limit of TabPFN. NPE-PF provides a new direction
for SBI, where training-free, general-purpose inference models offer efficient,
easy-to-use, and flexible solutions for a wide range of stochastic inverse
problems.

Conclusion: 该方法为数据稀缺情况下的异常检测提供了新方向，能更早、更可靠地进行故障诊断。

Abstract: Intelligent condition monitoring of wind turbines is essential for reducing
downtimes. Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are
commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However,
data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of
training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault
diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep
learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training
data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data.
Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an
NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to one with severely limited data. We
demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7
substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault
diagnosis in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most
similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs
trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1
month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The
domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered
degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The
proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault diagnosis in newly
installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to
improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Multidrug Resistance (MDR) is a critical global
health issue, causing increased hospital stays, healthcare costs, and
mortality. This study proposes an interpretable Machine Learning (ML) framework
for MDR prediction, aiming for both accurate inference and enhanced
explainability.
  Methods: Patients are modeled as Multivariate Time Series (MTS), capturing
clinical progression and patient-to-patient interactions. Similarity among
patients is quantified using MTS-based methods: descriptive statistics, Dynamic
Time Warping, and Time Cluster Kernel. These similarity measures serve as
inputs for MDR classification via Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and
Support Vector Machines, with dimensionality reduction and kernel
transformations improving model performance. For explainability, patient
similarity networks are constructed from these metrics. Spectral clustering and
t-SNE are applied to identify MDR-related subgroups and visualize high-risk
clusters, enabling insight into clinically relevant patterns.
  Results: The framework was validated on ICU Electronic Health Records from
the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada, achieving an AUC of 81%. It outperforms
baseline ML and deep learning models by leveraging graph-based patient
similarity. The approach identifies key risk factors -- prolonged antibiotic
use, invasive procedures, co-infections, and extended ICU stays -- and reveals
clinically meaningful clusters. Code and results are available at
\https://github.com/oscarescuderoarnanz/DM4MTS.
  Conclusions: Patient similarity representations combined with graph-based
analysis provide accurate MDR prediction and interpretable insights. This
method supports early detection, risk factor identification, and patient
stratification, highlighting the potential of explainable ML in critical care.

Abstract: In industrial settings, surface defects on steel can significantly compromise
its service life and elevate potential safety risks. Traditional defect
detection methods predominantly rely on manual inspection, which suffers from
low efficiency and high costs. Although automated defect detection approaches
based on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly,
their reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties
during deep model training and overfitting issues. These limitations may lead
to detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering
automated detection processes unreliable. To address this challenge, we first
evaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data
that satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition
with test data. Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration
sample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate
and false discovery rate. Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous
threshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability
defective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g.,
defect regions). This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean
error rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk
level. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average
prediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a
statistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty.
Furthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the
expected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning
ratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial
intelligence, yet these models remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations,
undermining their reliability in high-stakes applications. While adversarial
robustness in vision-based neural networks has been extensively studied, LLM
robustness remains under-explored. We adapt the Robustness Measurement and
Assessment (RoMA) framework to quantify LLM resilience against adversarial
inputs without requiring access to model parameters. By comparing RoMA's
estimates to those of formal verification methods, we demonstrate its accuracy
with minimal error margins while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
empirical evaluation reveals that robustness varies significantly not only
between different models but also across categories within the same task and
between various types of perturbations. This non-uniformity underscores the
need for task-specific robustness evaluations, enabling practitioners to
compare and select models based on application-specific robustness
requirements. Our work provides a systematic methodology to assess LLM
robustness, advancing the development of more reliable language models for
real-world deployment.

symptoms. Speech impairments offer a valuable diagnostic opportunity, with
machine learning advances providing promising tools for timely detection. In
this research, we propose a deep learning approach for early Parkinson's
disease detection from speech recordings, which also highlights the vocal
segments driving predictions to enhance interpretability. This approach seeks
to associate predictive speech patterns with articulatory features, providing a
basis for interpreting underlying neuromuscular impairments. We evaluated our
approach using the Italian Parkinson's Voice and Speech Database, containing
831 audio recordings from 65 participants, including both healthy individuals
and patients. Our approach showed competitive classification performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while providing enhanced interpretability
by identifying key speech features influencing predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代信号处理中分布数据的重要性日益突出，但现有神经最优传输方法主要关注两个分布之间的单一映射计算。

Method: 使用Transformer架构生成变长分布数据的嵌入，再通过超网络生成神经最优传输映射。

Result: 通过数值实验验证了嵌入和生成的最优传输映射的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为多分布最优传输问题提供了新的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Distributional data have become increasingly prominent in modern signal
processing, highlighting the necessity of computing optimal transport (OT) maps
across multiple probability distributions. Nevertheless, recent studies on
neural OT methods predominantly focused on the efficient computation of a
single map between two distributions. To address this challenge, we introduce a
novel approach to learning transport maps for new empirical distributions.
Specifically, we employ the transformer architecture to produce embeddings from
distributional data of varying length; these embeddings are then fed into a
hypernetwork to generate neural OT maps. Various numerical experiments were
conducted to validate the embeddings and the generated OT maps. The model
implementation and the code are provided on

Motivation: 现有的图神经网络在链接权重预测任务中表现不足，尤其是在多层网络中，复杂性更高，需要新的方法来解决。

Result: 实验表明，MSGCN在多种多层网络结构中表现出鲁棒、准确且可泛化的链接权重预测性能。

Conclusion: MSGCN为多层网络中的链接权重预测提供了一种有效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various learning
tasks, ranging from node classification to link prediction. They have
demonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving
graph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely
link weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased
complexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction
becomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes
can be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we
propose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN),
which spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer
link weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to
multiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across
multiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link
information show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable
link weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network
structures.

Motivation: 边缘设备资源有限，传统数字计算架构难以满足实时推理需求。

Conclusion: WISE显著提升无线边缘设备的深度学习推理能效。

Abstract: Modern edge devices, such as cameras, drones, and Internet-of-Things nodes,
rely on deep learning to enable a wide range of intelligent applications,
including object recognition, environment perception, and autonomous
navigation. However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often
resource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and
computational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing
architectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture
for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep
learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations:
disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation
of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio
frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast
model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image
classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per
client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This
approach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly
connected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement
in efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在持续学习中面临的灾难性遗忘问题，尤其是在计算和数据流受限的实际场景中。

Method: 结合LoRA和最小化回放机制，在医疗问答、遗传学和法律三个领域进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，即使最小化回放也能显著稳定并部分恢复领域知识。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的实际场景中部署适应性强的语言模型提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Continual learning in large language models (LLMs) typically encounters the
critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired
knowledge deteriorates upon exposure to new data. While techniques like replay
buffers and parameter-efficient tuning (e.g., Low-Rank Adaptation or LoRA) have
been proposed, few studies investigate real-time domain adaptation under strict
computational and data-stream constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate a
lightweight method combining LoRA and a minimal replay mechanism in a realistic
streaming setting across three diverse knowledge domains: medical question
answering, genetics, and law. Using perplexity, semantic similarity, and
GPT-based human-like evaluation metrics, we quantify the model's adaptation,
forgetting, and recovery over time. Our experiments reveal that while
catastrophic forgetting naturally occurs, even minimal replay significantly
stabilizes and partially restores domain-specific knowledge. This study
contributes practical insights for deploying adaptable LLMs in
resource-constrained, real-world scenarios.

TLDR: GeneMamba是一种基于状态空间建模的高效单细胞转录组学基础模型，解决了scRNA-seq数据的高维度和稀疏性问题，优于传统的Transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: scRNA-seq数据的高维度、稀疏性和批次效应带来了计算挑战，现有Transformer模型因二次复杂性和长程依赖处理不足而受限。

Method: GeneMamba采用Bi-Mamba架构，通过线性时间复杂度的状态空间建模捕获双向基因上下文，并结合生物学目标（如通路感知对比损失和基于排名的基因编码）进行预训练。

Result: 在30万细胞上预训练的GeneMamba在多批次整合、细胞类型注释和基因-基因相关性任务中表现出色，具有高性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GeneMamba是Transformer方法的实用替代方案，推动了大规模单细胞数据分析工具的发展。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution analysis of
cellular heterogeneity, but its complexity, which is marked by high
dimensionality, sparsity, and batch effects, which poses major computational
challenges. Transformer-based models have made significant advances in this
domain but are often limited by their quadratic complexity and suboptimal
handling of long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce GeneMamba, a
scalable and efficient foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics built
on state space modeling. Leveraging the Bi-Mamba architecture, GeneMamba
captures bidirectional gene context with linear-time complexity, offering
substantial computational gains over transformer baselines. The model is
pretrained on nearly 30 million cells and incorporates biologically informed
objectives, including pathway-aware contrastive loss and rank-based gene
encoding. We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch
integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating
strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position
GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods,
advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for
large-scale single-cell data analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: SentencePiece优于BPE，适用于低资源印度语言NER任务，尤其在跨语言零样本设置中表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨BPE在低资源印度语言NER任务中的适用性，并比较不同分词方法的效果。

Method: 系统比较BPE、SentencePiece和字符级分词策略，评估其内在语言特性和下游任务表现。

Result: SentencePiece在实体一致性和跨语言泛化能力上优于BPE，尤其在极低资源语言中表现突出。

Conclusion: SentencePiece是低资源印度语言NER任务中更有效的分词策略。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of Natural Language Processing (NLP),
especially for low resource languages, where subword segmentation influences
vocabulary structure and downstream task accuracy. Although Byte Pair Encoding
(BPE) is a standard tokenization method in multilingual language models, its
suitability for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in low resource Indic languages
remains underexplored due to its limitations in handling morphological
complexity. In this work, we systematically compare BPE, SentencePiece, and
Character Level tokenization strategies using IndicBERT for NER tasks in low
resource Indic languages like Assamese, Bengali, Marathi, and Odia, as well as
extremely low resource Indic languages like Santali, Manipuri, and Sindhi. We
assess both intrinsic linguistic properties tokenization efficiency, out of
vocabulary (OOV) rates, and morphological preservation as well as extrinsic
downstream performance, including fine tuning and zero shot cross lingual
transfer.
  Our experiments show that SentencePiece is a consistently better performing
approach than BPE for NER in low resource Indic Languages, particularly in zero
shot cross lingual settings, as it better preserves entity consistency. While
BPE provides the most compact tokenization form, it is not capable of
generalization because it misclassifies or even fails to recognize entity
labels when tested on unseen languages. In contrast, SentencePiece constitutes
a better linguistic structural preservation model, benefiting extremely low
resource and morphologically rich Indic languages, such as Santali and
Manipuri, for superior entity recognition, as well as high generalization
across scripts, such as Sindhi, written in Arabic. The results point to
SentencePiece as the more effective tokenization strategy for NER within
multilingual and low resource Indic NLP applications.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为SAVA的新方法，通过词汇适应优化英语LLMs以支持意大利语，显著降低了token fertility和参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs主要针对英语设计，对其他语言支持不足，导致效率低下。

Method: 采用语义对齐词汇适应（SAVA）技术，通过神经映射进行词汇替换。

Result: SAVA在多个下游任务中表现优异，显著降低了token fertility和参数数量。

Conclusion: 词汇适应后，模型通过少量目标语言训练即可恢复性能，适用于多任务场景。

Abstract: The number of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasing steadily,
though the majority are designed predominantly for the English language. While
state-of-the-art LLMs can handle other languages, due to language contamination
or some degree of multilingual pretraining data, they are not optimized for
non-English languages, leading to inefficient encoding (high token "fertility")
and slower inference speed. In this work, we thoroughly compare a variety of
vocabulary adaptation techniques for optimizing English LLMs for the Italian
language, and put forward Semantic Alignment Vocabulary Adaptation (SAVA), a
novel method that leverages neural mapping for vocabulary substitution. SAVA
achieves competitive performance across multiple downstream tasks, enhancing
grounded alignment strategies. We adapt two LLMs: Mistral-7b-v0.1, reducing
token fertility by 25\%, and Llama-3.1-8B, optimizing the vocabulary and
reducing the number of parameters by 1 billion. We show that, following the
adaptation of the vocabulary, these models can recover their performance with a
relatively limited stage of continual training on the target language. Finally,
we test the capabilities of the adapted models on various multi-choice and
generative tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: 论文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLMs）政治信仰深度的新框架，通过分析论证一致性和不确定性量化，发现LLMs的信仰稳定性是主题特定的，而非统一的意识形态立场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究LLMs的政治回应是否反映真实内部信仰，还是仅与训练数据表面一致。

Method: 方法包括评估12个LLMs在19项经济政策上的表现，通过支持和反对论点挑战其信仰稳定性。

Result: 结果显示，左倾和右倾模型的回应分别有95%和89%在挑战下保持一致，语义熵能有效区分表面一致与真实信仰（AUROC=0.78）。

Conclusion: 结论质疑LLMs具有稳定、类人政治意识形态的假设，强调在实际应用中需进行主题特定的可靠性评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping political discourse,
yet their responses often display inconsistency when subjected to scrutiny.
While prior research has primarily categorized LLM outputs as left- or
right-leaning to assess their political stances, a critical question remains:
Do these responses reflect genuine internal beliefs or merely surface-level
alignment with training data? To address this, we propose a novel framework for
evaluating belief depth by analyzing (1) argumentative consistency and (2)
uncertainty quantification. We evaluate 12 LLMs on 19 economic policies from
the Political Compass Test, challenging their belief stability with both
supportive and opposing arguments. Our analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit
topic-specific belief stability rather than a uniform ideological stance.
Notably, up to 95% of left-leaning models' responses and 89% of right-leaning
models' responses remain consistent under the challenge, enabling semantic
entropy to achieve high accuracy (AUROC=0.78), effectively distinguishing
between surface-level alignment from genuine belief. These findings call into
question the assumption that LLMs maintain stable, human-like political
ideologies, emphasizing the importance of conducting topic-specific reliability
assessments for real-world applications.

Motivation: 探讨现有LLM性别错误评估方法是否具有收敛效度，即不同方法的结果是否一致。

Method: 对三种现有数据集进行系统元评估，提出一种方法将数据集转换为支持概率和生成评估，并自动评估6个模型。

Result: 发现不同方法在实例、数据集和模型层面存在20.2%的不一致，且自动评估无法捕捉人类评估的复杂性。

Conclusion: 建议改进LLM性别错误评估方法，并质疑LLM评估中广泛假设不同方法一致的惯例。

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to measure LLM misgendering, including
probability-based evaluations (e.g., automatically with templatic sentences)
and generation-based evaluations (e.g., with automatic heuristics or human
validation). However, it has gone unexamined whether these evaluation methods
have convergent validity, that is, whether their results align. Therefore, we
conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of these methods across three existing
datasets for LLM misgendering. We propose a method to transform each dataset to
enable parallel probability- and generation-based evaluation. Then, by
automatically evaluating a suite of 6 models from 3 families, we find that
these methods can disagree with each other at the instance, dataset, and model
levels, conflicting on 20.2% of evaluation instances. Finally, with a human
evaluation of 2400 LLM generations, we show that misgendering behaviour is
complex and goes far beyond pronouns, which automatic evaluations are not
currently designed to capture, suggesting essential disagreement with human
evaluations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future
evaluations of LLM misgendering. Our results are also more widely relevant, as
they call into question broader methodological conventions in LLM evaluation,
which often assume that different evaluation methods agree.

Motivation: 探讨LLM交互中语言风格对用户偏好的影响及其潜在风险。

Method: 通过探索性和实验性用户研究，分析语言风格与用户偏好的关系。

Result: 语言风格确实影响用户偏好，但具体效果因用户群体和个体特质不同而有所差异。

Conclusion: 初步研究表明语言风格的重要性，但需更大样本和更广泛人口多样性验证。未来将深入分析语言风格、个体特质与偏好的联合效应及因果关系。

Abstract: What makes an interaction with the LLM more preferable for the user? While it
is intuitive to assume that information accuracy in the LLM's responses would
be one of the influential variables, recent studies have found that inaccurate
LLM's responses could still be preferable when they are perceived to be more
authoritative, certain, well-articulated, or simply verbose. These variables
interestingly fall under the broader category of language style, implying that
the style in the LLM's responses might meaningfully influence users'
preferences. This hypothesized dynamic could have double-edged consequences:
enhancing the overall user experience while simultaneously increasing their
susceptibility to risks such as LLM's misinformation or hallucinations. In this
short paper, we present our preliminary studies in exploring this subject.
Through a series of exploratory and experimental user studies, we found that
LLM's language style does indeed influence user's preferences, but how and
which language styles influence the preference varied across different user
populations, and more interestingly, moderated by the user's very own
individual traits. As a preliminary work, the findings in our studies should be
interpreted with caution, particularly given the limitations in our samples,
which still need wider demographic diversity and larger sample sizes. Our
future directions will first aim to address these limitations, which would
enable a more comprehensive joint effect analysis between the language style,
individual traits, and preferences, and further investigate the potential
causal relationship between and beyond these variables.

Abstract: Due to the proliferation of short-form content and the rapid adoption of AI,
opportunities for deep, reflective thinking have significantly diminished,
undermining users' critical thinking and reducing engagement with the reasoning
behind AI-generated outputs. To address this issue, we propose an Interactive
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Framework that enhances human-centered explainability
and responsible AI usage by making the model's inference process transparent,
modular, and user-editable. The framework decomposes reasoning into clearly
defined blocks that users can inspect, modify, and re-execute, encouraging
active cognitive engagement rather than passive consumption. It further
integrates a lightweight edit-adaptation mechanism inspired by preference
learning, allowing the system to align with diverse cognitive styles and user
intentions. Ethical transparency is ensured through explicit metadata
disclosure, built-in bias checkpoint functionality, and privacy-preserving
safeguards. This work outlines the design principles and architecture necessary
to promote critical engagement, responsible interaction, and inclusive
adaptation in AI systems aimed at addressing complex societal challenges.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained prominence as an effective
method for enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) through the incorporation of external knowledge. However, the evaluation
of RAG systems remains a challenge, due to the intricate interplay between

this work, we present MIRAGE, a Question Answering dataset specifically
designed for RAG evaluation. MIRAGE consists of 7,560 curated instances mapped
to a retrieval pool of 37,800 entries, enabling an efficient and precise
evaluation of both retrieval and generation tasks. We also introduce novel
evaluation metrics aimed at measuring RAG adaptability, encompassing dimensions
such as noise vulnerability, context acceptability, context insensitivity, and
context misinterpretation. Through comprehensive experiments across various
retriever-LLM configurations, we provide new insights into the optimal
alignment of model pairs and the nuanced dynamics within RAG systems. The

Motivation: 机器学习研究增长迅速，但代码实现常不可用，导致复现和扩展工作耗时费力。

Method: PaperCoder分三阶段：规划（设计架构、文件依赖）、分析（解读实现细节）、生成（模块化代码），每阶段由专门代理协作完成。

Conclusion: PaperCoder能有效生成高质量代码，为机器学习研究提供实用工具。

Abstract: Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code
implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for
researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime,
recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents
and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a
multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into
functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning,
where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with
diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files;
analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and
generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each
phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to
collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on
generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both
model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper
authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality,
faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the
recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by
substantial margins.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLM在提供特定领域（如自然灾害）的上下文信息时表现不佳，需要一种更专业化的解决方案。

Method: 采用RAG框架，整合自然灾害数据、观测数据和科学文献，构建多智能体系统WildfireGPT。

Result: 在十项专家主导的案例研究中，WildfireGPT显著优于现有LLM解决方案。

Conclusion: WildfireGPT通过RAG和多智能体设计，实现了高准确性和上下文相关性，为决策支持提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a transformational capability at the
frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning that can support
decision-makers in addressing pressing societal challenges such as extreme
natural hazard events. As generalized models, LLMs often struggle to provide
context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized
knowledge. In this work we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based
multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in the context
of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of concept, we
present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire hazards. The
architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored
risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating natural hazard
and extreme weather projection data, observational datasets, and scientific
literature through an RAG framework, the system ensures both the accuracy and
contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten
expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms
existing LLM-based solutions for decision support.

TLDR: 研究探讨了知识蒸馏（KD）在LLM捆绑生成中的应用，旨在减少计算成本并保持性能，提出了一个综合框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模LLM在捆绑生成中效率低，计算成本高，知识蒸馏提供了一种解决方案。

Method: 提出一个综合KD框架，逐步提取知识，探索知识数量和使用方式的影响。

Result: 实验表明知识格式、数量和使用方法共同影响性能，KD在高效捆绑生成中潜力显著。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏能显著提升LLM捆绑生成的效率与效果。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly explored for bundle generation, thanks to their
reasoning capabilities and knowledge. However, deploying large-scale LLMs
introduces significant efficiency challenges, primarily high computational
costs during fine-tuning and inference due to their massive parameterization.
Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, transferring expertise
from large teacher models to compact student models. This study systematically
investigates knowledge distillation approaches for bundle generation, aiming to
minimize computational demands while preserving performance. We explore three
critical research questions: (1) how does the format of KD impact bundle
generation performance? (2) to what extent does the quantity of distilled
knowledge influence performance? and (3) how do different ways of utilizing the
distilled knowledge affect performance? We propose a comprehensive KD framework
that (i) progressively extracts knowledge (patterns, rules, deep thoughts);
(ii) captures varying quantities of distilled knowledge through different
strategies; and (iii) exploits complementary LLM adaptation techniques
(in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, combination) to leverage
distilled knowledge in small student models for domain-specific adaptation and
enhanced efficiency. Extensive experiments provide valuable insights into how
knowledge format, quantity, and utilization methodologies collectively shape
LLM-based bundle generation performance, exhibiting KD's significant potential
for more efficient yet effective LLM-based bundle generation.

Motivation: 临床医生短缺和心理治疗污名化促使开发人机交互心理治疗工具，但现有方法未能有效实现CR。

Method: 提出CRDial框架，设计多轮对话阶段，整合支持性对话策略，采用多通道循环机制，并基于LLM生成数据集Crisp，训练对话模型Crispers。

Result: Crispers在点对点、成对和干预评估中表现优越。

Conclusion: CRDial和Crispers为认知重构提供了高效的人机交互解决方案。

Abstract: Cognitive Restructuring (CR) is a psychotherapeutic process aimed at
identifying and restructuring an individual's negative thoughts, arising from
mental health challenges, into more helpful and positive ones via multi-turn
dialogues. Clinician shortage and stigma urge the development of human-LLM
interactive psychotherapy for CR. Yet, existing efforts implement CR via simple
text rewriting, fixed-pattern dialogues, or a one-shot CR workflow, failing to
align with the psychotherapeutic process for effective CR. To address this gap,
we propose CRDial, a novel framework for CR, which creates multi-turn dialogues
with specifically designed identification and restructuring stages of negative
thoughts, integrates sentence-level supportive conversation strategies, and
adopts a multi-channel loop mechanism to enable iterative CR. With CRDial, we
distill Crisp, a large-scale and high-quality bilingual dialogue dataset, from
LLM. We then train Crispers, Crisp-based conversational LLMs for CR, at 7B and
14B scales. Extensive human studies show the superiority of Crispers in
pointwise, pairwise, and intervention evaluations.

Recurrent Units (GRU), enhanced with attention mechanisms to improve
translation accuracy. To further enhance performance, we apply transfer
learning using MarianNMT pre-trained models within the SimpleTransformers

existing English-Igbo benchmarks. With transfer learning, we observe a
performance gain of +4.83 BLEU points, reaching an estimated translation
accuracy of 70%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining RNNs
with transfer learning to address the performance gap in low-resource language
translation tasks.

Result: JurisCTC在准确率上显著优于其他模型和大语言模型，分别达到76.59%和78.83%的峰值。

Conclusion: JurisCTC为法律判决预测任务提供了一种有效的跨领域知识迁移方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has gained significant
attention in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) owing to its
ability to enhance model generalization across diverse domains. However, its
application for knowledge transfer between distinct legal domains remains
largely unexplored. To address the challenges posed by lengthy and complex
legal texts and the limited availability of large-scale annotated datasets, we
propose JurisCTC, a novel model designed to improve the accuracy of Legal
Judgment Prediction (LJP) tasks. Unlike existing approaches, JurisCTC
facilitates effective knowledge transfer across various legal domains and
employs contrastive learning to distinguish samples from different domains.
Specifically, for the LJP task, we enable knowledge transfer between civil and
criminal law domains. Compared to other models and specific large language
models (LLMs), JurisCTC demonstrates notable advancements, achieving peak
accuracies of 76.59% and 78.83%, respectively.

Method: 提出了一种选择性优化算法，综合考虑词级准确性和病理准确性，确保过程可微分以有效训练模型。

Result: 算法将不同群体间的性能差异减少了30%以上，同时文本生成准确性的变化通常控制在2%以内。

Conclusion: 该算法有效减少了文本生成中的偏见，提升了医疗诊断的公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those based on deep
learning models, have increasingly achieved expert-level performance in medical
applications. However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may
reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in
historically under-served populations. The fairness issue has attracted
considerable research interest in the medical imaging classification field, yet
it remains understudied in the text generation domain. In this study, we
investigate the fairness problem in text generation within the medical field
and observe significant performance discrepancies across different races,
sexes, and age groups, including intersectional groups, various model scales,
and different evaluation metrics. To mitigate this fairness issue, we propose
an algorithm that selectively optimizes those underperformed groups to reduce
bias. The selection rules take into account not only word-level accuracy but
also the pathology accuracy to the target reference, while ensuring that the
entire process remains fully differentiable for effective model training. Our
evaluations across multiple backbones, datasets, and modalities demonstrate
that our proposed algorithm enhances fairness in text generation without
compromising overall performance. Specifically, the disparities among various
groups across different metrics were diminished by more than 30% with our
algorithm, while the relative change in text generation accuracy was typically
within 2%. By reducing the bias generated by deep learning models, our proposed
approach can potentially alleviate concerns about the fairness and reliability
of text generation diagnosis in medical domain.

TLDR: CoheMark是一种基于句子间连贯关系的高级水印技术，通过模糊c均值聚类和特定句子选择标准，平衡文本质量与水印检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有句子级水印技术依赖随机分割或生成过程，可能限制合适句子的可用性，影响生成内容质量。

Method: 采用模糊c均值聚类选择句子，并应用特定下一句选择标准。

Result: 实验表明，CoheMark在保持高文本质量的同时实现了强水印强度。

Conclusion: CoheMark有效解决了文本质量与水印检测之间的平衡问题。

Abstract: Watermarking technology is a method used to trace the usage of content
generated by large language models. Sentence-level watermarking aids in
preserving the semantic integrity within individual sentences while maintaining
greater robustness. However, many existing sentence-level watermarking
techniques depend on arbitrary segmentation or generation processes to embed
watermarks, which can limit the availability of appropriate sentences. This
limitation, in turn, compromises the quality of the generated response. To
address the challenge of balancing high text quality with robust watermark
detection, we propose CoheMark, an advanced sentence-level watermarking
technique that exploits the cohesive relationships between sentences for better
logical fluency. The core methodology of CoheMark involves selecting sentences
through trained fuzzy c-means clustering and applying specific next sentence
selection criteria. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CoheMark achieves
strong watermark strength while exerting minimal impact on text quality.

Method: FLUKE利用大语言模型（LLMs）和人工验证生成语言层面的控制变化，评估微调模型和LLMs在四个NLP任务中的表现。

Result: 发现语言变化的影响高度依赖任务，LLMs整体鲁棒性较好但仍对某些变化敏感，所有模型对否定修改普遍脆弱。

Conclusion: 系统化的鲁棒性测试对理解模型行为至关重要。

Abstract: We present FLUKE (Framework for LingUistically-driven and tasK-agnostic
robustness Evaluation), a task-agnostic framework for assessing model
robustness through systematic minimal variations of test data. FLUKE introduces
controlled variations across linguistic levels - from orthography to dialect
and style varieties - and leverages large language models (LLMs) with human
validation to generate modifications. We demonstrate FLUKE's utility by
evaluating both fine-tuned models and LLMs across four diverse NLP tasks, and
reveal that (1) the impact of linguistic variations is highly task-dependent,
with some tests being critical for certain tasks but irrelevant for others; (2)
while LLMs have better overall robustness compared to fine-tuned models, they
still exhibit significant brittleness to certain linguistic variations; (3) all
models show substantial vulnerability to negation modifications across most
tasks. These findings highlight the importance of systematic robustness testing
for understanding model behaviors.

Result: 实验表明DAE在基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAE为多模态虚假信息检测提供了新范式。

Abstract: In the digital era, social media has become a major conduit for information
dissemination, yet it also facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation.
Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level
features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation
process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework
(DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze
misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining
creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating
readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language
Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to
misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware
filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms
existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation
detection.

Result: 实验验证MRE在多模态任务中的有效性，实现三个相关任务的互增强。

Conclusion: MRE在多模态领域具有普适性，为跨任务互增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mutual Reinforcement Effect (MRE) is an emerging subfield at the intersection
of information extraction and model interpretability. MRE aims to leverage the
mutual understanding between tasks of different granularities, enhancing the
performance of both coarse-grained and fine-grained tasks through joint
modeling. While MRE has been explored and validated in the textual domain, its
applicability to visual and multimodal domains remains unexplored. In this
work, we extend MRE to the multimodal information extraction domain for the
first time. Specifically, we introduce a new task: Multimodal Mutual
Reinforcement Effect (M-MRE), and construct a corresponding dataset to support
this task. To address the challenges posed by M-MRE, we further propose a
Prompt Format Adapter (PFA) that is fully compatible with various Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that MRE can
also be observed in the M-MRE task, a multimodal text-image understanding
scenario. This provides strong evidence that MRE facilitates mutual gains
across three interrelated tasks, confirming its generalizability beyond the
textual domain.

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上AUROC提升7%，且比微调模型更少数据泄露风险。

Conclusion: PatientDx在保持性能的同时有效保护数据隐私，适用于医疗领域。

Abstract: Fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become the default practice
for improving model performance on a given task. However, performance
improvement comes at the cost of training on vast amounts of annotated data
which could be sensitive leading to significant data privacy concerns. In
particular, the healthcare domain is one of the most sensitive domains exposed
to data privacy issues. In this paper, we present PatientDx, a framework of
model merging that allows the design of effective LLMs for health-predictive
tasks without requiring fine-tuning nor adaptation on patient data. Our
proposal is based on recently proposed techniques known as merging of LLMs and
aims to optimize a building block merging strategy. PatientDx uses a pivotal
model adapted to numerical reasoning and tunes hyperparameters on examples
based on a performance metric but without training of the LLM on these data.
Experiments using the mortality tasks of the MIMIC-IV dataset show improvements
up to 7% in terms of AUROC when compared to initial models. Additionally, we
confirm that when compared to fine-tuned models, our proposal is less prone to
data leak problems without hurting performance. Finally, we qualitatively show
the capabilities of our proposal through a case study. Our best model is

Abstract: Long-context understanding poses significant challenges in natural language
processing, particularly for real-world dialogues characterized by speech-based
elements, high redundancy, and uneven information density. Although large
language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on existing benchmarks, these
datasets fail to reflect the complexities of such texts, limiting their
applicability to practical scenarios. To bridge this gap, we construct the
first spoken long-text dataset, derived from live streams, designed to reflect
the redundancy-rich and conversational nature of real-world scenarios. We
construct tasks in three categories: retrieval-dependent, reasoning-dependent,
and hybrid. We then evaluate both popular LLMs and specialized methods to
assess their ability to understand long-contexts in these tasks. Our results
show that current methods exhibit strong task-specific preferences and perform
poorly on highly redundant inputs, with no single method consistently
outperforming others. We propose a new baseline that better handles redundancy
in spoken text and achieves strong performance across tasks. Our findings
highlight key limitations of current methods and suggest future directions for
improving long-context understanding. Finally, our benchmark fills a gap in
evaluating long-context spoken language understanding and provides a practical
foundation for developing real-world e-commerce systems. The code and benchmark

Conclusion: PicPersona-TOD和Pictor模型有效解决了对话系统个性化不足的问题，增强了交互体验。

Abstract: Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems are designed to fulfill user requests

generic, monotonic responses that lack individuality and fail to adapt to
users' personal attributes. To address this, we introduce PicPersona-TOD, a
novel dataset that incorporates user images as part of the persona, enabling
personalized responses tailored to user-specific factors such as age or
emotional context. This is facilitated by first impressions, dialogue
policy-guided prompting, and the use of external knowledge to reduce
hallucinations. Human evaluations confirm that our dataset enhances user
experience, with personalized responses contributing to a more engaging
interaction. Additionally, we introduce a new NLG model, Pictor, which not only
personalizes responses, but also demonstrates robust performance across unseen
domains https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PicPersona.

Conclusion: LLM生成的文本增强技术显著提升了主题模型在社会科学研究中的实用性和可解释性。

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as topic modeling and
clustering, are often used to identify latent patterns in unstructured text
data in fields such as political science and sociology. These methods overcome
common concerns about reproducibility and costliness involved in the
labor-intensive process of human qualitative analysis. However, two major
limitations of topic models are their interpretability and their practicality
for answering targeted, domain-specific social science research questions. In
this work, we investigate opportunities for using LLM-generated text
augmentation to improve the usefulness of topic modeling output. We use a
political science case study to evaluate our results in a domain-specific
application, and find that topic modeling using GPT-4 augmentations creates
highly interpretable categories that can be used to investigate domain-specific
research questions with minimal human guidance.

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a critical technique for combating misinformation
and protecting intellectual property in large language models (LLMs). A recent
discovery, termed watermark radioactivity, reveals that watermarks embedded in
teacher models can be inherited by student models through knowledge
distillation. On the positive side, this inheritance allows for the detection
of unauthorized knowledge distillation by identifying watermark traces in
student models. However, the robustness of watermarks against scrubbing attacks
and their unforgeability in the face of spoofing attacks under unauthorized
knowledge distillation remain largely unexplored. Existing watermark attack
methods either assume access to model internals or fail to simultaneously
support both scrubbing and spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose
Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), a unified
framework that enables bidirectional attacks under unauthorized knowledge
distillation. Our approach employs contrastive decoding to extract corrupted or
amplified watermark texts via comparing outputs from the student model and
weakly watermarked references, followed by bidirectional distillation to train
new student models capable of watermark removal and watermark forgery,
respectively. Extensive experiments show that CDG-KD effectively performs
attacks while preserving the general performance of the distilled model. Our
findings underscore critical need for developing watermarking schemes that are
robust and unforgeable.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate responses that deviate from user
input or training data, a phenomenon known as "hallucination." These
hallucinations undermine user trust and hinder the adoption of generative AI
systems. Addressing hallucinations is essential for the advancement of LLMs.
This paper introduces a comprehensive hallucination benchmark, incorporating
both new extrinsic and existing intrinsic evaluation tasks, built upon clear
taxonomy of hallucination. A major challenge in benchmarking hallucinations is
the lack of a unified framework due to inconsistent definitions and
categorizations. We disentangle LLM hallucination from "factuality," proposing
a clear taxonomy that distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations, to promote consistency and facilitate research. Extrinsic
hallucinations, where the generated content is not consistent with the training
data, are increasingly important as LLMs evolve. Our benchmark includes dynamic
test set generation to mitigate data leakage and ensure robustness against such
leakage. We also analyze existing benchmarks, highlighting their limitations
and saturation. The work aims to: (1) establish a clear taxonomy of
hallucinations, (2) introduce new extrinsic hallucination tasks, with data that
can be dynamically regenerated to prevent saturation by leakage, (3) provide a
comprehensive analysis of existing benchmarks, distinguishing them from
factuality evaluations.

TLDR: 研究探讨了在预训练数据前添加元数据对语言模型性能的影响，发现其效果取决于下游任务提示是否能推断潜在语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解预训练时添加元数据对模型性能的影响，尤其是在下游任务中表现不一致的现象。

Method: 通过人工生成的数据（如概率上下文无关文法）分析模型行为，考察元数据在不同上下文长度下的作用。

Result: 元数据在上下文足够长时能提升性能，但在信息不足时会负面影响模型表现。

Conclusion: 元数据的有效性依赖于下游任务提示能否推断潜在语义，需根据任务特性谨慎使用。

Abstract: The ability to acquire latent semantics is one of the key properties that
determines the performance of language models. One convenient approach to
invoke this ability is to prepend metadata (e.g. URLs, domains, and styles) at
the beginning of texts in the pre-training data, making it easier for the model
to access latent semantics before observing the entire text. Previous studies
have reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained
models in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in
specific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token
prediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how
prepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining
its behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach
produces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We
demonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent
semantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically,
through investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free
grammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance
when the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics. In
contrast, the technique negatively impacts performance when the context lacks
the necessary information to make an accurate posterior inference.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
performance on various complex reasoning benchmarks, the academic community
still lacks an in-depth understanding of base model training processes and data
quality. To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded
reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of
varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by
multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of
Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance
reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating
that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning
rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we
significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a
pass rate of 79.2\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark. This
result surpasses most current distilled models and closely approaches
state-of-the-art performance. We provide detailed descriptions of our data
processing, difficulty assessment, and training methodology, and have publicly
released all datasets and methods to promote rapid progress in open-source
long-reasoning LLMs. The dataset is available at:

Abstract: The proliferation of abusive language in online communications has posed
significant risks to the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities.
The growing concern regarding online abuse and its consequences necessitates
methods for identifying and mitigating harmful content and facilitating
continuous monitoring, moderation, and early intervention. This paper presents
a taxonomy for distinguishing key characteristics of abusive language within
online text. Our approach uses a systematic method for taxonomy development,
integrating classification systems of 18 existing multi-label datasets to
capture key characteristics relevant to online abusive language classification.
The resulting taxonomy is hierarchical and faceted, comprising 5 categories and
17 dimensions. It classifies various facets of online abuse, including context,
target, intensity, directness, and theme of abuse. This shared understanding
can lead to more cohesive efforts, facilitate knowledge exchange, and
accelerate progress in the field of online abuse detection and mitigation among
researchers, policy makers, online platform owners, and other stakeholders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对代码辅助LLM的评估主要关注执行正确性，缺乏对其生成程序的严格评估，因此需要更深入的分析以理解其数学推理能力。

Method: 对五种不同LLM在两个数学数据集上的生成程序进行手动和自动评估，重点关注程序对数学规则的遵循程度及其对性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现，数学规则的遵循程度取决于LLM的能力和问题难度；闭源模型表现更好，而开源模型在正确应用数学规则上表现较差。

Conclusion: 论文强调需要超越执行准确性的深入评估，以更好地理解代码辅助LLM在数学领域的潜力和局限性。

Abstract: Assisting LLMs with code generation improved their performance on
mathematical reasoning tasks. However, the evaluation of code-assisted LLMs is
generally restricted to execution correctness, lacking a rigorous evaluation of
their generated programs. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting an
in-depth analysis of code-assisted LLMs' generated programs in response to math
reasoning tasks. Our evaluation focuses on the extent to which LLMs ground
their programs to math rules, and how that affects their end performance. For
this purpose, we assess the generations of five different LLMs, on two
different math datasets, both manually and automatically. Our results reveal
that the distribution of grounding depends on LLMs' capabilities and the
difficulty of math problems. Furthermore, mathematical grounding is more
effective for closed-source models, while open-source models fail to employ
math rules in their solutions correctly. On MATH500, the percentage of grounded
programs decreased to half, while the ungrounded generations doubled in
comparison to ASDiv grade-school problems. Our work highlights the need for
in-depth evaluation beyond execution accuracy metrics, toward a better
understanding of code-assisted LLMs' capabilities and limits in the math
domain.

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了SCP的理论保证，并在不同校准-测试分割比例下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态AI系统提供了可扩展的幻觉检测和不确定性感知决策方案。

Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in
multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with
high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a
model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic
threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning
data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity
scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under
user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous
control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain
strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes
inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of
prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on
benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces
theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves
stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios,
underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous
systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between
theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems,
offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware
decision-making.

Conclusion: 研究为可持续LLM部署提供了基础，并为未来AI基础设施的节能设计提供了策略。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale in size and adoption, their
computational and environmental costs continue to rise. Prior benchmarking
efforts have primarily focused on latency reduction in idealized settings,
often overlooking the diverse real-world inference workloads that shape energy
use. In this work, we systematically analyze the energy implications of common
inference efficiency optimizations across diverse Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, including
conversational AI and code generation. We introduce a modeling approach that
approximates real-world LLM workflows through a binning strategy for
input-output token distributions and batch size variations. Our empirical
analysis spans software frameworks, decoding strategies, GPU architectures,
online and offline serving settings, and model parallelism configurations. We
show that the effectiveness of inference optimizations is highly sensitive to
workload geometry, software stack, and hardware accelerators, demonstrating
that naive energy estimates based on FLOPs or theoretical GPU utilization
significantly underestimate real-world energy consumption. Our findings reveal
that the proper application of relevant inference efficiency optimizations can
reduce total energy use by up to 73% from unoptimized baselines. These insights
provide a foundation for sustainable LLM deployment and inform energy-efficient
design strategies for future AI infrastructure.

Conclusion: EBI为资源有限的高性能AI系统提供了新思路，并展示了低性能模型的有效利用潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the potential of small language model(SLM) ensembles to
achieve accuracy comparable to proprietary large language models (LLMs). We
propose Ensemble Bayesian Inference (EBI), a novel approach that applies
Bayesian estimation to combine judgments from multiple SLMs, allowing them to
exceed the performance limitations of individual models. Our experiments on
diverse tasks(aptitude assessments and consumer profile analysis in both
Japanese and English) demonstrate EBI's effectiveness. Notably, we analyze
cases where incorporating models with negative Lift values into ensembles
improves overall performance, and we examine the method's efficacy across
different languages. These findings suggest new possibilities for constructing
high-performance AI systems with limited computational resources and for
effectively utilizing models with individually lower performance. Building on
existing research on LLM performance evaluation, ensemble methods, and
open-source LLM utilization, we discuss the novelty and significance of our
approach.

Result: 模型表现与训练数据中的语言资源量相关，低资源语言表现较差，且与英语相比有明显下降。

Conclusion: 建议在部署前验证LLMs在目标语言中的表现，以确保教育任务的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in educational
settings. These applications expand beyond English, though current LLMs remain
primarily English-centric. In this work, we ascertain if their use in education
settings in non-English languages is warranted. We evaluated the performance of
popular LLMs on four educational tasks: identifying student misconceptions,
providing targeted feedback, interactive tutoring, and grading translations in
six languages (Hindi, Arabic, Farsi, Telugu, Ukrainian, Czech) in addition to
English. We find that the performance on these tasks somewhat corresponds to
the amount of language represented in training data, with lower-resource
languages having poorer task performance. Although the models perform
reasonably well in most languages, the frequent performance drop from English
is significant. Thus, we recommend that practitioners first verify that the LLM
works well in the target language for their educational task before deployment.

version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture,
and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is
more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on
ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors
and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no

Result: 1) 极长序列下，大而稀疏的模型优于小而密集的模型；2) 解码阶段的稀疏度上限高于预填充阶段，且与模型规模相关；3) 稀疏注意力并非通用解决方案，需根据任务和阶段调整策略；4) 提出了针对稀疏注意力的新缩放规律。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力是增强Transformer LLM长序列处理能力的重要工具，但需权衡性能，适用于特定场景。

Abstract: Sparse attention offers a promising strategy to extend long-context
capabilities in Transformer LLMs, yet its viability, its efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs, and systematic scaling studies remain unexplored. To address this
gap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods
at varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse
collection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural
language while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our
experiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis
reveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are
preferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while
statistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than
prefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear
strategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of
sparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even
moderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on
at least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal
solution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored
for sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold
true beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate
that sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer
LLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of
trade-offs for performance-sensitive applications.

Abstract: The United States Department of Defense (DOD) looks to accelerate the
development and deployment of AI capabilities across a wide spectrum of defense
applications to maintain strategic advantages. However, many common features of
AI algorithms that make them powerful, such as capacity for learning,
large-scale data ingestion, and problem-solving, raise new technical, security,
and ethical challenges. These challenges may hinder adoption due to uncertainty
in development, testing, assurance, processes, and requirements.
Trustworthiness through assurance is essential to achieve the expected value
from AI.
  This paper proposes a claims-based framework for risk management and
assurance of AI systems that addresses the competing needs for faster
deployment, successful adoption, and rigorous evaluation. This framework
supports programs across all acquisition pathways provide grounds for
sufficient confidence that an AI-enabled system (AIES) meets its intended
mission goals without introducing unacceptable risks throughout its lifecycle.
The paper's contributions are a framework process for AI assurance, a set of
relevant definitions to enable constructive conversations on the topic of AI
assurance, and a discussion of important considerations in AI assurance. The
framework aims to provide the DOD a robust yet efficient mechanism for swiftly
fielding effective AI capabilities without overlooking critical risks or
undermining stakeholder trust.

TLDR: 论文将KLM框架引入FCA，提出一种可废止推理方法，解决了传统FCA中依赖关系对异常数据不适用的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FCA中的依赖关系无法处理异常数据，缺乏非单调推理的研究，因此需要引入KLM框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过构建偏好序对可能世界进行建模，将KLM框架应用于FCA，并保持非单调推理的原则。

Result: 提出的方法在FCA中实现了非单调推理，且比命题逻辑更具上下文相关性。

Conclusion: KLM框架在FCA中的应用不仅忠实于非单调推理原则，还提供了更具上下文相关性的推理能力。

Abstract: Defeasible conditionals are a form of non-monotonic inference which enable
the expression of statements like "if $\phi$ then normally $\psi$". The KLM
framework defines a semantics for the propositional case of defeasible
conditionals by construction of a preference ordering over possible worlds. The
pattern of reasoning induced by these semantics is characterised by consequence
relations satisfying certain desirable properties of non-monotonic reasoning.
In FCA, implications are used to describe dependencies between attributes.
However, these implications are unsuitable to reason with erroneous data or
data prone to exceptions. Until recently, the topic of non-monotonic inference
in FCA has remained largely uninvestigated. In this paper, we provide a
construction of the KLM framework for defeasible reasoning in FCA and show that
this construction remains faithful to the principle of non-monotonic inference
described in the original framework. We present an additional argument that,
while remaining consistent with the original ideas around non-monotonic
reasoning, the defeasible reasoning we propose in FCA offers a more contextual
view on inference, providing the ability for more relevant conclusions to be
drawn when compared to the propositional case.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled conversational
AI from traditional dialogue systems into sophisticated agents capable of
autonomous actions, contextual awareness, and multi-turn interactions with
users. Yet, fundamental questions about their capabilities, limitations, and
paths forward remain open. This survey paper presents a desideratum for
next-generation Conversational Agents - what has been achieved, what challenges
persist, and what must be done for more scalable systems that approach
human-level intelligence. To that end, we systematically analyze LLM-driven
Conversational Agents by organizing their capabilities into three primary
dimensions: (i) Reasoning - logical, systematic thinking inspired by human
intelligence for decision making, (ii) Monitor - encompassing self-awareness
and user interaction monitoring, and (iii) Control - focusing on tool
utilization and policy following. Building upon this, we introduce a novel
taxonomy by classifying recent work on Conversational Agents around our
proposed desideratum. We identify critical research gaps and outline key
directions, including realistic evaluations, long-term multi-turn reasoning
skills, self-evolution capabilities, collaborative and multi-agent task
completion, personalization, and proactivity. This work aims to provide a
structured foundation, highlight existing limitations, and offer insights into
potential future research directions for Conversational Agents, ultimately

TLDR: 本文提出了一种新型的多层分层HITL DRL算法，结合了三种学习方式（自主学习、模仿学习和迁移学习）和三种人类输入形式（奖励、动作和演示），并探讨了HITL在解决复杂问题中的挑战与优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度强化学习（DRL）的普及，人机交互（HITL）方法有望革新决策问题解决方式，并为人类与AI协作创造新机会。

Method: 提出了一种多层分层的HITL DRL算法，结合了自主学习、模仿学习和迁移学习，并考虑了奖励、动作和演示三种人类输入形式。

Result: 在无人机对抗场景中验证了算法的有效性，结果表明HITL能加速训练并提升性能，人类建议能降低梯度方法的方差，且建议量需适中以避免过训练或欠训练。

Conclusion: HITL DRL算法在复杂场景（如过载和诱饵攻击）中展现了人类与AI协作的重要性，为实际应用提供了系统化的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep reinforcement learning (DRL),
human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we
approach decision-making problems and create new opportunities for human-AI
collaboration. In this article, we introduce a novel multi-layered hierarchical
HITL DRL algorithm that comprises three types of learning: self learning,
imitation learning and transfer learning. In addition, we consider three forms
of human inputs: reward, action and demonstration. Furthermore, we discuss main
challenges, trade-offs and advantages of HITL in solving complex problems and
how human information can be integrated in the AI solution systematically. To
verify our technical results, we present a real-world unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAV) problem wherein a number of enemy drones attack a restricted area. The
objective is to design a scalable HITL DRL algorithm for ally drones to
neutralize the enemy drones before they reach the area. To this end, we first
implement our solution using an award-winning open-source HITL software called
Cogment. We then demonstrate several interesting results such as (a) HITL leads
to faster training and higher performance, (b) advice acts as a guiding
direction for gradient methods and lowers variance, and (c) the amount of
advice should neither be too large nor too small to avoid over-training and
under-training. Finally, we illustrate the role of human-AI cooperation in
solving two real-world complex scenarios, i.e., overloaded and decoy attacks.

*Balaji Rao,William Eiers,Carlo Lipizzi*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文提出了一种生成形式化证明的框架，结合自然语言描述、LLM生成证明和启发式模块，用于验证代码属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM生成代码的普及，形式化验证代码属性变得尤为重要，但通用定理证明仍未完全解决。

Method: 框架包含三个组件：生成自然语言描述、LLM生成形式化证明、启发式模块构建最终证明。LLM通过两阶段微调训练。

Result: 在miniF2F-test基准和Isabelle证明助手中验证了框架，并设计了AWS S3桶访问策略代码的验证用例。

Conclusion: 该框架为形式化验证提供了新途径，并创建了数据集以支持未来训练任务。

Abstract: Formally verifying properties of software code has been a highly desirable
task, especially with the emergence of LLM-generated code. In the same vein,
they provide an interesting avenue for the exploration of formal verification
and mechanistic interpretability. Since the introduction of code-specific
models, despite their successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the
task of generalized theorem proving still remains far from being fully solved
and will be a benchmark for reasoning capability in LLMs. In this work, we
introduce a framework that generates whole proofs in a formal language to be
used within systems that utilize the power of built-in tactics and
off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. Our framework includes 3 components:
generating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that
generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing
heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage
fine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model
to generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that
encourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover. We
validate our framework using the miniF2F-test benchmark and the Isabelle proof
assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness of the AWS S3 bucket
access policy code. We also curate a dataset based on the
FVEL\textsubscript{\textnormal{ER}} dataset for future training tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文提出了一种三阶段元评判选择流程，通过多智能体协作和综合评分标准，提高了LLM作为评判者的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂化，评估LLM的响应变得困难，而现有研究忽视了人类评判中的偏见和错误，且未充分探索如何从多个LLM响应中选择合适的评判。

Method: 1) 与GPT-4和人类专家共同制定综合评分标准；2) 使用三个高级LLM智能体评分；3) 通过阈值过滤低分评判。

Result: 在JudgeBench数据集上，相比原始评判和单智能体基线，分别提高了约15.55%和8.37%。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLM作为元评判具有潜力，为未来构建LLM作为评判者的强化学习偏好数据集奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being widely applied across various fields,
but as tasks become more complex, evaluating their responses is increasingly
challenging. Compared to human evaluators, the use of LLMs to support
performance evaluation offers a more efficient alternative. However, most
studies focus mainly on aligning LLMs' judgments with human preferences,
overlooking the existence of biases and mistakes in human judgment.
Furthermore, how to select suitable LLM judgments given multiple potential LLM
responses remains underexplored. To address these two aforementioned issues, we
propose a three-stage meta-judge selection pipeline: 1) developing a
comprehensive rubric with GPT-4 and human experts, 2) using three advanced LLM
agents to score judgments, and 3) applying a threshold to filter out
low-scoring judgments. Compared to methods using a single LLM as both judge and
meta-judge, our pipeline introduces multi-agent collaboration and a more
comprehensive rubric. Experimental results on the JudgeBench dataset show about
15.55\% improvement compared to raw judgments and about 8.37\% improvement over
the single-agent baseline. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs as
meta-judges and lays the foundation for future research on constructing
preference datasets for LLM-as-a-judge reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文提出了一种利用生成式AI和可解释AI技术来理解和解决自动驾驶车辆（AVs）中罕见故障模式（RFMs）的新方法，通过生成多样化环境图像和自然语言描述，提升AV系统的鲁棒性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆（AVs）依赖AI检测物体和环境，但即使经过大量真实数据训练，仍难以检测罕见故障模式（RFMs），即“长尾挑战”。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过提取对象分割掩码并反转生成环境掩码，结合文本提示输入定制扩散模型，利用Stable Diffusion修复模型和对抗噪声优化生成多样化环境图像，以暴露AI系统的漏洞。

Result: 生成了能够规避对象检测模型的多样化环境图像，并提供了自然语言描述的RFMs，帮助开发者和政策制定者改进AV系统的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解和解决AVs中的罕见故障模式提供了有效工具，结合模型训练和测试，可显著提升系统的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately
detect objects and interpret their surroundings. However, even when trained
using millions of miles of real-world data, AVs are often unable to detect rare
failure modes (RFMs). The problem of RFMs is commonly referred to as the
"long-tail challenge", due to the distribution of data including many instances
that are very rarely seen. In this paper, we present a novel approach that
utilizes advanced generative and explainable AI techniques to aid in
understanding RFMs. Our methods can be used to enhance the robustness and
reliability of AVs when combined with both downstream model training and
testing. We extract segmentation masks for objects of interest (e.g., cars) and
invert them to create environmental masks. These masks, combined with carefully
crafted text prompts, are fed into a custom diffusion model. We leverage the
Stable Diffusion inpainting model guided by adversarial noise optimization to
generate images containing diverse environments designed to evade object
detection models and expose vulnerabilities in AI systems. Finally, we produce
natural language descriptions of the generated RFMs that can guide developers
and policymakers to improve the safety and reliability of AV systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为CoGA的方法，通过预训练的视觉语言模型生成代码，限制动作空间以提高样本效率，并在MiniWob++基准测试中验证了其高效性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在稀疏奖励和大动作空间环境中，如网页GUI，传统方法需要大量专家演示才能达到良好性能。CoGA旨在解决低样本效率问题，尤其是在专家行为数据有限的情况下。

Method: CoGA利用预训练的视觉语言模型生成代码，通过隐式意图完成函数和自动化程序生成与验证流程，限制动作空间。这些程序用于强化学习代理，返回给定像素观测的可行动作集合。

Result: 在MiniWob++基准测试中，CoGA比传统强化学习代理样本效率高几个数量级，其程序能在任务家族内泛化，且在少量专家演示下表现优于或与行为克隆相当。

Conclusion: CoGA通过限制动作空间和自动化程序生成，显著提高了样本效率，并在多种任务中展示了其高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Agents that can autonomously navigate the web through a graphical user
interface (GUI) using a unified action space (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions)
can require very large amounts of domain-specific expert demonstrations to
achieve good performance. Low sample efficiency is often exacerbated in
sparse-reward and large-action-space environments, such as a web GUI, where
only a few actions are relevant in any given situation. In this work, we
consider the low-data regime, with limited or no access to expert behavior. To
enable sample-efficient learning, we explore the effect of constraining the
action space through $\textit{intent-based affordances}$ -- i.e., considering
in any situation only the subset of actions that achieve a desired outcome. We
propose $\textbf{Code as Generative Affordances}$ $(\textbf{$\texttt{CoGA}$})$,
a method that leverages pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to generate
code that determines affordable actions through implicit intent-completion
functions and using a fully-automated program generation and verification
pipeline. These programs are then used in-the-loop of a reinforcement learning
agent to return a set of affordances given a pixel observation. By greatly
reducing the number of actions that an agent must consider, we demonstrate on a
wide range of tasks in the MiniWob++ benchmark that: $\textbf{1)}$
$\texttt{CoGA}$ is orders of magnitude more sample efficient than its RL agent,
$\textbf{2)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$'s programs can generalize within a family of
tasks, and $\textbf{3)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$ performs better or on par compared
with behavior cloning when a small number of expert demonstrations is
available.

Motivation: 研究AI自动化对业务流程的影响，尤其是在传统与AI增强流程共存时的过渡阶段。

Method: 采用对象中心流程挖掘（OCPM）方法，结合保险行业的实际案例，分析LLM自动化对流程可扩展性的影响。

Result: LLM显著提升了运营能力，但也引入了新的流程动态，需要进一步优化。OCPM在现实场景中展示了其优势和局限性。

Conclusion: AI自动化在提升效率的同时需要进一步优化流程动态，OCPM为评估此类转型提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), have enhanced organizations' ability to reengineer
business processes by automating knowledge-intensive tasks. This automation
drives digital transformation, often through gradual transitions that improve
process efficiency and effectiveness. To fully assess the impact of such
automation, a data-driven analysis approach is needed - one that examines how
traditional and AI-enhanced process variants coexist during this transition.
Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) has emerged as a valuable method that
enables such analysis, yet real-world case studies are still needed to
demonstrate its applicability. This paper presents a case study from the
insurance sector, where an LLM was deployed in production to automate the
identification of claim parts, a task previously performed manually and
identified as a bottleneck for scalability. To evaluate this transformation, we
apply OCPM to assess the impact of AI-driven automation on process scalability.
Our findings indicate that while LLMs significantly enhance operational
capacity, they also introduce new process dynamics that require further
refinement. This study also demonstrates the practical application of OCPM in a
real-world setting, highlighting its advantages and limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法在处理复杂数据集时效率低下，主要问题在于每个特征使用一个代理的范式以及数据集的固有复杂性。

Method: 使用基于LLM的混合状态提取器捕获特征的数学和语义特性，对特征进行聚类，并为每个聚类和子聚类构建分层代理。

Result: 实验表明，HRLFS在效率和可扩展性上优于现有方法，同时减少了代理数量，加速了运行时间。

Conclusion: HRLFS通过分层代理和LLM的结合，显著提升了特征选择的性能和效率。

Abstract: Feature selection aims to preprocess the target dataset, find an optimal and
most streamlined feature subset, and enhance the downstream machine learning
task. Among filter, wrapper, and embedded-based approaches, the reinforcement
learning (RL)-based subspace exploration strategy provides a novel objective
optimization-directed perspective and promising performance. Nevertheless, even
with improved performance, current reinforcement learning approaches face
challenges similar to conventional methods when dealing with complex datasets.
These challenges stem from the inefficient paradigm of using one agent per
feature and the inherent complexities present in the datasets. This observation
motivates us to investigate and address the above issue and propose a novel
approach, namely HRLFS. Our methodology initially employs a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based hybrid state extractor to capture each feature's mathematical
and semantic characteristics. Based on this information, features are
clustered, facilitating the construction of hierarchical agents for each
cluster and sub-cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and robustness of our approach. Compared to contemporary or the
one-feature-one-agent RL-based approaches, HRLFS improves the downstream ML
performance with iterative feature subspace exploration while accelerating
total run time by reducing the number of agents involved.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for ontology
engineering. However, it is still unclear to what extent they are applicable to
the task of domain-specific ontology generation. In this study, we explore the
application of LLMs for automated ontology generation and evaluate their
performance across different domains. Specifically, we investigate the
generalizability of two state-of-the-art LLMs, DeepSeek and o1-preview, both
equipped with reasoning capabilities, by generating ontologies from a set of
competency questions (CQs) and related user stories. Our experimental setup
comprises six distinct domains carried out in existing ontology engineering
projects and a total of 95 curated CQs designed to test the models' reasoning
for ontology engineering. Our findings show that with both LLMs, the
performance of the experiments is remarkably consistent across all domains,
indicating that these methods are capable of generalizing ontology generation
tasks irrespective of the domain. These results highlight the potential of
LLM-based approaches in achieving scalable and domain-agnostic ontology
construction and lay the groundwork for further research into enhancing
automated reasoning and knowledge representation techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI向超级智能（ASI）发展，可能超出人类控制并引发灾难性后果，因此需要解决超级对齐问题。

Method: 提出了一种框架，整合外部监督（基于人类决策和自动化评估）和内在主动对齐（通过自我认知和同理心）。

Result: 该框架旨在实现人类与AI的协同对齐，促进可持续共生社会。

Conclusion: 结合外部监督和内在主动对齐是实现安全且有益的超级智能的关键。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming increasingly powerful and
autonomous, and may progress to surpass human intelligence levels, namely
Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). During the progression from AI to ASI, it
may exceed human control, violate human values, and even lead to irreversible
catastrophic consequences in extreme cases. This gives rise to a pressing issue
that needs to be addressed: superalignment, ensuring that AI systems much
smarter than humans, remain aligned with human (compatible) intentions and
values. Existing scalable oversight and weak-to-strong generalization methods
may prove substantially infeasible and inadequate when facing ASI. We must
explore safer and more pluralistic frameworks and approaches for
superalignment. In this paper, we redefine superalignment as the human-AI
co-alignment towards a sustainable symbiotic society, and highlight a framework
that integrates external oversight and intrinsic proactive alignment. External
oversight superalignment should be grounded in human-centered ultimate
decision, supplemented by interpretable automated evaluation and correction, to
achieve continuous alignment with humanity's evolving values. Intrinsic
proactive superalignment is rooted in a profound understanding of the self,
others, and society, integrating self-awareness, self-reflection, and empathy
to spontaneously infer human intentions, distinguishing good from evil and
proactively considering human well-being, ultimately attaining human-AI
co-alignment through iterative interaction. The integration of
externally-driven oversight with intrinsically-driven proactive alignment
empowers sustainable symbiotic societies through human-AI co-alignment, paving
the way for achieving safe and beneficial AGI and ASI for good, for human, and
for a symbiotic ecology.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), prompt a reassessment of the interaction mechanisms
between users and their devices. Currently, users are required to use a set of
high-level applications to achieve their desired results. However, the advent
of AI may signal a shift in this regard, as its capabilities have generated
novel prospects for user-provided intent resolution through the deployment of
model-generated code, which is tantamount to the generation of workflows
comprising a multitude of interdependent steps. This development represents a
significant progression in the realm of hybrid workflows, where human and
artificial intelligence collaborate to address user intentions, with the former
responsible for defining these intentions and the latter for implementing the
solutions to address them. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of
generating and executing workflows through code generation that results from
prompting an LLM with a concrete user intention, such as \emph{Please send my
car title to my insurance company}, and a simplified application programming
interface for a GUI-less operating system. We provide in-depth analysis and
comparison of various user intentions, the resulting code, and its execution.
The findings demonstrate a general feasibility of our approach and that the
employed LLM, GPT-4o-mini, exhibits remarkable proficiency in the generation of
code-oriented workflows in accordance with provided user intentions.

Abstract: As generative AI models become increasingly integrated into high-stakes

becomes increasingly important. This paper introduces a five-dimensional audit
model -- assessing Analytic Quality, Breadth of Ethical Considerations, Depth
of Explanation, Consistency, and Decisiveness -- to evaluate the ethical logic
of leading large language models (LLMs). Drawing on traditions from applied
ethics and higher-order thinking, we present a multi-battery prompt approach,
including novel ethical dilemmas, to probe the models' reasoning across diverse
contexts. We benchmark seven major LLMs finding that while models generally
converge on ethical decisions, they vary in explanatory rigor and moral
prioritization. Chain-of-Thought prompting and reasoning-optimized models
significantly enhance performance on our audit metrics. This study introduces a
scalable methodology for ethical benchmarking of AI systems and highlights the
potential for AI to complement human moral reasoning in complex decision-making
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有卫星和地面测量结合的空气质量估算方法计算强度高且覆盖范围有限，无法满足全球环境评估的需求。

Method: 采用均匀随机偏移采样策略，将地面真实数据均匀分散到更大的区域，并通过密集估计方法一步生成网格估算值。

Result: 新方法的平均绝对误差（MAE）为4.98 μg/m³，比现有点状方法提高了9.45%，兼具高精度和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模环境监测提供了可行的解决方案，具有全球适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical environmental challenge of estimating
ambient Nitrogen Dioxide (NO$_2$) concentrations, a key issue in public health
and environmental policy. Existing methods for satellite-based air pollution
estimation model the relationship between satellite and in-situ measurements at
select point locations. While these approaches have advanced our ability to
provide air quality estimations on a global scale, they come with inherent
limitations. The most notable limitation is the computational intensity
required for generating comprehensive estimates over extensive areas. Motivated
by these limitations, this study introduces a novel dense estimation technique.
Our approach seeks to balance the accuracy of high-resolution estimates with
the practicality of computational constraints, thereby enabling efficient and
scalable global environmental assessment. By utilizing a uniformly random
offset sampling strategy, our method disperses the ground truth data pixel
location evenly across a larger patch. At inference, the dense estimation
method can then generate a grid of estimates in a single step, significantly
reducing the computational resources required to provide estimates for larger
areas. Notably, our approach also surpasses the results of existing point-wise
methods by a significant margin of $9.45\%$, achieving a Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of $4.98\ \mu\text{g}/\text{m}^3$. This demonstrates both high accuracy
and computational efficiency, highlighting the applicability of our method for
global environmental assessment. Furthermore, we showcase the method's
adaptability and robustness by applying it to diverse geographic regions. Our
method offers a viable solution to the computational challenges of large-scale
environmental monitoring.

Motivation: 解决视觉变换器中固定长度输出的低效问题，动态适应图像内容以减少计算成本。

Method: 结合动态令牌合并（DToMe）和虚拟令牌解合并（VTU），动态调整令牌压缩并模拟完整序列的注意力动态。

Result: 实验显示，DyMU减少32%-85%的视觉令牌数量，性能与完整模型相当。

Conclusion: DyMU为视觉语言模型提供了一种高效、无需训练的动态压缩方法，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: We present DyMU, an efficient, training-free framework that dynamically
reduces the computational burden of vision-language models (VLMs) while
maintaining high task performance. Our approach comprises two key components.
First, Dynamic Token Merging (DToMe) reduces the number of visual token
embeddings by merging similar tokens based on image complexity, addressing the
inherent inefficiency of fixed-length outputs in vision transformers. Second,
Virtual Token Unmerging (VTU) simulates the expected token sequence for large
language models (LLMs) by efficiently reconstructing the attention dynamics of
a full sequence, thus preserving the downstream performance without additional
fine-tuning. Unlike previous approaches, our method dynamically adapts token
compression to the content of the image and operates completely training-free,
making it readily applicable to most state-of-the-art VLM architectures.
Extensive experiments on image and video understanding tasks demonstrate that
DyMU can reduce the average visual token count by 32%-85% while achieving
comparable performance to full-length models across diverse VLM architectures,
including the recently popularized AnyRes-based visual encoders. Furthermore,
through qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that DToMe effectively adapts
token reduction based on image complexity and, unlike existing systems,
provides users more control over computational costs. Project page:

to real data. We propose a novel image-to-image translation framework that
preserves structure while generating realistic textures from clinical data. Our
key innovation integrates Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, conditioned on a
latent representation extracted from a Per-Pixel Shading (PPS) map. PPS
captures surface lighting effects, providing a stronger structural constraint
than depth maps. Experiments show our approach produces more realistic
translations and improves depth estimation over GAN-based MI-CycleGAN. Our code
is publicly accessible at https://github.com/anaxqx/PPS-Ctrl.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种改进的自回归图像生成方法，通过任意顺序生成图像块并优化生成顺序，提升了图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自回归图像生成采用固定的光栅扫描顺序，忽略了图像内容的因果关系，导致生成质量不佳。

Method: 首先训练模型以任意顺序生成图像块，推断内容和顺序；然后利用提取的顺序微调模型。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在两种数据集上生成的图像质量优于传统方法，且训练成本和注释需求相同。

Conclusion: 优化生成顺序可以显著提升自回归图像生成的质量，无需额外成本或注释。

Abstract: Autoregressive patch-based image generation has recently shown competitive
results in terms of image quality and scalability. It can also be easily
integrated and scaled within Vision-Language models. Nevertheless,
autoregressive models require a defined order for patch generation. While a
natural order based on the dictation of the words makes sense for text
generation, there is no inherent generation order that exists for image
generation. Traditionally, a raster-scan order (from top-left to bottom-right)
guides autoregressive image generation models. In this paper, we argue that
this order is suboptimal, as it fails to respect the causality of the image
content: for instance, when conditioned on a visual description of a sunset, an
autoregressive model may generate clouds before the sun, even though the color
of clouds should depend on the color of the sun and not the inverse. In this
work, we show that first by training a model to generate patches in
any-given-order, we can infer both the content and the location (order) of each
patch during generation. Secondly, we use these extracted orders to finetune
the any-given-order model to produce better-quality images. Through our
experiments, we show on two datasets that this new generation method produces
better images than the traditional raster-scan approach, with similar training
costs and no extra annotations.

Conclusion: 合理的布局增强是数据增强的关键，新方法在性能和实用性上优于现有技术。

Abstract: Generative image models are increasingly being used for training data
augmentation in vision tasks. In the context of automotive object detection,
methods usually focus on producing augmented frames that look as realistic as
possible, for example by replacing real objects with generated ones. Others try
to maximize the diversity of augmented frames, for example by pasting lots of
generated objects onto existing backgrounds. Both perspectives pay little
attention to the locations of objects in the scene. Frame layouts are either
reused with little or no modification, or they are random and disregard realism
entirely. In this work, we argue that optimal data augmentation should also
include realistic augmentation of layouts. We introduce a scene-aware
probabilistic location model that predicts where new objects can realistically
be placed in an existing scene. By then inpainting objects in these locations
with a generative model, we obtain much stronger augmentation performance than
existing approaches. We set a new state of the art for generative data
augmentation on two automotive object detection tasks, achieving up to
$2.8\times$ higher gains than the best competing approach ($+1.4$ vs. $+0.5$
mAP boost). We also demonstrate significant improvements for instance
segmentation.

Result: 在所有数据集上性能最优，例如HMDB51 IPC 1提升2.6%，MiniUCF IPC 5提升7.8%。

Conclusion: 潜在空间操作和多样性选择显著提升了视频数据集蒸馏的性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
high-compression scenarios for image datasets. While video datasets inherently
contain greater redundancy, existing video dataset distillation methods
primarily focus on compression in the pixel space, overlooking advances in the
latent space that have been widely adopted in modern text-to-image and
text-to-video models. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a novel
video dataset distillation approach that operates in the latent space using a
state-of-the-art variational encoder. Furthermore, we employ a diversity-aware
data selection strategy to select both representative and diverse samples.
Additionally, we introduce a simple, training-free method to further compress
the distilled latent dataset. By combining these techniques, our approach
achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in dataset distillation,
outperforming prior methods on all datasets, e.g. on HMDB51 IPC 1, we achieve a
2.6% performance increase; on MiniUCF IPC 5, we achieve a 7.8% performance
increase.

Conclusion: 该综述为RNA亚细胞定位领域的研究者提供了创新解决方案的参考，并指出了数据稀缺和基准缺失等挑战。

Abstract: The subcellular localization of RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other smaller RNAs,
plays a critical role in determining their biological functions. For instance,
lncRNAs are predominantly associated with chromatin and act as regulators of
gene transcription and chromatin structure, while mRNAs are distributed across
the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitating the transport of genetic information
for protein synthesis. Understanding RNA localization sheds light on processes
like gene expression regulation with spatial and temporal precision. However,
traditional wet lab methods for determining RNA localization, such as in situ
hybridization, are often time-consuming, resource-demanding, and costly. To
overcome these challenges, computational methods leveraging artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful
alternatives, enabling large-scale prediction of RNA subcellular localization.
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in
AI-based approaches for RNA subcellular localization prediction, covering
various RNA types and focusing on sequence-based, image-based, and hybrid
methodologies that combine both data types. We highlight the potential of these
methods to accelerate RNA research, uncover molecular pathways, and guide
targeted disease treatments. Furthermore, we critically discuss the challenges
in AI/ML approaches for RNA subcellular localization, such as data scarcity and
lack of benchmarks, and opportunities to address them. This review aims to
serve as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop innovative
solutions in the field of RNA subcellular localization and beyond.

TLDR: PhysioSync是一个新型预训练框架，通过跨模态和时间对比学习提升EEG情感识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号虽能反映情感状态，但存在噪声和个体差异问题；现有方法忽视了模态间的动态同步和语义一致性。

Method: 提出PhysioSync框架，结合跨模态一致性对齐（CM-CA）和长短时时间对比学习（LS-TCL）。

Result: 在DEAP和DREAMER数据集上表现优异，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PhysioSync显著提升了EEG情感识别的性能，尤其在跨模态条件下表现突出。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide a promising and involuntary
reflection of brain activity related to emotional states, offering significant
advantages over behavioral cues like facial expressions. However, EEG signals
are often noisy, affected by artifacts, and vary across individuals,
complicating emotion recognition. While multimodal approaches have used
Peripheral Physiological Signals (PPS) like GSR to complement EEG, they often
overlook the dynamic synchronization and consistent semantics between the
modalities. Additionally, the temporal dynamics of emotional fluctuations
across different time resolutions in PPS remain underexplored. To address these
challenges, we propose PhysioSync, a novel pre-training framework leveraging
temporal and cross-modal contrastive learning, inspired by physiological
synchronization phenomena. PhysioSync incorporates Cross-Modal Consistency
Alignment (CM-CA) to model dynamic relationships between EEG and complementary
PPS, enabling emotion-related synchronizations across modalities. Besides, it
introduces Long- and Short-Term Temporal Contrastive Learning (LS-TCL) to
capture emotional synchronization at different temporal resolutions within
modalities. After pre-training, cross-resolution and cross-modal features are
hierarchically fused and fine-tuned to enhance emotion recognition. Experiments
on DEAP and DREAMER datasets demonstrate PhysioSync's advanced performance
under uni-modal and cross-modal conditions, highlighting its effectiveness for
EEG-centered emotion recognition.

Abstract: Foundation models have garnered increasing attention for representation
learning in remote sensing, primarily adopting approaches that have
demonstrated success in computer vision with minimal domain-specific
modification. However, the development and application of foundation models in
this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches
that each come with significant benefits and drawbacks. This paper examines
these approaches along with their roots in the computer vision field in order
to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls while outlining future
directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We
discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the
need for massive compute resources. We place emphasis on the multi-sensor
aspect of Earth observations, and the extent to which existing approaches
leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to
multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further
harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote
sensing observations.

Conclusion: 该方法为提升文本到视频生成质量提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Current text-to-video (T2V) generation models are increasingly popular due to
their ability to produce coherent videos from textual prompts. However, these
models often struggle to generate semantically and temporally consistent videos
when dealing with longer, more complex prompts involving multiple objects or
sequential events. Additionally, the high computational costs associated with
training or fine-tuning make direct improvements impractical. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce \(\projectname\), a novel zero-training video
refinement pipeline that leverages neuro-symbolic feedback to automatically
enhance video generation, achieving superior alignment with the prompts. Our
approach first derives the neuro-symbolic feedback by analyzing a formal video
representation and pinpoints semantically inconsistent events, objects, and
their corresponding frames. This feedback then guides targeted edits to the
original video. Extensive empirical evaluations on both open-source and
proprietary T2V models demonstrate that \(\projectname\) significantly enhances
temporal and logical alignment across diverse prompts by almost $40\%$.

Result: 在合成和真实图像基准测试中，APC显著优于现有VLM和空间推理模型。

Conclusion: APC框架有效提升了VLM的视角感知推理能力，接近人类水平。

Abstract: We present a framework for perspective-aware reasoning in vision-language
models (VLMs) through mental imagery simulation. Perspective-taking, the
ability to perceive an environment or situation from an alternative viewpoint,
is a key benchmark for human-level visual understanding, essential for
environmental interaction and collaboration with autonomous agents. Despite
advancements in spatial reasoning within VLMs, recent research has shown that
modern VLMs significantly lack perspective-aware reasoning capabilities and
exhibit a strong bias toward egocentric interpretations. To bridge the gap
between VLMs and human perception, we focus on the role of mental imagery,
where humans perceive the world through abstracted representations that
facilitate perspective shifts. Motivated by this, we propose a framework for
perspective-aware reasoning, named Abstract Perspective Change (APC), that
effectively leverages vision foundation models, such as object detection,
segmentation, and orientation estimation, to construct scene abstractions and
enable perspective transformations. Our experiments on synthetic and real-image
benchmarks, compared with various VLMs, demonstrate significant improvements in
perspective-aware reasoning with our framework, further outperforming
fine-tuned spatial reasoning models and novel-view-synthesis-based approaches.

TLDR: MCAF是一种基于代理的无训练框架，通过多模态粗到细注意力聚焦实现视频理解，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解（尤其是长视频）因信息冗余和复杂性而具有挑战性，需要全局注意力分配策略。

Method: MCAF通过多模态信息分层聚焦相关帧，并采用扩张时间扩展机制避免遗漏细节，结合自反馈机制迭代优化注意力。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如EgoSchema提升5%，Next-QA和IntentQA分别提升0.2%和0.3%，在长视频数据集Video-MME上也优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MCAF通过创新的注意力聚焦策略，显著提升了视频理解的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Even in the era of rapid advances in large models, video understanding,
particularly long videos, remains highly challenging. Compared with textual or
image-based information, videos commonly contain more information with
redundancy, requiring large models to strategically allocate attention at a
global level for accurate comprehension. To address this, we propose MCAF, an
agent-based, training-free framework perform video understanding through
Multimodal Coarse-to-fine Attention Focusing. The key innovation lies in its
ability to sense and prioritize segments of the video that are highly relevant
to the understanding task. First, MCAF hierarchically concentrates on highly
relevant frames through multimodal information, enhancing the correlation
between the acquired contextual information and the query. Second, it employs a
dilated temporal expansion mechanism to mitigate the risk of missing crucial
details when extracting information from these concentrated frames. In
addition, our framework incorporates a self-reflection mechanism utilizing the
confidence level of the model's responses as feedback. By iteratively applying
these two creative focusing strategies, it adaptively adjusts attention to
capture highly query-connected context and thus improves response accuracy.
MCAF outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on average. On the
EgoSchema dataset, it achieves a remarkable 5% performance gain over the
leading approach. Meanwhile, on Next-QA and IntentQA datasets, it outperforms
the current state-of-the-art standard by 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. On the
Video-MME dataset, which features videos averaging nearly an hour in length,
MCAF also outperforms other agent-based methods.

Result: 在广泛采用的基准测试中，该方法在准确性和泛化性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多尺度空间-频率分析有效解决了深度伪造检测中的挑战。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deep generative models poses a critical challenge to
deepfake detection, as detectors trained on forgery-specific artifacts often
suffer significant performance degradation when encountering unseen forgeries.
While existing methods predominantly rely on spatial domain analysis, frequency
domain operations are primarily limited to feature-level augmentation, leaving
frequency-native artifacts and spatial-frequency interactions insufficiently
exploited. To address this limitation, we propose a novel detection framework
that integrates multi-scale spatial-frequency analysis for universal deepfake
detection. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a local spectral
feature extraction pipeline that combines block-wise discrete cosine transform
with cascaded multi-scale convolutions to capture subtle spectral artifacts;
(2) a global spectral feature extraction pipeline utilizing scale-invariant
differential accumulation to identify holistic forgery distribution patterns;
and (3) a multi-stage cross-modal fusion mechanism that incorporates
shallow-layer attention enhancement and deep-layer dynamic modulation to model
spatial-frequency interactions. Extensive evaluations on widely adopted
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art deepfake
detection methods in both accuracy and generalizability.

Method: 提出SoVTP框架，结合空间标注、生理信号和上下文线索，形成统一提示策略。

Result: 实验表明SoVTP显著优于现有视觉提示方法。

Conclusion: SoVTP有效增强了VLLMs的视频情感识别能力。

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) exhibit promising potential for
multi-modal understanding, yet their application to video-based emotion
recognition remains limited by insufficient spatial and contextual awareness.
Traditional approaches, which prioritize isolated facial features, often
neglect critical non-verbal cues such as body language, environmental context,
and social interactions, leading to reduced robustness in real-world scenarios.
To address this gap, we propose Set-of-Vision-Text Prompting (SoVTP), a novel
framework that enhances zero-shot emotion recognition by integrating spatial
annotations (e.g., bounding boxes, facial landmarks), physiological signals
(facial action units), and contextual cues (body posture, scene dynamics,
others' emotions) into a unified prompting strategy. SoVTP preserves holistic
scene information while enabling fine-grained analysis of facial muscle
movements and interpersonal dynamics. Extensive experiments show that SoVTP
achieves substantial improvements over existing visual prompting methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing VLLMs' video emotion recognition
capabilities.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of poor quality of steganographic images and slow
network convergence of image steganography models based on deep learning, this
paper proposes a Steganography Curriculum Learning training strategy (STCL) for
deep learning image steganography models. So that only easy images are selected
for training when the model has poor fitting ability at the initial stage, and
gradually expand to more difficult images, the strategy includes a difficulty
evaluation strategy based on the teacher model and an knee point-based training
scheduling strategy. Firstly, multiple teacher models are trained, and the
consistency of the quality of steganographic images under multiple teacher
models is used as the difficulty score to construct the training subsets from
easy to difficult. Secondly, a training control strategy based on knee points
is proposed to reduce the possibility of overfitting on small training sets and
accelerate the training process. Experimental results on three large public
datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed image
steganography scheme is able to improve the model performance under multiple
algorithmic frameworks, which not only has a high PSNR, SSIM score, and
decoding accuracy, but also the steganographic images generated by the model
under the training of the STCL strategy have a low steganography analysis
scores. You can find our code at

Motivation: 传统图像压缩技术在处理LiDAR点云的2D范围图像（RIs）时效率有限，因其与自然图像在比特精度和像素值分布上存在差异。

Method: 将RIs分为深度和掩码图像，分别采用分块和像素级的INR架构，结合模型剪枝和量化技术进行压缩。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，该方法在低比特率和解码延迟下，优于现有图像、点云、RI和INR压缩方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效压缩LiDAR点云提供了新思路，适用于高精度3D场景存档和分析。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel scheme to efficiently compress Light Detection
and Ranging~(LiDAR) point clouds, enabling high-precision 3D scene archives,
and such archives pave the way for a detailed understanding of the
corresponding 3D scenes. We focus on 2D range images~(RIs) as a lightweight
format for representing 3D LiDAR observations. Although conventional image
compression techniques can be adapted to improve compression efficiency for
RIs, their practical performance is expected to be limited due to differences
in bit precision and the distinct pixel value distribution characteristics
between natural images and RIs. We propose a novel implicit neural
representation~(INR)--based RI compression method that effectively handles
floating-point valued pixels. The proposed method divides RIs into depth and
mask images and compresses them using patch-wise and pixel-wise INR
architectures with model pruning and quantization, respectively. Experiments on
the KITTI dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing image,
point cloud, RI, and INR-based compression methods in terms of 3D
reconstruction and detection quality at low bitrates and decoding latency.

Conclusion: 新方法有效结合了深度学习与传统技术，提升了图像质量评估的准确性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and widespread use of
smartphones have resulted in an exponential growth of image data, both real
(camera-captured) and virtual (AI-generated). This surge underscores the
critical need for robust image quality assessment (IQA) methods that accurately
reflect human visual perception. Traditional IQA techniques primarily rely on
spatial features - such as signal-to-noise ratio, local structural distortions,
and texture inconsistencies - to identify artifacts. While effective for
unprocessed or conventionally altered images, these methods fall short in the
context of modern image post-processing powered by deep neural networks (DNNs).
The rise of DNN-based models for image generation, enhancement, and restoration
has significantly improved visual quality, yet made accurate assessment
increasingly complex. To address this, we propose a novel IQA approach that
bridges the gap between deep learning methods and human perception. Our model
disentangles deep features into high-level semantic information and low-level
perceptual details, treating each stream separately. These features are then
combined with conventional IQA metrics to provide a more comprehensive
evaluation framework. This hybrid design enables the model to assess both
global context and intricate image details, better reflecting the human visual
process, which first interprets overall structure before attending to
fine-grained elements. The final stage employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
map the integrated features into a concise quality score. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves improved consistency with human perceptual
judgments compared to existing IQA models.

leveraging pretrained diffusion models for performing discriminative tasks.
Specifically, we extend the discriminative capability of pretrained frozen
generative diffusion models from the classification task to the more complex
object detection task, by "inverting" a pretrained layout-to-image diffusion
model. To this end, a gradient-based discrete optimization approach for
replacing the heavy prediction enumeration process, and a prior distribution
model for making more accurate use of the Bayes' rule, are proposed
respectively. Empirical results show that this method is on par with basic
discriminative object detection baselines on COCO dataset. In addition, our
method can greatly speed up the previous diffusion-based method for
classification without sacrificing accuracy. Code and models are available at

*Wenqiang Zhou,Zhendong Yu,Xinyu Liu,Jiaming Yang,Rong Xiao,Tao Wang,Chenwei Tang,Jiancheng Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种自适应步长量化方法（ASQ），通过动态调整量化参数和非均匀量化方案，显著提升了量化感知训练（QAT）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化感知训练（QAT）虽然能压缩模型并提升效率，但量化参数的可训练性会牺牲推理灵活性，尤其是处理分布差异大的激活值时。

Method: ASQ方法通过训练模块动态调整量化缩放因子，并采用基于平方根二的指数量化方案（POST）处理非均匀量化，同时利用查找表（LUT）保持计算效率。

Result: 实验表明ASQ优于现有QAT方法，4位量化的ResNet34在ImageNet上准确率提升1.2%，甚至接近全精度基线。

Conclusion: ASQ通过自适应量化方案有效解决了QAT的灵活性限制，同时保持了高性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Quantization Aware Training (QAT) is a neural network quantization technique
that compresses model size and improves operational efficiency while
effectively maintaining model performance. The paradigm of QAT is to introduce
fake quantization operators during the training process, allowing the model to
autonomously compensate for information loss caused by quantization. Making
quantization parameters trainable can significantly improve the performance of
QAT, but at the cost of compromising the flexibility during inference,
especially when dealing with activation values with substantially different
distributions. In this paper, we propose an effective learnable adaptive neural
network quantization method, called Adaptive Step Size Quantization (ASQ), to
resolve this conflict. Specifically, the proposed ASQ method first dynamically
adjusts quantization scaling factors through a trained module capable of
accommodating different activations. Then, to address the rigid resolution
issue inherent in Power of Two (POT) quantization, we propose an efficient
non-uniform quantization scheme. We utilize the Power Of Square root of Two
(POST) as the basis for exponential quantization, effectively handling the
bell-shaped distribution of neural network weights across various bit-widths
while maintaining computational efficiency through a Look-Up Table method
(LUT). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASQ method
is superior to the state-of-the-art QAT approaches. Notably that the ASQ is
even competitive compared to full precision baselines, with its 4-bit quantized
ResNet34 model improving accuracy by 1.2\% on ImageNet.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为GTF的新方法，用于文本引导的语义编辑，支持多种操作且无需训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法效率低、扩展性差且通用性有限，而扩散模型中的噪声几何特性与语义变化相关。

Result: 实验证明GTF能高效生成高保真结果，支持多模态任务。

Conclusion: GTF在语义编辑领域具有潜力，可推动技术前沿。

Abstract: Text-guided semantic manipulation refers to semantically editing an image
generated from a source prompt to match a target prompt, enabling the desired
semantic changes (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) while preserving
irrelevant contents. With the powerful generative capabilities of the diffusion
model, the task has shown the potential to generate high-fidelity visual
content. Nevertheless, existing methods either typically require time-consuming
fine-tuning (inefficient), fail to accomplish multiple semantic manipulations
(poorly extensible), and/or lack support for different modality tasks (limited
generalizability). Upon further investigation, we find that the geometric
properties of noises in the diffusion model are strongly correlated with the
semantic changes. Motivated by this, we propose a novel $\textit{GTF}$ for
text-guided semantic manipulation, which has the following attractive
capabilities: 1) $\textbf{Generalized}$: our $\textit{GTF}$ supports multiple
semantic manipulations (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) and can be
seamlessly integrated into all diffusion-based methods (i.e., Plug-and-play)
across different modalities (i.e., modality-agnostic); and 2)
$\textbf{Training-free}$: $\textit{GTF}$ produces high-fidelity results via
simply controlling the geometric relationship between noises without tuning or
optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach, highlighting its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in
semantics manipulation.

Conclusion: EdgePoint2是视觉任务中极具竞争力的选择，尤其适用于计算和通信受限的场景。

Abstract: The field of keypoint extraction, which is essential for vision applications
like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM), has evolved from relying on handcrafted methods to leveraging deep
learning techniques. While deep learning approaches have significantly improved
performance, they often incur substantial computational costs, limiting their
deployment in real-time edge applications. Efforts to create lightweight neural
networks have seen some success, yet they often result in trade-offs between
efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the high-dimensional descriptors
generated by these networks poses challenges for distributed applications
requiring efficient communication and coordination, highlighting the need for
compact yet competitively accurate descriptors. In this paper, we present
EdgePoint2, a series of lightweight keypoint detection and description neural
networks specifically tailored for edge computing applications on embedded
system. The network architecture is optimized for efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. To train compact descriptors, we introduce a combination
of Orthogonal Procrustes loss and similarity loss, which can serve as a general
approach for hypersphere embedding distillation tasks. Additionally, we offer
14 sub-models to satisfy diverse application requirements. Our experiments
demonstrate that EdgePoint2 consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
accuracy and efficiency across various challenging scenarios while employing
lower-dimensional descriptors (32/48/64). Beyond its accuracy, EdgePoint2
offers significant advantages in flexibility, robustness, and versatility.
Consequently, EdgePoint2 emerges as a highly competitive option for visual
tasks, especially in contexts demanding adaptability to diverse computational
and communication constraints.

Abstract: To improve the segmentation of diabetic retinopathy lesions (microaneurysms,
hemorrhages, exudates, and soft exudates), we implemented a binary segmentation
method specific to each type of lesion. As post-segmentation, we combined the
individual model outputs into a single image to better analyze the lesion
types. This approach facilitated parameter optimization and improved accuracy,
effectively overcoming challenges related to dataset limitations and annotation
complexity. Specific preprocessing steps included cropping and applying
contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization to the L channel of the LAB

further refine the model's efficacy. Our methodology utilized the DeepLabv3+
model, achieving a segmentation accuracy of 99%. These findings highlight the
efficacy of innovative strategies in advancing medical image analysis,
particularly in the precise segmentation of diabetic retinopathy lesions. The
IDRID dataset was utilized to validate and demonstrate the robustness of our
approach.

Motivation: 在线视频平台的快速增长，尤其是直播服务，对实时视频理解系统提出了迫切需求，现有VideoLLMs在处理流媒体视频时存在效率不足的问题。

Method: 提出DTD模块，灵感来自人类视觉感知的‘变化盲视’现象，保留有意义的时间变化，过滤静态冗余内容。

Result: DTD减少了82.8%的视频令牌，同时保持98%的性能，表明流媒体视频中80%以上的内容是冗余的。

Conclusion: TimeChat-Online在流媒体视频任务中表现优异，同时在长视频任务中保持竞争力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video platforms, particularly live streaming
services, has created an urgent need for real-time video understanding systems.
These systems must process continuous video streams and respond to user queries
instantaneously, presenting unique challenges for current Video Large Language
Models (VideoLLMs). While existing VideoLLMs excel at processing complete
videos, they face significant limitations in streaming scenarios due to their
inability to handle dense, redundant frames efficiently. We introduce
TimeChat-Online, a novel online VideoLLM that revolutionizes real-time video
interaction. At its core lies our innovative Differential Token Drop (DTD)
module, which addresses the fundamental challenge of visual redundancy in
streaming videos. Drawing inspiration from human visual perception's Change
Blindness phenomenon, DTD preserves meaningful temporal changes while filtering
out static, redundant content between frames. Remarkably, our experiments
demonstrate that DTD achieves an 82.8% reduction in video tokens while
maintaining 98% performance on StreamingBench, revealing that over 80% of
visual content in streaming videos is naturally redundant without requiring
language guidance. To enable seamless real-time interaction, we present
TimeChat-Online-139K, a comprehensive streaming video dataset featuring diverse
interaction patterns including backward-tracing, current-perception, and
future-responding scenarios. TimeChat-Online's unique Proactive Response
capability, naturally achieved through continuous monitoring of video scene
transitions via DTD, sets it apart from conventional approaches. Our extensive
evaluation demonstrates TimeChat-Online's superior performance on streaming
benchmarks (StreamingBench and OvOBench) and maintaining competitive results on
long-form video tasks such as Video-MME and MLVU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以准确捕捉和融合用户的风格偏好与语义意图，导致生成的图像无法保留用户偏好或反映指定语义。

Method: DRC采用解耦表示组合，通过双塔解耦器分离风格和语义特征，并结合语义保持增强进行个性化建模。

Result: 实验表明，DRC在性能上具有竞争力，有效缓解了引导崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 解耦表示学习对可控且有效的个性化图像生成至关重要。

Abstract: Personalized image generation has emerged as a promising direction in
multimodal content creation. It aims to synthesize images tailored to
individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances,
layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by
leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite
notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large
language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately
capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular,
the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual
features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to
preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics.
  To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image
generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation
Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic
intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form
user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs.
Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement
learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style
and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with
difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which
applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled
representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on
two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while
effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance
of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective
personalized image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统隐式神经表示（INRs）因其回归问题的本质，容易回归到均值，导致难以捕捉细节、保留高频信息及有效处理噪声。

Method: 提出I-INRs框架，通过迭代细化过程增强信号重建能力，并与现有INRs架构无缝集成。

Result: 实验表明，I-INRs在图像恢复、去噪和物体占用预测等任务中优于基线方法（如WIRE、SIREN和Gauss）。

Conclusion: I-INRs显著提升了信号重建质量，为计算机视觉任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have revolutionized signal processing
and computer vision by modeling signals as continuous, differentiable functions
parameterized by neural networks. However, their inherent formulation as a
regression problem makes them prone to regression to the mean, limiting their
ability to capture fine details, retain high-frequency information, and handle
noise effectively. To address these challenges, we propose Iterative Implicit
Neural Representations (I-INRs) a novel plug-and-play framework that enhances
signal reconstruction through an iterative refinement process. I-INRs
effectively recover high-frequency details, improve robustness to noise, and
achieve superior reconstruction quality. Our framework seamlessly integrates
with existing INR architectures, delivering substantial performance gains
across various tasks. Extensive experiments show that I-INRs outperform
baseline methods, including WIRE, SIREN, and Gauss, in diverse computer vision
applications such as image restoration, image denoising, and object occupancy
prediction.

Method: 提出TimeSoccer模型，结合MoFA-Select帧压缩模块，自适应选择代表性帧，并通过互补训练范式增强长序列处理能力。

Result: 实验表明TimeSoccer在SDVC任务上达到最先进性能，生成高质量评论且时间对齐准确。

Conclusion: TimeSoccer解决了足球视频端到端处理的挑战，为长视频理解提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Soccer is a globally popular sporting event, typically characterized by long
matches and distinctive highlight moments. Recent advances in Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
video understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise
temporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video.
However, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption
generation, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some
traditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to
capture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the
above issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for
Single-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos.
TimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass,
enabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long
video understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a
training-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects
representative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates
complementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle
long temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer
achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end
form, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and
strong semantic relevance.

Abstract: Accurate 3D trajectory data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving. Yet,
traditional datasets are usually captured by fixed sensors mounted on a car and
are susceptible to occlusion. Additionally, such an approach can precisely
reconstruct the dynamic environment in the close vicinity of the measurement
vehicle only, while neglecting objects that are further away. In this paper, we
introduce the DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset (DSC3D), a high-quality,
occlusion-free dataset of 6 degrees of freedom bounding box trajectories
acquired through a novel monocular camera drone tracking pipeline. Our dataset
includes more than 175,000 trajectories of 14 types of traffic participants and
significantly exceeds existing datasets in terms of diversity and scale,
containing many unprecedented scenarios such as complex vehicle-pedestrian
interaction on highly populated urban streets and comprehensive parking
maneuvers from entry to exit. DSC3D dataset was captured in five various
locations in Europe and the United States and include: a parking lot, a crowded
inner-city, a steep urban intersection, a federal highway, and a suburban
intersection. Our 3D trajectory dataset aims to enhance autonomous driving
systems by providing detailed environmental 3D representations, which could
lead to improved obstacle interactions and safety. We demonstrate its utility
across multiple applications including motion prediction, motion planning,
scenario mining, and generative reactive traffic agents. Our interactive online

Result: 在FSC-147、CARPK和PUCPR+数据集上验证了SDVPT的有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: SDVPT能以最小参数和推理时间开销，显著提升模型对未见类别的计数能力。

Abstract: Open-world object counting leverages the robust text-image alignment of
pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to enable counting of arbitrary
categories in images specified by textual queries. However, widely adopted
naive fine-tuning strategies concentrate exclusively on text-image consistency
for categories contained in training, which leads to limited generalizability
for unseen categories. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Semantic-Driven
Visual Prompt Tuning framework (SDVPT) that transfers knowledge from the
training set to unseen categories with minimal overhead in parameters and
inference time. First, we introduce a two-stage visual prompt learning strategy
composed of Category-Specific Prompt Initialization (CSPI) and Topology-Guided
Prompt Refinement (TGPR). The CSPI generates category-specific visual prompts,
and then TGPR distills latent structural patterns from the VLM's text encoder
to refine these prompts. During inference, we dynamically synthesize the visual
prompts for unseen categories based on the semantic correlation between unseen
and training categories, facilitating robust text-image alignment for unseen
categories. Extensive experiments integrating SDVPT with all available
open-world object counting models demonstrate its effectiveness and
adaptability across three widely used datasets: FSC-147, CARPK, and PUCPR+.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is crucial for monitoring environmental changes,
responding to disasters, and managing natural resources. In this context,
foundation models facilitate remote sensing image analysis to retrieve relevant
geoinformation accurately and efficiently. However, as these models grow in
size, fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging due to the associated
computational resources and costs, limiting their accessibility and
scalability. Furthermore, full fine-tuning can lead to forgetting pre-trained
features and even degrade model generalization. To address this,
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques offer a promising solution.
In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments with various foundation model
architectures and PEFT techniques to evaluate their effectiveness on five
different EO datasets. Our results provide a comprehensive comparison, offering
insights into when and how PEFT methods support the adaptation of pre-trained
geospatial models. We demonstrate that PEFT techniques match or even exceed
full fine-tuning performance and enhance model generalisation to unseen
geographic regions, while reducing training time and memory requirements.
Additional experiments investigate the effect of architecture choices such as
the decoder type or the use of metadata, suggesting UNet decoders and
fine-tuning without metadata as the recommended configuration. We have
integrated all evaluated foundation models and techniques into the open-source
package TerraTorch to support quick, scalable, and cost-effective model
adaptation.

Abstract: Collective Perception (CP) has emerged as a promising approach to overcome
the limitations of individual perception in the context of autonomous driving.
Various approaches have been proposed to realize collective perception;
however, the Sensor2Sensor domain gap that arises from the utilization of
different sensor systems in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) remains
mostly unaddressed. This is primarily due to the paucity of datasets containing
heterogeneous sensor setups among the CAVs. The recently released SCOPE

sensors for each CAV. This study is the first to tackle the Sensor2Sensor
domain gap in vehicle to vehicle (V2V) collective perception. First, we present
our sensor-domain robust architecture S2S-Net. Then an in-depth analysis of the
Sensor2Sensor domain adaptation capabilities of S2S-Net on the SCOPE dataset is
conducted. S2S-Net demonstrates the capability to maintain very high

effectively integrate multi-scale features from FE-Mamba, we then introduce a
novel Multidimensional Feature Fusion (MFF) module. Experiments against the
state-of-the-art on the ex-vivo SCARED benchmark demonstrate that StereoMamba
achieves superior performance on EPE of 2.64 px and depth MAE of 2.55 mm, the
second-best performance on Bad2 of 41.49% and Bad3 of 26.99%, while maintaining
an inference speed of 21.28 FPS for a pair of high-resolution images
(1280*1024), striking the optimum balance between accuracy, robustness, and
efficiency. Furthermore, by comparing synthesized right images, generated from
warping left images using the generated disparity maps, with the actual right
image, StereoMamba achieves the best average SSIM (0.8970) and PSNR (16.0761),
exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization on the in-vivo RIS2017 and StereoMIS
datasets.

Abstract: Video try-on replaces clothing in videos with target garments. Existing
methods struggle to generate high-quality and temporally consistent results
when handling complex clothing patterns and diverse body poses. We present
3DV-TON, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating high-fidelity and
temporally consistent video try-on results. Our approach employs generated
animatable textured 3D meshes as explicit frame-level guidance, alleviating the
issue of models over-focusing on appearance fidelity at the expanse of motion
coherence. This is achieved by enabling direct reference to consistent garment
texture movements throughout video sequences. The proposed method features an
adaptive pipeline for generating dynamic 3D guidance: (1) selecting a keyframe
for initial 2D image try-on, followed by (2) reconstructing and animating a
textured 3D mesh synchronized with original video poses. We further introduce a
robust rectangular masking strategy that successfully mitigates artifact
propagation caused by leaking clothing information during dynamic human and
garment movements. To advance video try-on research, we introduce HR-VVT, a
high-resolution benchmark dataset containing 130 videos with diverse clothing
types and scenarios. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate our
superior performance over existing methods. The project page is at this link

TLDR: UniME提出了一种新的两阶段框架，利用MLLMs学习可迁移的多模态表示，解决了CLIP的局限性，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP框架在多模态表示学习中存在文本截断、孤立编码和组合性不足等问题，而MLLMs的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: UniME采用两阶段方法：1) 从LLM教师模型进行知识蒸馏；2) 引入硬负样本增强的指令调优。

Result: 在MMEB基准和多种检索任务中，UniME表现一致优于现有方法，具有更强的判别和组合能力。

Conclusion: UniME通过两阶段设计显著提升了多模态表示学习的性能，为下游任务提供了更强大的嵌入能力。

Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework has become a
widely used approach for multimodal representation learning, particularly in
image-text retrieval and clustering. However, its efficacy is constrained by
three key limitations: (1) text token truncation, (2) isolated image-text
encoding, and (3) deficient compositionality due to bag-of-words behavior.
While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant advances in generalized vision-language understanding, their
potential for learning transferable multimodal representations remains
underexplored.In this work, we present UniME (Universal Multimodal Embedding),
a novel two-stage framework that leverages MLLMs to learn discriminative
representations for diverse downstream tasks. In the first stage, we perform
textual discriminative knowledge distillation from a powerful LLM-based teacher
model to enhance the embedding capability of the MLLM\'s language component. In
the second stage, we introduce hard negative enhanced instruction tuning to
further advance discriminative representation learning. Specifically, we
initially mitigate false negative contamination and then sample multiple hard
negatives per instance within each batch, forcing the model to focus on
challenging samples. This approach not only improves discriminative power but
also enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks,
including short and long caption retrieval and compositional retrieval. Results
demonstrate that UniME achieves consistent performance improvement across all
tasks, exhibiting superior discriminative and compositional capabilities.

TLDR: POD是一个自改进框架，通过预测、优化和蒸馏的循环提升4D物体理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过长期观察预测物体3D状态的能力启发，现有系统依赖多视角观察或监督数据集训练。

Method: POD框架通过预测、优化和蒸馏的循环，利用多视角扫描和单目视频迭代训练神经网络。

Result: POD在真实和合成物体上表现优于纯优化基线，性能随视频长度和迭代次数提升。

Conclusion: POD展示了自改进框架的潜力，能够通过增加观察和循环优化提升性能。

Abstract: Humans can resort to long-form inspection to build intuition on predicting
the 3D configurations of unseen objects. The more we observe the object motion,
the better we get at predicting its 3D state immediately. Existing systems
either optimize underlying representations from multi-view observations or
train a feed-forward predictor from supervised datasets. We introduce
Predict-Optimize-Distill (POD), a self-improving framework that interleaves
prediction and optimization in a mutually reinforcing cycle to achieve better
4D object understanding with increasing observation time. Given a multi-view
object scan and a long-form monocular video of human-object interaction, POD
iteratively trains a neural network to predict local part poses from RGB
frames, uses this predictor to initialize a global optimization which refines
output poses through inverse rendering, then finally distills the results of
optimization back into the model by generating synthetic self-labeled training
data from novel viewpoints. Each iteration improves both the predictive model
and the optimized motion trajectory, creating a virtuous cycle that bootstraps
its own training data to learn about the pose configurations of an object. We
also introduce a quasi-multiview mining strategy for reducing depth ambiguity
by leveraging long video. We evaluate POD on 14 real-world and 5 synthetic
objects with various joint types, including revolute and prismatic joints as
well as multi-body configurations where parts detach or reattach independently.
POD demonstrates significant improvement over a pure optimization baseline
which gets stuck in local minima, particularly for longer videos. We also find
that POD's performance improves with both video length and successive
iterations of the self-improving cycle, highlighting its ability to scale
performance with additional observations and looped refinement.

Motivation: 长上下文LMMs因计算成本高，模型规模和性能受限，探索无需长上下文处理的方法。

Method: 独立评分选择关键帧（Top-K），基于所选帧生成输出，无需微调现有LMMs。

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision和InternVL2上，FRAG显著提升性能，视频任务提升3.7%-5.8%，文档任务提升20%。

Conclusion: FRAG简单有效，适用于长视频和文档，性能优于专用长上下文LMMs。

Abstract: There has been impressive progress in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Recent
works extend these models to long inputs, including multi-page documents and
long videos. However, the model size and performance of these long context
models are still limited due to the computational cost in both training and
inference. In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction and process long
inputs without long context LMMs. We propose Frame Selection Augmented
Generation (FRAG), where the model first selects relevant frames within the
input, and then only generates the final outputs based on the selected frames.
The core of the selection process is done by scoring each frame independently,
which does not require long context processing. The frames with the highest
scores are then selected by a simple Top-K selection. We show that this
frustratingly simple framework is applicable to both long videos and multi-page
documents using existing LMMs without any fine-tuning. We consider two models,
LLaVA-OneVision and InternVL2, in our experiments and show that FRAG
consistently improves the performance and achieves state-of-the-art
performances for both long video and long document understanding. For videos,
FRAG substantially improves InternVL2-76B by 5.8% on MLVU and 3.7% on
Video-MME. For documents, FRAG achieves over 20% improvements on MP-DocVQA
compared with recent LMMs specialized in long document understanding. Code is

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注减少估计误差，但忽视了鲁棒性和安全性，导致系统易受对抗攻击。

Method: 提出TBA框架，结合DHNG（双异质噪声生成器）和自定义对抗损失函数，优化噪声以增强攻击效果。

Result: 实验显示TBA显著提升了对抗攻击效果，估计误差增加41.0%，平均提升约17.0%。

Conclusion: 当前EHPS模型存在严重安全漏洞，需加强防御措施。

Abstract: Expressive human pose and shape estimation (EHPS) is crucial for digital
human generation, especially in applications like live streaming. While
existing research primarily focuses on reducing estimation errors, it largely
neglects robustness and security aspects, leaving these systems vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. To address this significant challenge, we propose the
\textbf{Tangible Attack (TBA)}, a novel framework designed to generate
adversarial examples capable of effectively compromising any digital human
generation model. Our approach introduces a \textbf{Dual Heterogeneous Noise
Generator (DHNG)}, which leverages Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and
ControlNet to produce diverse, targeted noise tailored to the original image
features. Additionally, we design a custom \textbf{adversarial loss function}
to optimize the noise, ensuring both high controllability and potent
disruption. By iteratively refining the adversarial sample through
multi-gradient signals from both the noise and the state-of-the-art EHPS model,
TBA substantially improves the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate TBA's superiority, achieving a remarkable 41.0\%
increase in estimation error, with an average improvement of approximately
17.0\%. These findings expose significant security vulnerabilities in current
EHPS models and highlight the need for stronger defenses in digital human
generation systems.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将小损失样本视为正确标签，但部分正确标签样本因难学而在早期训练中表现出高损失，导致样本选择时精度与召回率难以平衡。

Method: 通过跟踪模型预测置信度间隙趋势（使用Mann-Kendall Test评估），区分正确标签样本与噪声样本，并作为即插即用模块集成到现有方法中。

Result: 在多个标准基准和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法提升了现有噪声标签学习方法的性能。

Conclusion: 通过置信度趋势分析，有效解决了样本选择中的精度-召回率权衡问题，为噪声标签学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a novel sample selection method for image classification in the
presence of noisy labels. Existing methods typically consider small-loss
samples as correctly labeled. However, some correctly labeled samples are
inherently difficult for the model to learn and can exhibit high loss similar
to mislabeled samples in the early stages of training. Consequently, setting a
threshold on per-sample loss to select correct labels results in a trade-off
between precision and recall in sample selection: a lower threshold may miss
many correctly labeled hard-to-learn samples (low recall), while a higher
threshold may include many mislabeled samples (low precision). To address this
issue, our goal is to accurately distinguish correctly labeled yet
hard-to-learn samples from mislabeled ones, thus alleviating the trade-off
dilemma. We achieve this by considering the trends in model prediction
confidence rather than relying solely on loss values. Empirical observations
show that only for correctly labeled samples, the model's prediction confidence
for the annotated labels typically increases faster than for any other classes.
Based on this insight, we propose tracking the confidence gaps between the
annotated labels and other classes during training and evaluating their trends
using the Mann-Kendall Test. A sample is considered potentially correctly
labeled if all its confidence gaps tend to increase. Our method functions as a
plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing sample
selection techniques. Experiments on several standard benchmarks and real-world
datasets demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing
methods for learning with noisy labels.

Motivation: 现有评估方法无法全面评估文本对齐和主题一致性，或成本高昂，因此需要一种更可靠且经济的解决方案。

Method: 利用视频推理基准和图像扰动构建大规模数据集，训练RefVNLI指标，同时评估文本对齐和主题一致性。

Result: RefVNLI在多个基准测试中表现优异，文本对齐和主题一致性分别提升6.4分和8.5分，且与人类偏好一致性达87%。

Conclusion: RefVNLI是一种高效且准确的评估工具，适用于主题驱动的文本到图像生成任务。

Abstract: Subject-driven text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to produce images that
align with a given textual description, while preserving the visual identity
from a referenced subject image. Despite its broad downstream applicability --
ranging from enhanced personalization in image generation to consistent
character representation in video rendering -- progress in this field is
limited by the lack of reliable automatic evaluation. Existing methods either
assess only one aspect of the task (i.e., textual alignment or subject
preservation), misalign with human judgments, or rely on costly API-based
evaluation. To address this, we introduce RefVNLI, a cost-effective metric that
evaluates both textual alignment and subject preservation in a single
prediction. Trained on a large-scale dataset derived from video-reasoning
benchmarks and image perturbations, RefVNLI outperforms or matches existing
baselines across multiple benchmarks and subject categories (e.g.,
\emph{Animal}, \emph{Object}), achieving up to 6.4-point gains in textual
alignment and 8.5-point gains in subject consistency. It also excels with
lesser-known concepts, aligning with human preferences at over 87\% accuracy.

Result: 在Prostate数据集上首次达到Dice系数90%，超过之前SOTA的88.61%。

Conclusion: Mamba-Sea是首个探索Mamba在医学图像分割中泛化能力的工作，展示了其在域偏移问题中的强大鲁棒性和潜力。

Abstract: To segment medical images with distribution shifts, domain generalization
(DG) has emerged as a promising setting to train models on source domains that
can generalize to unseen target domains. Existing DG methods are mainly based
on CNN or ViT architectures. Recently, advanced state space models, represented
by Mamba, have shown promising results in various supervised medical image
segmentation. The success of Mamba is primarily owing to its ability to capture
long-range dependencies while keeping linear complexity with input sequence
length, making it a promising alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Inspired by the
success, in the paper, we explore the potential of the Mamba architecture to
address distribution shifts in DG for medical image segmentation. Specifically,
we propose a novel Mamba-based framework, Mamba-Sea, incorporating
global-to-local sequence augmentation to improve the model's generalizability
under domain shift issues. Our Mamba-Sea introduces a global augmentation
mechanism designed to simulate potential variations in appearance across
different sites, aiming to suppress the model's learning of domain-specific
information. At the local level, we propose a sequence-wise augmentation along
input sequences, which perturbs the style of tokens within random continuous
sub-sequences by modeling and resampling style statistics associated with
domain shifts. To our best knowledge, Mamba-Sea is the first work to explore
the generalization of Mamba for medical image segmentation, providing an
advanced and promising Mamba-based architecture with strong robustness to
domain shifts. Remarkably, our proposed method is the first to surpass a Dice
coefficient of 90% on the Prostate dataset, which exceeds previous SOTA of
88.61%. The code is available at https://github.com/orange-czh/Mamba-Sea.

Method: 提出TableCenterNet，将表格空间和逻辑结构的预测统一为并行回归任务，通过共享特征提取层和任务特定解码的协同架构学习空间-逻辑位置映射规律。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，尤其在TableGraph-24k数据集上达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: TableCenterNet易于训练且推理速度快，能有效解析多样化场景中的表格结构。

Abstract: Table structure recognition aims to parse tables in unstructured data into
machine-understandable formats. Recent methods address this problem through a
two-stage process or optimized one-stage approaches. However, these methods
either require multiple networks to be serially trained and perform more
time-consuming sequential decoding, or rely on complex post-processing
algorithms to parse the logical structure of tables. They struggle to balance
cross-scenario adaptability, robustness, and computational efficiency. In this
paper, we propose a one-stage end-to-end table structure parsing network called
TableCenterNet. This network unifies the prediction of table spatial and
logical structure into a parallel regression task for the first time, and
implicitly learns the spatial-logical location mapping laws of cells through a
synergistic architecture of shared feature extraction layers and task-specific
decoding. Compared with two-stage methods, our method is easier to train and
faster to infer. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that TableCenterNet can
effectively parse table structures in diverse scenarios and achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the TableGraph-24k dataset. Code is available

Conclusion: 提出的方法在小样本学习中表现优异，能够生成更精确和连贯的图像修复结果。

Abstract: Image inpainting is a technique used to restore missing or damaged regions of
an image. Traditional methods primarily utilize information from adjacent
pixels for reconstructing missing areas, while they struggle to preserve
complex details and structures. Simultaneously, models based on deep learning
necessitate substantial amounts of training data. To address this challenge, an
encoding strategy-inspired diffusion model with few-shot learning for color
image inpainting is proposed in this paper. The main idea of this novel
encoding strategy is the deployment of a "virtual mask" to construct
high-dimensional objects through mutual perturbations between channels. This
approach enables the diffusion model to capture diverse image representations
and detailed features from limited training samples. Moreover, the encoding
strategy leverages redundancy between channels, integrates with low-rank
methods during iterative inpainting, and incorporates the diffusion model to
achieve accurate information output. Experimental results indicate that our
method exceeds current techniques in quantitative metrics, and the
reconstructed images quality has been improved in aspects of texture and
structural integrity, leading to more precise and coherent results.

Abstract: The recent global spread of monkeypox, particularly in regions where it has
not historically been prevalent, has raised significant public health concerns.
Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective disease management and
control. In response, this study proposes a novel deep learning-based framework
for the automated detection of monkeypox from skin lesion images, leveraging
the power of transfer learning, dimensionality reduction, and advanced machine
learning techniques. We utilize the newly developed Monkeypox Skin Lesion
Dataset (MSLD), which includes images of monkeypox, chickenpox, and measles, to
train and evaluate our models. The proposed framework employs the Xception
architecture for deep feature extraction, followed by Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and the Natural Gradient Boosting
(NGBoost) algorithm for classification. To optimize the model's performance and
generalization, we introduce the African Vultures Optimization Algorithm (AVOA)
for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring efficient exploration of the parameter
space. Our results demonstrate that the proposed AVOA-NGBoost model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an accuracy of 97.53%, F1-score of 97.72%
and an AUC of 97.47%. Additionally, we enhance model interpretability using
Grad-CAM and LIME techniques, providing insights into the decision-making
process and highlighting key features influencing classification. This
framework offers a highly precise and efficient diagnostic tool, potentially

Motivation: 解决现有方法在渲染速度和细节表现上的不足，提供一种高效且高质量的辐射场渲染方案。

Method: 采用双尺度表示（surfels和高斯分布），分两阶段渲染（先rasterize surfels，再splat高斯分布），并通过粗到细的优化过程捕捉场景细节。

Result: GESs 实现了超快速的高保真渲染，避免了视角变化时的伪影，并支持多种扩展（如抗锯齿、加速渲染等）。

Conclusion: GESs 是一种高效的辐射场渲染表示方法，在速度和保真度上优于现有技术。

Abstract: We introduce Gaussian-enhanced Surfels (GESs), a bi-scale representation for
radiance field rendering, wherein a set of 2D opaque surfels with
view-dependent colors represent the coarse-scale geometry and appearance of
scenes, and a few 3D Gaussians surrounding the surfels supplement fine-scale
appearance details. The rendering with GESs consists of two passes -- surfels
are first rasterized through a standard graphics pipeline to produce depth and
color maps, and then Gaussians are splatted with depth testing and color
accumulation on each pixel order independently. The optimization of GESs from
multi-view images is performed through an elaborate coarse-to-fine procedure,
faithfully capturing rich scene appearance. The entirely sorting-free rendering
of GESs not only achieves very fast rates, but also produces view-consistent
images, successfully avoiding popping artifacts under view changes. The basic
GES representation can be easily extended to achieve anti-aliasing in rendering
(Mip-GES), boosted rendering speeds (Speedy-GES) and compact storage
(Compact-GES), and reconstruct better scene geometries by replacing 3D
Gaussians with 2D Gaussians (2D-GES). Experimental results show that GESs
advance the state-of-the-arts as a compelling representation for ultra-fast
high-fidelity radiance field rendering.

Models (LLMs), KB-VQA systems have also undergone a notable transformation,
where LLMs serve as powerful knowledge repositories, retrieval-augmented
generators and strong reasoners. Despite substantial progress, no comprehensive
survey currently exists that systematically organizes and reviews the existing
KB-VQA methods. This survey aims to fill this gap by establishing a structured
taxonomy of KB-VQA approaches, and categorizing the systems into main stages:
knowledge representation, knowledge retrieval, and knowledge reasoning. By
exploring various knowledge integration techniques and identifying persistent
challenges, this work also outlines promising future research directions,
providing a foundation for advancing KB-VQA models and their applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感技术在城市复杂环境中缺乏精度，而街景图像能提供地面细节，但现有方法依赖有监督分类，面临标注数据稀缺和泛化困难的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法基于地理空间数据的空间一致性，适用于街景图像可用的多种场景，为无监督土地利用制图提供了灵活解决方案。

Abstract: Urban land use classification and mapping are critical for urban planning,
resource management, and environmental monitoring. Existing remote sensing
techniques often lack precision in complex urban environments due to the
absence of ground-level details. Unlike aerial perspectives, street view images
provide a ground-level view that captures more human and social activities
relevant to land use in complex urban scenes. Existing street view-based
methods primarily rely on supervised classification, which is challenged by the
scarcity of high-quality labeled data and the difficulty of generalizing across
diverse urban landscapes. This study introduces an unsupervised contrastive
clustering model for street view images with a built-in geographical prior, to
enhance clustering performance. When combined with a simple visual assignment
of the clusters, our approach offers a flexible and customizable solution to
land use mapping, tailored to the specific needs of urban planners. We
experimentally show that our method can generate land use maps from geotagged
street view image datasets of two cities. As our methodology relies on the
universal spatial coherence of geospatial data ("Tobler's law"), it can be
adapted to various settings where street view images are available, to enable
scalable, unsupervised land use mapping and updating. The code will be
available at https://github.com/lin102/CCGP.

TLDR: 提出了一种自监督单目深度估计网络，针对内窥镜场景，通过遮挡感知框架和语义分割提升深度估计质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态光照和遮挡下表现不佳，导致深度估计不可靠。

Method: 引入遮挡掩码进行数据增强，并结合非负矩阵分解的语义分割生成伪标签。

Result: 在SCARED数据集上达到SOTA性能，并在Endo-SLAM和SERV-CT数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对内窥镜场景中的光照变化和遮挡问题，提升深度估计的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose a self-supervised monocular depth estimation network tailored for
endoscopic scenes, aiming to infer depth within the gastrointestinal tract from
monocular images. Existing methods, though accurate, typically assume
consistent illumination, which is often violated due to dynamic lighting and
occlusions caused by GI motility. These variations lead to incorrect geometric
interpretations and unreliable self-supervised signals, degrading depth
reconstruction quality. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware
self-supervised framework. First, we incorporate an occlusion mask for data
augmentation, generating pseudo-labels by simulating viewpoint-dependent
occlusion scenarios. This enhances the model's ability to learn robust depth
features under partial visibility. Second, we leverage semantic segmentation
guided by non-negative matrix factorization, clustering convolutional
activations to generate pseudo-labels in texture-deprived regions, thereby
improving segmentation accuracy and mitigating information loss from lighting
changes. Experimental results on the SCARED dataset show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised depth estimation.
Additionally, evaluations on the Endo-SLAM and SERV-CT datasets demonstrate
strong generalization across diverse endoscopic environments.

Abstract: An intriguing phenomenon about JPEG compression has been observed since two
decades ago- after repeating JPEG compression and decompression, it leads to a
stable image that does not change anymore, which is a fixed point. In this
work, we prove the existence of fixed points in the essential JPEG procedures.
We analyze JPEG compression and decompression processes, revealing the
existence of fixed points that can be reached within a few iterations. These
fixed points are diverse and preserve the image's visual quality, ensuring
minimal distortion. This result is used to develop a method to create a
tamper-evident image from the original authentic image, which can expose
tampering operations by showing deviations from the fixed point image.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D跟踪器效率低且仅关注单层特征，导致融合鲁棒性差且速度慢，无法满足实际应用需求。

Method: HMAD利用RGB和深度模态的独特特征表示优势，采用分层方法进行特征分布与融合。

Result: 在多个RGB-D数据集上，HMAD实现了最先进的性能，并在实时场景中有效应对多种跟踪挑战。

Conclusion: HMAD通过分层模态聚合与分布显著提升了RGB-D跟踪的鲁棒性和实时性。

Abstract: The integration of dual-modal features has been pivotal in advancing
RGB-Depth (RGB-D) tracking. However, current trackers are less efficient and
focus solely on single-level features, resulting in weaker robustness in fusion
and slower speeds that fail to meet the demands of real-world applications. In
this paper, we introduce a novel network, denoted as HMAD (Hierarchical
Modality Aggregation and Distribution), which addresses these challenges. HMAD
leverages the distinct feature representation strengths of RGB and depth
modalities, giving prominence to a hierarchical approach for feature
distribution and fusion, thereby enhancing the robustness of RGB-D tracking.
Experimental results on various RGB-D datasets demonstrate that HMAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, real-world experiments further validate
HMAD's capacity to effectively handle a spectrum of tracking challenges in
real-time scenarios.

Motivation: 解决在训练时仅有限类别边界框信息的情况下，如何在推理时定位所有对象（包括未见类别）的问题。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，该方法显著优于之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用背景信息，该方法有效提升了开放世界对象定位的性能。

Abstract: Our work addresses the problem of learning to localize objects in an
open-world setting, i.e., given the bounding box information of a limited
number of object classes during training, the goal is to localize all objects,
belonging to both the training and unseen classes in an image, during
inference. Towards this end, recent work in this area has focused on improving
the characterization of objects either explicitly by proposing new objective
functions (localization quality) or implicitly using object-centric
auxiliary-information, such as depth information, pixel/region affinity map
etc. In this work, we address this problem by incorporating background
information to guide the learning of the notion of objectness. Specifically, we
propose a novel framework to discover background regions in an image and train
an object proposal network to not detect any objects in these regions. We
formulate the background discovery task as that of identifying image regions
that are not discriminative, i.e., those that are redundant and constitute low
information content. We conduct experiments on standard benchmarks to showcase
the effectiveness of our proposed approach and observe significant improvements
over the previous state-of-the-art approaches for this task.

Motivation: 视觉定位算法是自动驾驶和增强现实等应用的核心组件，但现有基于结构的方法灵活性不足，而无结构方法的研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过实验比较多种无结构方法，包括基于经典绝对或半广义相对姿态估计的方法与基于姿态回归的方法。

Conclusion: 无结构方法在灵活性上具有优势，但需在精度上进一步改进，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Visual localization algorithms, i.e., methods that estimate the camera pose
of a query image in a known scene, are core components of many applications,
including self-driving cars and augmented / mixed reality systems.
State-of-the-art visual localization algorithms are structure-based, i.e., they
store a 3D model of the scene and use 2D-3D correspondences between the query
image and 3D points in the model for camera pose estimation. While such
approaches are highly accurate, they are also rather inflexible when it comes
to adjusting the underlying 3D model after changes in the scene. Structureless
localization approaches represent the scene as a database of images with known
poses and thus offer a much more flexible representation that can be easily
updated by adding or removing images. Although there is a large amount of
literature on structure-based approaches, there is significantly less work on
structureless methods. Hence, this paper is dedicated to providing the, to the
best of our knowledge, first comprehensive discussion and comparison of
structureless methods. Extensive experiments show that approaches that use a
higher degree of classical geometric reasoning generally achieve higher pose
accuracy. In particular, approaches based on classical absolute or
semi-generalized relative pose estimation outperform very recent methods based
on pose regression by a wide margin. Compared with state-of-the-art
structure-based approaches, the flexibility of structureless methods comes at
the cost of (slightly) lower pose accuracy, indicating an interesting direction
for future work.

TLDR: DiMeR是一种新型的双流解耦模型，用于稀疏视图网格重建，通过分离几何和纹理输入及框架，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB图像在几何重建中常导致训练目标冲突且缺乏清晰度，因此需要一种更有效的方法来优化重建过程。

Method: DiMeR将输入和框架解耦为几何和纹理两部分，几何分支使用法线图作为输入以减少复杂性，纹理分支使用RGB图像。同时改进了网格提取算法。

Result: DiMeR在稀疏视图重建、单图像到3D和文本到3D任务中表现优异，Chamfer Distance在GSO和OmniObject3D数据集上提升了30%以上。

Conclusion: DiMeR通过解耦几何和纹理，显著提升了3D重建的性能和效率。

Abstract: With the advent of large-scale 3D datasets, feed-forward 3D generative
models, such as the Large Reconstruction Model (LRM), have gained significant
attention and achieved remarkable success. However, we observe that RGB images
often lead to conflicting training objectives and lack the necessary clarity
for geometry reconstruction. In this paper, we revisit the inductive biases
associated with mesh reconstruction and introduce DiMeR, a novel disentangled
dual-stream feed-forward model for sparse-view mesh reconstruction. The key
idea is to disentangle both the input and framework into geometry and texture
parts, thereby reducing the training difficulty for each part according to the
Principle of Occam's Razor. Given that normal maps are strictly consistent with
geometry and accurately capture surface variations, we utilize normal maps as
exclusive input for the geometry branch to reduce the complexity between the
network's input and output. Moreover, we improve the mesh extraction algorithm
to introduce 3D ground truth supervision. As for texture branch, we use RGB
images as input to obtain the textured mesh. Overall, DiMeR demonstrates robust
capabilities across various tasks, including sparse-view reconstruction,
single-image-to-3D, and text-to-3D. Numerous experiments show that DiMeR
significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving over 30% improvement in
Chamfer Distance on the GSO and OmniObject3D dataset.

Method: 1. 创建PICO-db数据集，利用视觉基础模型和2次点击标注方法生成密集3D接触标签；2. 提出PICO-fit优化方法，通过接触信息拟合3D模型。

Result: PICO-fit能处理多种物体类别，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为自然场景下的HOI理解提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering 3D Human-Object Interaction (HOI) from single color images is
challenging due to depth ambiguities, occlusions, and the huge variation in
object shape and appearance. Thus, past work requires controlled settings such
as known object shapes and contacts, and tackles only limited object classes.
Instead, we need methods that generalize to natural images and novel object
classes. We tackle this in two main ways: (1) We collect PICO-db, a new dataset
of natural images uniquely paired with dense 3D contact on both body and object
meshes. To this end, we use images from the recent DAMON dataset that are
paired with contacts, but these contacts are only annotated on a canonical 3D
body. In contrast, we seek contact labels on both the body and the object. To
infer these given an image, we retrieve an appropriate 3D object mesh from a
database by leveraging vision foundation models. Then, we project DAMON's body
contact patches onto the object via a novel method needing only 2 clicks per
patch. This minimal human input establishes rich contact correspondences
between bodies and objects. (2) We exploit our new dataset of contact
correspondences in a novel render-and-compare fitting method, called PICO-fit,
to recover 3D body and object meshes in interaction. PICO-fit infers contact
for the SMPL-X body, retrieves a likely 3D object mesh and contact from PICO-db
for that object, and uses the contact to iteratively fit the 3D body and object
meshes to image evidence via optimization. Uniquely, PICO-fit works well for
many object categories that no existing method can tackle. This is crucial to
enable HOI understanding to scale in the wild. Our data and code are available
at https://pico.is.tue.mpg.de.

Motivation: 理解真实环境中人类活动的复杂性，并为人工智能提供高质量的多模态数据。

Method: 构建包含20种传感器的数据集，标注分为三个层次（L1独立任务、L2共享动作、L3详细步骤），并进行多模态传感器融合实验。

Result: 实验验证了DARai在识别、定位和预测任务中的有效性，并揭示了单个传感器的局限性。

Conclusion: DARai为人类活动研究提供了丰富的数据资源，支持多模态和分层任务的研究。

Abstract: Daily Activity Recordings for Artificial Intelligence (DARai, pronounced
"Dahr-ree") is a multimodal, hierarchically annotated dataset constructed to
understand human activities in real-world settings. DARai consists of
continuous scripted and unscripted recordings of 50 participants in 10
different environments, totaling over 200 hours of data from 20 sensors
including multiple camera views, depth and radar sensors, wearable inertial
measurement units (IMUs), electromyography (EMG), insole pressure sensors,
biomonitor sensors, and gaze tracker.
  To capture the complexity in human activities, DARai is annotated at three
levels of hierarchy: (i) high-level activities (L1) that are independent tasks,
(ii) lower-level actions (L2) that are patterns shared between activities, and
(iii) fine-grained procedures (L3) that detail the exact execution steps for
actions. The dataset annotations and recordings are designed so that 22.7% of
L2 actions are shared between L1 activities and 14.2% of L3 procedures are
shared between L2 actions. The overlap and unscripted nature of DARai allows
counterfactual activities in the dataset.
  Experiments with various machine learning models showcase the value of DARai
in uncovering important challenges in human-centered applications.
Specifically, we conduct unimodal and multimodal sensor fusion experiments for
recognition, temporal localization, and future action anticipation across all
hierarchical annotation levels. To highlight the limitations of individual
sensors, we also conduct domain-variant experiments that are enabled by DARai's
multi-sensor and counterfactual activity design setup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: StyleGAN在生成高真实性人脸方面表现出色，但其低维潜在空间的强纠缠性导致特征控制困难。现有方法在W潜在空间中调制采样，但仍受限于表达能力。

Method: 引入生成场理论解释StyleGAN的分层特征合成，并提出基于通道风格潜在空间S的新图像编辑流程。

Result: 通过利用CNN的内在结构特征，实现了在合成时对特征合成的解耦控制。

Conclusion: 生成场理论和通道风格潜在空间S为StyleGAN提供了更灵活的特征控制方法。

Abstract: StyleGAN has demonstrated the ability of GANs to synthesize highly-realistic
faces of imaginary people from random noise. One limitation of GAN-based image
generation is the difficulty of controlling the features of the generated
image, due to the strong entanglement of the low-dimensional latent space.
Previous work that aimed to control StyleGAN with image or text prompts
modulated sampling in W latent space, which is more expressive than Z latent
space. However, W space still has restricted expressivity since it does not
control the feature synthesis directly; also the feature embedding in W space
requires a pre-training process to reconstruct the style signal, limiting its
application. This paper introduces the concept of "generative fields" to
explain the hierarchical feature synthesis in StyleGAN, inspired by the
receptive fields of convolution neural networks (CNNs). Additionally, we
propose a new image editing pipeline for StyleGAN using generative field theory
and the channel-wise style latent space S, utilizing the intrinsic structural
feature of CNNs to achieve disentangled control of feature synthesis at
synthesis time.

Conclusion: DPMambaIR展示了作为统一All-in-One图像修复解决方案的潜力和优越性。

Abstract: All-in-One image restoration aims to address multiple image degradation
problems using a single model, significantly reducing training costs and
deployment complexity compared to traditional methods that design dedicated
models for each degradation type. Existing approaches typically rely on
Degradation-specific models or coarse-grained degradation prompts to guide
image restoration. However, they lack fine-grained modeling of degradation
information and face limitations in balancing multi-task conflicts. To overcome
these limitations, we propose DPMambaIR, a novel All-in-One image restoration
framework. By integrating a Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM)
and a High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB), DPMambaIR enables fine-grained
modeling of complex degradation information and efficient global integration,
while mitigating the loss of high-frequency details caused by task competition.
Specifically, the DP-SSM utilizes a pre-trained degradation extractor to
capture fine-grained degradation features and dynamically incorporates them
into the state space modeling process, enhancing the model's adaptability to
diverse degradation types. Concurrently, the HEB supplements high-frequency
information, effectively addressing the loss of critical details, such as edges
and textures, in multi-task image restoration scenarios. Extensive experiments
on a mixed dataset containing seven degradation types show that DPMambaIR
achieves the best performance, with 27.69dB and 0.893 in PSNR and SSIM,
respectively. These results highlight the potential and superiority of
DPMambaIR as a unified solution for All-in-One image restoration.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) on smartglasses has various use cases,
including health/fitness tracking and input for context-aware AI assistants.
However, current approaches for egocentric activity recognition suffer from low
performance or are resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce a resource
(memory, compute, power, sample) efficient machine learning algorithm,
EgoCHARM, for recognizing both high level and low level activities using a
single egocentric (head-mounted) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Our
hierarchical algorithm employs a semi-supervised learning strategy, requiring
primarily high level activity labels for training, to learn generalizable low
level motion embeddings that can be effectively utilized for low level activity
recognition. We evaluate our method on 9 high level and 3 low level activities
achieving 0.826 and 0.855 F1 scores on high level and low level activity
recognition respectively, with just 63k high level and 22k low level model
parameters, allowing the low level encoder to be deployed directly on current
IMU chips with compute. Lastly, we present results and insights from a
sensitivity analysis and highlight the opportunities and limitations of
activity recognition using egocentric IMUs.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid
development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as
GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing
capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a
vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant
advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large
gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in
this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called
Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source
models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the
Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing

diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we
build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For
evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world
user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that
Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin
and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making
significant contributions to the field of image editing.

TLDR: DynPose-100K是一个大规模动态互联网视频数据集，标注了相机姿态，解决了现有方法在动态视频姿态估计中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态互联网视频的相机姿态标注对视频生成和模拟等领域至关重要，但现有数据集难以满足需求。

Method: 通过结合任务特定和通用模型筛选视频，并利用点跟踪、动态掩码和运动结构重建技术进行姿态估计。

Result: DynPose-100K数据集规模大且多样，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该数据集为下游应用提供了新的研究机会。

Abstract: Annotating camera poses on dynamic Internet videos at scale is critical for
advancing fields like realistic video generation and simulation. However,
collecting such a dataset is difficult, as most Internet videos are unsuitable
for pose estimation. Furthermore, annotating dynamic Internet videos present
significant challenges even for state-of-theart methods. In this paper, we
introduce DynPose-100K, a large-scale dataset of dynamic Internet videos
annotated with camera poses. Our collection pipeline addresses filtering using
a carefully combined set of task-specific and generalist models. For pose
estimation, we combine the latest techniques of point tracking, dynamic
masking, and structure-from-motion to achieve improvements over the
state-of-the-art approaches. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that
DynPose-100K is both large-scale and diverse across several key attributes,
opening up avenues for advancements in various downstream applications.

TLDR: Token-Shuffle方法通过减少Transformer中的图像令牌数量，提升了自回归模型在高分辨率图像合成中的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像合成中因需要大量图像令牌而效率低下，限制了分辨率和性能。Token-Shuffle旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Token-Shuffle和Token-Unshuffle操作，利用视觉词汇的维度冗余减少令牌数量，同时保持空间排列。

Result: 在2048x2048分辨率下实现高效图像合成，2.7B模型在GenAI-benchmark中表现优于其他AR和扩散模型。

Conclusion: Token-Shuffle为MLLMs中的高效高分辨率图像生成提供了基础设计。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, long dominant in language generation, are
increasingly applied to image synthesis but are often considered less
competitive than Diffusion-based models. A primary limitation is the
substantial number of image tokens required for AR models, which constrains
both training and inference efficiency, as well as image resolution. To address
this, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the
number of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional
redundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
where low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to
high-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key
operations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel
dimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which
untangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial
arrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy
requires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support
extremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction
way while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we
push the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048
with gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model
achieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen
by 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human
evaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of
text-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance. We hope that Token-Shuffle
can serve as a foundational design for efficient high-resolution image
generation within MLLMs.

Motivation: 解决在室外场景规模下直接训练扩散模型生成精细细节的挑战，填补局部扩散与对象级别扩散之间的空白。

Method: 提出LiDPM方法，通过选择合适的起始点，直接使用vanilla DDPM进行场景完成，无需局部扩散近似。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，LiDPM方法在场景完成任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，vanilla DDPM在场景级别完成中是可行的，且LiDPM方法效果更优。

Abstract: Training diffusion models that work directly on lidar points at the scale of
outdoor scenes is challenging due to the difficulty of generating fine-grained
details from white noise over a broad field of view. The latest works
addressing scene completion with diffusion models tackle this problem by
reformulating the original DDPM as a local diffusion process. It contrasts with
the common practice of operating at the level of objects, where vanilla DDPMs
are currently used. In this work, we close the gap between these two lines of
work. We identify approximations in the local diffusion formulation, show that
they are not required to operate at the scene level, and that a vanilla DDPM
with a well-chosen starting point is enough for completion. Finally, we
demonstrate that our method, LiDPM, leads to better results in scene completion
on SemanticKITTI. The project page is https://astra-vision.github.io/LiDPM .

reductions in energy consumption, VM migrations, SLA violation rates, and

among these key performance indicators, confirming the effectiveness of our

Motivation: 现有QAE方法仅适用于单变量时间序列异常检测，无法满足企业级多变量时间序列的需求。

Method: 开发并验证了一种专为多变量时间序列设计的QAE框架。

Result: 实验表明，该QAE性能与传统神经网络自编码器相当，且参数更少。

Conclusion: 提出的QAE是企业级半监督异常检测的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) defines the task of identifying observations or events
that deviate from typical - or normal - patterns, a critical capability in IT
security for recognizing incidents such as system misconfigurations, malware
infections, or cyberattacks. In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud
systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate
time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of
quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional
latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One
approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method
with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior
applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data,
limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we
introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards
enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the
architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with
neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters.
We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and
show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for
semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.

Result: 针对线性、对数等不同计算能力，量化了T-PRS所需的相干性、纠缠性和魔法性资源。

Conclusion: T-PRS为计算能力受限的观察者提供了高效资源替代方案，并揭示了资源需求与计算能力的关系。

Abstract: A pseudorandom quantum state (PRS) is an ensemble of quantum states
indistinguishable from Haar-random states to observers with efficient quantum
computers. It allows one to substitute the costly Haar-random state with
efficiently preparable PRS as a resource for cryptographic protocols, while
also finding applications in quantum learning theory, black hole physics,
many-body thermalization, quantum foundations, and quantum chaos. All existing
constructions of PRS equate the notion of efficiency to quantum computers which
runtime is bounded by a polynomial in its input size. In this work, we relax
the notion of efficiency for PRS with respect to observers with near-term
quantum computers implementing algorithms with runtime that scales slower than
polynomial-time. We introduce the $\mathbf{T}$-PRS which is indistinguishable
to quantum algorithms with runtime $\mathbf{T}(n)$ that grows slower than
polynomials in the input size $n$. We give a set of reasonable conditions that
a $\mathbf{T}$-PRS must satisfy and give two constructions by using
quantum-secure pseudorandom functions and pseudorandom functions. For
$\mathbf{T}(n)$ being linearithmic, linear, polylogarithmic, and logarithmic
function, we characterize the amount of quantum resources a $\mathbf{T}$-PRS
must possess, particularly on its coherence, entanglement, and magic. Our
quantum resource characterization applies generally to any two state ensembles
that are indistinguishable to observers with computational power
$\mathbf{T}(n)$, giving a general necessary condition of whether a low-resource
ensemble can mimic a high-resource ensemble, forming a
$\mathbf{T}$-pseudoresource pair. We demonstate how the necessary amount of
resource decreases as the observer's computational power is more restricted,
giving a $\mathbf{T}$-pseudoresource pair with larger resource gap for more
computationally limited observers.

Method: 通过理论分析建立对抗训练量子分类器的泛化误差边界，并验证其在不同嵌入方式下的影响。

Result: 对抗训练的泛化误差随样本量增加而降低，高维输入下样本复杂度增加可忽略；量子嵌入的选择影响对抗攻击效果。

Conclusion: 对抗训练能有效提高量子分类器的鲁棒性，嵌入方式对结果有重要影响。

Abstract: Quantum classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate
their input classical or quantum data. A promising countermeasure is
adversarial training, where quantum classifiers are trained by using an
attack-aware, adversarial loss function. This work establishes novel bounds on
the generalization error of adversarially trained quantum classifiers when
tested in the presence of perturbation-constrained adversaries. The bounds
quantify the excess generalization error incurred to ensure robustness to
adversarial attacks as scaling with the training sample size $m$ as
$1/\sqrt{m}$, while yielding insights into the impact of the quantum embedding.
For quantum binary classifiers employing \textit{rotation embedding}, we find
that, in the presence of adversarial attacks on classical inputs $\mathbf{x}$,
the increase in sample complexity due to adversarial training over conventional
training vanishes in the limit of high dimensional inputs $\mathbf{x}$. In
contrast, when the adversary can directly attack the quantum state
$\rho(\mathbf{x})$ encoding the input $\mathbf{x}$, the excess generalization
error depends on the choice of embedding only through its Hilbert space
dimension. The results are also extended to multi-class classifiers. We
validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.

Conclusion: 论文强调需要重新思考如何验证和治理这些强大技术，以应对其内在的可解释性挑战。

Abstract: Deep Foundation Models (DFMs) offer unprecedented capabilities but their
increasing complexity presents profound challenges to understanding their
internal workings-a critical need for ensuring trust, safety, and
accountability. As we grapple with explaining these systems, a fundamental
question emerges: Are the difficulties we face merely temporary hurdles,
awaiting more sophisticated analytical techniques, or do they stem from
\emph{intrinsic barriers} deeply rooted in the nature of these large-scale
models themselves? This paper delves into this critical question by examining
the fundamental characteristics of DFMs and scrutinizing the limitations
encountered by current explainability methods when confronted with this
inherent challenge. We probe the feasibility of achieving satisfactory
explanations and consider the implications for how we must approach the
verification and governance of these powerful technologies.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important part of our everyday
lives, yet user requirements for designing AI-assisted systems in law
enforcement remain unclear. To address this gap, we conducted qualitative
research on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to
identify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and
understand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these
systems.
  Participants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of
processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime
detection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements
for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to
be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of
having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to
interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy.
To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users
need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and
government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and
monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the
system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed
they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the
system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the
system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature
of the law enforcement domain.

Conclusion: 结论指出需通过监管改革提升非峰值机组的市场响应能力，以释放其潜在灵活性。

Abstract: A key input to energy models are assumptions about the flexibility of power
generation units, i.e., how quickly and often they can start up. These
assumptions are usually calibrated on the technical characteristics of the
units, such as installed capacity or technology type. However, even if power
generation units technically can dispatch flexibly, service obligations and
market incentives may constrain their operation. Here, we cluster over 60% of
German national gas generation (generation units of 100 MWp or above) based on
their empirical flexibility. We process the hourly dispatch of sample units
between 2019 and 2023 using a novel deep learning approach, that transforms
time series into easy-to-cluster representations. We identify two clusters of
peaker units and two clusters of non-peaker units, whose different empirical
flexibility is quantified by cluster-level ramp rates. Non-peaker units, around
half of the sample, are empirically less flexible than peakers, and make up for
more than 83% of sample must-run generation. Regulatory changes addressing the
low market responsiveness of non-peakers are needed to unlock their
flexibility.

Conclusion: 该框架填补了法律概念分析与机器学习确定性需求之间的空白，为法律与技术结合提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Organizations developing machine learning-based (ML) technologies face the
complex challenge of achieving high predictive performance while respecting the
law. This intersection between ML and the law creates new complexities. As ML
model behavior is inferred from training data, legal obligations cannot be
operationalized in source code directly. Rather, legal obligations require
"indirect" operationalization. However, choosing context-appropriate
operationalizations presents two compounding challenges: (1) laws often permit
multiple valid operationalizations for a given legal obligation-each with
varying degrees of legal adequacy; and, (2) each operationalization creates
unpredictable trade-offs among the different legal obligations and with
predictive performance. Evaluating these trade-offs requires metrics (or
heuristics), which are in turn difficult to validate against legal obligations.
Current methodologies fail to fully address these interwoven challenges as they
either focus on legal compliance for traditional software or on ML model
development without adequately considering legal complexities. In response, we
introduce a five-stage interdisciplinary framework that integrates legal and
ML-technical analysis during ML model development. This framework facilitates
designing ML models in a legally aligned way and identifying high-performing
models that are legally justifiable. Legal reasoning guides choices for
operationalizations and evaluation metrics, while ML experts ensure technical
feasibility, performance optimization and an accurate interpretation of metric
values. This framework bridges the gap between more conceptual analysis of law
and ML models' need for deterministic specifications. We illustrate its
application using a case study in the context of anti-money laundering.

Result: MVS适用于高维数据，支持自动选择重要视图，并提供灵活的缺失数据处理选项。

Conclusion: R包`mvs`为多视图学习提供了高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: In biomedical science, a set of objects or persons can often be described by
multiple distinct sets of features obtained from different data sources or
modalities (called "multi-view data"). Classical machine learning methods
ignore the multi-view structure of such data, limiting model interpretability
and performance. The R package `mvs` provides methods that were designed
specifically for dealing with multi-view data, based on the multi-view stacking
(MVS) framework. MVS is a form of supervised (machine) learning used to train
multi-view classification or prediction models. MVS works by training a
learning algorithm on each view separately, estimating the predictive power of
each view-specific model through cross-validation, and then using another
learning algorithm to assign weights to the view-specific models based on their
estimated predictions. MVS is a form of ensemble learning, dividing the large
multi-view learning problem into smaller sub-problems. Most of these
sub-problems can be solved in parallel, making it computationally attractive.
Additionally, the number of features of the sub-problems is greatly reduced
compared with the full multi-view learning problem. This makes MVS especially
useful when the total number of features is larger than the number of
observations (i.e., high-dimensional data). MVS can still be applied even if
the sub-problems are themselves high-dimensional by adding suitable penalty
terms to the learning algorithms. Furthermore, MVS can be used to automatically
select the views which are most important for prediction. The R package `mvs`
makes fitting MVS models, including such penalty terms, easily and openly
accessible. `mvs` allows for the fitting of stacked models with any number of
levels, with different penalty terms, different outcome distributions, and
provides several options for missing data handling.

TLDR: 本文对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视听能力进行了多维度评估，发现其在零样本和小样本泛化能力上表现优异，但对视觉模态依赖性强，且易受对抗样本影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在多模态信息处理上取得了成功，但其视听能力在多样化场景（如分布偏移和对抗攻击）中缺乏全面评估。

Method: 通过四个关键维度（有效性、效率、泛化性和鲁棒性）对MLLMs的视听能力进行多面评估。

Result: MLLMs在零样本和小样本泛化能力上表现优异，但对视觉模态依赖性强，视觉输入受损时性能下降；相比传统模型，MLLMs对对抗样本更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了MLLMs的视听能力，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved great
success in processing and understanding information from diverse modalities
(e.g., text, audio, and visual signals). Despite their growing popularity,
there remains a lack of comprehensive evaluation measuring the audio-visual
capabilities of these models, especially in diverse scenarios (e.g.,
distribution shifts and adversarial attacks). In this paper, we present a
multifaceted evaluation of the audio-visual capability of MLLMs, focusing on
four key dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, generalizability, and
robustness. Through extensive experiments, we find that MLLMs exhibit strong
zero-shot and few-shot generalization abilities, enabling them to achieve great
performance with limited data. However, their success relies heavily on the
vision modality, which impairs performance when visual input is corrupted or
missing. Additionally, while MLLMs are susceptible to adversarial samples, they
demonstrate greater robustness compared to traditional models. The experimental
results and our findings provide insights into the audio-visual capabilities of
MLLMs, highlighting areas for improvement and offering guidance for future
research.

TLDR: AdjointDiffusion是一种物理引导的框架，将伴随灵敏度梯度融入扩散模型的采样过程，显著减少了仿真需求并提高了设计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统逆向设计方法中复杂的二值化和滤波步骤，以及深度学习策略中需要大量仿真的问题。

Method: 通过训练扩散网络生成二进制掩码，并在去噪步骤中注入基于物理的伴随梯度，引导生成高优值解。

Result: 在波导弯曲和CMOS图像传感器颜色路由器设计中，AdjointDiffusion在效率和可制造性上优于现有非线性优化器，且仿真需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: AdjointDiffusion为下一代光子器件设计提供了高效、仿真少且制造友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Designing free-form photonic devices is fundamentally challenging due to the
vast number of possible geometries and the complex requirements of fabrication
constraints. Traditional inverse-design approaches--whether driven by human
intuition, global optimization, or adjoint-based gradient methods--often
involve intricate binarization and filtering steps, while recent deep learning
strategies demand prohibitively large numbers of simulations (10^5 to 10^6). To
overcome these limitations, we present AdjointDiffusion, a physics-guided
framework that integrates adjoint sensitivity gradients into the sampling
process of diffusion models. AdjointDiffusion begins by training a diffusion
network on a synthetic, fabrication-aware dataset of binary masks. During
inference, we compute the adjoint gradient of a candidate structure and inject
this physics-based guidance at each denoising step, steering the generative
process toward high figure-of-merit (FoM) solutions without additional
post-processing. We demonstrate our method on two canonical photonic design
problems--a bent waveguide and a CMOS image sensor color router--and show that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers (such
as MMA and SLSQP) in both efficiency and manufacturability, while using orders
of magnitude fewer simulations (approximately 2 x 10^2) than pure deep learning
approaches (approximately 10^5 to 10^6). By eliminating complex binarization
schedules and minimizing simulation overhead, AdjointDiffusion offers a
streamlined, simulation-efficient, and fabrication-aware pipeline for
next-generation photonic device design. Our open-source implementation is
available at https://github.com/dongjin-seo2020/AdjointDiffusion.

Motivation: Transformer大模型在边缘设备上部署面临计算需求高、内存带宽受限和能耗问题，需优化解决方案。

Method: 采用激活感知权重量化（AWQ）和FPGA加速执行管道，结合CPU和FPGA的混合执行策略。

Result: 模型压缩率55.08%，输出速度5.1 tokens/s，优于基线2.8 tokens/s。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了边缘设备部署大模型的挑战，提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced AI
capabilities but pose considerable challenges for deployment on edge devices
due to high computational demands, memory bandwidth constraints, and energy
consumption. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting an efficient
framework for deploying the Qwen2.5-0.5B model on the Xilinx Kria KV260 edge
platform, a heterogeneous system integrating an ARM Cortex-A53 CPU with
reconfigurable FPGA logic. Leveraging Activation-aware Weight Quantization
(AWQ) with FPGA-accelerated execution pipelines, the proposed approach enhances
both model compression rate and system throughput. Additionally, we propose a
hybrid execution strategy that intelligently offloads compute-intensive
operations to the FPGA while utilizing the CPU for lighter tasks, effectively
balancing the computational workload and maximizing overall performance. Our
framework achieves a model compression rate of 55.08% compared to the original
model and produces output at a rate of 5.1 tokens per second, outperforming the
baseline performance of 2.8 tokens per second.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为L3的硬件-软件协同设计系统，通过整合DIMM-PIM和GPU设备，解决了大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理长文本序列时的内存瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在处理长文本序列时面临GPU内存容量和带宽的权衡问题，而现有的HBM加速和主机端DIMM卸载方法各有局限性。

Method: L3系统通过硬件重新设计、通信优化和自适应调度器，解决了DIMM-PIM中的数据布局和计算元素不匹配问题，并隐藏了数据传输开销。

Result: 实验表明，L3相比最先进的HBM-PIM解决方案实现了最高6.1倍的加速，并显著提高了批处理大小。

Conclusion: L3通过结合DIMM-PIM和GPU的优势，有效解决了LLM推理中的内存瓶颈问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly require processing long text
sequences, but GPU memory limitations force difficult trade-offs between memory
capacity and bandwidth. While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its
capacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves
capacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the
critical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention
(MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and
high bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this
operation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM)
architectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.
  Based on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software
co-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three
innovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and
computational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference
utilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data
transfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler
coordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices.
Evaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\times$ speedup
over state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch
sizes.

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种学习可验证的神经网络参数化收缩度量的方法，用于离散时间非线性动力系统，并通过验证工具验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂非线性系统的收缩度量识别缺乏可扩展工具，尤其是基于神经网络的控制器带来的非光滑性挑战。

Method: 提出新的充分条件，利用神经网络验证工具高效验证，并开发从数据中学习收缩度量的方法。

Result: 成功合成并验证了多种非线性系统的神经网络收缩度量。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂非线性系统的收缩度量提供了一种可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Contraction metrics are crucial in control theory because they provide a
powerful framework for analyzing stability, robustness, and convergence of
various dynamical systems. However, identifying these metrics for complex
nonlinear systems remains an open challenge due to the lack of scalable and
effective tools. This paper explores the approach of learning verifiable
contraction metrics parametrized as neural networks (NNs) for discrete-time
nonlinear dynamical systems. While prior works on formal verification of
contraction metrics for general nonlinear systems have focused on convex
optimization methods (e.g. linear matrix inequalities, etc) under the
assumption of continuously differentiable dynamics, the growing prevalence of
NN-based controllers, often utilizing ReLU activations, introduces challenges
due to the non-smooth nature of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. To bridge
this gap, we establish a new sufficient condition for establishing formal
neural contraction metrics for general discrete-time nonlinear systems assuming
only the continuity of the dynamics. We show that from a computational
perspective, our sufficient condition can be efficiently verified using the
state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN, which scales
up non-convex neural network verification via novel integration of symbolic
linear bound propagation and branch-and-bound. Built upon our analysis tool, we
further develop a learning method for synthesizing neural contraction metrics
from sampled data. Finally, our approach is validated through the successful
synthesis and verification of NN contraction metrics for various nonlinear
examples.

Abstract: In this study, we built an end-to-end tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
assessment pipeline within QuPath, demonstrating the potential of easily
accessible tools to perform complex tasks in a fully automatic fashion. First,
we trained a pixel classifier to segment tumor, tumor-associated stroma, and
other tissue compartments in breast cancer H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSI)
to isolate tumor-associated stroma for subsequent analysis. Next, we applied a
pre-trained StarDist deep learning model in QuPath for cell detection and used
the extracted cell features to train a binary classifier distinguishing TILs
from other cells. To evaluate our TILs assessment pipeline, we calculated the
TIL density in each WSI and categorized them as low, medium, or high TIL
levels. Our pipeline was evaluated against pathologist-assigned TIL scores,
achieving a Cohen's kappa of 0.71 on the external test set, corroborating
previous research findings. These results confirm that existing software can
offer a practical solution for the assessment of TILs in H&E-stained WSIs of
breast cancer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著性图是解释神经网络分类的常用方法，但如何评估其效果仍是一个开放性问题。研究旨在比较不同评估方法下的显著性图表现。

Method: 通过一项被试间研究（N=166），测试了三种显著性图方法在主观用户测量、客观用户测量和数学指标下的表现。

Result: 研究发现评估结果不一致：主观测量中无显著差异，Grad-CAM在提升用户能力方面表现最佳，而Guided Backpropagation在数学指标上最优。部分数学指标与用户理解相关，但关系常反直觉。

Conclusion: 研究强调了用户研究和数学指标在可解释AI评估中的互补作用，并呼吁进一步探讨评估方法的一致性。

Abstract: Saliency maps are a popular approach for explaining classifications of
(convolutional) neural networks. However, it remains an open question as to how
best to evaluate salience maps, with three families of evaluation methods
commonly being used: subjective user measures, objective user measures, and
mathematical metrics. We examine three of the most popular saliency map
approaches (viz., LIME, Grad-CAM, and Guided Backpropagation) in a between
subject study (N=166) across these families of evaluation methods. We test 1)
for subjective measures, if the maps differ with respect to user trust and
satisfaction; 2) for objective measures, if the maps increase users' abilities
and thus understanding of a model; 3) for mathematical metrics, which map
achieves the best ratings across metrics; and 4) whether the mathematical
metrics can be associated with objective user measures. To our knowledge, our
study is the first to compare several salience maps across all these evaluation
methods$-$with the finding that they do not agree in their assessment (i.e.,
there was no difference concerning trust and satisfaction, Grad-CAM improved
users' abilities best, and Guided Backpropagation had the most favorable
mathematical metrics). Additionally, we show that some mathematical metrics
were associated with user understanding, although this relationship was often
counterintuitive. We discuss these findings in light of general debates
concerning the complementary use of user studies and mathematical metrics in
the evaluation of explainable AI (XAI) approaches.

Motivation: 了解AI工具如何影响个体的心理状态，尤其是自我物化和自尊，以及性别差异的表现。

Method: 使用两种不同版本的面部分析工具（批判性和中性），测量参与者的自我物化、自尊、情绪反应及外貌增强行为。

Result: 高自我物化和低自尊与外貌增强行为相关，中性工具仍引发负面情绪，女性更倾向于数字增强且对他人情绪感知较弱。

Conclusion: AI工具可能无意中强化社会偏见，需负责任的设计；未来研究将探讨训练数据中的人类意识形态如何影响工具输出及用户态度。

Abstract: AI-powered facial assessment tools are reshaping how individuals evaluate
appearance and internalize social judgments. This study examines the
psychological impact of such tools on self-objectification, self-esteem, and
emotional responses, with attention to gender differences. Two samples used
distinct versions of a facial analysis tool: one overtly critical (N=75; M=22.9
years), and another more neutral (N=51; M=19.9 years). Participants completed
validated self-objectification and self-esteem scales and custom items
measuring emotion, digital/physical appearance enhancement (DAE, PAEE), and
perceived social emotion (PSE). Results revealed consistent links between high
self-objectification, low self-esteem, and increased appearance enhancement
behaviors across both versions. Despite softer framing, the newer tool still
evoked negative emotional responses (U=1466.5, p=0.013), indicating implicit
feedback may reinforce appearance-related insecurities. Gender differences
emerged in DAE (p=0.025) and PSE (p<0.001), with females more prone to digital
enhancement and less likely to perceive emotional impact in others. These
findings reveal how AI tools may unintentionally reinforce and amplify existing
social biases and underscore the critical need for responsible AI design and
development. Future research will investigate how human ideologies embedded in
the training data of such tools shape their evaluative outputs, and how these,
in turn, influence user attitudes and decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人机交互研究通常将所有人及情境视为统一，而忽视了不同乘客、目标和驾驶环境对交互成功的不同标准，阻碍了AVs的实际应用。

Method: 通过三项实证研究：1）在极端驾驶环境中识别最优沟通策略；2）分析错误沟通系统的后果；3）使用机器学习预测个人对AVs的信任因素。

Result: 研究发现需要任务敏感、情境适应和个性化的沟通策略，以满足不同乘客的认知限制和目标。

Conclusion: 透明、适应性强且个性化的AV系统是必要的，未来研究应考虑人机交互的复杂系统特性。

Abstract: Unresolved questions about how autonomous vehicles (AVs) should meet the
informational needs of riders hinder real-world adoption. Complicating our
ability to satisfy rider needs is that different people, goals, and driving
contexts have different criteria for what constitutes interaction success.
Unfortunately, most human-AV research and design today treats all people and
situations uniformly. It is crucial to understand how an AV should communicate
to meet rider needs, and how communications should change when the human-AV
complex system changes. I argue that understanding the relationships between
different aspects of the human-AV system can help us build improved and
adaptable AV communications. I support this argument using three empirical
studies. First, I identify optimal communication strategies that enhance
driving performance, confidence, and trust for learning in extreme driving
environments. Findings highlight the need for task-sensitive,
modality-appropriate communications tuned to learner cognitive limits and
goals. Next, I highlight the consequences of deploying faulty communication
systems and demonstrate the need for context-sensitive communications. Third, I
use machine learning (ML) to illuminate personal factors predicting trust in
AVs, emphasizing the importance of tailoring designs to individual traits and
concerns. Together, this dissertation supports the necessity of transparent,
adaptable, and personalized AV systems that cater to individual needs, goals,
and contextual demands. By considering the complex system within which human-AV
interactions occur, we can deliver valuable insights for designers,
researchers, and policymakers. This dissertation also provides a concrete
domain to study theories of human-machine joint action and situational
awareness, and can be used to guide future human-AI interaction research.

Conclusion: LLM导航为VR提供了一种舒适、自然的免手操作替代方案，尤其适合无障碍需求。

Abstract: Locomotion plays a crucial role in shaping the user experience within virtual
reality environments. In particular, hands-free locomotion offers a valuable
alternative by supporting accessibility and freeing users from reliance on
handheld controllers. To this end, traditional speech-based methods often
depend on rigid command sets, limiting the naturalness and flexibility of
interaction. In this study, we propose a novel locomotion technique powered by
large language models (LLMs), which allows users to navigate virtual
environments using natural language with contextual awareness. We evaluate
three locomotion methods: controller-based teleportation, voice-based steering,
and our language model-driven approach. Our evaluation measures include
eye-tracking data analysis, including explainable machine learning through SHAP
analysis as well as standardized questionnaires for usability, presence,
cybersickness, and cognitive load to examine user attention and engagement. Our
findings indicate that the LLM-driven locomotion possesses comparable
usability, presence, and cybersickness scores to established methods like
teleportation, demonstrating its novel potential as a comfortable, natural
language-based, hands-free alternative. In addition, it enhances user attention
within the virtual environment, suggesting greater engagement. Complementary to
these findings, SHAP analysis revealed that fixation, saccade, and
pupil-related features vary across techniques, indicating distinct patterns of
visual attention and cognitive processing. Overall, we state that our method
can facilitate hands-free locomotion in virtual spaces, especially in
supporting accessibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CSI在WiFi室内定位中具有潜力，但其大规模部署和商业化仍受限，主要由于现有系统多在受控小规模环境中开发，缺乏泛化性。

Method: 采用图结构建模异质CSI数据，设计预训练任务利用未标记数据，并引入置信感知微调策略。

Result: 在覆盖五层楼和25,600平方米的实验中，中位定位误差为2.17米，楼层准确率达99.49%，MAE降低18.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了大规模ISAC部署中的CSI定位性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, Channel State Information (CSI), recognized for its
fine-grained spatial characteristics, has attracted increasing attention in
WiFi-based indoor localization. However, despite its potential, CSI-based
approaches have yet to achieve the same level of deployment scale and
commercialization as those based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).
A key limitation lies in the fact that most existing CSI-based systems are
developed and evaluated in controlled, small-scale environments, limiting their
generalizability. To bridge this gap, we explore the deployment of a
large-scale CSI-based localization system involving over 400 Access Points
(APs) in a real-world building under the Integrated Sensing and Communication
(ISAC) paradigm. We highlight two critical yet often overlooked factors: the
underutilization of unlabeled data and the inherent heterogeneity of CSI
measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI-based
learning framework for WiFi localization, tailored for large-scale ISAC
deployments on the server side. Specifically, we employ a novel graph-based
structure to model heterogeneous CSI data and reduce redundancy. We further
design a pretext pretraining task that incorporates spatial and temporal priors
to effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled CSI data. Complementarily, we
introduce a confidence-aware fine-tuning strategy to enhance the robustness of
localization results. In a leave-one-smartphone-out experiment spanning five
floors and 25, 600 m2, we achieve a median localization error of 2.17 meters
and a floor accuracy of 99.49%. This performance corresponds to an 18.7%
reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the best-performing
baseline.

"nudifying" software programs that allow non-technical users to create AIG-NCII
within minutes. Then, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology

methods, we show how the current landscape of practices fails to effectively
regulate the MTE for adult AIG-NCII, as well as flawed assumptions explaining
these gaps.

Abstract: The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and
opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the
potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various
tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises
concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions

various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of
solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated
into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM
by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students'
questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more
personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by
using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based
on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and
inclusive learning experience.

Abstract: This study presents a novel mathematical model derived from cohomology,
leveraging the KEEL-proven theorem that establishes cohomology as tautological,
generated by boundary classes of curves with fixed dual graphs. Simplicial
complexes are constructed using skew-commutative graded algebra, and the
structure theorem is applied to connect distinct homologies, enabling precise
interpretations of the resulting geometric forms. The proposed model is
utilized for protein structure analysis and prediction, with a specific
application to the Flagellar Motor structure. This approach offers new insights
into the geometric and algebraic foundations of biological macromolecular
modeling, highlighting its potential for advancement in structural biology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索NTSR1受体的激活机制和偏向信号传导，以开发针对成瘾相关疾病的潜在治疗方法。

Result: 揭示了NTSR1的动态逐步激活机制和信号传导网络，发现了一个潜在的变构位点。

Conclusion: 研究为理解NTSR1的原子级激活机制和开发其变构调节剂提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), a member of the Class A G protein-coupled
receptor superfamily, plays an important role in modulating dopaminergic
neuronal activity and eliciting opioid-independent analgesia. Recent studies
suggest that promoting \{beta}-arrestin-biased signaling in NTSR1 may diminish
drugs of abuse, such as psychostimulants, thereby offering a potential avenue
for treating human addiction-related disorders. In this study, we utilized a
novel computational and experimental approach that combined nudged elastic
band-based molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state models, temporal
communication network analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and conformational
biosensors, to explore the intricate mechanisms underlying NTSR1 activation and
biased signaling. Our study reveals a dynamic stepwise transition mechanism and
activated transmission network associated with NTSR1 activation. It also yields
valuable insights into the complex interplay between the unique polar network,
non-conserved ion locks, and aromatic clusters in NTSR1 signaling. Moreover, we
identified a cryptic allosteric site located in the intracellular region of the
receptor that exists in an intermediate state within the activation pathway.
Collectively, these findings contribute to a more profound understanding of
NTSR1 activation and biased signaling at the atomic level, thereby providing a
potential strategy for the development of NTSR1 allosteric modulators in the
realm of G protein-coupled receptor biology, biophysics, and medicine.

### [227] [Automatically Generating Rules of Malicious Software Packages via Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17198)
*XiangRui Zhang,HaoYu Chen,Yongzhong He,Wenjia Niu,Qiang Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TLDR: RuleLLM利用大型语言模型自动生成开源生态系统规则，显著提升安全工具对软件供应链攻击的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全工具依赖专家预定义规则，难以应对新兴软件供应链攻击。

Method: RuleLLM提取恶意软件元数据和代码片段，生成可直接部署的YARA和Semgrep规则，包括规则生成、优化和对齐三个子任务。

Result: 在1,633个恶意包数据集上，RuleLLM生成763条规则（452 YARA和311 Semgrep），准确率85.2%，召回率91.8%，优于现有工具。

Conclusion: RuleLLM有效解决了传统安全工具的局限性，并提出11类38子类的规则分类法。

Abstract: Today's security tools predominantly rely on predefined rules crafted by
experts, making them poorly adapted to the emergence of software supply chain
attacks. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel tool, RuleLLM, which
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate rule generation for OSS
ecosystems. RuleLLM extracts metadata and code snippets from malware as its
input, producing YARA and Semgrep rules that can be directly deployed in
software development. Specifically, the rule generation task involves three
subtasks: crafting rules, refining rules, and aligning rules. To validate
RuleLLM's effectiveness, we implemented a prototype system and conducted
experiments on the dataset of 1,633 malicious packages. The results are
promising that RuleLLM generated 763 rules (452 YARA and 311 Semgrep) with a
precision of 85.2\% and a recall of 91.8\%, outperforming state-of-the-art
(SOTA) tools and scored-based approaches. We further analyzed generated rules
and proposed a rule taxonomy: 11 categories and 38 subcategories.

TLDR: 论文分析了XZ Utils项目中的供应链攻击（CVE-2024-3094），揭示了攻击者如何利用开源开发流程注入后门，并探讨了如何通过改进工程实践保护开源生态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件的广泛使用带来了安全漏洞，尤其是资源不足的关键项目。本文旨在揭示一种新型供应链攻击，攻击者不仅利用代码漏洞，还操纵开发流程本身。

Method: 通过分析GitHub事件和开发工件，重构攻击时间线，研究攻击者如何利用社区管理和CI/CD配置等工程实践。

Result: 研究发现攻击者通过看似有益的贡献绕过传统安全措施，长期控制项目。

Conclusion: 论文指出软件工程实践可能被武器化，为保护开源生态系统提供了新的视角。

Abstract: The digital economy runs on Open Source Software (OSS), with an estimated
90\% of modern applications containing open-source components. While this
widespread adoption has revolutionized software development, it has also
created critical security vulnerabilities, particularly in essential but
under-resourced projects. This paper examines a sophisticated attack on the XZ
Utils project (CVE-2024-3094), where attackers exploited not just code, but the
entire open-source development process to inject a backdoor into a fundamental
Linux compression library. Our analysis reveals a new breed of supply chain
attack that manipulates software engineering practices themselves -- from
community management to CI/CD configurations -- to establish legitimacy and
maintain long-term control. Through a comprehensive examination of GitHub
events and development artifacts, we reconstruct the attack timeline, analyze
the evolution of attacker tactics. Our findings demonstrate how attackers
leveraged seemingly beneficial contributions to project infrastructure and
maintenance to bypass traditional security measures. This work extends beyond
traditional security analysis by examining how software engineering practices
themselves can be weaponized, offering insights for protecting the open-source
ecosystem.

Result: SCALAR在标注标识符时优于其他标注工具。

Conclusion: SCALAR为源代码标识符的词性标注提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The paper presents the Source Code Analysis and Lexical Annotation Runtime
(SCALAR), a tool specialized for mapping (annotating) source code identifier
names to their corresponding part-of-speech tag sequence (grammar pattern).
SCALAR's internal model is trained using scikit-learn's
GradientBoostingClassifier in conjunction with a manually-curated oracle of
identifier names and their grammar patterns. This specializes the tagger to
recognize the unique structure of the natural language used by developers to
create all types of identifiers (e.g., function names, variable names etc.).
SCALAR's output is compared with a previous version of the tagger, as well as a
modern off-the-shelf part-of-speech tagger to show how it improves upon other
taggers' output for annotating identifiers. The code is available on Github

TLDR: 论文提出了一种结合大语言模型（LLM）和主题建模的新方法，用于自动识别Python程序中的主题，实验表明该方法能生成语义丰富的代码表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解源代码对软件工程任务（如维护和重用）至关重要，但现有方法在提取语义信息上仍有局限。

Result: 实验表明，LLM生成的摘要能提供可解释且语义丰富的代码结构表示。

Conclusion: 该方法在自动文档生成、代码搜索等软件工程任务中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding source code is a topic of great interest in the software
engineering community, since it can help programmers in various tasks such as
software maintenance and reuse. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable program comprehension capabilities, while
transformer-based topic modeling techniques offer effective ways to extract
semantic information from text. This paper proposes and explores a novel
approach that combines these strengths to automatically identify meaningful
topics in a corpus of Python programs. Our method consists in applying topic
modeling on the descriptions obtained by asking an LLM to summarize the code.
To assess the internal consistency of the extracted topics, we compare them
against topics inferred from function names alone, and those derived from
existing docstrings. Experimental results suggest that leveraging LLM-generated
summaries provides interpretable and semantically rich representation of code
structure. The promising results suggest that our approach can be fruitfully
applied in various software engineering tasks such as automatic documentation
and tagging, code search, software reorganization and knowledge discovery in
large repositories.

TLDR: 论文提出‘老化债务’（AD）概念，通过源代码注释中的‘自认老化债务’（SAAD）研究软件老化，并开发分类法量化开源软件中的AD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注运行时指标，忽略源代码注释等进化指标，导致对软件老化的理解不全面。

Method: 采用混合方法，定性定量分析源代码注释中的SAAD模式，开发分类法并量化开源软件中的AD。

Result: 分类法将软件老化分为活跃和休眠两类，分析显示21%的开源仓库存在SAAD，休眠AD为主。

Conclusion: 软件老化问题随规模增长加剧，分类法有助于研究和改进维护策略。

Abstract: Context: Previous research on software aging is limited with focus on dynamic
runtime indicators like memory and performance, often neglecting evolutionary
indicators like source code comments and narrowly examining legacy issues
within the TD context. Objective: We introduce the concept of Aging Debt (AD),
representing the increased maintenance efforts and costs needed to keep
software updated. We study AD through Self-Admitted Aging Debt (SAAD) observed
in source code comments left by software developers. Method: We employ a
mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to
detect and measure AD in software. This includes framing SAAD patterns from the
source code comments after analysing the source code context, then utilizing
the SAAD patterns to detect SAAD comments. In the process, we develop a
taxonomy for SAAD that reflects the temporal aging of software and its
associated debt. Then we utilize the taxonomy to quantify the different types
of AD prevalent in OSS repositories. Results: Our proposed taxonomy categorizes
temporal software aging into Active and Dormant types. Our extensive analysis
of over 9,000+ Open Source Software (OSS) repositories reveals that more than
21% repositories exhibit signs of SAAD as observed from our gold standard SAAD
dataset. Notably, Dormant AD emerges as the predominant category, highlighting
a critical but often overlooked aspect of software maintenance. Conclusion: As
software volume grows annually, so do evolutionary aging and maintenance
challenges; our proposed taxonomy can aid researchers in detailed software
aging studies and help practitioners develop improved and proactive maintenance
strategies.

TLDR: 提出一种基于机器学习的数据驱动方法，从单张波前传感器图像中估计Fried参数（r0），适用于实时自适应光学系统控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致地面望远镜观测图像模糊，自适应光学系统需实时校正波前，而Fried参数是优化系统性能的关键。

Method: 利用计算机视觉的机器学习方法，从Shack-Hartmann或金字塔波前传感器图像中估计r0，并通过COMPASS仿真工具评估。

Result: 开发出单一网络估计器，在开环和闭环AO配置中均能准确估计r0，推理时间仅0.83毫秒。

Conclusion: 该方法经济高效，适用于实时仪器控制，为自适应光学系统提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades the quality of astronomical observations in
ground-based telescopes, leading to distorted and blurry images. Adaptive
Optics (AO) systems are designed to counteract these effects, using atmospheric
measurements captured by a wavefront sensor to make real-time corrections to
the incoming wavefront. The Fried parameter, r0, characterises the strength of
atmospheric turbulence and is an essential control parameter for optimising the
performance of AO systems and more recently sky profiling for Free Space
Optical (FSO) communication channels. In this paper, we develop a novel
data-driven approach, adapting machine learning methods from computer vision
for Fried parameter estimation from a single Shack-Hartmann or pyramid
wavefront sensor image. Using these data-driven methods, we present a detailed
simulation-based evaluation of our approach using the open-source COMPASS AO
simulation tool to evaluate both the Shack-Hartmann and pyramid wavefront
sensors. Our evaluation is over a range of guide star magnitudes, and realistic
noise, atmospheric and instrument conditions. Remarkably, we are able to
develop a single network-based estimator that is accurate in both open and
closed-loop AO configurations. Our method accurately estimates the Fried
parameter from a single WFS image directly from AO telemetry to a few
millimetres. Our approach is suitable for real time control, exhibiting 0.83ms
r0 inference times on retail NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU hardware, and thereby
demonstrating a compelling economic solution for use in real-time instrument
control.

Motivation: 现有PBR材料在处理高镜面和透明表面时效果不佳，需要一种更灵活且物理一致的方法。

Result: 实现了对透明材料（如玻璃和窗户）的高效合成和精确编辑。

Conclusion: ePBR材料提供了一种确定性、可解释的图像合成方法，适用于复杂表面模型。

Abstract: Realistic indoor or outdoor image synthesis is a core challenge in computer
vision and graphics. The learning-based approach is easy to use but lacks
physical consistency, while traditional Physically Based Rendering (PBR) offers
high realism but is computationally expensive. Intrinsic image representation
offers a well-balanced trade-off, decomposing images into fundamental
components (intrinsic channels) such as geometry, materials, and illumination
for controllable synthesis. However, existing PBR materials struggle with
complex surface models, particularly high-specular and transparent surfaces. In
this work, we extend intrinsic image representations to incorporate both
reflection and transmission properties, enabling the synthesis of transparent
materials such as glass and windows. We propose an explicit intrinsic
compositing framework that provides deterministic, interpretable image
synthesis. With the Extended PBR (ePBR) Materials, we can effectively edit the
materials with precise controls.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多视图图像的新视角合成方法（如NeRF和3DGS）通常依赖低动态范围（LDR）图像，限制了场景细节的捕捉。而高动态范围（HDR）重建方法需要固定相机位置的多曝光图像，耗时且不灵活。

Method: 提出CasualHDRSplat方法，通过统一的微分物理成像模型，联合优化曝光时间、相机响应函数（CRF）、相机位姿和清晰的3D HDR场景，支持从自动曝光视频中重建。

Result: 实验表明，CasualHDRSplat在鲁棒性和渲染质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CasualHDRSplat提供了一种灵活且高效的方法，能够从非理想条件下捕获的视频中重建高质量的3D HDR场景。

Abstract: Recently, photo-realistic novel view synthesis from multi-view images, such
as neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have garnered
widespread attention due to their superior performance. However, most works
rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, which limits the capturing of richer
scene details. Some prior works have focused on high dynamic range (HDR) scene
reconstruction, typically require capturing of multi-view sharp images with
different exposure times at fixed camera positions during exposure times, which
is time-consuming and challenging in practice. For a more flexible data
acquisition, we propose a one-stage method: \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} to easily
and robustly reconstruct the 3D HDR scene from casually captured videos with
auto-exposure enabled, even in the presence of severe motion blur and varying
unknown exposure time. \textbf{CasualHDRSplat} contains a unified
differentiable physical imaging model which first applies continuous-time
trajectory constraint to imaging process so that we can jointly optimize
exposure time, camera response function (CRF), camera poses, and sharp 3D HDR
scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in terms of robustness and rendering quality. Our source code will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全局优化方法在处理少量设计参数时有效，但随着解空间和约束复杂度的增加，需要新技术。微电子元件的设计和优化因其高维解空间和多物理约束而极具挑战性。

Method: 以ASIC和异构集成中介层为原型，开发并数值测试了基于强化学习的优化框架，重点优化了ASIC芯片的键合互连几何形状和中介层上的组件布局。

Result: 该方法在高维解空间中有效优化了设计，并满足了热弹性和设计约束。

Conclusion: 强化学习为复杂微电子元件的设计优化提供了可行且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of reinforcement learning based
techniques for the design of microelectronic components under multiphysics
constraints. While traditional design approaches based on global optimization
approaches are effective when dealing with a small number of design parameters,
as the complexity of the solution space and of the constraints increases
different techniques are needed. This is an important reason that makes the
design and optimization of microelectronic components (characterized by large
solution space and multiphysics constraints) very challenging for traditional
methods. By taking as prototypical elements an application-specific integrated
circuit (ASIC) and a heterogeneously integrated (HI) interposer, we develop and
numerically test an optimization framework based on reinforcement learning
(RL). More specifically, we consider the optimization of the bonded
interconnect geometry for an ASIC chip as well as the placement of components
on a HI interposer while satisfying thermoelastic and design constraints. This
placement problem is particularly interesting because it features a
high-dimensional solution space.

Motivation: 随着供水网络数字化程度的提高，隐蔽性虚假数据注入攻击（SFDIAs）威胁其运行完整性，但现有研究未深入探讨攻击复杂性、系统知识需求与影响之间的关系。

Method: 提出了多种攻击策略，从满足物理和检测约束的定制策略到简单的测量操纵，攻击仅需目标传感器及其水力连接知识。

Result: 通过Net1和Net3基准网络的案例研究，证明这些攻击能长期未被监测系统发现，增加运营成本并改变水流。

Conclusion: 分析为供水网络漏洞评估提供见解，并推动结合物理和统计安全机制的保护策略发展。

Abstract: As water distribution networks (WDNs) become increasingly connected with
digital infrastructures, they face greater exposure to cyberattacks that
threaten their operational integrity. Stealthy False Data Injection Attacks
(SFDIAs) are particularly concerning, as they manipulate sensor data to
compromise system operations while avoiding detection. While existing studies
have focused on either detection methods or specific attack formulations, the
relationship between attack sophistication, system knowledge requirements, and
achievable impact remains unexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis
of sensor attacks against WDNs, investigating different combinations of
physical constraints, state monitoring requirements, and intrusion detection
evasion conditions. We propose several attack formulations that range from
tailored strategies satisfying both physical and detection constraints to
simpler measurement manipulations. The proposed attacks are simple and local --
requiring knowledge only of targeted sensors and their hydraulic connections --
making them scalable and practical. Through case studies on Net1 and Net3
benchmark networks, we demonstrate how these attacks can persistently increase
operational costs and alter water flows while remaining undetected by
monitoring systems for extended periods. The analysis provides utilities with
insights for vulnerability assessment and motivates the development of
protection strategies that combine physical and statistical security
mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设一方为完全信息专家，可能导致估计偏差和协调失败，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: N-PACE通过迭代线性二次逼近非线性博弈，显式建模同伴的学习动态，推断其目标函数。

Result: N-PACE实现了快速无偏学习，并支持多智能体系统中的意图通信。

Conclusion: N-PACE为解决非线性动态博弈中的协调问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Human-robot interactions can be modeled as incomplete-information general-sum
dynamic games since the objective functions of both agents are not explicitly
known to each other. However, solving for equilibrium policies for such games
presents a major challenge, especially if the games involve nonlinear
underlying dynamics. To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that
one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead
to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we
propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for
general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (LQ)
approximation of the nonlinear general-sum game, each agent explicitly models
the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective
functions, leading to unbiased fast learning in inferring the unknown objective
function of the peer agent, which is critical for task completion and safety
assurance. Additionally, we demonstrate how N-PACE enables \textbf{intent
communication} in such multi-agent systems by explicitly modeling the peer's
learning dynamics.

Motivation: 解决多智能体控制、人机交互等领域中信息不完全的线性二次微分博弈问题，尤其是当双方均不了解对方成本函数时的复杂性。

Method: 提出PACE框架，将对方视为学习智能体而非静态最优智能体，建模其学习动态并推断其成本函数参数。

Conclusion: PACE框架有效解决了信息不完全的线性二次微分博弈问题，提升了稳定性和收敛速度。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of a two-player linear quadratic
differential game with incomplete information, a scenario commonly encountered
in multi-agent control, human-robot interaction (HRI), and approximation
methods for solving general-sum differential games. While solutions to such
linear differential games are typically obtained through coupled Riccati
equations, the complexity increases when agents have incomplete information,
particularly when neither is aware of the other's cost function. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a model-based Peer-Aware Cost Estimation (PACE) framework
for learning the cost parameters of the other agent. In PACE, each agent treats
its peer as a learning agent rather than a stationary optimal agent, models
their learning dynamics, and leverages this dynamic to infer the cost function
parameters of the other agent. This approach enables agents to infer each
other's objective function in real time based solely on their previous state
observations and dynamically adapt their control policies. Furthermore, we
provide a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of parameter estimation and
the stability of system states in PACE. Additionally, in our numerical studies,
we demonstrate how modeling the learning dynamics of the other agent benefits
PACE, compared to approaches that approximate the other agent as having
complete information, particularly in terms of stability and convergence speed.

Motivation: 传统LDP扰动机制导致数据失真和效用下降，需一种新方法避免直接扰动值。

Method: 通过随机化索引（多虚拟、多样本、多组策略）实现LDP，提出CRIAD框架。

Result: CRIAD在隐私保护、灵活性和查询准确性上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: CRIAD为LDP提供了一种高效、可扩展的替代方案，验证了其理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is the predominant privacy model for
safeguarding individual data privacy. Existing perturbation mechanisms
typically require perturbing the original values to ensure acceptable privacy,
which inevitably results in value distortion and utility deterioration. In this
work, we propose an alternative approach -- instead of perturbing values, we
apply randomization to indexes of values while ensuring rigorous LDP
guarantees. Inspired by the deniability of randomized indexes, we present CRIAD
for answering subset counting queries on set-value data. By integrating a
multi-dummy, multi-sample, and multi-group strategy, CRIAD serves as a fully
scalable solution that offers flexibility across various privacy requirements
and domain sizes, and achieves more accurate query results than any existing
methods. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experimental
evaluations, we validate the effectiveness of CRIAD and demonstrate its
superiority over traditional value-perturbation mechanisms.

TLDR: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成高保真测试数据，解决复杂SQL模式中语义一致性和结构约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业环境中生产数据难以获取，传统方法生成的数据保真度低且无法满足复杂SQL测试需求。

Method: 结合LLM（如gemini）及预处理和后处理步骤，生成符合复杂结构和语义的测试数据。

Result: 成功生成支持复杂SQL查询（如连接、聚合、嵌套子查询）的高保真测试数据。

Conclusion: LLM方法为工业SQL代码生成服务提供了实用的高保真测试数据生成方案。

Abstract: The demand for high-fidelity test data is paramount in industrial settings
where access to production data is largely restricted. Traditional data
generation methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and the
ability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that are
critical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Language
to SQL (NL2SQL). In this paper, we address the critical need for generating
syntactically correct and semantically ``meaningful'' mock data for complex
schema that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently
encounter in Google SQL code generation workloads. We highlight the limitations
of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to
handle large and complex schema, as well as the lack of semantically coherent
test data that lead to limited test coverage. We demonstrate that by leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and
post-processing steps, we can generate realistic high-fidelity test data that
adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to
the test targets (SQL queries/functions). This approach supports comprehensive
testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply
nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services,
like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant services. Our results demonstrate the
practical utility of an out-of-the-box LLM (\textit{gemini}) based test data
generation for industrial SQL code generation services where generating
realistic test data is essential due to the frequent unavailability of
production datasets.

Motivation: 传统XANES数据采集方法耗时且缺乏对光谱结构的领域知识，限制了动态实验的时间分辨率。

Method: 采用知识注入的贝叶斯优化方法，结合吸收边和前边峰等光谱特征，实现自适应数据采集。

Result: 方法在电池材料和催化剂上验证，吸收边误差小于0.1 eV，峰值误差小于0.03 eV，均方根误差小于0.005。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了XANES实验的自动化程度和数据采集效率，适用于高时间分辨率的动态实验。

Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy is a powerful
technique for characterizing the chemical state and symmetry of individual
elements within materials, but requires collecting data at many energy points
which can be time-consuming. While adaptive sampling methods exist for
efficiently collecting spectroscopic data, they often lack domain-specific
knowledge about XANES spectra structure. Here we demonstrate a
knowledge-injected Bayesian optimization approach for adaptive XANES data
collection that incorporates understanding of spectral features like absorption
edges and pre-edge peaks. We show this method accurately reconstructs the
absorption edge of XANES spectra using only 15-20% of the measurement points
typically needed for conventional sampling, while maintaining the ability to
determine the x-ray energy of the sharp peak after absorption edge with errors
less than 0.03 eV, the absorption edge with errors less than 0.1 eV; and
overall root-mean-square errors less than 0.005 compared to compared to
traditionally sampled spectra. Our experiments on battery materials and
catalysts demonstrate the method's effectiveness for both static and dynamic
XANES measurements, improving data collection efficiency and enabling better
time resolution for tracking chemical changes. This approach advances the
degree of automation in XANES experiments reducing the common errors of under-
or over-sampling points in near the absorption edge and enabling dynamic
experiments that require high temporal resolution or limited measurement time.

Conclusion: 遗传编程在演化高非线性度布尔函数方面表现优异，但结合局部搜索和空间限制的遗传算法也能取得显著成果。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of evolving Boolean functions of odd sizes
with high nonlinearity, a property of cryptographic relevance. Despite its
simple formulation, this problem turns out to be remarkably difficult. We
perform a systematic evaluation by considering three solution encodings and
four problem instances, analyzing how well different types of evolutionary
algorithms behave in finding a maximally nonlinear Boolean function. Our
results show that genetic programming generally outperforms other evolutionary
algorithms, although it falls short of the best-known results achieved by
ad-hoc heuristics. Interestingly, by adding local search and restricting the
space to rotation symmetric Boolean functions, we show that a genetic algorithm
with the bitstring encoding manages to evolve a $9$-variable Boolean function
with nonlinearity 241.

Conclusion: Dual-Individual GA在神经网络优化中表现出高效性和有效性，尤其在二分类任务中优于传统方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced Genetic Algorithm technique called
Dual-Individual Genetic Algorithm (Dual-Individual GA), which optimizes neural
networks for binary image classification tasks, such as cat vs. non-cat
classification. The proposed method employs only two individuals for crossover,
represented by two parameter sets: Leader and Follower. The Leader focuses on
exploitation, representing the primary optimal solution at even-indexed
positions (0, 2, 4, ...), while the Follower promotes exploration by preserving
diversity and avoiding premature convergence, operating at odd-indexed
positions (1, 3, 5, ...). Leader and Follower are modeled as two phases or
roles. The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a self-adaptive
layer dimension mechanism that eliminates the need for manual tuning of layer
architectures; (2) generates two parameter sets, leader and follower parameter
sets, with 10 layer architecture configurations (5 for each set), ranked by
Pareto dominance and cost. post-optimization; and (3) demonstrated superior
performance compared to traditional gradient-based methods. Experimental
results show that the Dual-Individual GA achieves 99.04% training accuracy and
80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.034) on a three-layer network with architecture
[12288, 17, 4, 1], outperforming a gradient-based approach that achieves 98%
training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.092) on a four-layer
network with architecture [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1]. These findings highlight the
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing neural

Result: 研究提供了新的理论解释和见解，并验证了固定不应期SNN架构的有效性。

Conclusion: 结论指出固定不应期SNN架构为序列建模提供了新的解决方案，并挑战了传统生物机制的必要性。

Abstract: In the field of image recognition, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have
achieved performance comparable to conventional artificial neural networks
(ANNs). In such applications, SNNs essentially function as traditional neural
networks with quantized activation values. This article focuses on an another
alternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks.From this viewpoint, current SNN
architectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1)
Traditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence
modeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset
mechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically
under-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in
SNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps.To address these
challenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental
mechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in
binary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such
biological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking
patterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately
propose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling.

Conclusion: S2Vec能生成有效的地理空间表示，并与其他数据模态互补。

Abstract: Scalable general-purpose representations of the built environment are crucial
for geospatial artificial intelligence applications. This paper introduces
S2Vec, a novel self-supervised framework for learning such geospatial
embeddings. S2Vec uses the S2 Geometry library to partition large areas into
discrete S2 cells, rasterizes built environment feature vectors within cells as
images, and applies masked autoencoding on these rasterized images to encode
the feature vectors. This approach yields task-agnostic embeddings that capture
local feature characteristics and broader spatial relationships. We evaluate
S2Vec on three large-scale socioeconomic prediction tasks, showing its
competitive performance against state-of-the-art image-based embeddings. We
also explore the benefits of combining S2Vec embeddings with image-based
embeddings downstream, showing that such multimodal fusion can often improve
performance. Our results highlight how S2Vec can learn effective
general-purpose geospatial representations and how it can complement other data
modalities in geospatial artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Generative agents offer promising capabilities for simulating realistic urban
behaviors. However, existing methods oversimplify transportation choices in
modern cities, and require prohibitive computational resources for large-scale
population simulation. To address these limitations, we first present a virtual
city that features multiple functional buildings and transportation modes.
Then, we conduct extensive surveys to model behavioral choices and mobility
preferences among population groups. Building on these insights, we introduce a
simulation framework that captures the complexity of urban mobility while
remaining scalable, enabling the simulation of over 4,000 agents. To assess the
realism of the generated behaviors, we perform a series of micro and
macro-level analyses. Beyond mere performance comparison, we explore insightful
experiments, such as predicting crowd density from movement patterns and
identifying trends in vehicle preferences across agent demographics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在动态社交媒体环境中预测社区反应时的局限性，如依赖静态数据和易产生幻觉。

Method: 整合大型语言模型与检索增强生成技术，检索历史社区反应和外部知识，用于预测新帖子的社区反应。

Result: 在X平台的六个场景中，关键评估指标平均提升超过10%，并能捕捉多样化的意识形态和细微差别。

Conclusion: SCRAG为需要准确预测社区反应的应用提供了一个有效的社交计算工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces SCRAG, a prediction framework inspired by social
computing, designed to forecast community responses to real or hypothetical
social media posts. SCRAG can be used by public relations specialists (e.g., to
craft messaging in ways that avoid unintended misinterpretations) or public
figures and influencers (e.g., to anticipate social responses), among other
applications related to public sentiment prediction, crisis management, and
social what-if analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved
remarkable success in generating coherent and contextually rich text, their
reliance on static training data and susceptibility to hallucinations limit
their effectiveness at response forecasting in dynamic social media
environments. SCRAG overcomes these challenges by integrating LLMs with a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique rooted in social computing.
Specifically, our framework retrieves (i) historical responses from the target
community to capture their ideological, semantic, and emotional makeup, and
(ii) external knowledge from sources such as news articles to inject
time-sensitive context. This information is then jointly used to forecast the
responses of the target community to new posts or narratives. Extensive
experiments across six scenarios on the X platform (formerly Twitter), tested
with various embedding models and LLMs, demonstrate over 10% improvements on
average in key evaluation metrics. A concrete example further shows its
effectiveness in capturing diverse ideologies and nuances. Our work provides a
social computing tool for applications where accurate and concrete insights
into community responses are crucial.

Result: 展示了LLM任务规划器的脆弱性，特别是在多触发器攻击下的表现。

Conclusion: 通过揭示LLM任务规划器的安全漏洞，呼吁开发更安全的机器人系统。

Abstract: Robots need task planning methods to achieve goals that require more than
individual actions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance in task planning. LLMs can generate a step-by-step
solution using a description of actions and the goal. Despite the successes in
LLM-based task planning, there is limited research studying the security
aspects of those systems. In this paper, we develop Robo-Troj, the first
multi-trigger backdoor attack for LLM-based task planners, which is the main
contribution of this work. As a multi-trigger attack, Robo-Troj is trained to
accommodate the diversity of robot application domains. For instance, one can
use unique trigger words, e.g., "herical", to activate a specific malicious
behavior, e.g., cutting hand on a kitchen robot. In addition, we develop an
optimization method for selecting the trigger words that are most effective.
Through demonstrating the vulnerability of LLM-based planners, we aim to
promote the development of secured robot systems.

Conclusion: 新方法通过联合估计姿态和下一视角，显著提升了简单形状产品的姿态估计和展示效果。

Abstract: We have developed a new method to estimate a Next Viewpoint (NV) which is
effective for pose estimation of simple-shaped products for product display
robots in retail stores. Pose estimation methods using Neural Networks (NN)
based on an RGBD camera are highly accurate, but their accuracy significantly
decreases when the camera acquires few texture and shape features at a current
view point. However, it is difficult for previous mathematical model-based
methods to estimate effective NV which is because the simple shaped objects
have few shape features. Therefore, we focus on the relationship between the
pose estimation and NV estimation. When the pose estimation is more accurate,
the NV estimation is more accurate. Therefore, we develop a new pose estimation
NN that estimates NV simultaneously. Experimental results showed that our NV
estimation realized a pose estimation success rate 77.3\%, which was 7.4pt
higher than the mathematical model-based NV calculation did. Moreover, we
verified that the robot using our method displayed 84.2\% of products.

Conclusion: 结合BIM的结构知识可以有效解决建筑工地AR可视化中的漂移问题，提升长期定位和可视化准确性。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) applications for construction monitoring rely on
real-time environmental tracking to visualize architectural elements. However,
construction sites present significant challenges for traditional tracking
methods due to featureless surfaces, dynamic changes, and drift accumulation,
leading to misalignment between digital models and the physical world. This
paper proposes a BIM-aware drift correction method to address these challenges.
Instead of relying solely on SLAM-based localization, we align ``as-built"
detected planes from the real-world environment with ``as-planned"
architectural planes in BIM. Our method performs robust plane matching and
computes a transformation (TF) between SLAM (S) and BIM (B) origin frames using
optimization techniques, minimizing drift over time. By incorporating BIM as
prior structural knowledge, we can achieve improved long-term localization and
enhanced AR visualization accuracy in noisy construction environments. The
method is evaluated through real-world experiments, showing significant
reductions in drift-induced errors and optimized alignment consistency. On
average, our system achieves a reduction of 52.24% in angular deviations and a
reduction of 60.8% in the distance error of the matched walls compared to the
initial manual alignment by the user.

Abstract: Foundation models, as a mainstream technology in artificial intelligence,
have demonstrated immense potential across various domains in recent years,
particularly in handling complex tasks and multimodal data. In the field of
geophysics, although the application of foundation models is gradually
expanding, there is currently a lack of comprehensive reviews discussing the
full workflow of integrating foundation models with geophysical data. To
address this gap, this paper presents a complete framework that systematically
explores the entire process of developing foundation models in conjunction with
geophysical data. From data collection and preprocessing to model architecture
selection, pre-training strategies, and model deployment, we provide a detailed
analysis of the key techniques and methodologies at each stage. In particular,
considering the diversity, complexity, and physical consistency constraints of
geophysical data, we discuss targeted solutions to address these challenges.
Furthermore, we discuss how to leverage the transfer learning capabilities of
foundation models to reduce reliance on labeled data, enhance computational
efficiency, and incorporate physical constraints into model training, thereby
improving physical consistency and interpretability. Through a comprehensive
summary and analysis of the current technological landscape, this paper not
only fills the gap in the geophysics domain regarding a full-process review of
foundation models but also offers valuable practical guidance for their
application in geophysical data analysis, driving innovation and advancement in
the field.

*Louisa Pawusch,Stefania Scheurer,Wolfgang Nowak,Reed Maxwell*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为HydroStartML的机器学习模拟器，用于加速水文模型中的初始水位深度（DTWT）配置过程，显著减少计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的水文模型通过迭代计算达到稳态，计算成本高且耗时，尤其是在初始DTWT配置远离稳态时。

Method: 开发了HydroStartML，基于美国本土的稳态DTWT数据进行训练，利用传导率和地表坡度等数据预测流域的初始DTWT配置。

Result: 使用HydroStartML预测的初始配置比传统方法更快收敛，且对未见过的地形配置也能准确预测，显著减少了计算时间。

Conclusion: HydroStartML为结合机器学习与传统模拟的混合方法提供了可能，提高了水文预测的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Finding the initial depth-to-water table (DTWT) configuration of a catchment
is a critical challenge when simulating the hydrological cycle with integrated
models, significantly impacting simulation outcomes. Traditionally, this
involves iterative spin-up computations, where the model runs under constant
atmospheric settings until steady-state is achieved. These so-called model
spin-ups are computationally expensive, often requiring many years of simulated
time, particularly when the initial DTWT configuration is far from steady
state.
  To accelerate the model spin-up process we developed HydroStartML, a machine
learning emulator trained on steady-state DTWT configurations across the
contiguous United States. HydroStartML predicts, based on available data like
conductivity and surface slopes, a DTWT configuration of the respective
watershed, which can be used as an initial DTWT.
  Our results show that initializing spin-up computations with HydroStartML
predictions leads to faster convergence than with other initial configurations
like spatially constant DTWTs. The emulator accurately predicts configurations
close to steady state, even for terrain configurations not seen in training,
and allows especially significant reductions in computational spin-up effort in
regions with deep DTWTs. This work opens the door for hybrid approaches that
blend machine learning and traditional simulation, enhancing predictive
accuracy and efficiency in hydrology for improving water resource management
and understanding complex environmental interactions.

*Subash Neupane,Shaswata Mitra,Sudip Mittal,Shahram Rahimi*

Main category: cs.MA

TLDR: 本文介绍了一个符合HIPAA标准的Agentic AI框架，用于医疗数据处理的合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于LLM的Agentic AI系统在临床工作流中的应用增加，确保其处理敏感医疗数据时的合规性成为关键需求。

Method: 框架整合了ABAC、混合PHI清理管道和不可变审计跟踪三大机制。

Result: 该框架通过动态策略执行和上下文感知，实现了对PHI的合规处理。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为Agentic AI在医疗领域的合规应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) as their
foundational reasoning engine, are transforming clinical workflows such as
medical report generation and clinical summarization by autonomously analyzing
sensitive healthcare data and executing decisions with minimal human oversight.
However, their adoption demands strict compliance with regulatory frameworks
such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),
particularly when handling Protected Health Information (PHI). This
work-in-progress paper introduces a HIPAA-compliant Agentic AI framework that
enforces regulatory compliance through dynamic, context-aware policy
enforcement. Our framework integrates three core mechanisms: (1)
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granular PHI governance, (2) a hybrid
PHI sanitization pipeline combining regex patterns and BERT-based model to
minimize leakage, and (3) immutable audit trails for compliance verification.

### [257] [Anatomy-constrained modelling of image-derived input functions in dynamic PET using multi-organ segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17114)
*Valentin Langer,Kartikay Tehlan,Thomas Wendler*

Main category: eess.IV

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种基于多器官分割的方法，整合了来自主动脉、门静脉、肺动脉和输尿管的图像衍生输入函数（IDIFs），以改进动态PET成像中的动力学建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IDIFs仅从主动脉获取，忽略了解剖变异和复杂血管贡献，导致动力学分析不准确。

Method: 利用高分辨率CT分割肝脏、肺、肾脏和膀胱，整合器官特异性血液供应源，改进IDIFs。

Result: 在9名患者的动态PET数据中，肝脏和肺的均方误差（MSE）分别降低了13.39%和10.42%。

Conclusion: 多IDIFs方法有望提升解剖建模和动态PET成像的应用潜力，推动示踪动力学建模在临床中的常规应用。

Abstract: Accurate kinetic analysis of [$^{18}$F]FDG distribution in dynamic positron
emission tomography (PET) requires anatomically constrained modelling of
image-derived input functions (IDIFs). Traditionally, IDIFs are obtained from
the aorta, neglecting anatomical variations and complex vascular contributions.
This study proposes a multi-organ segmentation-based approach that integrates
IDIFs from the aorta, portal vein, pulmonary artery, and ureters. Using
high-resolution CT segmentations of the liver, lungs, kidneys, and bladder, we
incorporate organ-specific blood supply sources to improve kinetic modelling.
Our method was evaluated on dynamic [$^{18}$F]FDG PET data from nine patients,
resulting in a mean squared error (MSE) reduction of $13.39\%$ for the liver
and $10.42\%$ for the lungs. These initial results highlight the potential of
multiple IDIFs in improving anatomical modelling and fully leveraging dynamic
PET imaging. This approach could facilitate the integration of tracer kinetic
modelling into clinical routine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态PET成像中，动力学参数估计计算量大且空间分辨率有限，而深度神经网络（DNNs）需要大量数据和计算资源。

Method: 利用隐式神经表示（INRs）学习连续函数，结合3D CT先验信息，实现高效、高分辨率的参数成像。

Result: 在[$^{18}$F]FDG动态PET/CT数据集上验证，结果显示更高的空间分辨率、更低的均方误差和更好的解剖一致性。

Conclusion: INRs在个性化、数据高效的示踪动力学建模中具有潜力，适用于肿瘤表征、分割和预后评估。

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) with [$^{18}$F]FDG enables
non-invasive quantification of glucose metabolism through kinetic analysis,
often modelled by the two-tissue compartment model (TCKM). However, voxel-wise
kinetic parameter estimation using conventional methods is computationally
intensive and limited by spatial resolution. Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer
an alternative but require large training datasets and significant
computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a
physiological neural representation based on implicit neural representations
(INRs) for personalized kinetic parameter estimation. INRs, which learn
continuous functions, allow for efficient, high-resolution parametric imaging
with reduced data requirements. Our method also integrates anatomical priors
from a 3D CT foundation model to enhance robustness and precision in kinetic
modelling. We evaluate our approach on an [$^{18}$F]FDG dynamic PET/CT dataset
and compare it to state-of-the-art DNNs. Results demonstrate superior spatial
resolution, lower mean-squared error, and improved anatomical consistency,
particularly in tumour and highly vascularized regions. Our findings highlight
the potential of INRs for personalized, data-efficient tracer kinetic
modelling, enabling applications in tumour characterization, segmentation, and
prognostic assessment.

Result: 首次可视化并量化了温度变化下汗腺3D形态的细微变化，建立了正常汗腺形态基准。

Conclusion: 为汗腺结构研究提供了实时、非侵入性工具，推动了皮肤病学研究和临床应用。

Abstract: Skin, the primary regulator of heat exchange, relies on sweat glands for
thermoregulation. Alterations in sweat gland morphology play a crucial role in
various pathological conditions and clinical diagnoses. Current methods for
observing sweat gland morphology are limited by their two-dimensional, in
vitro, and destructive nature, underscoring the urgent need for real-time,
non-invasive, quantifiable technologies. We proposed a novel three-dimensional
(3D) transformer-based multi-object segmentation framework, integrating a
sliding window approach, joint spatial-channel attention mechanism, and
architectural heterogeneity between shallow and deep layers. Our proposed
network enables precise 3D sweat gland segmentation from skin volume data
captured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). For the first time, subtle
variations of sweat gland 3D morphology in response to temperature changes,
have been visualized and quantified. Our approach establishes a benchmark for
normal sweat gland morphology and provides a real-time, non-invasive tool for
quantifying 3D structural parameters. This enables the study of individual
variability and pathological changes in sweat gland structure, advancing
dermatological research and clinical applications, including thermoregulation
and bromhidrosis treatment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MIL方法（如ABMIL）忽略空间交互，而TransMIL虽引入空间上下文但计算复杂。研究旨在验证显式建模补丁关系是否能在ABMIL中带来类似性能提升。

Method: 提出GABMIL模型，在ABMIL框架中集成交互感知表示，显式捕获实例间依赖关系。

Result: 在乳腺癌和肺癌肿瘤亚型分类任务中，GABMIL比ABMIL在AUPRC和Kappa分数上分别提升7%和5%，且计算开销几乎不变。

Conclusion: 显式建模补丁交互对MIL框架至关重要，GABMIL在性能和效率上均优于ABMIL。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising approach for weakly
supervised classification in pathology using whole slide images (WSIs).
However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple
Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among
patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such
as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and
inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly
modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which
relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs
Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the
cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we
enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to
address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly
captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency.
Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in
breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage
point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score
over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These
findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within
MIL frameworks.

Result: 在慢性伤口数据集上，ADZUS的IoU达86.68%，精度94.69%，显著优于FUSegNet等监督方法。

Conclusion: ADZUS为医学影像分割提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，但计算成本和微调需求仍需改进。

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) pose a significant challenge in healthcare,
requiring precise and efficient wound assessment to enhance patient outcomes.
This study introduces the Attention Diffusion Zero-shot Unsupervised System
(ADZUS), a novel text-guided diffusion model that performs wound segmentation
without relying on labeled training data. Unlike conventional deep learning
models, which require extensive annotation, ADZUS leverages zero-shot learning
to dynamically adapt segmentation based on descriptive prompts, offering
enhanced flexibility and adaptability in clinical applications. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ADZUS surpasses traditional and state-of-the-art
segmentation models, achieving an IoU of 86.68\% and the highest precision of
94.69\% on the chronic wound dataset, outperforming supervised approaches such
as FUSegNet. Further validation on a custom-curated DFU dataset reinforces its
robustness, with ADZUS achieving a median DSC of 75\%, significantly surpassing
FUSegNet's 45\%. The model's text-guided segmentation capability enables
real-time customization of segmentation outputs, allowing targeted analysis of
wound characteristics based on clinical descriptions. Despite its competitive
performance, the computational cost of diffusion-based inference and the need
for potential fine-tuning remain areas for future improvement. ADZUS represents
a transformative step in wound segmentation, providing a scalable, efficient,
and adaptable AI-driven solution for medical imaging.

Motivation: 研究动机源于DNNs在视觉任务中表现与灵长类神经反应的早期对齐趋势，以及近年来这种趋势的逆转，表明现代DNNs可能依赖不同的视觉特征。

Method: 提出未来研究方向应聚焦于设计更接近生物视觉系统的数据、训练流程和目标，而非依赖互联网数据基准。

Result: 指出当前DNNs与灵长类视觉系统的差异，并预测下一代模型将更贴近人类视觉的形成机制。

Conclusion: 结论强调视觉科学需独立于人工智能发展，以开发更准确的生物视觉计算模型。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) once showed increasing alignment with primate
neural responses as they improved on computer vision benchmarks. This trend
raised the exciting possibility that better models of biological vision would
come as a byproduct of the deep learning revolution in artificial intelligence.
However, the trend has reversed over recent years as DNNs have scaled to human
or superhuman recognition accuracy, a divergence that may stem from modern DNNs
learning to rely on different visual features than primates to solve tasks.
Where will better computational models of biological vision come from? We
propose that vision science must break from artificial intelligence to develop
algorithms that are designed with biological visual systems in mind instead of
internet data benchmarks. We predict that the next generation of deep learning
models of biological vision will be trained with data diets, training routines,
and objectives that are closer to those that shape human vision than those that
are in use today.

TLDR: 提出了一种结合HRTF Denoisy U-Net和AE-GAN的新方法，用于从稀疏、噪声的HRTF测量中高效上采样，显著降低了测量需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化HRTF能提高定位精度，但传统测量方法耗时且需无噪环境。机器学习虽减少测量点，但仍需受控环境。本文旨在解决这一限制。

Method: 结合HRTF Denoisy U-Net去噪和AE-GAN上采样，仅需三个测量点即可完成。

Result: 方法在log-spectral distortion (LSD)误差为5.41 dB，余弦相似度损失为0.0070，表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了HRTF测量中的环境限制问题，为个性化HRTF提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The demand for realistic virtual immersive audio continues to grow, with
Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) playing a key role. HRTFs capture how
sound reaches our ears, reflecting unique anatomical features and enhancing
spatial perception. It has been shown that personalized HRTFs improve
localization accuracy, but their measurement remains time-consuming and
requires a noise-free environment. Although machine learning has been shown to
reduce the required measurement points and, thus, the measurement time, a
controlled environment is still necessary. This paper proposes a method to
address this constraint by presenting a novel technique that can upsample
sparse, noisy HRTF measurements. The proposed approach combines an HRTF Denoisy
U-Net for denoising and an Autoencoding Generative Adversarial Network (AE-GAN)
for upsampling from three measurement points. The proposed method achieves a
log-spectral distortion (LSD) error of 5.41 dB and a cosine similarity loss of
0.0070, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in HRTF upsampling.

Method: 采用数据引擎分解自然混合音频，引入重混评估指标优化分离性能，并提出针对性训练策略。

Result: ClearSep在多个声音分离任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: ClearSep有望推动自然音频场景中的声音分离技术发展。

Abstract: Universal sound separation aims to extract clean audio tracks corresponding
to distinct events from mixed audio, which is critical for artificial auditory
perception. However, current methods heavily rely on artificially mixed audio
for training, which limits their ability to generalize to naturally mixed audio
collected in real-world environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose
ClearSep, an innovative framework that employs a data engine to decompose
complex naturally mixed audio into multiple independent tracks, thereby
allowing effective sound separation in real-world scenarios. We introduce two
remix-based evaluation metrics to quantitatively assess separation quality and
use these metrics as thresholds to iteratively apply the data engine alongside
model training, progressively optimizing separation performance. In addition,
we propose a series of training strategies tailored to these separated
independent tracks to make the best use of them. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ClearSep achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
sound separation tasks, highlighting its potential for advancing sound
separation in natural audio scenarios. For more examples and detailed results,

Conclusion: 物理知识驱动的特征学习方法增强了模型的可解释性和性能，为可解释机器学习提供了新途径。

Abstract: Supervised machine learning involves approximating an unknown functional
relationship from a limited dataset of features and corresponding labels. The
classical approach to feature-based machine learning typically relies on
applying linear regression to standardized features, without considering their
physical meaning. This may limit model explainability, particularly in
scientific applications. This study proposes a physics-informed approach to
feature-based machine learning that constructs non-linear feature maps informed
by physical laws and dimensional analysis. These maps enhance model
interpretability and, when physical laws are unknown, allow for the
identification of relevant mechanisms through feature ranking. The method aims
to improve both predictive performance in regression tasks and classification
skill scores by integrating domain knowledge into the learning process, while
also enabling the potential discovery of new physical equations within the
context of explainable machine learning.

Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation is critical in medical
research. It provides insights into how treatment effects vary among
individuals, which can provide statistical evidence for precision medicine.
While most existing methods focus on binary treatment situations, real-world
applications often involve multiple interventions. However, current HTE
estimation methods are primarily designed for binary comparisons and often rely
on black-box models, which limit their applicability and interpretability in
multi-arm settings. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable
machine learning framework for HTE estimation in multi-arm trials. Our method
employs a rule-based ensemble approach consisting of rule generation, rule
ensemble, and HTE estimation, ensuring both predictive accuracy and
interpretability. Through extensive simulation studies and real data
applications, the performance of our method was evaluated against
state-of-the-art multi-arm HTE estimation approaches. The results indicate that
our approach achieved lower bias and higher estimation accuracy compared with
those of existing methods. Furthermore, the interpretability of our framework
allows clearer insights into how covariates influence treatment effects,
facilitating clinical decision making. By bridging the gap between accuracy and
interpretability, our study contributes a valuable tool for multi-arm HTE
estimation, supporting precision medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE使用预定义的似然函数（如高斯分布）可能导致似然失配，造成重建模糊和数据保真度低，尤其是高维数据（如图像）。

Method: EnVAE采用确定性解码器和能量分数构建重建损失，实现无似然推断；FEnVAE通过解码器的局部平滑性和潜变量后验分布的锐度优化计算效率。

Result: 实验表明，EnVAE在重建和生成质量上优于基于似然的基线方法。

Conclusion: EnVAE为生成模型提供了一种通用、可扩展且统计严谨的无参数分布学习方法。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) typically rely on a probabilistic decoder
with a predefined likelihood, most commonly an isotropic Gaussian, to model the
data conditional on latent variables. While convenient for optimization, this
choice often leads to likelihood misspecification, resulting in blurry
reconstructions and poor data fidelity, especially for high-dimensional data
such as images. In this work, we propose \textit{EnVAE}, a novel
likelihood-free generative framework that has a deterministic decoder and
employs the energy score -- a proper scoring rule -- to build the
reconstruction loss. This enables likelihood-free inference without requiring
explicit parametric density functions. To address the computational
inefficiency of the energy score, we introduce a fast variant, \textit{FEnVAE},
based on the local smoothness of the decoder and the sharpness of the posterior
distribution of latent variables. This yields an efficient single-sample
training objective that integrates seamlessly into existing VAE pipelines with
minimal overhead. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
\textit{EnVAE} achieves superior reconstruction and generation quality compared
to likelihood-based baselines. Our framework offers a general, scalable, and
statistically principled alternative for flexible and nonparametric
distribution learning in generative modeling.

Conclusion: 深度集成方法在鲁棒性上表现更优，而GP方法在分布内校准良好，但在分布偏移下需谨慎评估。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial in modern machine learning. Deep
Gaussian Processes (DGPs) and Deep Sigma Point Processes (DSPPs) extend GPs
hierarchically, offering promising methods for uncertainty quantification
grounded in Bayesian principles. However, their empirical calibration and
robustness under distribution shift relative to baselines like Deep Ensembles
remain understudied. This work evaluates these models on regression (CASP
dataset) and classification (ESR dataset) tasks, assessing predictive
performance (MAE, Accu- racy), calibration using Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)
and Expected Calibration Error (ECE), alongside robustness under various
synthetic feature-level distribution shifts. Results indicate DSPPs provide
strong in-distribution calibration leveraging their sigma point approximations.
However, compared to Deep Ensembles, which demonstrated superior robustness in
both per- formance and calibration under the tested shifts, the GP-based
methods showed vulnerabilities, exhibiting particular sensitivity in the
observed metrics. Our findings underscore ensembles as a robust baseline,
suggesting that while deep GP methods offer good in-distribution calibration,
their practical robustness under distribution shift requires careful
evaluation. To facilitate reproducibility, we make our code available at

Abstract: Parametric Markov chains (pMC) are used to model probabilistic systems with
unknown or partially known probabilities. Although (universal) pMC verification
for reachability properties is known to be coETR-complete, there have been
efforts to approach it using potentially easier-to-check properties such as
asking whether the pMC is monotonic in certain parameters. In this paper, we
first reduce monotonicity to asking whether the reachability probability from a
given state is never less than that of another given state. Recent results for
the latter property imply an efficient algorithm to collapse same-value
equivalence classes, which in turn preserves verification results and
monotonicity. We implement our algorithm to collapse "trivial" equivalence
classes in the pMC and show empirical evidence for the following: First, the
collapse gives reductions in size for some existing benchmarks and significant
reductions on some custom benchmarks; Second, the collapse speeds up existing
algorithms to check monotonicity and parameter lifting, and hence can be used
as a fast pre-processing step in practice.

Abstract: When a plasma disrupts in a tokamak, significant heat and electromagnetic
loads are deposited onto the surrounding device components. These forces scale
with plasma current and magnetic field strength, making disruptions one of the
key challenges for future devices. Unfortunately, disruptions are not fully
understood, with many different underlying causes that are difficult to
anticipate. Data-driven models have shown success in predicting them, but they
only provide limited interpretability. On the other hand, large-scale
statistical analyses have been a great asset to understanding disruptive
patterns. In this paper, we leverage data-driven methods to find an
interpretable representation of the plasma state for disruption
characterization. Specifically, we use a latent variable model to represent
diagnostic measurements as a low-dimensional, latent representation. We build
upon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, and extend it for (1)
continuous projections of plasma trajectories; (2) a multimodal structure to
separate operating regimes; and (3) separation with respect to disruptive
regimes. Subsequently, we can identify continuous indicators for the disruption
rate and the disruptivity based on statistical properties of measurement data.
The proposed method is demonstrated using a dataset of approximately 1600 TCV
discharges, selecting for flat-top disruptions or regular terminations. We
evaluate the method with respect to (1) the identified disruption risk and its
correlation with other plasma properties; (2) the ability to distinguish
different types of disruptions; and (3) downstream analyses. For the latter, we
conduct a demonstrative study on identifying parameters connected to
disruptions using counterfactual-like analysis. Overall, the method can
adequately identify distinct operating regimes characterized by varying
proximity to disruptions in an interpretable manner.

Main category: cs.CE

TLDR: 该研究提出了一种基于机器学习的替代建模框架，用于快速预测粗糙表面接触的有效接触面积，解决了传统数值方法计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粗糙表面接触的有效接触面积在多物理现象（如磨损、密封、热或电传导）中至关重要，但传统数值方法（如边界元法）计算成本高，限制了其在多查询场景中的应用。

Method: 研究使用多种机器学习算法训练预计算数据集，输入为施加的载荷和统计粗糙度参数，输出为有效接触面积，并通过超参数优化比较模型的预测准确性和计算效率。

Result: Kernel Ridge Regressor在准确性和效率之间表现出最佳平衡，而Gaussian Process Regressor在需要不确定性量化时是更好的选择。模型在未见过的模拟场景中验证了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该替代建模框架在多查询任务中实用且高效，尽管数据库生成为主要成本，但其优势仍显著。

Abstract: The effective contact area in rough surface contact plays a critical role in
multi-physics phenomena such as wear, sealing, and thermal or electrical
conduction. Although accurate numerical methods, like the Boundary Element
Method (BEM), are available to compute this quantity, their high computational
cost limits their applicability in multi-query contexts, such as uncertainty
quantification, parameter identification, and multi-scale algorithms, where
many repeated evaluations are required. This study proposes a surrogate
modeling framework for predicting the effective contact area using
fast-to-evaluate data-driven techniques. Various machine learning algorithms
are trained on a precomputed dataset, where the inputs are the imposed load and
statistical roughness parameters, and the output is the corresponding effective
contact area. All models undergo hyperparameter optimization to enable fair
comparisons in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency,
evaluated using established quantitative metrics. Among the models, the Kernel
Ridge Regressor demonstrates the best trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency, achieving high predictive accuracy, low prediction time, and
minimal training overhead-making it a strong candidate for general-purpose
surrogate modeling. The Gaussian Process Regressor provides an attractive
alternative when uncertainty quantification is required, although it incurs
additional computational cost due to variance estimation. The generalization
capability of the Kernel Ridge model is validated on an unseen simulation
scenario, confirming its ability to transfer to new configurations. Database
generation constitutes the dominant cost in the surrogate modeling process.
Nevertheless, the approach proves practical and efficient for multi-query
tasks, even when accounting for this initial expense.

Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the
energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development
still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics
tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face
significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures
that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative
algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small
molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we
introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to
generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat
unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer
connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855
DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized
molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar
chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark
our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse
conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its
performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given
these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level
structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for
predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for
their intrinsic structural flexibility.

Abstract: In e-commerce, user representations are essential for various applications.
Existing methods often use deep learning techniques to convert customer
behaviors into implicit embeddings. However, these embeddings are difficult to
understand and integrate with external knowledge, limiting the effectiveness of
applications such as customer segmentation, search navigation, and product
recommendations. To address this, our paper introduces the concept of the
customer persona. Condensed from a customer's numerous purchasing histories, a
customer persona provides a multi-faceted and human-readable characterization
of specific purchase behaviors and preferences, such as Busy Parents or Bargain
Hunters.
  This work then focuses on representing each customer by multiple personas
from a predefined set, achieving readable and informative explicit user
representations. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient solution
GPLR. To ensure effectiveness, GPLR leverages pre-trained LLMs to infer
personas for customers. To reduce overhead, GPLR applies LLM-based labeling to
only a fraction of users and utilizes a random walk technique to predict
personas for the remaining customers. We further propose RevAff, which provides
an absolute error $\epsilon$ guarantee while improving the time complexity of
the exact solution by a factor of at least
$O(\frac{\epsilon\cdot|E|N}{|E|+N\log N})$, where $N$ represents the number of
customers and products, and $E$ represents the interactions between them. We
evaluate the performance of our persona-based representation in terms of
accuracy and robustness for recommendation and customer segmentation tasks
using three real-world e-commerce datasets. Most notably, we find that
integrating customer persona representations improves the state-of-the-art
graph convolution-based recommendation model by up to 12% in terms of NDCG@K
and F1-Score@K.

TLDR: IRA框架通过动态兴趣单元和语义检索，实时适应用户兴趣变化，提升社区平台个性化推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模工业场景中实时适应用户兴趣变化和新文档的挑战。

Method: 提出IRA框架，利用兴趣单元捕获用户兴趣并通过累积更新动态调整，基于语义关系进行检索。

Result: 在真实数据集和NAVER CAFE平台上验证了IRA的有效性。

Conclusion: IRA能够持续适应用户偏好，提供细粒度的个性化推荐，不受历史训练分布限制。

Abstract: Online community platforms require dynamic personalized retrieval and
recommendation that can continuously adapt to evolving user interests and new
documents. However, optimizing models to handle such changes in real-time
remains a major challenge in large-scale industrial settings. To address this,
we propose the Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA) framework, an
efficient and scalable approach that dynamically adapts to new interactions
through a cumulative structure. IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest
Units that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while
reinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval
process that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based
solely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to
mitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with
the retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences,
ensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by
past training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the
Home Section of NAVER's CAFE, South Korea's leading community platform.
